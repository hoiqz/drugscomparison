Ritalin+Oral	Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	solong1234, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	35-44	7/21/2012 9:02:48 PM	Don't be afraid to start gradual, split the pills up to small doses, and eventually not take the full dose recomended by doc if you don't need that much.  Years ago went to doc with chest pains and after ruling out physical aliment, he referred me to a physiologist. Head doc diagnose me with add and gave me strattera. didn't know much about it but it turned my life around. Had problems peeing, hurt ejaculate, and after taking cold meds one winter I had serous high blood pressure. Body doc told me to stop, and the head doc started me down the road of lexapro and other meds that made me not give a damn.  Got off those after my house went to crap...and wasted 8 years of my life.  Recently started screwing up at work, and relizing I couldn't get anything done outside of work, went back to my 3rd head doc and ask for generic add med. He tried to put me on prozac, saying it was the same as ritalin, adderall, but I wasn't buying it.  He put me on 30 mg ritalin and what a help! First day I notice I was slowing down, not making the mistakes I once made, taking care of my home and myself on only 2 5 mg dose. I like that you can cut the instant release pills in half, I have for months settled on taking 10 in the morning and 2 half throughout the day.  That is all I need, no side effects, I like that I can take only what I need unlike stattera and adderall which you are stuck with the dose and side effects.  No dry mouth, dribble peeing, or obsessive thoughts as with stattera.  Course maybe I was on too high a dose with stattera, who knows?  Just hate that I have to see the doc every month, wish he could do refills so i could cut back on visits, wait times are an hour or more.  There is a stigma and fear attached to these drugs because some abuse them, too sad.

It has also helped a lot with my OCD, and helps me stay calm through out the day. It did make my stomach upset but it didnt last long. The other problem i am having is musle spasms at night but i hope they wont last long either. I will give this drug a month before i think about trying something else.

I personally have found the generic i find at Dominicks and Target to be the most effective for me.  I had issues with not eating and sleepless nights for the first couple weeks but all subsided.  I tried Adderall and found it made my mind race and heart beat hard.

I was swapped to adderall just this week.  Do not have near the side effects.  Ritalin however helped with focusing, but I felt trapped in my own head, I couldn't express how I was feeling when I was on it.

I have gained 30 lbs on this medication. I take it twice a day once in the am and again after lunch. by 7 pm each day I am tired and groggy and starved I eat everything in site. Generally after I eat all I want to do is sleep.I crash and sleep so hard it is if I have been drugged. If I awake to go to the bathroom I generally feel hungry and often have to fight the urge to go to the kitchen for a snack. I've never been a candy or junk food eater but find myself craving chocolate and chips. Will wake up and eat junk food and go right back to sleep. I dont like this drug. Was previously on Vyvanse 60mg once a day but was getting muscle spasams. that drug worked great but the spasams were awful.Dont know if it came in a lower dosage my doctor just took me off it a smaller dosage may have prevented the spasams. My doctor has now prescribed focalin RX which is very expensive even with my insurance

The energy and focus it has given me have been awesome.  I am able to focus on the tasks at hand and get alot of things accomplished.  The only down side I have seen thus far is a bad pounding headache that Tylenol doesn't seem to help either.  Will talk to my doctor to see if it is a side effect of the meds or something else because the headaches are pretty bad.  I haven't seen a whole lot of comments from others saying headache was a symptom so...maybe it's just coincidental.  Would love to stay on the meds because the my energy and focus level have sky rocketed.

According to my parents, I had hallucinations, would wake up screaming in the night, as well as break out in twitches. They took me off it after one month of use, and I was put on another medication. I believe it was Concerta. I was on Concerta for the next 15 years of my life.I still suffer from uncontrollable hand shaking as a side effect of using the Ritalin at such a young age. This is NOT a safe drug for children to be on. It should be taken off the market for children under the age of 16.

I started on concerta ER, which was perfect, no side effects, no notice at all in change of behaviour. lost my insurance and could no longer afford it. its 135 without insurance! so i had to switch to generic ritalin, I take just 10-20mgs,the smallest dose avail. If i have a busy day or meetings, ill take the 20, but usually just a 10mg dose is good. I dont feel or notice anything at all, but I do know it works because im able to focus, work, and i don't forget things or my mind doesn't wander. Scary moments like forgetting my 8 mnth old son on by bed and he rolls off it on to the floor. NOT GOOD! LUCKILY bed is close to the floor and we have thick carpet and he just kind of slid off it, but still reminded me that I have to be more alert and if im watching him myself i take larger dose. It does wonders. Sometimes Ill have these weird panic attacks in middle of the night. I wake up alarmed, with a sense of doom or that im dying or choking, but then i realize in 5 seconds or so that im just having an episode or dream and that I'm fine. I get a drink of water and go back to bed. see your doctor to try different doses or even different meds, but it takes few weeks to settle in and get used to. you can't make decisions based on just a week of use or a few days. hope this helps.

I was then also diagnosed with ADD. I am in the beginning of trying to control this for myself though I have been researching and controlling it for my son for over 5 years. My son takes concerta and it seems to be working for now but I have earned that sometimes you have to switch up meds to keep them effective. I would also suggest anyone needing this kind of treatment see an actual Psychiatrist he has been a life saver for me ... Anyway Ritilin is working for me so far.. I do experience the tight jaw... mild headaches and nausia.  I found if I eat something about 30 minutes after taking it no headache or nausia.. I do tend to not sleep well if I take my last dose too late. But I can concentrate so much better and I get so much more accomplished. At first it did cause me to be irratable but I think that was more me being able to focus on everything going on around me instead of feeling like there was a movie playing in the background. I go back for a check up soon and it will be 3 weeks of taking this med. but so far so good.. Its not perfect or a miracle but it is helping.

I feel jittery and my blood pressure has risen (usually I am 110/70 and right now I am 164/96) which makes me weary of this drug. I do have more energy and can read a paragraph without falling asleep. I feel the effect after an hour of taking it, then about 3 hours later it wears off and I am my normal, sluggish, disorganized self.  I will call my Dr. for reassurance, but I am already addicted to nicotine and caffeine.  I dont want another addiction.

I tried lots of different meds but none worked well. I finally started a combination of Trazadone and Welbutrin, while this helped some I still felt that something was missing, still felt lethargic, and still working on the depression. Worst of all the Welbutrin caused me to become mentally unfocused, and my mind was wandering constantly. It was, however the only drug that had helped me at all. I then was prescribed Ritalin in addition to those. Wow is it exactly what I had needed. I have been able  to keep my focus, able to have enough energy to get through a standard day and not want to hide from the world. For the first time, I have actually been feeling good. I honestly feel like I have found a miracle combination for what was troubling me. I have noticed no negative side effects. the only down side is that after about 6 hrs or so of taking it I begin to feel a slow down, or crash. As if I hadnt taken it at all. I intend to see if I can spread it out through the day. but other than that it really has been fantastic for me.

I really like it. I take it for more than one reason..because i keep falling asleep during the day, cant focus on anything even little every day small things ( disassociate ). i take 40 mg at 9 am 20 mg at 12 noon and 20 mg at 3 pm. I find myself feeling great laughing again joking around again, burst of energy with episodes of talking a lot ( actually wanting to be social) can focus great and can listen to a complete sentence without my mind wondering off. However after 5:30 or 6 I'm useless again. Having to take it every 3 hrs is hard for me to watch the clock with the demands of everyday life. but will realize when i so called come down from it leaving my system, but sometimes even if i take it late it does not have the same effect as it does when i take it on time.

I often get very overwhelmed at work and it has stopped. I take it as soon as I get to work and again 4 hrs later. I take 10mg each time. I have notice I tend to get head aches a little more when I am NOT taking it. I started getting a tic in my cheek today. I also take Celexa for depression and I feel like it has even made a difference in the depression, in a better way. It has not effected my sleep. I can sleep on this medication. I wish I would have taken this medication when I was a child because it has made such a big difference in my life. I needed this medication a long time ago.

This is Veryfrustrating and can cause situational depression, that is solved when I am able to relocate my papers.I DEFINITELY have to give this med. a 2&quot;thumbs up&quot; sign in all respects. I occassionally experience inappropriate anger, but can usually recognize it and adapt to it before it gets detrimental.I pay CLOSE attention tha I NEVER misuse/abuse this med. and have medication left over at the end of my &quot;months&quot; supply by only taking one tablet for the last dose.

About a month ago, I was prescribed Ritalin 10 mg once a day as an add-on to the 40mg of Prozac I take.  It has definitely made a tremendous difference.  I feel so much more positive, actually happy.  Only complaint is that it lasts just 4 or so hours.  I will talk to my doc about increasing to 10mg twice a day next time I see him.

I would prefer something longer-acting.  But other than that, I love Ritalin and I am very satisfied. I am, however, concerned about the possibility of addiction/dependency, so I am being careful.

Not much change in behavior but he did start to show some minor facial tics and irritability. We are now meeting with his dr. to discuss trying a different med.

Sounds like a miracle drug, right? No! I got so completely addicted to it it drove me crazy. When my doctor took me off of it I would regularly go down to Mexico where I could buy it without a prescription and smuggle it back across the border, I did this for almost 2 years. Luckily, I moved much further north so driving to Mexico was no longer an option, so I'm finally off of it for good. I probably should have gone to some kind of Ritalin rehab. Ritalin also made me want to smoke cigarettes all the time, which is totally disgusting. But now without Ritalin, I no longer want to smoke, it makes me sick just to smell it.

My father noticed alot of positive differences and my conversational skills and in my thought processes when helping him with errands. However, i'm noticing im more irritable. i started on 10mg/day and today was told to start taking 10mg either twice a day or two at once in the morning. i tried two at once about 2 hours ago and find i have nausea and am far more irritable over absolutely nothing. I also find that if i TRY (purposely) thinking about anything...i can't. Unless whatever im thinking about is visible or if im talking about it, i can't think ahead to plan anything. i cant think things over in my head. i HAVE to verbalize it or be actually doing it. i dont like that aspect. i almost feel like my thoughts are in a rubber band and as i try to think about something outside of what's visible or what the conversation around me is, it gets snapped back and im forced to think about the present. i know thats part of the reason for taking the medication, but i cant sit in my own thoughts, at all. any suggestions or help?

They just upped the dose to 20mg 3x and 60mg Strattera. It was like turning a light switch off in my head. This medication has changed my life in the best way possible. My wife was the one telling me to get tested for ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADD without Hyperactivity @ age 30. It was very hard to find a MD doctor that believed in giving Ritalin to someone over the age of 18. I finally found a psychiatrist that would. Before I started my meds I had very hard times with home(not able to complete choirs), school (Very poor grades &amp; placed in special class), work (avg job lasting 2-3 months),  projects (I would start them and never finish them), and couldn't keep any long term relationships my whole life. My parents refused that I have had any issues with ADD or ADHD my whole life. They thought I was just the way my brain developed and I was &quot;Lazy, Procrastinator, Unreliable, Absentminded, Never finish anything I started&quot; I think they may have been embarrassed of the term &quot;ADD &amp; ADHD&quot; in the 1970's. My family, friends, and I cannot believe the changes that the medication has done. It has changed me 180.  I have some books that I also found that has helped me deal with and understand ADD. One book is called &quot;A.D.D. &amp; Romance&quot; by Jonathan Halverstadt, &quot;You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!&quot; by Kate Kelly &amp; Peggy Ramundo.
Ritalin+Oral	Depression	G/Texas, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	75 or over	4/26/2010 10:59:33 AM	My 87 yr old Mother has been taking this med for 9+ yrs, &quot;allergic to tricyclates (sp?)&quot;. She has 38 yrs of sobriety (alcohol), but lately she gets very irritable/hostile outbursts and her short-term memory is terrible and she is very easily confused. She can only handle one small task at a time IF she can remember the task. Does the methylphenidate cause her problems or usual old age or the combination of drug AND old age? She still lives alone with visits from home health nurses twice a week along with &quot;providers&quot; every other week. My brother and I also see her at least once a week for shopping, rides, etc. Thanks for any help, her condition is becoming so stressful. I spend most of my days on phone solving problems, apologizing for her behavior and orchestrating her long distant care. I live 35 miles from her. We took her car from her last year...seem her problems really started thereafter...boredom contributes??

I took it on and over over 3-4 years. However, I started to take more and more to get the same effect, as you start to get immune to the effects of a lower dosage after continued use. Then I started overdosing.I do not recommend Ritalin at all, as it is easy to get hooked on to the point where you're dependant on that weird high you get from it.

Take 20mg 2 times a day and a concerta(extended release ritalin) in the am. Works very well- don't know how I got thru school the first time without it(very slowly) Generic does not work; causes upset stomach with no help in ability to focus. Brand name well worth the extra cost. Does not keep me awake and has no effect on appetite at this point. Seems to me that abuse potential would be small because does not cause euphoria or a &quot;high&quot;

Admittedly, Ritalin was one of the few drug treatments available then.  However, I have tried many other drugs over the years to enhance concentration. Still I have yet to discover any therapy, (chemical or otherwise), that has proven to be nearly as cost-effective or time-efficient as regular Ritalin (time-release Ritalin is expensive).  Although... I would highly recommend that anyone suffering from ADHD seek behavioral, cognitive, or other psychological therapy - in addition to medicinal treatment.

Tried Adderall lost too much weight Staterra which didn't work at all for my issues. Going back to Ritilan 10mg but insurance requires generic. I am not sure if it is pill content or dosage this time but I am not experiencing instant effectiveness as I did. I kept journals and had people around me add comments for each medication I used except increased dosage of Adderal . I sugest all do this, to avoid continued use if there are side affects you don't realize.

I've only been on it for two months but this is the wonder drug I have been looking for my entire life.  I have struggled through my educational life but now my grades are better, my mood, my marriage.  Its wonderful. I do make sure that I drink a small amount of caffefine will on it to subside the side effects.  This is my 'trick' to curving the negative side effects. Best wishes to all!

It has helped him greatly. He is able to sit still and focus on his school work, as well as helping him stay organized while at school. For the first two years he took 5mg and now he has been bumped up to 7.5mg. I think after awhile he kind of got &quot;immune&quot; to the dosage. Thats when our MD bumped the dosage up to 7.5mg.  Overall I have been very pleased with the results and so has he. Without ritalin I am sure he would of had to repeat 2nd and 3rd grade.

It has helped me with better thinking, better moods, and more energy and drive. The problem I have with it is that the medication's effectiveness is varied. I have had 3 different refills and the first was mild, the second was intense, and the third was between mild and intense. I then have to change my dosage and time intervals to compensate for these different effects in the pills or batches. This can be difficult to do. But overall, I am satisfied so far.

TWICE A DAY, IT WORKS, BUT HE NEEDS MORE, AND AFTER A WEEK HE STARTED WITH 10 MG TWICE A DAY. 10 MG AT 7 AM, AND 10 MG AT 11 AM, SO RITALIN WORKS WHILE MY SON IS AT SCHOOL, AND ALSO, BY THE AFTERNOON AND WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF RITALIN HE DOES PRETTY WELL WITH HIS HOMEWORK AND EVEN IN HIS KUNG-FU CLASS. HE HAS CLEARLY IMPROVE ON WHATEVER IS HE DOING. HIS ENERGY DOESN'T GO LOW OR FEEL SAD. I NEVER GIVE HIM RITALIN ON WEEKENDS OR VACATIONS. HE IS SO BRILLIANT AND NOW HIS SOCIAL LIFE IS NORMAL, HIS PEERS NOTICE DE 360' CHANGE AND THE FOCUS IN THE SCHOOL COULDN'T BE BETTER.

Now I can focus perfectly in what i'm doing and don't get distracted by anything, it also elevates my mood and elevates my mood. The only downside to this medication is that the effect lasts only a few hours, in my case for a 20 mg pill.  I take it twice a day and can go most of the day with a focused state of mind. I have had highly satisfactory results with it and wouldn't go a day without taking it.

I started on the standard 5mg twice a day.  After about 3 days I could notice a big difference in my ablility to focus and concentrate.  After a week I moved up to 10mg twice a day and then 10 mg three times daily.  I experienced some of the side effects; dry mouth, not hungry, sleeplessness, racing pulse and higher blood pressure, tiredness.  Sleeplessness AND tiredness, well after taking the first dose you hit your peak after about 1-2 hrs and then come back down(crash) which tires you out, take the next dose and go back on that rollercoaster.  I finally figured out how to space my doses out so it would be worn off by the time I needed to get to sleep and for me that was taking the last dose by 3pm so I could hit the sheets by 10pm.  I hated that roller coaster ride so I talked with my doc and he put me on 20mg extended release that I take twice daily.  The effect lasts between 4-8 hrs.  I get up at 5am for work and then go to night school and am home by 930.  Long hours to be needing focused and the extended release is the perfect fit for me.  If the effect is wearing off too fast ask about the extended release and you will be a lot happier.  I do get a slight headach but goes away after eating.

RITALIN WAS  PRECRIBED TO HIM LAST YEAR BUT I REALLY DIDN'T GIVE IT TO HIM BECAUSE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS;DIZZYNESS,HEADACHES,AND STOMACK ACHES.HE'S ALSO VERY SHORT FOR HIS AGE AND I'M SCARED THAT THIS MED WILL SLOW HIS GROWTH EVEN MORE.I TOLD THE DOCTOR ABOUT MY CONCERN AND HE SUGGESTED I GIVE HIM THE EXTENDED REALEASE.THIS HELPED BECAUSE INSTEAD OF GIVING HIM 10MG IN THE AM AND 10MG BEFORE LUNCH,I ONLY GIVE IT TO HIM ONCE IN THE AM.THIS HELPS WITH THE CRASH AND PREVENTS MOST OF THE SIDE EFFECTS HE WAS EXPERIENCING.HE IS ALREADY DOING SO MUCH BETTER IN SCHOOL AND HE CAME HOME WITH A RECOGNITION CERTIFICATE FOR MOST IMPROVED.HIS TEACHER SAY'S ITS LIKE DAY AND NIGHT.I DON'T KNOW HOW HE WILL DO WITH THIS LONG TERM.SO FAR I HAVENT READ ANYTHING GOOD WITH PT'S THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING THIS LONG TERM.I WILL KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON HIM.

My focus and concentration as well as my motivation level have increased dramatically.  I know this may sound weird but has actually help lower my anxiety such that I have been able to reduce my daily dosage of Xanax.  The only downside I've experienced appears to be an increase in my blood pressure.

After about 3 to 4 hours I start to get a mild headache, nothing terrible.  The dosage I use is 10mg so headaches and other side effects may be worse with higher doses.

They sell the medical unthinkable as a disease.Grief and mourning are now being transformed and given the status and the statute of a neurobiological illness  (PGD, Prolonged Grief Disorder). &#171; Work &#187; is also done to force pregnancy to be conceived as a medical-pathological &#171; disorder &#187;, so that pregnancy can be treated with preventive drugs against post-natal depression. The advantage would be that premature babies (bingo!) with osteoporosis (bingo!), will be born with withdrawal symptoms (bingo!) and that mothers will have to continue their taking persistent doping (bingo again!).The allergy of the multidisciplinary team (PPHS, Projected pedagogical helplessness syndrome) against a normal child behavior appears to be an incurable disease. PPHS has the same symptoms as ADHD.But the &#171; children &#187; are treated as supposed to be suffering from ADHD.The allergy itself is questionable, especially when the &#171; patients &#187; were trained to manage this allergy.That alienation is to be considered to be a crime because the kids can not resist.But what initially was considered as medically unthinkable, takes now only 1 moment of decision. There is nothing medically wrong with these three examples.Up to this point the patients are medically speaking  perfectly OK, (but this is but a small detail).To speak in terms of a neurobiological disorder is premature.Treatment itself is making the disease the alleged disease.Indeed, no doctor,  neither a real nor a psychiatrist, has explained the mechanism that doping would mobilize  immeasurable and alleged deficiencies of dopamine, serotonine, norepinephrine, etc. All the myths about these biochemical molecules are presented as scientific dogmas.Indeed : how can SSRIs , such as Prozac and  Strattera 'selectively' treat  the dopamine deficits in ADHD?Selectively releasing serotonine by massive dose

Having been on this treatment for my Narcolepsy since 1977 you can imagine the battles I've had to fight just to convince MD&quot;s even with suportive sleep studies is a thing we that are diagnosed wih should not have to face I mean who are the DEA except a bunch of administrators and bureaucrats anyway

It worked well in the beginning. I was a student and found that Ritalin allowed me to read and understand the content, as well as learn. 20 years later, my heart seems to have problems racing, and high blood pressure with lots of headaches and it all seems related to my Ritalin. Now when I take it I feel that it make me lazy and after conferring with some colleagues, they agree they see the laziness and disorganization too.

I ADD but not Hyperactivity. I am able to do more and remember more and I don't feel any side affects as I did with Adderall. I think this drug is much more effective and it sure as heck costs a lot less, having no insurance that was a big plus but not the reason it works. I have had ADD for a long time and didn't know what cause my behavioral problems I am 57 and to much happier and feel a lot less drugged up. I hope this helps others.

Both seem to be equally effective, but I have different/bad side effects with each. With the Adderall I lost my appetite and lost 7+ pounds in a month. With the Ritalin, I keep getting headaches. I usually never get headaches so I am very disappointed. Hopefully they go away in the next couple of weeks and my body adjusts to the drug, otherwise I will switch back to Adderall or try something else.

I noticed a positive change in the first week with my school work and being able to sit for more than five minutes at a time. I did experience both headaches and irritability when the drug started to wear off. My doctor prescribed Celexa, an antidepressant and the irritibility disappeared and the headaches are far and few between. I've noticed a few other posts about being tired after taking the pill. I am on a 10 mg pill, twice per day and I notice that after I take the second pill in the afternoon I get very tired. Hope this helps!

It works really well for me.  I no longer fall asleep without warning.  It works much better than Provigil or Nuvigil.  I take 20 mgs in the morning and 10 in early afternoon.  I haven't noticed any side-effects.  It's letting me live my life again.

I started taking 20mg twice a day. I am now on approx. 180mg to 240mg per day, My doctor has me on 160 mg/per day, but sometimes I take an extra one for my dosage. I have chest pains, hives, blurred vision, paranoia, panic attacks, horrible anxiety, lack of motivation, my social life has gone down the toilet, i feel like i'm going slighty crazy once in a while (a minute or two ever couple days). I don't know what to do or how to cut back or stop. I don't have insurance because my individual Blue Cross plan when from $350 to $550 per month, this month. I cannot wake up in the morning w/out it. I feel like I might die and I don't care a whole lot if I do.

So far, I am somewhat pleased with the results.  I don't really have any complaints about it.  So far, my side effects are very mild and don't really interfere with my everyday life.  I started on 5 mg the first week and have moved up to 10 mg, taken twice a day.  I have noticed that my brain does not go a mile a minute any more which makes it easier to concentrate.  I have noticed that I remember things that I would normally forget.  My mood has been so much more calm and my angry outbursts have practically gone completely away.  I do find that I am a little more tired but my increase in mood helps me to overcome that.  No trouble going to sleep but staying asleep is the problem.  I find I am a little more jittery than usual, again not a big deal.  I still forget things on a daily basis, but not near as much as before.  My husband has even noticed a change in my mood, for the better.  I find that it is easier for me to stay on task at work and to prioritize my work more effectively.  I still find myself being distracted a little, but not as much as before the medication.  So, far I have been satisfied with the medication and would recommend it to women my age who have just been diagnosed with Adult ADD, as in my case.

Then I had to keep upping my doses. And then it started working for shorter periods of time. And then it got to a point where I had to take too much too often that it started causing severe ups and downs in energy. I then got on Strattera which works but I had all of the physical side effects and it wasn't worth it anymore. Now I'm starting on Concerta (I'm 27 yrs old now). I think people have to try different things to see what works for them. Also, sometimes you just have to switch after awhile because your body gets used to the medicine. So maybe I'll take Concerta for awhile and then if it stops helping, I'll go back on Strattera.

There are only two available medications in Canada to treat this and Ritilan is one of them. I still fall asleep a lot. I am worse off when I don't take them but it doesn't work as well as I would like. I still fall asleep standing up at work or trying to help my daughter with her homework. I have read other peoples reviews and now am wondering if this drug is the reason for my agitation all the time. I have no patience and get so agrevated over stupid little things that should not bother me. I used to be a very happy person. With lots of patience. I'm not saying Ritilan is the reason but I now have to wonder.

As part of our ongoing search to discover the medication and dosage that is best for me, my doctor recently prescribed Ritalin.  Unfortunately, the side effects of the medication were such that, after only a week, he took me off the Ritalin and put me back on the medication I was taking previously (Dexedrine).  (Note: Anyone reading this review should remember that what medications and dosages work for ADHD can vary greatly from person to person)  For me, the Ritalin made me feel like I was so exhausted I couldn't think straight.  It also made me both depressed and anxious.  In fact, I am also taking Lexapro to treat depression and when I was taking the Ritalin, the Lexapro stopped working.  Far from providing any sort of help for my ADHD, the Ritalin erased all energy or desire I had to do anything except sleep or cry.  I am very glad to no longer be taking this medication!!!

Dr said to wait at least 2 weeks to see improvment at school, but after 3 days we got a letter from the teacher saying he was listening to instructions better and staying in his seat at lunch, whereas before he was running aroud the lunchroom. He says he doesn't eat lunch at school anymore because he isn't hungry, but he usually eats breakfast before it kicks in and supper when it starts to wear off.  So it does have some effect on his appetite, but we just give him snacks and things whenever he IS hungry so that hasn't been to much of a problem. We tried Vyvanse before and that was a NIGHTMARE!!  We are very happy with this medicine. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it is short acting.
Ritalin+Oral	Other		1	1	1			3/29/2009 2:50:42 PM	i think this drug is a joke. its pretty much like taking speed. my best friend was prescribed it for school to conentrate but i think she didnt need it it causes her anxiwety and she never seems herself anymore. its a way the doctors can make money but never really even look into conditions just write out prescriptions and move to the next patient. there are other ways to curve hyperness or lack of concentration other than medications you just have to look.!

Finally my dr. gave me Ritalin. I thought he made a bad judgement call because my son took Ritalin while in school for ADHD. I knew I didn't have that. I couldn't stay awake, no matter how much sleep I had. However, since he'd been my dr. for 20+ years I trusted him so I took it. Then I did some research on it. It has been a blessing. My stomach aches with it sometimes, and I have notice the &quot;coming down&quot; but it has allowed me to keep my job and to do my job. When I start yawning, I know I have about 30 min. before I hit bottom. So I wait 15 min. take it, and in about 15 min. I am ready to work. My last pill at 3 gives me time to get home and start supper. I don't have much energy in the evening, but  as long as I can keep my job, I'm happy with it.

The medication use to work very well when I was in highschhol. Now the medication seems to be ineffective. It has caused me to have severe anxiety and panic attack. Also, when the medication wears off I have a great deal of depression. I started with 10mg-3 times a day and now I am taking 20mg-3times a day. Sometimes I feel like the medication is not working and my tolerance has gone up. I would not suggest this medication for anyone to take over a long period of time.

The first week I started on it I was only taking one in am and one at noon at about 4pm, I would be sooooo tired, the doc upped me to 3 10mg per day and I feel great by time the meds are wearing off its bed time, I have to admit, I personally have had a little increase in my appetite, I was hoping for the opposite, maybe its just because I really feel better about me! Also I have noticed that I am not as moody and letting crude comments fall from my mouth, After countless anti depressants that didnt work

I was having so much difficulty at work (I'm a nurse) that I was thinking time to look into SSDI. I was drowsy and my brain felt muddled all the time. I felt like messages were being recieved by my brain well, but the response to the message was slow, and my words were slurred. My doctor suggested ritalin, which is usually not prescribed for Fibro-fog, but I said I would try it. I now wake up easily every morning, stay awake all day, I can concentrate again, I can finish tasks, I can remember things. It feels like a life-saver to me, because I was having such trouble working, now &amp; feel normal again. I just pray it continues to work, so that I can continue to work !!!

Ritalin+Oral	Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	kat23607,  Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female		11/24/2008 9:45:12 PM	I have had ADD for nearly my entire life. My parents put me on ritalin when I was 6 years old, and I took it for years. I have also been on Adderall and Concerta, for the most part, the drugs all worked the same for me. The upside to ritalin is that it is MUCH cheaper. The downside is having to take it more than once in a day. And in general, the side effects are true. Which can be the downside to these type of drugs. For instance, I know to make sure and have it filled on time because if I don't take it, I literally cannot function because I am so tired. And the crash and the end of the day sucks too. I'm now 20, and can safely say that for me, all the drugs pretty well have worked the same, and for the most part have been effective if taken properly.
Ritalin+Oral	Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day	Sleepyhead628, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	11/23/2008 10:23:04 PM	I have Narcolepsy, and used Ritalin for 13 years. The best description for this drug  is &quot;A Rollercoaster&quot; Up and Down! The upside: The drug works quickly! in 15 to 20 minutes I was ready to go. It kept me alert, and when I got the proper sleep, works very predictably, and is easy to take. Now the downside: The drug is very ADDICTIVE! I was on a very high dose (20 MG 3 X's per day)and when it wore off...WATCH OUT! Not only were the Narcoleptic symtoms of tiredness coming back, but I was also &quot;Coming Down&quot; After many years my wife and I determined that arguments between us occurred most frequently when I was due to take my medication. I was &quot;Coming Down&quot;! The medication IS MOODS ALTERING! After many years I noticed it had an effect on my nervous system, that included muscle spasms when falling asleep (Medium severity)and an extreme sensitivity to certain loud noises when tired. Hands clapping when I was tired, could send me through the ceiling. It was a rollercoaster. You went up fast...and came down hard!     I know this because I was &quot;Weaned&quot; off of Ritalin to Provigil. It took me 6 weeks to &quot;De-Tox&quot; For my family...it was hell! Daddy is reducing his meds today....STAY AWAY! After about a year off the drug, The muscle spasms stopped, and the sensitivity to noises mostly sub-sided. Awareness to these facts are important. Now do not get the wrong impression here. If other drugs are not do-able, for whatever reason. For the person with Narcolepsy this drug is a GOD-SEND! It works! It's better than a life spent fighting to stay awake...and failing. But awareness of the side effects will be a tremendous advantage. Take it from someone who has 13 years of knowledge.

His teacher wanted him tested for ADD/ADHD. So we took the Conners Check List. Then we got a second opinion from a child psychologist who then diagnosised him with moderate ADHD. He had started Ritalin 4 months ago. He is taking it twice a day at 10mg ea. He is much calmer and more focused now. He enjoys reading more then he did be for. All I can say it has worked for us.

My brain fog cleared and I was able to do my computer job properly. I was like a zombie while my brain was working in high focus, but no one in my computer job even noticed my lack of socialness. But then I did talk, I would be really into to it and talk a long time.  But in the end it affected my blood pressure and creatnin levels so I had to quit. But it had pulled me out of my fog far enough to let me funtion wihtout it again, so I ma happy that I used it. It did crave it for about a year after I quit, but I know that I cannot affor to ruin my kidneys just to get ahead at work. I am a good stable worker and have no danger of losing my job no, so I am pleased with the results.

I have felt so ill at times I thought someone was trying to poison me! I'm not a doctor, but I believe the combination of the 3 drugs are not mixing well. I THIS is why I put off seeing any kind of doctor. (Any ideas on how to gain weight would be GREATLY appreciated)..PS I'm having the headaches and nausea too.

It finally explained my &quot;oddness,&quot; if you will... : ). My Dr. started me out on Adderall XR @ 1st and it worked wonders, but gave me severe, daily headaches. I already suffer from migraines as it is, so that was terrible! I went off the adderall and on Zoloft. I then went about a year without any meds. I failed the state Bar exam both times I took it AND work has been a NIGHTMARE! My co-workers are always questioning my speed on work (not fast enough, not productive enough, etc...). I always feel like a failure at the end of the day! I recently started taking Ritalin and I can focus extremely well, I WANT to study for the bar and can actually sit through long sessions without being extremely bored. Downside? Sleep. Not getting any. Hence, writing in here at 2 am, when I have to be up at 6:30. : )

Ritalin+Oral	Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity		4	3	4			8/8/2008 12:13:41 AM	I just started taking Ritalin and it's day 6. I have noticed a big difference in being able to study and getting the most out of the time I have. I have had problems getting passing grades in college but I feel like I have more focus and can remember the lectures a lot better than I did before being on the medication. I have more energy when I take it but it does wind down at the end of the day. I have ADD in which I am taking Lexapro and Propranolol for social anxiety disorder too. I'm at 5mg. right now and I think this is where I want to stay. I could go all the way up to 20mg. if I want to but I think I need to check in with my doctor to get some feedback on my treatment overall.

I take 20 mg @ 6A, 1030A &amp; 3P.   This helps burn off the fog that would normally be surrounding me from my MS.   It also helps with the physical fatigue as well.  Before I started Ritalin, I was taking Cylert (18.75 mg) daily.  Worked just as well.  For information on this, you can check out the Cleveland Clinic website for MS symptom management...http://my.clevelandclinic.org/di sorders/pediatric_multiple_sclerosis/ns_symptom_m anagement.aspx

This drug is a god send, however, I know I might have the genes that make me prone to addiction. With that in mind, I take this drug sparingly, when I know I will need it, and it has worked like a charm.  I do not take it everyday, and always take a 3 month holiday during the summer.  The trick is to take it at the very beginning of your day, and scheduale your day around when the drug will be most effective, so that you can use it and still sleep at night.  I just wonder about having caffeine with ritalin.

I was diagnosed with ADD my senior year of college (over 10 years ago) and had been taken Ritalin ever since.  I agree with all the comments about experiencing the jitters and how you can operate with little sleep.  Despite the side effects, it was a miracle!  I had always taken the max dosage 20 mg/x3.  Over the years I started to see a decrease in effectiveness and even tried other drugs - strattera, adderall, wellbuterin...nothing as effective as ritalin.  Even now I feel somewhat addicted and have even exceeded the max dosage signifcantly.  (For those others who had concerns - ritalin is addictive, esp mentally in my case.)  Needless to say, I've gotten off of it completely for approximately 2 months.  I've been struggling like all of us with true ADD, but I had to prove that I could function without it.  For those of you in the same boat as me, take a break from it.  Once you get back on the ritalin after a break it becomes more effective again. (Just make sure you regulate yourself...I have to divide up my doses by week, and hide the rest.  If I run out then I have to make do without!)  Hopefully this helps!  (Please share your experiences here if anyone knows of anything else that helps with ADD/Depression.)  Thanks, and Good Luck!   :)

He is very smart but lost insrented in just a few minutes.His mind seem to go faster then it should. I gave him 1 pill on a Saturday to see what it made him do,so he would be at home. And thank God I did that pill made my poor child go wild,he was so nervous,he jerked all over.That pill like to have caused my poor child go crazy,may I say I would not give my child another one of thoes pills for a million dollars. he ask me please don't give me another pill.believe me I didn't. now he is getting a bit older and is settling down on his self I cut back on sweets and dranks such as cokes.I advised all to be very careful of Ritalin.I believe this is a very bad drug.or it was for my child.

I was Diagnosed 3 years ago after being advised to do so by a colloge professor.  Thank God I did. I had immediate major improvement on day 1.  I started on the non time lapsed dose and it made me crash hard;I would end up with headaches. I loved the effects, but the headaches were becoming daily problems. My doctor put me on the time lapsed pills and I have been good for over a year now.  I graduated high school with a 1.2 G.P.A, barely getting by. Stupidity was acceptance when it came to my self image. I am currently in college finishing up my degree with a 4.0. G.P.A. Not bad considering I was expelled from my first high school and maintained less than C average most of my life. It causes some jitters at first, like way to much coffee jitters, but that subsides over time. It pulls your focus so you stay in 1 lane at a time by filing your thoughts. It feels good to finally see your mind as a gift instead of a curse. Afterall, we are some quick thinkers, so just imagine being able to organize all those precious thoughts to be saved for the right time and place. Good Luck!

He has had all the typical ADD problems all his life but has just recently started taking it. The only problem is, he has a tendency to abuse drugs. Last month he went thru 30 of them in one week. This month I am distributing them to him, but if he found them I know what would happen. I do believe they help him, but it brings back too many memories of his &quot;cocaine&quot; days. He doesn't sleep well and tends to keep me up. I'm just not sure how to handle it, whether I should talk to his doctor or if his doctor would even talk to me. I'm worried.

Ritalin+Oral	Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	5/7/2008 9:36:14 AM	I have suffered with clinical depression for most of my life, but since the &quot;prozac&quot; type drugs came on the market, have had control of most depression symptoms.  However, the SSRIs don't seem to improve my feelings of physical &quot;heaviness&quot; or my fatigue.  Having ruled out most other common causes of fatigue, my doctor prescribed Ritalin for me.  It has worked like a charm.  Even in very low doses, I no longer feel heavy and tired during the day.  I've only been taking it for a few months, and have never stopped, so I'm not sure about the withdrawl problems or whether I've developed a dependency on it.  I've forgotten to take it a few times (weekends) and never noticed any problem.

Went to Family practice physician and after trial and error of medications I found Retalin non time released tablets to work best.  I was placed on the maximum amount of medication allowed per month by a regular MD which was one 20mg. tabled 3 x daily.  Now after being on this dosage for a few years it just dosent have the effect it once did.  I was maxed out by my physician which gave me no choice but to stay at the same level of medicaiton.  I lost my health insurance and this med (generic or not) just is not available thru a discount pharmacy (walmart, etc).  I lost my job (again) and always struggle financially.  I want to stop the cycle of constant struggle.  I have not afforded or had regular couseling or guidance due to little income.  I feel little to no effects from the drug and need a higher dosage to get back on track.  The family practive physician can not up my dosage and I do not know how to go about getting past this.  I have heard of children on higher dosage's than me.  Is there help for me?  How can I get passed this?

It worked very well the first day, but we went through atleast a month of restless nights, that have finally gotten better with time.  It has had to be increased to three times a day already and he still cannot sit still or concentrate at all.  It may be a cure-all for some, but not for our family.  He is not able to go to school even on the medication.  It does not seem to have disturbed his height, but he has lost about ten pounds in the time that he has been on it.  Mealtime is not any fun around here.  He cannot sit still enough to even eat without leaving the table atleast once.  He has been changed to Vyvanse now, we are hoping for better results.

It does seem to wear off about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, so I know I need to get all my school work done in the morning to maintain my &quot;focus&quot;  It has been a great help to me.

Ritalin+Oral	Depression	jeanette, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	2/8/2008 6:43:32 PM	My neurologist prescribed Ritalin in addition to Lexapro for depression.  I have only heard bad things about Ritalin/kids,etc.  Always thought Ritalin as a drug to calm/quiet children in the schoolrooms,etc.  Am anxious about beginning to take this drug.   Undecided what to do.  Have been looking for experiences published  on the Internet.   I am 50 yo female.  I definitely do not want to become addicted to it.   Lexapro 10 mg made no difference, so he increased that dosage to 20 mg.  It has helped, but we both agree that there is more help for me, if we can just fine tune what's to be done.

Ritalin+Oral	Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	1/26/2008 11:50:22 AM	I have been taking Ritalin 15mg 3 times a day for 4 months now along with Lithium 900mg a day in order to treat rapid progression BiPolar disorder with mania onset A.D.D. It has been wonderful. There are a few side effects as with any medication, but the overall benefit has been huge. As a college student I am able to pay attention, and live a normal day to day life without the wild swings of R.P. BiPolar or the distraction of A.D.D.
Ritalin+Oral	Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity		5	3	5			1/23/2008 10:22:34 PM	Taking 10mg tab @ rate 6/day of immediate release. I'm a 200lb male.  Not quite enough mg's to get through day but better than the &quot;2 pot a day&quot; coffee habit that I had before. I did not seek treatment until 30 years of age and so I did not take Ritalin until then.  At 30yrs of age I finally had a neuropsyc exam to see if there were any learning disabilities.  Diag'ed with ADHD but also with assessed IQ at above 90% of population.  ADD is real and any who doubt it have no clue.  It's a shame they can't experience it for one day.  It was not until the neuropsyc exam, resultant ADHD diagnoses, and Ritalin script; that I found peace.  Prior to I might as well have had an IQ of 50.  This whole time I thought that I was below average IQ &amp; ability.  I barely grad'ed H.S.  At this time my social skills were poor, I had great hyperactivity, and also no ability to focus.  Resultant poor self-esteem leading to anger/frustration and then illicit drug use to &quot;self-medicate&quot; as they say. My life was problematic before due to impulsivity as well and the usual inability to focus. Everyone around me would joke of ADD but I didn't take it seriously. After starting Ritalin I am now a college student w/3.0 avg GPA in the hardest Mathematics sequence that exists on this planet. God Bless Ritalin. I hope that parents out there with a kid who fits this description of my past doesn't fall victim to the hype that this drug is destructive. Sure, any substance can be misused.  However, if a doc recommends it for these symptoms in a person, it's worth a shot; a shot at life. My life is just beginning at and it could have started so long ago had this pharmaceutical solution been taken earlier on in my life.  Look at the long-term studies of this drug. It's track record is good and my worst day on Ritalin is still better than my better days off of it. Exercise helps, Ritalin solves. If this becomes a permanent solution then so be it.  I don't want to go back to the way it was... ever.

My information is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. I am not a doctor.This drug seriously and I mean seriously damaged me. It enlarged my heart, gave me a heart attack, made my palms very sweaty, my body jittery and depressed most of the time and actually made my concentration many times worse. I became unable to feel rested on this drug and it took me hours to fall asleep. This drugged completely turned me against the use of any drugs in the human body. By simply giving myself large amounts of very nutrient dense foods (fresh farmers market organic produce) and completely removing all unnatural food additives (food colorings, monosodium glutamate, refined sugar...) I was able to completely cure my ADHD, feel calm and relaxed all the time. 8 hours of intense studies is now easily in reach for me. I would suggest to people that before using this drug to perhaps get off the sugar, msg, food colorings, low vitamin and mineral foods as thousands of studies show the relation between nutrition and mental abilities. Also, let me tell you that getting off this drug was very painful and saddening for me. Talk to your doctor about this, all the information that I am telling you is my own opinion and I am not a medical doctor, though I now have over 8000 thousand hours of nutritional studies. The only reason I am saying this is because I feel that if i don't say this, I am breaking the law and they will remove this review.

The drug itself may fall into the &quot;bandaid&quot; category of treatments, as opposed to your atypical SSRI anti-depressants, but I would not consider it to be overly addictive neccessarily, such as is generally the case with Xanax and other benzodiazepines.  Quite honestly....to sum it up....Ritalin has the ability to restore a hapless depression patient to full, lucid cognetive abilities, and even enhance such capabilities beyond societies accepted &quot;norm.&quot;

After trying practically every anti-depressant currently available my psychiatrist suggested I try Ritalin to increase my energy and elevate my mood. I have been on it (as well as soma and requip) as adjunct therapy to lamictal, cymbalta, and abilify. Its success, in my opinion, has been remarkable.

Continued treatment for 3 years. Zombie like state of mind for duration of medication. Concentration improved but for the extra homework i got completed I think i lost out on so many social skills in school. All in all not so bad just didn't like it when i was a child.

Recently, I have had an accident and have been off work. I decided to stop the Ritalin while not working. I did not suffer any withdrawal symptoms; however, I did experience a return of the severe hypersomnia, would fall asleep several times a day without my CPAP and developed hypoxic headaches as a result. I am a RN, and while I would prefer not to have to take any drug, life without the Ritalin has not been satisfying.

Experienced huge change due to Ritalin and became much more focused on school, and more successful.  Have been taking Ritalin since then (through college and now at work) and could not imagine life without it.
