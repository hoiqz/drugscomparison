forced by evil corrupt society!
I know truth! Drug companies and doctors are corrupt. This is all about money! They are going to suffer and all this corrupt society  will end. I have a gift that make everyone think I am nuts. What is evil is they are the crazy ones working in the mental hospitals. They are sick. Evil forces attacks people who are special. We know truth! All the people who forced psyc meds to gain power and fuck up minds of people who have the power to end your corrupt career. This includes your police. They lie and try to fuck you over. Doctors lie. Denist lie. Stock market scams people. Banks try to rip you off. Lawyers and judges will be shut down. School is disguating. The teachers and all the other workers are perverts. You were all tested and failed. Ready to pay the price of evil you sick evil people. Go listen and read the lyrics of nightmare by avenged sevenfold.

Bipolar II, PTSD, Borderline
Weight gain, horrible gas, improved blood sugar, increased ability to fall asleep and then the worst...apathy, anhedonia, restlessness, flat affect, no motivation, no joy, no creativity, suicidal thoughts because of feeling miserable. Lost interest in doing anything fun I'd done before, except pathological gambling, and that only because it helped to pass time.
I went off it on my own 4 days ago and I am ALREADY feeling more like the old me. The old sweet, goofy, creative, dreamy, sometimes joyous, motivated, curious, funny ME. Not this horrible empty, restless, bored, apathetic, anhedonia, miserable thing that Abilify extremely gradually over 5 months turned me into. I literally could not bear to sit and do anything besides gamble; I didn't even like that but the high level of stimulation and preoccupation was the only thing I could bear in life to do. That is no life!!! I used to read, cook, see movies, sing, metal-detect, see friends, listen to music but with Abilify all desires to do anything besides gamble all went away. I can't wait for the old me to come back.

Adjunct to Celexa
Weight gain of 25 pounds :-(
Abilify has helped as an adjunct to celexa and as an anti-psychotic. When I was extremely anxious/stressed/depressed I experienced disconnected thoughts and an internal monologue that has disappeared. I still suffer from depression/anxiety and my doctor is recommending buspar to add to the celexa and abilify.

Bipolar disorder
Mixed experience. Good mood stabilization- too good. Zombie syndrome. Lost interest in my former activities. Very narrow range of emotions. Lower doses not effective. HUGE WEIGHT GAIN. WARNING!!!!! More than 60 pounds in two years!!! I can't get it off now. I'm really angry because I've always been petite, now I'm larger wide than tall. I actually have to worry about developing diabetes now.

augmention for depression
Nausea, constipation, gas, extreme gastric pain and stomach cramps. I wished I would die instead of having to deal with the side effects. The side effects continued for days after stopping the drug.
If marijuana had all these side effects, it wouldn't be illegal because no one would want to take it - poison.

depression, anxiety
Anxiety was worse, very antsy and could not sit still. Stiff muscles, Vision was blurry, loss of appetite completely, would sleep till 4 am and then wake up. After i stopped taking medication for about 3 days developed uncontrollable rapid eye movements which was scary and had to take lorazepam to counteract symptoms. Eventually it went away as the drug worked its way out of my system. This is a very scary drug! Please be careful!

Bipolar
Within 30 minutes of taking this I saw flashing lights progressed to very bad smells, agitation, heart not beating right. Only 5 hours layer had to lay down from extreme pain in legs, headache, ears popping, twitches in face. Could not sleep, got severe headache and felt like I had pneumonia with 4 bouts of hiccups, swollen eyes , could not use c-pap from nose running and drooling. 23 hours later I'm starting to feel better, still have slight headache was able to sleep a couple hours after 17 hours. I know this has helped other people, but I feel like I was severely poisioned , I don't want to even look at that pill again, I seriously thought about going to er but rode it out. I have taken thousands of pharmasuticals in my lifetime and have never had that reaction from taking just one pill, please be cautious and KNOW it affects people differently . I have other health conditions which may have contributed to my negative experience ie.. Ms, INS, Barrett's esophagus, sleep apnea, DDD and others...I' will never try this med again!

for 'schizophrenia'
weakness in the legs, Inability of keeping me upright  due to lack of strenght in legs. extreme malaise and stomach pain. Difficulty in swallowing,as if the stomach weren't able to receive food. Want to vomiting but without passing to act. Loss of appetite. Headaches. all of this in the first three to four hours after ingestion of the tablet. As the day passes away I'm feeling better and better until I find myself a little better again.  during the first hours after ingestion of the tablet i have to stand lying in the bed until I feel better, due to the fact that if i stand upright i feel a general malaise, headaches and a extreme malaise mainly in stomach, during this time, i can't eat anything. i have also loss of appetite for the rest of the day.

Bi Polar II, Depression, Paranoia

I needed to update my review for Abilify. I decided to try it again since I had great luck with it my first week of taking it last time. I did some research and talked to my doctor about taking it in really small doses since I'm really sensitive to medication and he was fine with it. So I got a pill cutter and carefully divided it into 8ths. By taking only an 8th at night, I had a great reduction in my depression. My only side effect has been a little bit of inner tension and some grogginess which only lasted the first week. My belief is that a big portion of the negative reviews on Abilify were those from people who had taken too much to begin with and couldn't take the side effects. I highly recommend talking to your doctor about taking it in small doses. Another positive is, for the first time in years I can drink caffeine with out getting anxiety. I've also noticed that I want to get out more and be social. One more thing to add, by taking it in this small of dose I'm not getting any intense food or carb cravings, in fact I think I am hungry less than before I started taking it. I'll see if that reflects on the scale.

Severe depression, OCD
Initially, headache, anxiety with a "wired" feeling and constipation.  All have subsided.
I was on Zoloft 100mg/day, but depression worsening and OCD symptoms totally out of control.  This medication saved my life.  I only wish I'd gone on it sooner, as my Doc wanted me to. I was just afraid of being on an antipsychotic med, but he told me the psychosis dosage of Abilify is 30 to 60mg/day or more. That made me feel a bit better about it...

Bipolar I rapid cycle
Weight gain, sleepyness
in just one to two days this medicine helped me. I stopped taking it due to a 60 lb weight increase after taking it for more than a year-- however, I wasn't watching my diet, nor was I exercising. After a 6 month break, I became very depressed, extremely suicidal and self destructive. As soon as the abilify was in my system, I felt like I was myself again-- it was instant! This is a good medicine but you will need to monitor your weight. This time I have devised an action plan to avoid weight gain. Will repost in 3 months.

Muscle stiffness first 2 weeks, weight gain of 30 lbs in 6 months
Overall, was able to wean from 200mg of Zoloft to 50 mg of Zoloft with the addition of Abilify, however, after 1.5 years of having this additional weight on, I am slowly trying to wean off the Abilify. I do however, feel terrific on the medication. I have no anxiety, my thoughts are clearer than ever.  After a few months of being off the med, if my symptoms return, I will most likely go back on it at only 1mg. We will see. My brother is Bipolar 1 and this drug has been a miracle drug for him as well.

Bipolar
The first 2 days I had extreme insomnia, a horrible headache and nausea, and agitation. Now I just have slight insomnia, nausea and am a little shaky. My appetite is also down.
I have tried almost every bipolar med out there. So far this is working very well for me. I have a lot of energy (hope not too much) and the side effects are definitely going down. I am also on Lithium which works well for my mania but I needed something for my depression. Seroquel helped a lot but too sleepy on it. This is like seroquel without the sedation.

Yes
Ever since I've been taking anti-psychotic medicine, I've lost interest in movies, games, internet, or books. I've also lost interest in going out and socializing.
After some research, I think It's the dopamine that's being blocked that's causing the problem.Dopamine is known to cause curiosity and reward driven learning in the brain.I don't know what to do, I've been tempted so many times to stop the pills but I'm afraid of going into a psychosis if I do. Is there a way to somehow reduce the dopamine in the brain without having to block the dopamine receptors ? How have you been doing ? Thanks. Keep in touch .

Bi-Polar 1
In the beginning my main side effect was extreme restlessness; however, my pdoc prescribed cogentin and that side effect went away.  Eventually I stopped taking the cogentin because I became tolerant of that bad side effect.
I have to take abilify every day.  If I don't I go straight into mania.  Then I do all kinds of things to mess up my life.  I can't go 48 hrs without taking it.  It keeps me sane.  It is a wonderful drug.  It manages my bipolar 1 disorder.

MDD
Insomnia, light sensitivity, just felt "off"
My doctor prescribed Abilify to add to Cymbalta for my MDD.  It aggravated my insomnia and caused my Ambien to not work as well.  Mostly though, it caused my pupils to remain dilated so I was very sensitive to light.  I had an eye exam last week, and the doctor didn't even have to dilate my eyes.  I ended up getting off as I didn't like the side effects.

This drug is extremely destructive. It made me sleep 20 hours a day, turned me into a zombie, took my mental alertness and sex drive, made my coordination slow and sluggish, killed normal human emotions like joy, enthusiasm etc, and caused long term damage to my brain and body.
This drug causes long term brain damage, slow metabolism, reduced mental and physical capacity, and problems with internal organs. I came off the drug many years ago and still haven't gone back to how I was before.

Have also been on risperidone, olanzapine, melleril, lithium, sodium valproate, mirtazapine, venlafaxine, lofepramine - you name it, I've tried it.  I'm giving it up with regret to go cold turkey.

My grandmother was given this drug.  At the age of 84 she was functioning quite well, working out, living at home, and cognitively normal.  Within a month of taking this drug, she became exteremly ill.  She could barely move off the sofa.  She completely "lost her mind" and became extremely paranoid and agressive.  She had no idea where she was and her memory was gone.  She wouldn't eat and she could barely move.  After coming off, the physical symptoms rapidly got better, but the mental symptoms have not improved very much.  This drug COMPLETELY changed her.  I think she should have NEVER been given that drug.  Please, DO NOT TAKE.

Depression, Anxiety, pos. Bipolar 2
Drowsy in afternoon.
The best drug I have ever tried. Taking it with 150 mg Effexor. My crazy sleep problems are gone, the noise in my head is gone, my suicidal ideation and hopelessness are gone. My Goldberg depression rating went from 66 to 26 in 2 weeks. I started on 1 mg a day and moved up to 5 mg. Got good results by 2 mg.  Have previously tried Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Wellbutrin, Celexa, with little results. Also tried Celexa with Wellbutrin, for better results. Effexor worked the best, but I was still quite a mess. Abilify as an add-on has been great.

bipolar II
weight gain
I have mixed feelings about abilify.  Since going off of it several weeks ago I have lost 20 pounds and feel better about that.  It did keep me stable if not a bit on the depressed end of things.  I will probably go back on it if my strange symptoms return like anxiety or what I call brain fog.   Was worried about getting diabetes from it and the effect it was having on my lipids.  As far as any withdrawal symptoms I have not noticed anything really bad other than feeling a bit run down.  I did taper off of it and was on a low dose to begin with but am watching for withdrawal symptoms closely.  I guess I am taking it one day at a time.  I did notice an odd eye blinking thing and people were asking me what was wrong with my eyes.  A bit concerned about tartive symptoms as well since I have read that they can manifest after discontinuing an anti-psychotic.  All the more reason to give it a rest for a while.

Bipolar 2
I was hypomanic after the death of my father in November. Began taking Depakote in early December for anger/rage/mood problems.  Psych suggested Abilify might help Depakote work better.  While my mood is better and my anger issues are nearly non-existent now, I'm finding I'm still a bit hypomanic and the Abilify creates extreme restlessness in me.  While my house has never looked better and I'm getting lots of project done, I find I can't sit still for longer than 10 minutes and by the end of the day my feet ache for being on them so long running around in the house and doing all my projects.
Together with Depakote.  Doc now prescribing propranolol for agitation/restlessness/irritability - would rather prescribe additional med for side effect than change primary meds...and I agree with his decision.  Doc now bumping me up to 10mg 1xday and propranolol 10mg 1xday.

It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof

I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.

Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

Temporary psychosis
Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing
I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

Bipolar 2
Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.

Bipolar1 Disorder
Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels
I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!
