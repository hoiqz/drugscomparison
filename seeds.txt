I eat more, up to 3k calories a day (I monitor myself) and still lost weight and size. I feel like I'm jumping over things, looking at things symbolically at times. Example: where things I type make sense even though mispelled. I've never been diagnosed with any of the reasons this drug is prescribed for; this is a test by my doctor and it seems to work out. But instead of nervous energy it seems as though my physical energy levels have increased ten-fold. I do not take any other drugs nor drink alcohol at all and am very active physically. My blood pressure at a rest after walking is 130/70's, heart rate is higher than normal while at rest but during workouts is average (70% of 220-my age).

For me a vicious cycle results between tremor and anxiety especially when taking Abilify. I was taking after breakfast 20mg per day this last time then stepped down to 15mg with no let up in either tremor or anxiety.

She had become so oversedated that she was nearly catatonic, and had lost all desire to eat or do anything except slump in her chair in front of the TV. She developed aspiration pneumonia and ended up in the hospital, where they had to put in a feeding tube because she could no longer swallow food or liquid. She was seen by a neurologist who correctly diagnosed her with tardive dyskensia--NOT Parkinson's--and put her on Clozeril. After 8 months of suffering, and intensive speech therapy, she is now home, eating regular food, and is more alert and lucid than I've seen her in years.  Please, if you are on either Abilify or Seroquel, and if you are having any symptoms like hers, tell your dr and don't take no for an answer!

Reading the reviews to help me decide to try or not. I see some good reviews but many with bad side effects which causes me much concern and hesitant to try it.  I wish doctors would test brain chemicals before using these psych meds. My psychiatrist does not do this kind of testing before prescribing. I understand it can be done simply with saliva tests.  Have been on effexor, cymbalta, clonazapam and buspar - cymbalta was the worst to go off of - terrible withdrawal.  I understand now that many psychiatric problems can be caused by hormonal imbalance - recently was found low in adrenal, thyroid, progesterone &amp; DHEA hormones on saliva testing.  Had to see an alternative minded doctor to get these tests. A must read for all, including doctors, is Dr. Mark Starr's book Hypothyroidism Type 2 available on amazon.com.  He explains how thyroid affects every body system including the brain and nervous system. Many people may get relief from psychiatric disorders with proper thyroid/adrenal treatment. One must find a doctor open minded enough to test for this.

Abilify worked the best for me, I felt happy all the time, I didn't find myself constantly thinking about horrible things, my hallucinations became pretty mild and less consistent.  I was on it for about a month or two when I began having a bad side effect.  I find it a little funny, but I started to develop facial twitches.  My upper lip would pull the &quot;Elvis Face&quot; without me wanting it to and my smile would twitch on the sides as well as having other random facial twitches.  This sort of scared me out of it and I did not refill the prescription.  I'd take it again, if not for the facial twitches.  It worked really well, especially for anxiety, but it's been over a half a year since I was off of it and I'm still experiencing facial twitches.

Thus, I need more abilify if I don't have the brand name drug.  I also notice more side affects at 5mgs.

I have noticed these very symtoms, such as increased hunger, thirst, urination, swelling of extemities, craving sweets, etc.  Have others noticed this?  I gained 10 pounds in the last month so I am going down to 2 mg. after I check with my doctor for his approval in our overall treatment plan.  (Anytime I have tried to play doctor by myself it ends up in disaster!)I will be checking back if other people have these symptoms that lead to weight gain.

Your cognitive function suffers tremendously, but you don't realize it unless you have to function at a high level and deal with complex problems. It's touted as the only atypical that doesn't cause weight gain, not true! It's just another me too drug in a poorly understood class of pharmaceuticals. Yes it has a better side effect profile than Haldol. If your doctor suggests an antipsychotic for you, maybe you should ask him why he thinks you need an antipsychotic. Short term therapy maybe 2-3 days of Zyprexa are enough to take care of crisis situations. Taking this drug routinely is like taking chemo to prevent cancer. Don't think of this as a mood stabilizer. I predict it will be off the market in 8 years. Educate yourself on this class of medication, be an informed consumer. Oh yeah, I'm a pharmacist too with 34 years of experience.

I have amazing energy, decreased obsession with eating, and feel happy to be alive.  The negatives (which I will tolerate since the med works so well for me): jitters if I don't take my pill at the same time everyday.  I feel jumpy if I sit too long.  I get very tired in the afternoon, but a 10 minute rest and I feel great again.  I had severe headaches the first week, but they are gone now.  This drug has probably saved my life.

All helped for a while keeping me out of the deepest black pit most of the time. But I never felt really good, just blah. I tried Zoloft, Lexapro, several others, all of which were less effective over time. I have been on Effexor XR 150mg for 4 years. I felt, as usual, blah and hoped I would not wake up in the morning. Suicide was not a logical possibility as I couldn't put my wife thru a second one after my son. The only way I thought I might kill myself was suddenly, in anger. One month ago I went to a new doctor who suggested I try Abilify. I has seen the ads but never thought I could get better and had no energy to try. Doc gave me two weeks of free 2mg tabs and after about 7 days Abilify switched my life back on. It is amazing and I almost am scared at how good I feel. I have not felt this good in 30 years.

I was also takibng Lithium and Lamictal as the time. It worked well for a while but then I felt emotional numb and had cognitive clouding. I was going through a horrific custody battle for my son and was earning more time with him and I figured this was how things were going to be. I was communicating to my psychiatrist and psychologist that I was having a hard time talking to people and remembering things but my psychiatrist didn't recommend a change for almost a year which of course I was scared to do because I was gaining more time with my son. My psychologist never told me she though my meds were off she just said she thought we could move to meeting once a month as I didn't have much to say! Luckily I told a guy I was dating that I was BP and he did research on Abilify and said it was a nasty drug and that I needed to get off of it. I talked to my psychologist again and she said I think you are having cognitive clouding and that you need to talk to your psychiatrist and have your meds changed. I got off it and I'm a new person. I have emotions and can talk to people again. I've since switched counselors and she said I was probably on too high of a dose and that it's not a bad drug, but for me it robbed a year of my life.

My doctor let me try this because the Risperdal I was taking had caused a lot of weight gain, and Abilify is known to cause somewhat less weight gain.  I took it for several months.  It was a terrible experience.  I had one of its most common side effects, which was anxiety and insomnia.  I had constant anxiety just gushing inside my body, and I would be awake all night, over and over again.  I started making fewer and fewer meals and just ate handfuls of peanuts instead just to stay alive because I felt too bad to cook a balanced meal.  I did lose some weight, but the situation got worse, where at 15 mg. I was starting to hear voices again, and I was afraid to ask my doctor to increase the dose because the awful anxiety might have gotten worse.  I finally switched back to Risperdal and later Invega (a slightly improved version of Risperdal), and it was the biggest relief I have ever had in my lifetime.  My sleep immediately went back to normal, no more voices, and the awful gushing anxiety just stopped.  I wish it was easier to lose weight on Invega, but I have had some success in doing so, since it's not like it causes me hunger all the time.  The weight just sort of creeps up on me with these drugs, and it's possible to eat healthy and keep a healthy weight, it just takes some effort.",effectiveness: 2, ease_of_use: 1, satisfactory: 1, created_at: '2011-01-22 012:53:27', review_url: "http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-64439-Abilify+Oral.aspx?drugid=64439&drugname=Abilify+Oral&pageIndex=209&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1", drug_id:newdrug.id)

The Doctor I was seeing at the time kept me on it for 3 years because he could not accept the fact that the muscle movement problems I was having, and still have, could be Tardive Dyskinesia caused by the Abilify. He claimed my symptoms did not match the &quot;criteria&quot; for TD, but according to the drug manufacturer &amp; the FDA it DOES. He also claimed that because the possibility of Abilify causing TD was so low there was no way I could have TD!I fired the Doctor, found one who knows what he's doing &amp; got off Abilify. Now, 3 1/2 years later I STILL have Tardive Dyskinesia &amp; it affects me daily. I'm glad it seems to help some people, but PLEASE BE CAREFUL!When I was on Abilify I had MANY other side-effects (panic attacks, agoraphobia, problems maintaining my body temperature, skin infections, hair loss, forgetting how to do things, OCD/hoarding, and more, even an autoimmune disorder that has since gone away), thankfully most of those have gone away completely (except the weight gain, skin infections, &amp; while the hoarding tendency is better, it's still there), or at least have become tolerable, but the continuing muscle problems are very frustrating &amp; debilitating to say the least! On a GOOD day I might be able to walk 2 blocks without trouble, on a bad day 10 feet can be a huge struggle.Abilify also caused my personality to change &amp; I'm still trying to learn how to overcome that (I had a friend who won't speak to me now because of it).Now that I've been off Abilify I've realized that it was magnifying my moodswings.I am now on a totally natural/vitamin-based treatment program &amp; I'm doing MUCH BETTER than I ever did on antipsychotics!PLEASE, if you notice ANY muscle problems, or ANYTHING else UNUSUAL FOR YOU, NO MATTER HOW SMALL, talk to your Doctor immediately!

I have been on both Lexipro and Wellbutrin for a couple of years to treat my depression.  Both helped considerably, but I still had residual symptoms of depression, and I was still, for lack of a better way to describe it, only operating at 50% my normal self.  I saw the commercials on TV and I asked my psychiatrist if I could try Abilify.  He put me on a trial, and within 2 weeks, I felt my old self again.  I no longer feel depressed - and I'm actually feeling cheerful - something I've not felt in a few years.  My work performance has improved remarkably, which is good, because I was slowly digging a hole for myself there.  While I have a way to go there, I'm actually catching up, rather than falling farther behind.But here is the kicker: For many years, I've suffered from Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS).  My RLS got considerably worse when I went on anti-depressants.  I've been taking Mirapex, which helps some, but it just makes it milder, it doesn't get rid of it.  Within a week of going on Abilfy, my RLS is GONE.  For the first time in 30 years, I can sleep without my legs waking me up several times a night, or preventing me from going to sleep.",effectiveness: 5, ease_of_use: 5, satisfactory: 5, created_at: '2010-05-25 02:50:28', review_url: "http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-64439-Abilify+Oral.aspx?drugid=64439&drugname=Abilify+Oral&pageIndex=175&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1", drug_id:newdrug.id)

My house has gone to hell, and I'm just not bothered. I have a disabling writers block (this is how I make my living, peeps), and I just feel like, oh well... it'll clear up. I have no sense of urgency.  I'm kind and loving and patient with everyone in my life, but I can't deal with the constant physical pain and the total lack of give-a-sh*t. When I have stopped taking it for a few days to &quot;just see,&quot; the physical pain resolves, and I'm able to feel angry again, but I feel like the crazy rages are out there waiting for me.

The bad effects he does have is even though it causes a VERY deep sleep for him he still has night terrors. He has went from 2mg, to 3mg, to now 5mg. For a year I had been paying $89 a month (for a 30 day supply while he took a pill and half) from our local pharmacy.

Most would work a while, then stop, necessitating going to another. My latest is Lexapro.  I am also taking Lamictal to smooth out the edges (signs of bipolar II). I take Xanax for anxiety and Ambien CR to help me sleep. One day I woke up and there was dead silence in my head, whereas there's usually some kind of noise or static. It was unnerving! Talked to my shrink, he gave me Abilify, at first 2 mg per night, then after my telling him it was doing NOTHING, he increased it to 10 mg per night. Haven't really been on it long enough to judge. Was fairly happy with drug combination until this Abilify, even though it's very easy to take. Price is A FACTOR:  Both Lexapro and Abilify cost $100 each. Lamictal costs $50, but at least I do have a good insurance. My mother is paying for all the medications at the current time, which helps me out enormously, while I pay off my credit cards.

newuser.reviews.create(comments: "I have been on Abilify for about 5 months now.  I had my third depressive episode in six years.  I couldn't believe it was happening again.  I have been on Lexapro for those six years.  The first episode I went on Lexapro, the second was because I tried going off of it.  This third time was triggered by a tough break up.  However, I was shocked that I could become that horribly depressed while on medication.  That was the first time I started seeing a psychiatrist.  I can't recommend it more!  I have realized that primary care physicians don't have the knowledge to treat people with more complex situation like me.  My depression was so horrible.  I was on Depakote for a month, which stabilized me, but I gained way too much weight.  Abilify seems like just the right thing for me.  I feel so much better.  My doctor is suspecting that I could have Bipolar II now based on what I went through.  I am weaning off the Lexapro and only take 5mg.  I take only 2mg of Abilify at night.  That is amazing to me that someone soooo depressed could be okay on just a little medication.  That is why it has been so vital to for me to meet with the psychiatrist.  My PC physician just had me on such a high dosage of the Lex and I had insomnia for two years and times of horrible anxiety and panic attacks which I didn't know what cased by that dosage of Lexapro.  I wanted to write something positive about the mental health field and the drugs that we take on here.  I think sometimes these boards draw in people that just want to complain and tell horror stories.  Yes sometimes there are horror stories but don't give up.  Drugs really work.  If I just took a hand full of vitamins and exercised more I would probably be dead now.  Keep at it!  I know trying different things is frustrating, but you can't stop fighting for yourself.  I am a mental health victory.  If Abilify stops working like Lexapro, then I will start fighting to find something again.",effectiveness: 5, ease_of_use: 5, satisfactory: 5, created_at: '2009-08-18 010:15:13', review_url: "http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-64439-Abilify+Oral.aspx?drugid=64439&drugname=Abilify+Oral&pageIndex=117&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1", drug_id:newdrug.id)

In the last two years, Effexor has been upped to 375mg/day, but I have had several life-altering events, and depression remained severe.  My doc started me on abilify about six weeks ago, and the difference is AMAZING. Gradually, depressed thoughts (to which I am severely genetically predisposed)have disappeared! Now, no matter where I look in the corners of my mind, there isn't one scrap of depression visible.  It is truly lifesaving.  I have been doing very poorly for very, very long time. Now I laugh and laugh - which I've missed more than almost anything - but it is very natural ... nothing manic about it.  I am also diabetic (type 2-on insulin) and so far the Abilify has caused no problem.  The ONLY drawback may be that I get too BIG to fit through the doors in my house!  It may be a &quot;small&quot; price to pay, but still ...I hope this helps -- I would LOVE knowing others have been as helped by this med as I have.  God Bless all.

(Yes, I know this is off-label and it's dangerous to give psych meds to kids, but they are under top-notch medical supervision and I thought it worth the risk; read on to know why.)  It has made a huge difference in their lives.Before the meds, one son was full of rage and constantly hurting others.  The other had no idea where his body was and once tried to jump out a second story window without even knowing it.  They were stimming all the time.  We tried other treatments like sensory diets and social stories, but it was too difficult to keep up with the needs of both of them plus my other two children who have multiple food allergies.  Our home was a living hell and I was totally exhausted.Since they've been on the meds, they've been calm long enough to start learning how to deal with their Asperger's and they've made lots of progress.  The older child has learned social skills and now has a circle of friends.  The younger child has moved from violent rage to merely saying he hates us, and is learning how to recognize when he's getting mad and withdraw to his room.The only thing I don't like about giving Abilify to my boys is that I have to cut the pills in halves and quarters to get the right dose for them.  It would be really nice if they came in juvenile-size doses.  But that's a petty complaint; I'm just grateful the drug is available in the first place.

newuser.reviews.create(comments: "I know that I have only started taking abilify one dose, but I can already tell a difference.  I was diagnosed as bipolar I in November 08 at the age of 48.  After taking pretty much everything except lithium, I was FAIRLY stable taking 125mg lamictal and .50mg clonazepam with 5mg ambien to sleep.  However, I kept getting more and more hypomanic, with hypersexual tendencies.  My psych added 2.5mg abilify yesterday when I told her I was getting no better, only worse.  The only thing I have noticed today is some drowsiness.  I am to increase dosage to 5mg in 4 days.  If it has adverse side effects I will drop back down to 2.5mg.  After so many months of feeling totally not normal, it is very very refreshing to feel pretty much like I used to feel before the bp diagnosis.  I have gained weight before starting the abilify, about 15 lbs., but I needed it.  I could not eat or sleep for so many months when taking all the other meds that I looked horrible.  I do not need to gain anymore, however, so I am going to do my best to keep the eating under control.  My hope, and my docs, is if the abilify works, to get rid of the lamictal totally and only use the clonopin as needed.  That would be SO wonderful.  Taking all these different drugs when you are already &quot;messed up in the head&quot; is a nightmare.  I have very little depression with the bp, so I cannot speak for the effects on that, but my mania seems to be less today than since over a year ago.

newuser.reviews.create(comments: "I've been taking abilify for the past 8 months (approximately).  The effects of this medicine for me are varied.  Currently on 5 mg, thinking about going up to 10 or 20 mg.  I'll start with the cons first: Ive gained about 40-50 pounds eating the same amount of food I've been eating for years, I sleep for 10-14 hours a night, it hasn't stopped my depression, I'm less talkative to my significant other, I'm more stir-crazy than normal (I have jittery legs, feel some tension in my calves and shin), I lose my balance once in a while, my memory seems to be effected (more short term), I get hot much easier than normal (notwithstanding I live in AZ), I get little joy our of sex and masturbation, it's difficult to become happy, and I'm more apathetic than I was when I was manic and unmedicated.  The pros are as follow: manic episodes are much rarer, I'm able to control my emotions (when I have them) more than I could, and I've not cut myself for the time I've been taking this medication.  Honestly, there are a lot of cons to this medication, at least in my experience, even though I'm thinking about going to a higher dose because it seems like I'm building up a tolerance.  I still have outbursts at work and home, albeit much lessened (like I'll get pissed off at an incompetent client and will start swearing like a sailor once they're off the phone).  I still get overwhelmed by life, though not as much as before, though I find it hard to become motivated as well.  I guess I'll move to a higher dose, hopefully I don't keep gaining weight (and yes I go to the gym 3-4 days a week).  I don't think I'd really recommend this medication without trying something else first or without taking something else in conjunction to alleviate these negative side effects.  Granted, I'm just one person, however these side effects are pretty serious to me.  I'm like a slug now, with very little personality.  Moreover, I still have racing thoughts and suicidal impulses.

I honestly feel great!  I have only been taking it for a couple weeks, but I do feel that it has greatly improved my concentration, leveled out my moods, and alleviated my anxiety.  I have a lot of energy also.  One downfall to Abilify is that it doesn't have a generic yet, so it costs a lot more for me to use.  Another downfall to Abilify is that it makes me VERY sleepy.  I take it at 10:00pm and I am asleep by 10:30 and i sleep a full 8 hours.  I tend to be fairly sensitive to medications that make people sleepy and this medication is no exception.

My husband noticed a tremor in my hand and I feel nauseous right after taking. I will call my Doc first thing Monday to talk about decreasing back to 2 mg. At 2 mg it was a wonder drug for me. Perhaps some problems others have experienced are due to the dosage. We are all different and it may take some time to find what works, i.e., provides the benefit w/out nasty side effects.

We just started giving her 3.75 mg to see if that is the magic dose.  It has been a rollercoaster ride and I worry about the affects on her overall health. We have scheduled a Dr.'s appointment to have her thoroughly checked out. It is comforting to see her have impluse control which has allowed her to develop friendships and have a more positive attitude.",effectiveness: 5, ease_of_use: 5, satisfactory: 4, created_at: '2009-03-04 24:50:44', review_url: "http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-64439-Abilify+Oral.aspx?drugid=64439&drugname=Abilify+Oral&pageIndex=78&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1", drug_id:newdrug.id)

I had trouble getting out of bed and starting my day before, now I am up early and anxious to get the day going, excited about life again. I feel more energetic than I have in years.A couple of downsides I have noticed: It seems like most reviews say that the drug makes them tired, but I seem to be having the opposite issue, insomnia. I now take it in the morning, and hopefully that will help. I am also experiencing constipation, which is one of the possible side effects.

Attempted suicide, but someone found me and took me to the hospital. Obviously I was saved.  I was put on Zyprexa 7.5mg. It worked good.  But I gained 40 lbs in less than two months!  I was then switched to Abilify but honestly it did nothing for me.  I felt like I wasn't even taking anything. So I was switched to Geodon, which made me very very ill, throwing up for over a month before I switched Dr.'s because mine didn't believe that the vomiting was a side effect. I lost all of the weight I gained, which was great! But it was just horrible living off freeze pops and in and out of the hospital many many times for I.V's. for dehydration. I am now on Seroquel 400mg. Works great but I'm back up to the 40lb gain again. I have a Dr. appt coming up soon in which I will discuss alternatives.

newuser.reviews.create(comments: "At 14 our son began taking Concerta for ADHD. At 16 our son was diagnosed as Bipolar and began taking Trileptal. At the age of 17 Abilify was added. After taking Abilify along with Trileptal and Concerta for several months the dosage of Abilify was increased from 5mg to 10mg.  Sadly within 36 hours (Friday pm to Sunday am) he committed suicide.   After the tragedy had occurred two people came forward to tell us that he had complained that his medication was making him feel unstable. In retrospect we recall that there was a noticeable increase in volatility within just 24 hours.  The event that triggered suicide occurred 36 hours after the increase, when he wrecked his car.  When he arrived home after wrecking his car it was apparent that he was not himself. He was extremely agitated and irrational and within 10 minutes had taken his life.  Although we were taken aback by the increase in mood swings, we did not associate his behavior with the increase of his medication.  I believe this tragedy may have been avoided if the Dr. prescribing this med had clearly informed us of the warning signs associated with the increase in dosage.  When we notified the Dr. of the tragedy his response was shock and disbelief.  He stated that he believed our son was &quot;doing so well&quot;.  It seems apparent to me that the doctor had become comfortable in his Dr/Patient relationship with our son and therefore may have minimized the warnings and risks associated with Abilify when taken by teens. My intention is not to place blame but rather to highlight the need for better communication between Dr's and both patients and parents.  Warning signs and side effects should be clearly stated each time there is a change/increase regardless of the length of time the patient has been taking the medication.",effectiveness: 1, ease_of_use: 4, satisfactory: 1, created_at: '2008-11-16 23:09:45', review_url: "http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-64439-Abilify+Oral.aspx?drugid=64439&drugname=Abilify+Oral&pageIndex=58&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1", drug_id:newdrug.id)

Finally, I was put on this drug and Depakote, and I'm feeling great. I've been on this combination of meds for about one month. Getting used to Abilify was a challenge. I felt very manic. Couldn't sit still, had to move my feet and legs, and couldn't sleep at night. I was put on  med to help temporarily with sleeping problems. Now that I'm sleeping, and the meds were increased, I'm doing better, for now. Everyone needs to remember, being bipolar isn't a choice.

I could not afford this medication at one point in time.  10 days later,  akathisia set in.  Akathisia is one gigantic horror experience.  Then I contacted the physician explained my symptoms, for which he never ever mentioned akathisia.  This guy is nothing more than cruel.  At the second to last visit, I was complaining about not being able to get off this drug.  He replied in a very LOUD VOICE, &quot;Oh, for God's sake, you're not even on a therapeutic dose!&quot;  Iwas stunned.  Why would doctor prescribe a non-therapeutic dose?  I think I have Bipolar II not 1.  Last session, he bowed his head, using a humble voice said, &quot;I think you are right to get off Abilify.  After all,  tardive dyskinisia could have been growing, becoming more permanent.&quot;  I have been diagnosed with permanent tardive dyskinisia and akathisia by a neurologist.  Why is it that the sheriff doesn't simply make an arrest as other criminals?  I left a voice mail for him saying, &quot;Have you ever heard of a word, akathisia, just google it and then you will know the definition.  Then do you mind sending information to my home address, please?&quot;  No response.  He took 2 months to send my records to my primary care doctor when it was suppose to take 3 days according to his office staff.  There is much more to my story but my advice is NEVER, NEVER EVER TRUST ANY HEATH CARE PROVIDER FOR ANY REASON!  DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND GET A 2ND OPINION.

I hope so, Being paranoid sucks, but to spend your entire teenage life hating yourself is worse in my mind.I do have depression which has been previously treated since the age of 12 and I don't really understand how this drug can be good for me since it is not even an off label use for anxeity. wish me luck.",effectiveness: 2, ease_of_use: 1, satisfactory: 1, created_at: '2008-07-08 22:58:49', review_url: "http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-64439-Abilify+Oral.aspx?drugid=64439&drugname=Abilify+Oral&pageIndex=36&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1", drug_id:newdrug.id)

I do NOT reccomend this drug for anyone dealing with bipolar II. The risks simply outweigh the benefits.

Abilify has very minimal side effects (unlike most of the other anti-psychotics); however, it didn't completely quell my symptoms - I still experienced some psychotic feelings.  This is not surprising, however, because Abilify is the newest (and &quot;weakest&quot;) anti-psychotic.  By &quot;weakest&quot; I am referring to the fact that it is only a partial dopamine agonist, which, in some cases, facilitates the manifestation of some psychotic symptoms.  However, for many people, Abilify is a highly efficacious drug.  For me, however, it just wasn't quite strong enough, so I switched to Zyprexa (which quells my psychotic symptoms, but has its own related side effects *see my Zyprexa posting*).  In sum, Abilify is a very gentle drug that is well tolerated by many people.  Given the potential side effects of other anti-psychotic drugs, I would try Abilify as my first line of defense.

Well...I ran out last week(of abilify) and haven't had a single episode in days-a big contrast from having episodes several times a week; sometimes 4-5 a day!
