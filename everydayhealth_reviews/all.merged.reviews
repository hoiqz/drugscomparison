abilify	Agitated State	2012-10-15 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I see the negative comments here, but I have to say that this drug at 2mg saved my life. I was going out of my mind for months with high anxiety (and no apparent cause). I was under a psychiatrist's care but really felt no hope. I was taking 22.5 mg Remeron and that didn't do it, but then he sdded just 2mg Abilify and the drug relieved the anxiety in a day ... one day. I can't say enough good things about this drug, simply wonderful. It is now a year later and I am still taking 2mg Abilify along with 22.5mg of Remeron and feel GOOD, and those of you that can relate to that high angst know what I mean when I say GOOD (normal).	-

abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2012-09-27 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I suffered from extreamly loud voices and wild dellusions before taking Abilify.  At 30mg once a day, I am now symptom FREE, and have been for 3+ years.  I know my case is a rare one in that it was so effective with no percievable side effects.  But I believe this drug is a step in the right dirrection for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoeffective dissorder...	-
abilify	Agitation	2012-08-23 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	0.5	0.5	I was given 2mg of Abilify along with 10mg of lexapro. I was instructed to take them at night before bed, the following is my expierences: the first thing I noticed was that no matter what I could not sit/lay still I was constantly kicking my legs and thrashing around. The constant movement coupled with racing thoughts would not allow me to fall asleep. I have never had racing thoughts until I took the drug!! Luckily they were not depressing or violent, but more goofy in nature. Eventually I went to get out of bed and things rapidly went downhill. Immediately I was nauseus and as I attempted to make it to the bathroom I became incredibly dizzy at that point an intense ringing began in my ears and I fainted hitting my head on a door frame. I then attempted to steady myself and go back to bed i failed 3 more times each time tunnel vision and ringing in my ears. These symptoms continued into the next day, I will not take this again.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2012-08-09 00:00:00		2.5	2.0	4.0	1.0	Helps with the upswings, but seems to leave only depression. So bad that I have spent the last week pretty much in bed, I am so uniterested in life right now its ridiculous. When I first started I fainted 2 times, so I had to cut the dose in half. I am still on half the dose for the past month and a half and am unsure if its the abilify causing this depression or something else, but I haven't felt this bad in years.	-
abilify	Agitated State	2012-07-23 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	5.0	2.0	This drug is HORRIBLE. I am a 19 yr old girl standing at 5'6&quot;. I was at size 5, 120 lbs. (Underweight) I took this for 4 months and got to size 13, 170 lbs. 8 months later, I have the metabolism of a 39 year old at 150 lbs, size 9. The weight gain intensified my mental instability, ruining my self image and happiness.	-
abilify	Schizophrenia	2012-07-03 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	0.5	Although this drug relieved the symptoms, I developed compulsive gambling as a result of taking this medication.  If you have also experienced this side effect, please  contact me me ASAP:gambilify@gmail.com	-
abilify	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	2012-06-24 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	I have severe obsessive compulsive disorder. I had been on Lexapro, AND I was doing well after 2 years I went off it. I was doing well for a few months, and then my OCD spiraled out of control. I started taking Lexapro again 3 weeks ago. Last week I was still doing horribly. My Psychiatrist put me on 2 MG of Abilify and it seemed to kick in for me the next day. I'm not perfect, but my OCD thoughts are much less. I'm not ruminating. I don't have rituals, just obsessive thoughts. They're practically gone in one week. This medicine seems to have done the trick for me thus far. I have just started CBT therapy too. My appetite has increased. I don't know if it's actually from the Abilify.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2012-03-28 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	I at first was eager to try this new med about 3 years ago.  I started to realize over time that I was losing interest in what I enjoyed most.  I stopped reading, listening to music as it became all noise in my head. I gained over 40 pounds and became even more depressed.  When I brought this concern up to my doctor he increased the medication which brought on worsened symtoms like paranoia and difficulty sleeping.  I started slowly weaning off and experienced restless leg syndrome and more paranoia.  They need to take this med off the market!!  Plus the co-pay is expensive,\.	-
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2012-02-12 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	5.0	0.5	what a nightmare!!! and from only 5mgs!!! made me weak, clumsydid not help with Panic/anxiety/agoraphobia disorders, I was on 2mg's for a month, didn't notice anything, until the jump to 5mg's. I feel poisoned now, and afraid to continue using this drug....should be named Disabilify, it crippled me literally	-
abilify	Post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)	2011-10-20 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	5.0	I have been on Abilify from 20 to 30 mg/daily for over 4 years and have had no inpatient hospitalizations.  I have not needed any lithium for over 4 years as well.  All I need is anxiety medication upon occasion.  Vision blurry and weight gain are main side effects.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2011-07-31 00:00:00		3.0	1.0	5.0	2.5	Caused blurry vision. I had to stop driving at night. I quit the meds and my vision cleared up. Took it with Lamictal and it worked well	-
abilify	Autism	2011-07-31 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	4.5	4.0	Seemed to help a lot with OCD symptoms associated with autism..also my son seemed to no longer be in a fog like he has been for many years, much clearer thinking	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2011-05-16 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I finally got a diagnosis after years of being considered depressed.  Tried 60 to 80 mg of Prozac, which made my legs restless.  (AWFUL feeling!).  So we backed down to 40 mgs of prozac and added 10 mg of Abilify.  WoW! What a difference!  I had lost interest in everything until I started on it.  I'd like to increase to 15mg, to see if it would help with my being tired in the a.m...Still would like to be a bit more active and interested in doing things that I should be doing.  Still have a dislike of people in general, though.  I don't work and I am afraid to go &quot;out there&quot; again...	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2011-05-16 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	5.0	4.0	I was on Abilify for about 5 to 6 months. I did saved my life. My manic depression was under control for the first time. I have Abilify +200mg Zoloft. I barely remember what happened before Abilify. That was how effective it was. The only side effect I have was weight gain. Huge. I gained 20 lbs the first 10 weeks. I did not bother me much as I was slightly underweight at the start (bmi 18). After 6 months, I was totally overweight (bmi 25), gained in total close to 40 lbs. Needles to say, I asked my doctor to stop this treatment.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2011-01-31 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	Abilify took away my mania symptoms and left me feeling safe from those high mood swings. I would recommend it to anyone who has bipolar disorder.	-
abilify	Depression	2010-12-27 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	5.0	It was with deepest regret that I had to stop taking Abilify. Along with my main depression medication I took 5 mg a day and it put me over that hump to where I finally felt like myself again after two years of struggling to find the right mix of drugs. I had always been a fairly cheerful person and this allowed me to truly enjoy my life again and not just try to enjoy it. However, after several months, 3 or 4, I began to move my jaw from side to side throughout the day. At first I didn't think too much of it, but then it became more exaggerated and more constant. It never occurred to me that this was a drug side effect, but it was embarrassing and annoying. My close friend finally asked me about it and then said I should tell my doctor. He immediately stopped my Abilify and although it took about 6-8 weeks to stop it did finally go away. I was fortunate as with this drug it could have been permanent. This was the ONLY side effect I had. It broke my heart to stop taking this drug.	-
abilify	Depression	2010-12-27 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	2.5	0.5	OMG! I used this medication in addition to Lexapro, because besides Depression, I have PTSD. And I must say that I repent 100 times that it was added. I slowly but surely started to have vivid nightmares and crying bouts constantly. I felt hopeless and worthless. I started getting ideas of killing people around me(which I NEVER, EVER had or even thought of doing EVER! I felt I never could go out without anyone going with me. Even driving made me quiver!I finally called my mom one day and she told me to go to the E.R. and there Mental Health Crisis Center helped me wean off this terrible drug. See, Lexapro, wasn't helping me, so my Dr. thought it was safe to add Abilify. But, Thank God today I am on another medication and I have no thoughts of Suicide or Killing anybody and I would not recommend this to ANYONE! Please be aware if you are looking into this, so, that this doesn't happen to you too.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2010-10-23 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	5.0	Before taking Abilify I spent years looking for the right medication. In this time I was often deeply depressed &amp; went back &amp; forth between not caring whether I lived or died, and being VERY suicidal. I often felt &quot;crazy&quot;, and had periods of depersonalization or derealization, during which I had no energy or motivation and isolated myself. Other times I had lots of energy &amp; would have fits of rage or sadness, involving screaming, crying, &amp; violence towards both myself &amp; others. Other times yet, I was very happy, extremely confident, and very promiscuous.Irritability was a constant, as was impulsiveness (which led to much regret).Since taking Abilify (7.5mg daily), I have still felt a wide range of emotions, but none of them have been extreme, or uncalled for, and negative feelings haven't lasted long. It's what I imagine being &quot;normal&quot; feels like.I behave like an average, respectable person &amp; make good decisions.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2010-07-18 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	I have been on this drug for 5 years. I have taken between 10-15 mg a day. I first started taking Abilify while in a manic episode. I have never had severe depression or mania while taking Abilify. The only side effect I have encountered is a slight twitch in my foot. The benefits out weight the side effect for me. I have never taken any other bi-polar meds.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2010-05-23 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I love Abilify.  I have taken this drug for 2 years.  I take 30 mg. each morning and 15 mg. in the afternoon.  I do not have any side effects.  Without Abilify I am excessfully anxious and have continuous panic attacks.  With Abilify, I can deal with everyday problems. My only problem is the cost of this drug.  I am on Social Security disability for having Bipolar.  I do have Medicare Part D.  Right now I have fallen in the donout hole.  My Abilify for a 90 day supply was $1,750 at CVS.  I like to have fell over.  I started crying at the drug store.  The only alternative was to order the generic Abilify over the internet on a strange website.  I wish Abilify price would come down so I can afford it. I also take Lamictal 200 x 2 a day, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Xanaz and Ambien. I really need help. I have applied to drug company and was denied assistance since I have Part D Medicare. Any ideas?	-
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2010-05-02 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	5.0	I am 40 and have been taking Abilify for over two years now and for me it has been a life saver. It has made my life tolerable to extremely livable depending on the day. I have had no major side effects other than a bit of weight gain. I work out regularly at a moderate rate to counter this. The crazy thoughts and swings have subsided because of this medication. I am working and my family has noticed a significant difference in my ability to function under stress because of this medication. I can not say enough good about it.	-

abilify	Autism	2009-12-21 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	My son was placed on Abilify after being diagnosed at 5 with autistic tendencies, Adhd, and bipolar.. I feel like I got my little boy back after putting him on this medicine. Less repetitive behaviors, less anger outbursts, ability to focus increased, better communication skills and less insomnia. I feel that Abilify is wonderful for treating the conditions that my son has been diagnosed with.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61845
abilify	Depression	2009-12-21 00:00:00		4.0	1.5	4.5	2.5	Added as supplement to prozac.  Found immediate increase in energy.   However, using just 5mg per day, I found myself with moderate restlessness, inability to relax and intermittent sleep at night.  I had high hopes because of it's early effectiveness but this is too much.  I halved the dosage and will give that a week or so but if there is no improvement, I will ask the Dr. to recommened something else.  Any suggestions for a supplemental aid to prozac?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61843
abilify	Depression	2009-12-16 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	3.0	well it is only my first day taking abilify.  i currently take paxil 30 mg as well.  today i took abilify 10mg.  the effects i have noticed so far are after taking it i felt extreme fatigue, but not sleepy.  definitely less anxious... my body temp feels higher than norm.  it completely killed my appetite.  do feel sort of restless now after 5 hrs from taking it	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61813
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-12-11 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	4.0	5.0	I was so disappointed I had to stop taking this due to horrible muscular side effects (crippling neck pain and tightness). It worked wonders for me. It stopped my mixed episodes, made me happy without being manic, made me rational and organized and able to think! It turned me into myself for the first time in years. All I could do was sit back and be amazed. My friends were amazed, too, at how much more myself I was. It was brilliant! So I say it is definitely worth a try, it might be brilliant for someone else as well.Regrettably I had to go off it due to the side effects. I had horrible neck pain, it felt like my head was being squeezed in a vice, and I felt like I was going to throw up, the pain was so bad. It was dreadful. And a shame, because the med worked so well for the BPII. I would recommend it still.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61790
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2009-11-20 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	3.0	I started taking 2mg Abilify 3 weeks ago. I am already on 30mg Cymbalta and 100mg Lamotrigine twice daily but was still feeling down and crying easily so the doc put me on Abilify. I felt great until a week ago.  I have had shortness of breath which is giving me anxiety attacks and the beginning of a panic attacks. Needless to say, as of this morning I've decided to stop taking it. I read last night that this is a serious side effect and you should go to emergency. My doctor isn't in on Fridays (today) and won't be in until Monday at 1:00. Frustrated! On the positive side, I did NOT gain weight. I have actually been losing it. I feel so much better but this side effect has ruined it for me. I hope there is another drug that will make me feel so good mentally. I would tell people to give it a try. If you don't like it don't take it....in the end it's up to you.  Thanks for listening.  I just had to put my opinion and experience with this drug out there.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61629
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-11-04 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Have only been on Abilify for about 7 days.  So far so good, but don't want to be misleading to others.  So far am tolerating ok, but having symptoms that may have been there prior to beginning treatment, but can't remember as I sometimes suffer from placebo effects and if a side effect is mentioned I often think it is related to the new treatment rather than being able to differentiating from prior symptoms.  Keeping my fingers crossed	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61495
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2009-10-21 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	3.0	I am on my 5th day of Abilify (2 mg in the morning). I started on a Saturday because I was so worried about the side effects and didn't want to deal with those when I had to go to work. I am also on Lamictal 350 mg/day and Wellbutrin. So far, I am in a better mood during the day and have energy. I have had a headache since I started, some days worse than others. My stomach is a little upset and I don't have much of an appetite....nothing sounds good. I am still on Geodon at night, but am weaning off that within the next week or so. I don't have any problem sleeping at night...in fact, I am very tired. But not during the day, which is what's important. Hopefully the 2 mgs will work...it sounds like the higher the dose the more side effects you experience. Good luck to everyone!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61360
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2009-10-13 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	Within a month of taking it I gained 15 pounds, despite that I worked out 5 days a week.  It made me insanely hungry nothing felt like enough. Mouth watered, these were the reasons why I stopped, the hunger felt like a constant obsession, while it stops the obsessive thoughts, it gave me obsessive hunger. wtf. Tradeoff not worth it. Better since I stopped, I stop eating after I have a meal, now it registers in my mind that I am not hungry anymore. Never had this problem before this med.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61297
abilify	Depression	2009-10-02 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	So far I've been on 2.5mg dose Abilify for a week as an add on to Wellbutrin. So far its working good. This is the first med that has worked effectively for me. Wellbutrin alone dosent do much. I've been a lot less depressed and irritable, calmer. The only side effect is sleepyness. I need 8 hours of sleep not too feel tired throughout the day. Without it, I can normally go with 6.5 or 7hours.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61193
abilify	Depression	2009-09-25 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Have had atypical depression &amp; anxiety for 20+ years. Recently began Pristiq after Cymbalta pooped out. After 3 mo. it helped &quot;some&quot; but FATIGUE was at an ALL TIME LOW. Thought I might have to quit work &amp; go on disability. Cried all the time, couldn't socialize, go anywhere, or do anything. 2 wks. ago I asked  Dr. to add Abilify. Very 1st day I had more energy!  Has been 2 wks. &amp; has been a MIRACLE drug for me. Went from suicidal thoughts to enjoying life again! I take a 2 mg tablet 7:30. AM. Have had NO side effects but trouble falling asleep at night. Also take Klonopin for anxiety &amp; sleep. Started taking calcium/magnesium at night too. Tried adding Tylenol PM but had trouble waking up next day. Recently added Estroven PM  &amp; I'm falling asleep much easier &amp; less tossing &amp; turning from hot flashes. Also take 1/2 vicodin 3-4 X's day for back pain &amp; 72mg Concerta ER in AM.  Concerta was SUPPOSED to help fatigue but I was still basically unable to function until I started the Abilify.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61149
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-09-20 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I was just diagnosed w/Bipolar II after being treated for depression &amp; anxiety.I’m on Cymbalta &amp; when my Dr. decreased my dosage to 30 mg from 90 &amp; added 2.5mg of Abilify, I stabilized. Then he changed diagnosis from depression to Bipolar II. It's like an evil spirit was excorcised from my soul (metaphor to describe futility of struggling with something that felt out of my control.) I've been wildly productive for a month &amp; feel great. I don't sweat the small stuff now, most of which would become huge &amp; suck me down into a pit of depression. Now it's like 'everyone get out of my way, I have art to make.'I hope this lasts. I never felt this good before &amp; I'm 39, so I have a lot to catch up on.Don’t give up. If meds don't feel right, tell your psychiatrist.Research everything you're prescribed. Read the info that comes w/them.Too high a dosage can cause negative side effects but just the right one may not.I wish more people find success with their meds &amp; treatment.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61094

Only side affects:  severe constipation (take a laxative or 6); restlessness (hey, better than  what I felt before!); difficulty falling to sleep (up the trazadone).  Otherwise, it's a great med.  Why didn't I try it sooner!!!!!!?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60999
abilify	Schizophrenia	2009-08-18 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	3.5	0.5	Experienced loss of appetite within the first few days of taking Abilify, became extremely fatigued, some abdominal pain. Found out a few days ago that Abilify was giving hepetotoxicity. Made my skin yellow, urine very dark. I feel miserable, stopped taking the meds a few days ago but still can't eat very well and want to sleep all the time. Haha the noises I was hearing stopped, but It pretty much made everything else 10 times worse.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60833
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-08-14 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	4.0	5.0	I have been diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder for about 10 years, and have been on every medication on the market.  My disorder favors the depressive side, and I am taking Lamical 200mg, Wellbutrin 200 mg, and Trazadone to sleep.  I am usually well controlled, but I still have an average of two intense episodes of depression a year. The last episode of depression, I actually considered suicide.  My psychiatrist prescribed Abilify 10 mg as an adjunct therapy and my symptoms improved dramatically!  This is the best that I have felt in years!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60802
abilify	Depression	2009-07-29 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	I had some pretty adverse side effects to this medication. I was using it in adjunction with Depakote for my depression. Immediately I was in a state of constant fatigue, irritability and vomiting. I was throwing up everywhere. Not fun. It may work well for others but for me, being a sleepy, vomiting mess was not my idea of alleviating depression. I would also like to note that I was only taking 2.5 mg a day, half of the smallest recommended dose. I can't even imagine what the full 5 would have done.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60688
abilify	Depression	2009-07-24 00:00:00		1.5	1.5	5.0	1.5	I was on lexapro for two months without seeing any results so my doctor put me on abilify also. I am only on 5 mg and the side effects are aweful. I am so restless i cant sit still and my anxiety has gotten worse. I have head aches almost everyday and i get so dizzy and tired after i take it. It hasnt even done anything for my depression so i am going to talk to my doctor about stopping it next week	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60635
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-07-23 00:00:00		3.5	3.0	4.0	4.5	I just recently have resumed taking abilify.  I stopped taking it first time due to strange side effects. I have since tried numerous drugs similar to abilify. Im my opinion, Abilify's benefits far outweigh the negatives.In the beginning I experienced slight drowsiness at first, and also began gagging.  I am experiencing the same side effects the second time around as well.  The gagging is apparently a pretty rare side effect.  I ended feeling better than ever after getting adjusted and finding the right dosage (about 6 weeks).I am being treating for Bipolar II, ADHD, depression, and PTSD.  I know that abilify isn't for everyone, but I have had wonderful results with it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60630
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2009-07-13 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	Problem with this med is the Doctors over-prescribe. I take 2.5 mg (5mg pills cut in half to save  money). It is extremely effective and I have no side effects. Comparing to the reported side effects, I have opposite effects. It actually stabilized my sugar levels and I'm not as hungry, I feel an increase in libido, I can sleep, and all other stress / anxiety symptoms have disappeared. I have tried several meds and this is the only one that made me normal again. Lamictal made me feel like I was dying. I'm bipolar, was mostly manic, every day. I also take atenolol for my heart rhythm / rate.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60544
abilify	Asperger's Syndrome	2009-07-10 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	My husband is taking 5mg. of Abilify a day for his Asperger's, and he is back to the man I fell in love with years ago! His symptoms seem to get worse the older he gets, just like his dad's did, and an anti-deppresant helped some but he needed something more. One day last week he missed his pill and by noon the next day told me he could barely string together a coherant thought. He said his head felt like it was stuffed full of &quot;oily cotton&quot; and it was too much of an effort to think, much less to think rationally. He said this is how he'd been feeling for the past few years, which explains a lot of the horrible decisions he'd been making. It had gotten so bad that I had one foot out the door before he started Abilify, but in the past couple of months things have made a 180. We're about to celebrate our 15-year anniversary, and for the first time in years I'm actually looking forward to 15 more!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60523

abilify	Depression	2009-06-14 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I've had no side effects from Abilify and it brought me out of a deep depression within two weeks with 10 mg a day along with me already taking Cymbalta 60 mg per day.  I highly recommend this prescription drug in combination with another antidepressent.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60308
abilify	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	2009-06-03 00:00:00		3.5	1.0	5.0	2.5	When I first tried 10mg of Abilify in the afternoon I became very sleepy, probably due to its antihistamine effects. That night I woke up after about 5 hours of sleep and couldn't sit still for the rest of the night. I simply felt I couldn't get into a comfortable position. The next day I was tired and slightly confused, and almost completely unmotivated and slept several times throughout the day.A few days later I tried half the dose, with about half the side effects. I tried this for a few days and did notice some relief from OCD in the morning, but the side effects were still intolerable.It works, likely due to its 5-HT2a antagonism, but only if you can tolerate the dopamine and histamine antagonism.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60214
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-05-21 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	4.0	0.5	I asked for this drug because a friend with Bipolar I took it and suggested it when I didn't tolerate Geodon very well. Within a week of starting this medication I developed severe akathisia... very agitated, crawiling out of my skin all the time, couldn't sit still and was overwhelmed with panic on the edge of complete terror, especially being out of the house ... had a lot of uncontrollable anxiety attacks, crying fits, etc.It did not help me with depression at all, I can't speak for hypomania or mood stabilization because I wasn't on it long and the side effects were far too severe to gauge any benefits.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60109
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-05-11 00:00:00		2.5	4.0	5.0	4.0	I started taking Abilify after a few months I was diagnosed bipolar and  before that  I was on risperdal..:(  and the Abilify was a major change which was much better.. I started on 15 mg. I was also given lexapro,cogentin for sides and ativan.Then later after a few weeks I was getting depressed  I was also a compulsive eater and manic so I gained 80- 90 lbs in 3 years... and then switched to geodon,prozac and cogenton but it made no difference in sides and weight gain, it added sleepyness tofor about 2 years on this med...Then I went back on Abilify 10 mg..a couple months ago and I feel ok just need to go up on dosage, but I dont know what to expect when the Abilify takes full affect yet.I am also on trileptol 900mg once a day and 1 mg of cogentin a day..I think this med has a different affect on everyone not all but most..	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60008
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2009-05-02 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	3.5	3.0	I have had sever weight gain, insomnia, trembling and now I am having sick thoughts of wanting to be with young girls. I have never had any thoughts like this in my life and I am terrified!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59932
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-05-02 00:00:00		4.5	1.0	5.0	2.5	When my Zoloft 100mg stopped working, my pdoc prescribed Ability 5mg.  I tried for 1 month.  I could not sleep (wide awake every 1 to 2 hours), I was acting impulsively (eating and shopping and speaking sometimes) and that my mind was three sentences in front of my mouth (which made me sound like my brain was a bit on the fried side).  I dropped down to 2mg and nearly immediately had a return of the depressive symptoms/suicidality.  Bumped back up to 4-4.5 and returned to the aforementioned side effects.  I also gained 15lbs.  While I understand this medication works for some and it did work on the depression, the side effects were intolerable for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59928
abilify	Depression	2009-04-11 00:00:00		3.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	Four days ago, I started taking 2.5 mg of Abilify as an addition to the prozac I'm already on.   So far, so good, for the most part.  The only side effect so far is insomnia.   It used to be impossible for me to get up in the morning, and I could fall back asleep easily when awakened.  Now, if something wakes me up at night, which it frequently does, I lie in bed for hours, trying to get back to sleep. The odd thing, is, the insomnia at least makes it easy to wake up and stay awake during the day.  I have more energy, more motivation to get things done, and have even found myself smiling once in awhile.  Its the closest I've come to feeling &quot;almost normal&quot; in so long.   So far, with abilify, I've actually smiled a few times without having to force it, or even think about trying to appear &quot;happy&quot;.  I guess I can try to live without sleep.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59746
abilify	Borderline Personality Disorder	2009-03-24 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	3.0	Worked miracles for me as far as treating paranoia and delusions! It would have been the perfect med if not for the side effects. I would get muscle jerks and feel on edge- like drinking 20 cups of coffee, and extremely agitated and jittery. It got to the point where I couldn't tolerate the side effects unfortunately.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59613
abilify	Schizophrenia	2009-03-22 00:00:00		1.5	4.5	5.0	3.5	Well, I feel a little ambiguous about this med. It didn't give me any side effects, I have lost 6 kilos over six months while on it, but it simply wasn't effective for my symptoms. A higher dose just increased side effects, but did nothing to help my condition.This is a really good med to try if you suffer from schizophrenia med-induced weight gain, but as I said, watch out, cause the symptoms may come back.Hope it will work for you. :)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59593
abilify	Agitated State	2009-03-05 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	4.0	0.5	I was prescribed 5mg abilify tablets, nightly at bedtime, for anxious mood.  I have concerns about the diabetes side effect; however, I'm more worried about my restless legs!  I feel like I can't sit still and have to pace, yet my legs feel like they weight 200 lb. each!  Attention span is lacking as well.  Only benefit I personally feel is that it's easier for me to fall asleep after taking this.........basically restless and lethargic most of the time during the day..........wouldn't recommend this medicine for anyone.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59415
abilify	Asperger's Syndrome	2009-02-10 00:00:00		4.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	have a 4 year old son that started taking 1mg of abilify in april08. the medication seemed to be the answers to our prayers for about 3 months. then he returned to sleepless nights and self harm. at about six months, his doctor uped his dosage to 2mg a day. no positive changes occured! it has been 10 mos. since my son started abilify and i am noticing that he is starting to chew his tongue and his tantrums are getting more intense. the most positive effect of this drug has been his ability to be more social and accepting of outsiders. at this time i am struggling with the decision to continue this drug for treatment!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59218
abilify	Borderline Personality Disorder	2009-01-26 00:00:00		4.0	4.5	4.5	4.5	Before taking Abilify I was Harming myself frequently and was lucky to still be alive.  I would zone out and not even feel the pain.  After taking Abilify I couldn't even understand how I could have begun to get this serious urge to harm myself.  I took this medication for a few years and when I stopped after slowly lowering the 15mg dose to none, I was extremly sucidal and had effects like I was on some kind of meth.  Several other meds were tried over a period over about 5 weeks and the only thing that helped was to start back on Abilify.  It is a great med while you are on it but can a person ever get off of it?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59098
abilify	Depression	2009-01-10 00:00:00		3.5	3.0	5.0	3.5	After literally years of trying different meds for dysthymia (which led to excessive sleeping and inactivity), Abilify seems to be helping.  I am awake when I'm supposed to be awake and i'm actually motivated to do things other than just fulfilling the minimum obligations in my life.  Side effects include considerable nausea and restlessness.  Also, I am on the verge of crying a lot but not because I'm sad... TV commercials, songs, well-wishing friends, etc. make me choke up from joy or sentimentality.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58963
abilify	Depression	2008-12-31 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	Abilify is the most horrible drug on the market; It worsens depression and anxiety. Other side effects include suicidal thoughts, uncontrolled saliva production, trembling, night mares, blurred vision.This product should be taken off the market, it does harm and has no benefits whatsoever.I used Abilify for 4 months and almost died from it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58877
abilify	Depression	2008-12-20 00:00:00		1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0	Cognitive-behavioral therapy is the best adjunct to treatment for major depression.The abilify depression commercial now on TV is misleading. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and medications are equally effective at treating depression, and CBT will reduce the likelihood of a relapse for depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy is effective at helping you re-interpret your depressogenic (or depression causing) thoughts in a different way. How you interpret the world is going to have a strong impact on your depression. But they don't mention CBT on commercials for abilify, and your psychiatrist, not being trained in psychotherapy, may not know CBT. Be sure to use all non-medication options first before using an antipsychotic for off - label applications given the potential for side effects for this drug. Abilify is an antipsychotic - don't believe the hype, this was not intended as an anti-depressant and the drug companies are simply trying to make more money.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58763
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-11-05 00:00:00		2.0	1.0	3.0	3.0	I'm a dental hygienist and found that this med made my hands tremor, so much so that I am need of going off it so that my hands don't shake. It is quite annoying and I just didn't get relief from my anxiety. Still having to take xanax to quell my nerves and am as paranoid as ever.... Anyone else get hand shakes/tremors?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58569
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-10-21 00:00:00		3.5	2.5	4.0	2.5	I began taking Abilify about three weeks ago, and although my moods seem to have stabilized, I am experiencing restlessness and at times a rapid heartbeat and palpitations. These side effects have not become reason enough to stop taking this medicine, but because my doctor started me off on a very low dose (2.5 mg) and I'm slowly increasing, I'm wondering if the side effects are more likely to get worse or if it's still possible for them to subside after taking the drug for a certain period of time, as maybe your body gets used to it? Does anyone have any thoughts on this?I also take Effexor XR 75 mg and Adderal 5 mg daily.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58506
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-10-16 00:00:00		2.5	4.0	3.0	2.0	Worked great for about a year for BPII. I was only on 5mg, so I didn't get tired, but I didn't notice a huge help, I would still have light mania and depression here and there. Then I started getting head ticks, and had to stop taking immediately.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58481
abilify	Cyclothymic disorder	2008-09-23 00:00:00		2.0	1.0	4.0	1.0	I was on this for 1 month. I really couldn't tell if it stabilized my mood because of all the negative side effects. I had EXTREME restlessness and insomnia. When I didn't have that, I was so tired that I could barely function.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58396
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-09-21 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	3.0	1.0	My Son Was put on abilify 10mg in the morning and 10 mg at night he is 7 years old he starting taking abilify, then 4 days after attacked me and my husband was put in a mental hospital for violence and 2 er visit before we finally figured out what was wrong with him so after 6 violent attacks on us and 3 hospital visits we finally figured it out we took him off and the next he was instantly better so just be careful	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58387
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2008-09-12 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	I have GAD and Major Depression. The abilify really helps manage the depression aspect of it. It's easy to take and haven't noticed any side-effects other than it makes me feel restless, but otherwise that's it. If you are on it, DON'T DRINK!!! As with any medication its a bad idea, but on abilify it will actually make you MORE depressed. I had to have my dosage increased because of that. Works very quickly, got me back up and running in a couple of days. You still have episodic bouts of depression for about the first 3 weeks, but far and few. After a month it's great.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58355
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2008-09-03 00:00:00		2.5	1.5	2.0	2.0	I have been on Abilify for a while now and at first it worked fine.  Later on, I experienced more and more side effects such as weight gain.  I could not lose weight even with eating right and exercise.  Overall, the medication is alright, but not for me.  I am getting it changed soon.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58319
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-08-28 00:00:00		4.0	0.5	4.0	2.0	My pdoc prescribed Abilify in conjunction with Depakote. The plan was to use Abilify while I titrated down from Depakote and then up with Lamictal (since Depakote and Lamictal can't be taken at the same time i.e. the Stevens-Johnson rash increase). For the first time in six years, I was not depressed. I am also on Celexa. But this was a pure happy feeling and it made me realize that other people must feel this way too. I was not used to such joy. It took four weeks to reach 50 mg. I became more agitated with each 10 mg. increase. By the time I did reach 50 mg, I felt EXTREME akathisia. I immediately began titrating off the med and within a week the main symptoms stopped. It took 25 days for it to fully leave my body. The depression reappeared.Akathisia is the the main side effect. Be aware.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58296

abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-08-09 00:00:00		1.5	3.5	4.0	2.5	Didn't help me a bit with the mania part of Bipolar Disorder, I was up to 10-15 mgs per day, allthough it was easy to take, gained a lot of weight while on it.  Might work for other people perhaps combined with other meds, but as we know, that is very hard to find sometimes.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58215
abilify	Borderline Personality Disorder	2008-07-25 00:00:00		2.5	2.0	3.5	3.0	My daughter is on this med after being hospitalized for 5 months.  I would probably have rated the med better but while in the hospital I felt they had her on much too high of a dose.  She was on 30mg daily plus Prozac 60 mg daily.  (If you read the literature that is double the max daily dose).  She was very &quot;blunted&quot;.  She is now on 20mg Abilify.  I am noticing side effects.  I also do not feel the doctors and counselors were listening to her.  Now that she is home I really like her counselor and doctor and we are slowly decreasing the med.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58156
abilify	Depression	2008-07-07 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	4.0	5.0	I have been taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder for 26 years.  Both of my parents died within the last year and after my mom died this May I started to descend into what I call the &quot;hole&quot;.  I could not concentrate or focus on anything even at work.  I was extremely anxious and even though I could not seem to be still I never accomplished anything.  I was constantly obsessing about things.I finally told my Dr. what was going on and he prescribed Abilify in addition to my other meds.  I take 5 mg twice daily and to me it is a miracle.I feel so much better and all the problems I was having have definitely improved even after less than 2  weeks.  Side effects are tolerable so far.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58049
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-07-02 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	I have bipolar II and am on 5mg of Abilify.  It has helped with the mania (hyperactivity) that I use to get. The bad thing is that I gained 7 pounds. I will be trying only 2.5mg to see if I get more energy and lose the weight. This helped me to be able to drop some Effexor that I was on - now I take 150mg instead of 225mg :-)  I feel kind of tired on this and lack motivation  and energy to do things but am very happy to not have the mania.  Caffeine helps bring my energy up so 3 cups of coffee a day works pretty well.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58022
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-06-24 00:00:00		2.0	1.0	3.5	1.5	I had most of all the bad side efffects	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57995
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-06-20 00:00:00		1.5	4.5	4.5	0.5	Soon after I started taking this, I started gaining weight. By the time I stopped I had gone from 155 to 192. No problem with the medication except that there was too little change in my feelings or behavior to warrant unlimited weight gain. Dr. said I had metabolic syndrome and now I am seeing a dietician and on a strict dietary program. Don't know if I'll ever get back to my normal habits. Now on Cymbalta nd quite happy with it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57982
abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2008-06-19 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	I was started on this medication after being stabilized after a major manic episode that required 2 months of hospitalization with Depakote.  The Depakote had some nasty side effects (major weight gain), so I was switched to Abilify,1 15mg tablet a day.  When on this medication, I had no episodes and few symptoms of mania for 18 months.  It wasn't until I went off of it (due to not being able to afford it, it's about $350-400 a month without insurance) that the symptoms returned.  It wasn't quite as effective for the depression, but I could function at least.  The pharmacutical company that manufactures Abilify rejected me for their patient assistance program, despite my low (read: none) income and history of hospitalization,  so seeing as it's about $13 a pill, it's not feasible for me to be on this medication via any legal means, so international online pharmacies, here I come. &gt;&lt;	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57979
abilify	Depression	2008-04-14 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	This medicine is great!  For such a tiny amount in a tiny pill it has really done the trick combined with the other medicine I am taking!  Hope it keeps working!  I am starting to lose weight, I can stay awake all day now, I get lots of chores done all day, I can organize better now, I am not as irritable as i used to be toward everyone and everything.  I am much happier now.  I am using only a 2 mg. tablet every day!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57680
abilify	Depression	2008-04-06 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Although it is not enough to treat my depression on its own, this medication is an important component of my medication cocktail. It is great at reducing my intrusive negative thoughts. Without it I become delusional and unable to function. The only side effect I have noticed is a tendency to gain weight. I have to really watch my diet while I take this medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57634
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-04-03 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Abilify saved my 8 year old son.  Not to mention me and his sister.  The constant  mood swings and violent outbursts were unbearable and getting worse with time.  He was wonderful at school (usually) and at his Dad's but an absolute monster with us.  We knew from the first week on Abilify that our sweet little boy was back and I didn't dread picking him up from school.  If I did not have insurance to cover this medication I would take a second or third job just to cover the cost - it has made such a complete difference in our lives.  I only wish I had seen the symptoms and admitted something was wrong years earlier.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57612
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-01-24 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	This medication has been AMAZING for my 9 year old son!  Have tried Geodon (side effects) and Zyprexa (gained 13 lbs. in 3 wks, didn't work).    Couldn't reach doctor during holidays, stopped Zyprexa, arrived on office doorstep on Jan 2, with son fully manic.  Doc said, &quot;We must stabilize before school starts!&quot;  Gave 5 mg. Abilify right there in the office.  Within 24 hours my son seemed absolutely NORMAL, just like he was before DX with BP!  I was in shock--the good kind!  Almost one month later the change in our family life is just unbelievable.  I have my great little guy back.  Oh, he also takes Adderall XR 25 mg and Strattera 25 mg twice a day.  Doing GREAT in school too!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57223
abilify	Borderline Personality Disorder	2008-01-15 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	I have struggled with BPD for 15 + years.  I have tried numerous meds with little to no success.   I was gaining weight and had no energy on seroquel, so my DR. switched me to Abilify (10mg)  It has been a miracle for me!!!  I am also on Zoloft (200mg)  in the am, i take Valium (30mg) throughout the day, and Trazadone (300mg) @ night.  I LOVE Abilify.  It has given me motivation and focus.  I actually feel happy ( so rare...)  I have not cut, purged, or drank since the switch.  Only thing I would mention is stiffness of my muscles.  ( nothing advil can't fix)  However, I would suggest and BPD's considering Abilify to get on an anti-anxirty med and some form of sleeping pill because it was the only way I could deal with the restlessness and insomnia.  As for me, I believe I found the perfect cocktail.   Hope this helps.   :)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57154
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2007-12-19 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	5.0	0.5	I was very happy while taking this drug. Unfortunately I was manic the entire tiime.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57020
abilify	Schizophrenia	2007-12-04 00:00:00		3.5	5.0	5.0	3.0	Abilify helped me become more motivated and gave me more energy but that was on the minimum dose. After raising the dose I became agiatated out of my skin, couldn't move, couldn't talk, couldn't do anything. Overall it didn't give me exactly what I wanted but it could definately work wonders for other people. Worth a try	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56952
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-10-16 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	5.0	0.5	Abilify is the WORST med I've ever tried! I was put on Paxil, Wellbutrin, and Lexapro before I was even diagnosed as Bi-Polar II. First I was told that I had Generalized Anxiety and Depression, then Hypomania, then GAD with Depression again. It was when I finally landed in the hospital that I was diagnosed as Bipolar II. When I left the hospital, I was on Lexapro and Abilify, with Vistaril for occasional panic attacks or sleeplessness. Abilify made me restless, about to jump out of my skin, ADD (I've always had a long attention span), and finally after about two weeks, I had one of the worst panic attacks I have EVER had. I literally felt like I was on a bad LSD trip. I kept hugging my mom and my two-year old niece because I was so freaked out. Abilify made me feel HORRIBLE. Fortunately, it was stopped right away, and now I'm on Lexapro and Trileptal instead, which is thus far working much, much better for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56755
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-10-11 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	5.0	This medicine pretty much saved me. I was so close to going back to my old days of self-injury; at the time I switched I was on Risperdal and Lexapro. Now I take Lexapro and Abilify. I can't believe what a difference there is. I had little or no side effects, and it has been working ever since! The only thing is that I may need to up my dosage (I'm only on 2 mg daily) because I occasionally feel a little bit of a mood swing (I have rapid cycling).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56733
abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2007-09-28 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	3.0	2.5	I felt less anxious on abilify, but I gained a lot of weight.  This was partly because taking the drug had a very negative effect on my ability to exercise.  I didn't have the energy or motivation;  Since exercise is very important to me, I had to stop the drug.  After a few weeks, I had lost the weight and was exercising nornmally.  I was disappointed since I had been told that abilify did not have these side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56662
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-09-28 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	1.0	0.5	This was the first medication that was prescribed after my diagnosis. I can't believe they would put anyone who is hypomanic on this drug. After 2 days, I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin. I was jittery, continued to not be able to sleep, and my thoughts raced even more! I wasn't really nauseated, but I lost my appetite. This medicine obviously didn't work with my brain chemistry.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56659
abilify	Agitation	2007-09-08 00:00:00		3.0	1.0	3.5	3.5	I noticed a big change in responses toward my anger and hostility.  I definitely recommend, everyone realizing that they need a little help and get it!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56565
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-08-23 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	I suffer from a mixed state and Abilify has not only stabilized me, but it's also made my thinking a lot clearer and rational. I am better able to apply cognitive restructuring and distress tolerance techniques. The only side effects from taking this drugs are: 11 pound weight loss (titrating off Pamelor concurrently), severe constipation, little to no appetite and I can't sleep more than 6-7 hours before springing out of bed, wide awake. I now have lots of energy and motivation to get my work done. Which is a good thing. I am back in the gym and feeling good about myself. Problems while titrating up in dosage, which are transient in nature include: increased hr, sweating, restlessness and anxiety. These side effects do go away over time. Titrating slowly is highly recommended. I started at 1mg and slowly worked my way up.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56497
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2007-07-26 00:00:00		0.5	1.5	2.5	1.0	This medicine did absolutely NOTHING to help me.  I got so fidgety from it I had to take Congentin, a Parkenson's drug, to get me to be still and even then I was fidgety.  My stability did not improve whatsoever from this and after a month my doctor took me off it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56356

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-07-14 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Abilify is the best antipsychotic on the market. There are no long-term side effects that I have had to deal with. The only short-term side effects were restlessness, insomnia and a zombie effect that went away after a few weeks on it. There is weight stabilization too. Abilify is a good drug to try. I am on 10 mg once daily. Take it in the morning. It helps.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55169
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-07-11 00:00:00		4.5	1.5	4.0	4.5	I Have Bi-Polar II and had been taking Trileptal with much Success! Unfortunately, my company switched Insurance and the insurance would no longer cover it, except Abilify. A weeks worth of samples of 10 mg as well as a Script for a 30 day supply, 15mg. Talk about catatonic! Within an hour I was so dizzy and sleepy that I would almost crawl to bed. Morning I was a walking Zombie. I &quot;pill-cut&quot; the 15mg and just took half. Finally am now taking 3-4mgs a night. GOOD NEWS! Like Goldi Locks, I had to find the right dosage. I know believe that Abilify is far superior to Trileptal! My mood swings are alll but gone and after my morning cup of coffee I am happy as a Duck in Water. My advice...Dont give up on the stuff. Do Find the Right Dosage for you. 10-15MG's was Over-Kill. 7mgs was good, but still too much. The medicine does what it is suppossed to do. Stop the mood swings. I have gained a little weight, but now that I know it is happening I am increasing my activity.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55158
abilify	Depression	2007-06-27 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	5.0	3.5	As a patient in a lengthy (16 months) depression and a history of severe mood swings (sudden feelings of despair), a low dose (5mg/day) of this drug greatly increased my mood stability. (I have also tried: Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Ativan, Cymbalta, Lamictal and Geodon without any success. While I was also on Abilify, I was simultaneously taking low does of Lexapro and Klonopin, which had elicited partial responses, though more by improving my baseline mood rather than doing much for my instability.) Unfortunately though, as soon as I started Abilify, I began gaining weight quite rapidly. This was the only negative side effect I experienced, but it was severe enough that I discontinued the drug. I'm disappointed though, because what it did in terms of improving my mood stability and general resilence were far, far better than anything else I'd tried, and it didn't make me feel dulled, tired, or any other similar complaints that often crop up with these kinds of meds.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55101
abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2007-06-10 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Before Abilify, the voices and &quot;hearing&quot; other things was pretty bad.  Now, I hardly ever hear them.  This drug does make you drowsy though, so I take it at bedtime.  I'm up to 20 mg a night.  It also helps with other problems like anxiety and panic attacks - at least for me.  It seems to have a calming effect on me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55009
abilify	Autism	2007-06-07 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	When our son was 17, he had been weaned from all medication to erradicate obsessive compulsive behaviors. We had started drug therapy when he was 12.He had been without meds for about 3 years.A parent recommended Abilify, describing that it 'took the edge off' and 'got rid of the weird stuff'. Given that those assessments were interesting, yet hardly tangible, we waited a year and tried it for ourselves.It has made a difference. The highs and lows related to anxiety are definitely tempered. He does not perseverate or obsess as much. He does seem more calm.He has been taking Abilify for almost 2 years now, and we did question a sign of 'drooping' of his tongue. We took him to a neurologist and he assessed that it was not a tartive dyskinesia.When I draw it to my son's attention, he pulls his tongue back. He can control it.So far, we are staying with Abilify.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54989
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-05-07 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	1.5	0.5	I wanted to keel over! I saw my pdoc for a switch from Zyprexa; I have BP-2 disorder, along with depression, OCD, and panic disorder. I take several other medications and was gaining weight like crazy after a month and a half on Zyprexa. My pdoc told me of Abilify, which I had never heard of, and I thought I'd heard of most of the new atypical antipsychotics. When I got home and took my first dose, I was dizzy within 15 minutes. Within an hour, I had a fever and was vomiting and close to fainting. I felt like this for roughly 28 hours. It was horrid. I notified him right away, and he switched me to Geodon, so we'll see how that goes. It's been a long time since a drug has made me this sick. When I looked into the side effects of Abilify, every single side effect I experienced was listed. Scary.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54840

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2007-03-14 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	4.0	3.0	Ok for School I guess if you needed to finish school or do well at work this med could work.  There are some side effects that you have to live with:  balance, problems swallowing, sensitive to the sun.  But it does help out in the concentration department.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54475
abilify	Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder combined	2007-02-16 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Abilify This medication works great for my 11 year old son.  Although taking it twice a day seems to help him the most.  He has a better morning when taking a small dose of 2.5 mg at night and 5 mg in the am.  It has made him much more coherent and mature acting.  It helps greatly with rages and argumentiveness.  He is much more reasonable.  His focus/organization could be better, but he can not take stims due to the tics it causes.  His social life improved greatly when starting this med.  It does seem to cause constipation though.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54329
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2007-01-10 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	3.5	0.5	Horrible drug They gave me this after detoxing from benzos. I was already in bad shape, but this just made me worse. I couldn't sit down and had to pace endlessly.  I couldn't think straight and I had no attention span.  It took a long time to wear off too.  I wouldn't suggest anybody ever take this stuff.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53984
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-12-10 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	5.0	0.5	Terrible! Don't know if it would have worked or not. Only took it for 4 days and felt just so sick in genenral. Very, very dizzy....shot my blood pressure straight up. I do have hypertension, but it has been mostly under control. The Abilify made it shoot straight up from day 1.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53842
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-12-08 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	too soon to tell I've been taking amblify for 7 days and the best things i notice are a slight increase in energy and motivation. I am less depressed even though I have been taking lamictal for a year. The lamictal alone wasn't cutting the depression entirely and the amblify seems to be a nice add on. I'm looking forward to having some trileptal added also for irritability and anxiety. Matbe the amblify will take care of these issues as well!I have noticed that I am only sleeping about 4 or 5 hours and  the dreams are not as nice as I would like but fortunely i forget them as soon as i get out of bed. thank God because as I am laying there i'm thinking what the hell was that all about shit!! that part of the drug is not good so I'm not looking forward to tonight and I might leave the lights on. lolno more strange dreams more calm and feeling better every day. it's unbelievable. I can't believe it's only 2 weeks. it's been over 1 month and we've gone up to 20mg. I am super productive and slightly restless. Some nights I sleep very welland other nights I don't sleep many hours but the quality of sleep is excellent. I do take 2 tylenol pm and a calcium magnesium at bedtime for my painfull degenerative neck. This is very annoying. With the bipolar and the neck I am easily aggravated. The addition of trileptal  will hopefully help me and smooth out any rough edges of the abilify. I do love abilify!!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52642
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-12-08 00:00:00		0.5	3.0	5.0	1.5	Abilify? Are you serious? It made me ABLE to lose my freaking mind! This was the first antipsychotic I was on after I was diagnosed.  I didn't know what to expect and needless to say, I was scared.  The first day, no side effects.  This continued for the first week.  Somewhere between week 2 and week 4, I lost all ability to concentrate on any one thing.  I became so restless at times that I felt like I wanted to jump out of my skin.  I was on this med as a combination with Paxil.  Between the two of them, I gained 45 lbs in 5 months.  It didn't help with any of my mood swings...depression or hypomania.  I actually started experiencing my first mixed episodes.  Hearing about them scared me.  Living them was a nightmare!Then the really weird side effects started.  I started having strange visual disturbances.  When driving at night, all the tail lights of the cars ahead of me would blend together.  I couldn't tell one car from another.  I also started having leg stiffness.  It would feel like my legs weighed a ton and when I got up to walk, I felt like a 90 year old woman.  I was only 26!I can write a book on all the crappy things this med did to me, from anxiety to hostility and terrible nightmares.  About the only GOOD thing about this med was that it allowed me to sleep...when I wasn't having nightmares, that is.Almost forgot to add: get your blood work done regularly.  I have blood work done on a regular basis and in the short time I was on this stuff, my cholesterol and triglycerides went up and I developed metabolic syndrome (the set of symptoms you get before developing diabetes).  Believe the warnings from the American Diabetes Association.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53670

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-12-02 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	5.0	1.0	weight gain! I'm Bipolar I, but mostly depressive.  Have only had one manic episode in 2 years.  Most of the time I am in a depressive state.I started on Abilify 5 mg. a day in May, and have gained about 30 lbs. since then.  I have been gaining about 5 lbs. a month since I started on it.It has done nothing to ease my depression, except make memore depressed due to weight gain.  However, Abilify did help with my &quot;voices&quot;  - a sort of murmuring and mumbling as if I were listening to a distant radio, after I went up to 15 mg. a day.I am going to ask my doctor to take me off this medication, because I feel slightly uncomfortable when out in public (I feel like &quot;the fat girl&quot;).There was only one other person on RemedyFind that mentioned weight gain, so this may be a side effect very infrequently experienced.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53403

abilify	Schizophrenia	2006-11-16 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Abilify - Helps Me Write  I started Abilify by itself, when in the hospital in July. It made me extremely agitated and irritable. My pdoc added 160mg of Geodon and immediately I calmed down. The voices and delusions were still a problem though, so she added 15mg of Haldol to the mix as well. On this combo, things rapidly improved. I can however, attribute one major benefit to the Abilify alone, since I'd been on the other two drugs before: a drive and ability to write and write -- my one talent and ability -- like never before. I write pages and pages a day in my notebook, and usually a poem each day and a blog entry of several paragraphs and e-mails galore. Sometimes I write all day long, right up until the instant I fall asleep at night, and it's great. THe delusions are under control, as are the voices. My mood is balanced, neither up nor down, and the irritability has completely vanished. In fact, I can wait and wait and wait without the least impatience. So I'd say that Abilify has a role to play in my illness, even if I can't tolerate it by itself, and it is not effective completely on its own. I would not want to stop taking it!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52728

abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2006-11-01 00:00:00		3.0	5.0	4.5	3.5	Great at the beginning. Not sure now. At the beginning I had very satisfactory results. I have taken the drug for two months, I have experienced no unpleasant side effects at all. The first two weeks I had more energy, was sleeping great at night, (My insomnia gives me a hard time),I felt like exercising, I cooked, etc. I thought this was definitively the medicine.But two months after start taking the medicine, things have changed. I am having trouble sleeping, I have a terrible lack of energy, I am afraid my depression is coming back (even though I am taking antidepressants). I guess this is happening because I am Bipolar II, and my understanding is that Abilify is FDA approved for Bipolars I.I am taking Lithium and the idea was to replace the Lithium with Abilify , but as soon as I got a smaller dosage of Lithium I felt terrible, so now I am back with Lithium and at the same time with Abilify, giving some time to see if Abilify works. I am taking also Stablon (not approved in the US).I really want to try again with Lamictal, because I have read it is the best for Bipolars II, but I tried 2 years ago and I had terrible itching, not a rash thank God, but my doctor preferred not to continue with Lamictal. I will keep you posted, in case Abilify works.

Before taking ability I had simple racing thoughts and maybe a few other things but I liked and enjoyed who I was.  Now when trying to go without the medication I feel terrible, I had my dose lowered because I felt like I couldn't sit patiently, like I couldn't get comfortable, squirmy.  I feel caught between a rock and a hard place.  I wish I wouldn't have been forced to take this medicine without more accute symptoms for peace of mind that it was helping instead of causing the symptoms I now experience.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51887

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-10-24 00:00:00		0.0	1.0	5.0	1.0	Just for one day I took Abilify for only one day because the side effects I got made it not worth the trouble. Took it around 8pm one evening, then didn't sleep a wink all night. When I woke, I was sensitive to all light and sound, and then vomited just for good measure. A friend told me that these side effects are likely to ease after a few months, but I didn't see the point in taking something which was giving me the symptoms it was supposed to treat, i.e. the insomnia and overacuteness of the senses of a manic episode.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51546
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-10-23 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	4.5	4.0	This worked great for me I have run the gambet on anti depresents. This one finally has been a dream. I am not sleepy on this at all. I take it with my ADD meds, and they have not caused any real problems for me. A bit of weight gain, just a bit. But all in all this a good drug for me. Very smooth as far as the way I feel. Helps take the edge off adderall. Glad to here others have it work well for them as well. Remember all drugs are not going to work the same for everyone. Try and keep trying till you find the one that makes you say YES. Feel free to e mail if you have any questions.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51427

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-10-19 00:00:00		3.5	3.0	5.0	3.5	It has just stated. Well it has been about 12 days and I can honestly say that I am feeling more positive effects within this time than with 8 months of taking Seroquel.  I am really kind of timid to say that it really is working, but so far things are looking up. I have been dealing with a bit of insomnia, but I have medication for that problem.  Please keep your fingers crossed for me and I will keep you posted.......Still taking Ambilify.  It makes me feel different than Seroquel in a positive way except for figity problems and problems sleeping. I am taking meds for the sleeping problem.  After about five weeks of taking Ambilify, I am not sure where I really stand.  So I will keep on trying with this med.  Hopefully next time I will have better news.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/50220

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-10-11 00:00:00		3.0	2.5	4.5	3.0	Not for me, but I''ve seen it help another This medication made me incredibly restless. I tend to be like that anyway, but it made the sensation unbearable. I felt like climbing out of my skin. It did seem to help level me out and I probably would have remained on it longer if not for that side effect.My friend takes this and it works remarkably well for her. There is a very clear difference between when she takes it and when she does not. She had one odd side effect though. Apparently, it caused her breasts to swell almost uncomfortably. The doctor told her that is a possible side effect, something about it can trigger lactation or something along those lines. I think it's a rare thing to happen. It, unfortunately, didn't happen to me! :-)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51068

I have always been sensitive to meds - so my fatigue may be more related to my body chemistry than anything else.  On the positive side I was experiencing severe bipolar (and somewhat psychotic) episodes where I thought I saw and heard things (more like conversations in other rooms and people calling me than commands to take actions).Once I started taking Abilify I almost immediately was relieved of these truly disturbing symptoms of my illness.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/50950

I am currently in the more depressed side of my mixed states and have been given several medications new to me, most of which do not seem to be working against my anxiety.  I'm shaking a lot and was told by my doctor that it may be the Abilify.  I will probably not stay on Abilify for very much longer.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30234

abilify	Depression	2006-09-21 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Relief This was prescribed for Depression/PTSD/DESnos ( Disorders of extreme stress - not otherwise specified ) from childhood.I suffered from refractory depression, debilating fatigue, anxiety, severe sleep disorders, chronic diffuse pain (fibromyalgia), and ADD-like symptoms.Tried without adequate response (4+ weeks each): Zoloft, Paxil, Lexapro, Amitryptaline, Wellbutrin, Lamictal, Effexor(helped some) and Cymbalta.The first 4 days were really tough to get through but worth the effort.  I was extremely sleepy, felt like my limbs were made of lead and really struggled to perform cognitive tasks of any kind regardless of what time I took the dose. The &quot;zombie&quot; like effects were severe enough that I almost quit taking it on each of those first 4 days.  After the 5th day on Abilify, there was a fairly abrupt shift for the better that has persisted.  I feel much calmer, relaxed and have noticed an enormous difference in my ability to handle stress or unexpected events.  Also, instead of feeling constantly uncentered and awkward around people I don't know well, social situations are now much more comfortable and even pleasant for me. Abilify has also helped with the depression and significantly reduced the ADD-like symptoms that had only been exacerbated by SSRI's or SNRI's. Finally, I feel like living life again instead of being trapped dwelling on the past and hiding my wounds from the world.  No weight gain to date and perhaps a small amount of weight loss.I am also taking desipramine(100-150mg/day for past 6 mos) which has helped enormously with the pain, fatigue and mood.Only side effect so far has been a slight increase in the anticholinergic effects of the desipramine, which for me is only a mild heart rate increase and urinary hesitency.  Those side effects are nothing compared to what this med has fixed.  Based on my experiences so far I would recommend starting at a low dose first and try to start it when you have no serious obligations	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49817

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-09-19 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	3.5	4.5	Abilify is OK This medication was given to me first in the slightest dosage and then in very small increments upped.  That was a total pain.  If I was given too much of an increase I would shake.  However, once stabilized I seem to have no problem with this med.  It also seems to be doing it's job as far as stabilizing my mood.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35979
abilify	Depression	2006-09-19 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	made a huge difference I have Fibromyalgia and Major Depression.  I had been in a Fibro relapse with a subsequent depressive episode that had been weighing on me like a stone for months.  I had no energy and couldn't focus.  I was taking Wellbutrin XL and had tried a couple different anti-depressants in addition to the Wellbutrin but nothing worked.  Then my doctor suggested Abilify.  I take a fairly low dose.  The doc wanted to raise it but I said &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;.  Abilify doesn't impact my Fibro symptoms, but it sure did help lift my severe depression.  Don't let the fact that it was initally approved as an anti-psychotic scare you off.  The new anti-psychotics simply modulate the same neurotransmitters that anti-depressants do--but with a different &quot;flavor&quot;. The are being use for lots of psychiatric complaints now.  I highly recommend Abilify for depression.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49632
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-09-17 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	4.0	0.5	Felt Like I Was Fading Away When I first started using it for my Bipolar I it seemed to help almost immediately with my nighttime anxiety. I was taking it with Wellbutrin,which was stopped because the doc believed it may have been contributing to the anxiety.So I was on the Abilify alone. Thats when all hell broke loose! I couldn't eat, food repulsed me ( I wanted to lose weight but not like that.)I had NO energy, no motivation, couldn't sleep and the WORST anxiety I ever had 24 hours a day. It was a feeling of utter panic and dread from head to toe and I paced the floor for hours! It was the first time since I was diagnosed that I really felt &quot;crazy&quot; for lack of a better word.Worst of all, my doc made it seem like my reaction was rare and unusual, but reading what i have here shows that it was not.I took the semester off from college because I couldn't function. I ended up being taken off of it and was given Xanax( 1 or two 0.25mg 3 times a day) which cleared the anxiety literally in a matter of hour or two after taking the first dose. I also take a very small dose of Seroquel(25 mg), and so far, so good.God bless the people it helps because it made my life a living hell for the time I had taken it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49534
abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2006-09-09 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	4.0	Abilify giveth, and taketh away Update.  As I read other reviews ofthis medication I am struck by similarity of experience.  I, like some others, have felt a loss of affect. My illness is quite well controlled, but I have lost my passion (a friend said this to me). Never very happy or very sad.  Life is comfortable but without a great deal of color.  I am on a heavy regimen of medications so I will not point the finger solely at Abilify (for the good or the bad).  I just feel this is important information.Abilify was added to me regime almost four years ago. I was already on Geodon and and anti-depressant (forget which one). I was in a state of depression, paranoia, and low energy. This drug did not fix everything but it did give my energy level a boost. I find I tolerate it well and it is easy to take. I have had a tremor for some time. I think it's from the Geodon, can't be sure though.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41893

The only effective treatment from my personal experience with Panic Disorder is Xanax(benzo) and research shows that as well. The overuse of anti-psychotic is getting on my nerves.  Abilify did nothing for my panic disorder symptoms for obvious reasons since it is not designed for it.

abilify	Schizophrenia	2006-08-16 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	Following up on my earlier review. I've been on Abilify a few years now, therefore I'm in a good position to tell you how it's helped me.  It has totally wiped out my hallucinations/delusions and, along with Seroquel, has controlled my manic phases.  The only real side effect I have is a totally flat affect.  I don't feel any intense emotions about anything.  Happiness, sadness, fear, stress etc. have all been limited to moderate.  I feel nothing much more than numb most of the time.  I didn't like not having any feelings, so, along with my Pdoc, I weaned off of the Abilify only to be sent into a deep depression.  Severe enough to cost me my job and very likely, my career.  Anyway, I'm back on it and feeling much better.  Still numb, but much better than depressed and manicky.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47651
abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2006-08-16 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	Following up on my earlier review. I've been on Abilify a few years now, therefore I'm in a good position to tell you how it's helped me.  It has totally wiped out my hallucinations/delusions and, along with Seroquel, has controlled my manic phases.  The only real side effect I have is a totally flat affect.  I don't feel any intense emotions about anything.  Happiness, sadness, fear, stress etc. have all been limited to moderate.  I feel nothing much more than numb most of the time.  I didn't like not having any feelings, so, along with my Pdoc, I weaned off of the Abilify only to be sent into a deep depression.  Severe enough to cost me my job and very likely, my career.

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-08-15 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	good on abilify for me The only side effects I have had are a rash on my leg and I cant sleep too good and my doc has me now on something else to help me sleep because I did not want to give it up. All and all I think it has helped me alot. Nothings gonna make you perfect.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47490

abilify	Post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)	2006-08-14 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	very good I have been diagnosed with PTSD.  Treatment with SSRIs caused unacceptable side effects.  My symptoms did not respond to Lamictal.  I do experience somnalence but hopefully with time this will resolve.  So far no weight gain.  I did initially have an increased heart rate but this has resolved.  My primary symptom is anxiety and insomnia.  Even though I have day time somnalence....the insomnia, or frequent wakening still occurs.  My overall appoval of this drug is good at considerably less than a therapeutic dose.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47461
abilify	Asperger's Syndrome	2006-08-11 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	Excellent My son with Asperger's has been on this and I notice a huge difference in his repetitive behaviors and the obsessive thinking.  He has also lost just about all his violent behavior due to sensory overloading.  He maintains a healthy weight and sleeps well.  He was on Risperdal for awhile and he gained almost 10 pounds in a short time and was still aggresssive on it.  This has been much better.  We did try a little higher of a dose once and it produced a sedating effect.  At the 5 mg dose, he is 8 and weighs 71 pounds, he has had no ill effects.  I like this medicine and would strongly recommend it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47367

They are my sunshine pills for they bring sunshine to the dark ravages BPD can wreck.  Unfortunately, oh how unfortunate, I cannot tolerate them for more than 2-3 months.

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-08-02 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Excellent I have used Abilify only for break-through mania which happens once or twice a year, along with upping my Depakote dosage. The combination ends the mania in under 24 hours. Most of the time the Depakote alone keeps my mania at bay.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/46577
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-08-02 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	A life-saver for our son At 17, our adopted son has several serious behavior problems* (stemming from fetal alcohol exposure) which has led to a series of out of home placements in schools, hospitals, residential treatment, and group homes.  After he was thrown out of his last group home, his doctor added Abilify to his meds. (Depakote, Concerta, Zoloft).  We saw an almost immediate good response which has continued for 3 months. This is a long time for him, as many prvious meds. lead to improvement for about a month when we saw the benefits taper off to a much more modest level.  He responded fairly well to Zyprexa and Risperdal, but had massive, debilitating weight gain which he has avoided with this. He did develop oculogyric crisis on this, but it has been easily controlled with Benadryl.  I think he would be in jail without Abilify.  In his own assessment, he noted that he feels &quot;less angry&quot;.

abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2006-08-02 00:00:00		3.0	2.0	5.0	3.0	Does cause weight gain Unlike what the pharma community has lauded about Abilify and it's impact on weight, my 10 year old son has put on significant weight since taking this drug for two years.  However, compared to Risperdal, Abilify seems to be more effective in the long run and most likely less a cause of weight gain.  Just wish the medical community could come up with an antipsychotic that did not trigger an appetite response!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/46535

I REALLY, REALLY hope this lasts.  The Dr. told me this med is his first line treatment for obsessive thinking - pretty common in Aspies, but it has also lifted my depression.

abilify	Depression	2006-07-07 00:00:00		2.5	1.5	3.5	2.5	So Tired..... I started on the 10 mg once a day at night.  It made me feel drowsy all day, like I was sedated.  I could barely function.  But when I tried to take a nap, I felt anxious and uneasy.  I went down to 5 mg, which helps with the drowsiness (still drowsy, but not as much), but at about 4pm, I would get suddenly very anxious.I was still really tired with the 5mg, so I'm down to 2.5 and although I am tired, I am able to function.I am not hungry, but have kept my weight pretty constant.  No other major side effects.I can't tell if the meds are working or if I am just in a state of sedation, but I do feel like I am not as rocky emotionally throughout the day.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44461

Why they let these guys prescribe this stuff, I don't know!) I decided to continue on it and the swelling diminished to almost nothing.  I am not sure about the blurring yet but I am planning a trip to my eoye doc soon.  In combination with Lexapro it does seem to work better than what I was on prior to recent hospitalization, which was Chorimipramine (it has a more common name but I can't remember it.

I'm probably in the minority, and I wanted it to work b/c of the side effect profile, but it became clear quickly that this drug does not agree with me. I hope it works for others. As for atypicals, Zyprexa and Seroquel are the only two that have worked for me, and Seroquel more than Zyprexa. (Risperdal did nothing and Geodon kept me up at night and wouldn't let me wake up in the morning, w/questionable effect.)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44946
abilify	Depression	2006-06-20 00:00:00		3.5	4.5	4.5	4.0	Good with other medications  I tried just the abilify and it helped with anxiety but did not help with my depression. I take Abilify, provigil and wellbutrin. The combination has done wonders for me. I have tried being on each of these drugs by themselves, but they did not seem to work as well.

My manic episodes have now elevated to a point where I am miserable and I have an appointment today with the psychiatrist for a med checkup, and I am going to tell her that she HAS to take me off the Abilify. I can't sleep or eat and I am physically and mentally exhausted. I am teetering on the edge it feels like and I just want to sleep. I've been on this for a little over a month and it has just been winding me up more and more as time has gone by. Besides Bipolar I, I also have OCD and Acute Social Phobia so it's been a real hard time. I have lost 17 pounds in this time as well and have felt like I've been in a deep freezer. Constantly cold and wearing a coat in the house. This is crazy. Sorry to ramble....	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/42828

abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2006-05-12 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Excellent for my depression and anxiety and mood. I take it in the morning and lexapro (ssri antidepressant at night).I tried the other drugs and they just made me zonked out. This worked for me well! Love it! also I take a few fish oil tabs a day for omega 3.This combination works so so so well. Love it.I wanted to die before this (even with an SSRI) and this has helped me get out and do so much.It has all kicked in and i feel great.Dont be afraid to try a few diff ones if one doesnt work. Dont give up. Most didnt work for me but this did.Try it and if not try another.Chop	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/42589

abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2006-05-06 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	Abilify has restored my life - There is hope ! After taking abilify for only a few days, I felt myself again. My old self, (silly, funny, loving, with energy, creativity, motivation) I had not felt this way since 1990's. I have taken so many medications over the years. None have compared to Abilify.  I am also taking a regimen of other medications, as many of you are.  I want to give hope to everyone that there is hope.  Also, try not to focus on your mental illness, it is only a condition that we must deal with.  It does not define who we are.  We are NOT bipolars....we are Mary or Bob, or Lamar, or whomever.

abilify	Post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)	2006-05-05 00:00:00		0.5	0.0	5.0	1.0	not a good fit This med was prescribed for me after telling my psychiatrist that I had been feeling like I want to jump out of my skin.  The side-effects I experienced were not worth my taking it as it seemed to be counterproductive.  Instead of making me feel better about myself, I felt worse because I became constipated, had a voracious appetite and gained a lot of weight.  I was not happy at all with this med.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/42172

abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2006-05-01 00:00:00		3.5	4.5	4.5	4.0	Good with other medications  I tried just the abilify and it helped with anxiety but did not help with my depression. I take Abilify and wellbutrin. The combination has done wonders for me. I have tried being on each of these drugs by themselves, but they did not seem to work as well. The side effects with abilify have been mild--I just wanted to eat carbs or chocolate for the first few weeks.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41435

I was already on Geodon and and anti-depressant (forget which one). I was in a state of depression, paranoia, and low energy. This drug did not fix everything but it did give my energy level a boost. I find I tolerate it well and it is easy to take. I have had a tremor for some time. I think it's from the Geodon, can't be sure though.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41904

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-04-27 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	too sedative at first, great for anxiety i was diagnosed bipolar 2 after 12 years of being misdiagnosed with depression and terrible results with lexapro. they started me on 2.5mg of abilify, and i felt drugged for the 1st week,with an &quot; i don't care&quot; feeling,  tired, trouble thinking, being social and carrying a conversation. then i went up to 5 mg.  i finally was able to have a more objective look on life, step back and evaluate instead of reacting, and anxiety stopped. the heavier side effects were gone by the 3rd week. then added lamictal to the mix, starting @ 25 mg to move up to 200mg. (i'm @ 50 now) so far the results are great, i feel &quot;normal&quot;. i only have a little trouble remembering things, the occasional headache and too enthusiastic at night, which changed once i switched to taking meds in the morning. finally, don't get discouraged by the &quot;antipsychotic&quot; word.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41701
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-04-23 00:00:00		3.0	1.5	5.0	3.0	awesome if there were no side effects after 14 different medication, not to mention combinations of medications already tried after a period of 2 years I was so happy that for the first few day Abilify was increasing my focus and concentration.  My mood was &quot;normal&quot;, not over inflated and didn't fluctuate like it has been.  The only problem was after a couple of days I started to have insomnia which I couldn't handle and a nervousness inside I couldn't quite get a handle on.  I also had a heavy heartbeat, like I shouldn't have been feeling my heartbeat like that when I was laying down.  It did make me drowsy but I can handle drowsy, can't handle insomnia though which I have now.  It did give me bad thoughts that scared me after about 5 days but i dismissed them hoping they were just part of the bipolar illness.  Good med, sorry to say, couldn't handle the side effects.  That hurts!I wanted to add to the writer that said that Abilify was expensive.  Ask your pdoc for samples.  Mine gives me samples of Abilify, Seroquel, Lamictal, Zoloft, almost everything I've tried.  When he didn't have samples of even Ambien and Trileptal when I tried those he had some &quot;voucher&quot; sticker affixed to the back of the script so when I took the script to the pharmacist it was free.  Its embarrassing to be poor but its better to be well and have some money in your pocket!!  Just a tip, don't be afraid to ask for samples, they got tons, trust me, they've told me!Also, on a briter note, i'm back on Abilify at 2.5 mg with propanolol to keep my heart rate steady to try to ease up on the inner restlessness and heart palpitations I guess and i'm taking Ambien for the insomnia.  The dose isn't high enough and i'm a bit irritable but slowly but surely hopefully i'll be back to the normal dose.the Ambien didn't work and I'm sad to say had to discontinue the only med so far that was working for me due to the insomnia side effect.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40495

I started at 10mg and am on 30mg, dose set when hospitalized in January.  I developed EPS, my jaw spasmed, so the doc put me on Cogentin.  That has helped a lot.

Just on edge all the time; couldn't calm down, but not in a good way.  I have a good friend who is on it, however (also Lithium) and she appears to be doing ok.

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-04-13 00:00:00		0.0	1.0	5.0	1.0	Caused Horrible Side Effects I was prescribed this for bipolar 2 with quasi-delusional thinking, and anxiety. I used it for 6 days before stumbling back to my pdoc to get me off asap.I was super tired and groggy constantly, and I felt like it slowed my thought process. But when I tried to sleep I couldn't due to a pounding heart, trouble breathing, and a general inability to relax. It also made me very agitated, but not in a productive way. More like I was constantly on edge, feeling on the verge of a panic attack, and absolutely could not calm down. I couldn't get comfortable sitting, standing, or laying down, because of the agitation. It did absolutely nothing for my mood. If anything, my mood was worse because of the extreme agitation.I also had constipation and severely decreased appetite.To sum up my experience, this was the worst drug I have ever been on--and I've tried many of them. I couldn't even stand it long enough to let possible 'start-up' symptoms go away. I do have a low tolerance for many medications, but nothing should ever make anyone feel like this one made me feel.Now on 25mg Lamictal/day and feeling better already. :)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40994

I discontinued the med due this side effect. It wasn't essential for me to take it I just wanted see what alternatives were out there.

abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2006-04-04 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	Abilify ~ A diamond in the rough for me Abilify is the first drug that I have tried with satisfactory results for bipolar disorder. Although I have only taken the drug for two weeks, I have experienced no unpleasant side effects at all. To the contrary, I have experienced more energy (not a manic disphoric type of energy but what I believe might be normal for most people), elimination of paranoia, better sleep at night (I take my dose at bedtime), no racing thoughts, my speech and behavior have become less pressured, and my athletic performance has returned to normal as a result of having found a drug that does not make me drousy, dizzy or &quot;slowed down&quot;. I also take 1mg of Clonazepam at bedtime to aid in maintaining a normal sleep pattern. Previously, I have tried Lamictal (resulted in itching and an acne like rash on chest), Trileptal (worked great but with side effect of dizziness and a feeling of slowed response time that affected my performance as an athlete), Seroquel (caused me to feel nervous and grind my teeth) and every antidepressant out there (all of which caused me to become manic).  So far Abilify earns a gold star with me.  Of course everyone is affected differently by any given drug as a result of our unique brain chemistry, but I would suggest to give this one a try if you are not 100% satisfied with your current medication(s).  I never thought I would find a drug that was so transparent to use. Good luck to all in the search for the right coctail.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40488

Although my 16 year-old son has only been taking Abilify for a short period of time, it appears to be a miracle drug.  He is taking it for Bipolar Disorder.  His outrageous aggressive behavior and sudden fits of rage seemed to be under control yesterday for the first time in years. Recently, he was court ordered to get residential treatment because he started getting into trouble with the law and refused to take medication; all I could see was him in prison off and on for the rest of his life. However, when I went to visit yesterday I could not beleive what I was seeing and hearing. For the first time in about 8 years I actually felt comfortable around him. I don't know how it will be later for him but I pray that he continues to experience the same results years from now.

abilify	Depression	2006-03-15 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	4.5	Abilify for intrusive thoughts Some people with depression have problems with intrusive thoughts and memories that are distressing.  Abilify helps me shake these off.  It also gives me more mental energy for sustained concentration at work.

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-03-15 00:00:00		3.0	0.5	5.0	2.5	Too many side-effects for me My theory on why this was effective for me as an anti-psychotic (anti-manic, really) is that basically it made me feel like I had the flu.  And on top of the flu, restless leg syndrome.  So, I didn't want to do anything (the anti-manic effect), but basically because I felt horribly sick, and yet I had to get up and pace because of the restless legs. Basically it was driving me crazy.  I was climbing out of my skin and could not concentrate whatsoever, so I had to stop.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39350
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-03-13 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.0	The switch turned on! I am bipolar 1 with mixed states, which is what Abilify is FDA approved for (mixed states).  Whether it's the histamine or the dopamine that Abilify targets (or both) all I can say is WOW where have you been all my life?  I was preparing for ECT when I decided to tritate off Seroquel and use Abilify hoping it would hold me over until shock treatments could begin. After the Seroquel was completely out of my system, literally almost overnight I felt so good, I held off on ECT and so far so good. I should note that I'm allergic to all anti-convulsants so my only recourse is the newer atypicals or ECT and I was at the end of my rope!Of course this is in addition to the other meds I take, Adderall, Buspar and Xanax, but those were on board before Abilify.  Since it's not recommended for any other type but mixed states I assume there's a good reason why?  It may have to do with the Seretonin factor since Abilify doesn't mess with it. If you're a mixed state, I'd gladly be the poster child for this drug and you just may too!  The only drawback is the cost.  A 3 month supply retails for over $1000.00 and as far as side effects, a slight headache and occasional muscle cramps are the worst of it for me. It beats the hell that is bipolar depression.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39142

I kept taking it and they got worse. After being on it for a month. I stopped taking it. The panic attacks stopped. I waited one week. This seemed IMPOSSIBLE to me. So to prove myself wrong I started taking it again. The massive panic attacks started AGAIN. I took it for another full month and had to endure the worst panic attacks I have ever had. I then stopped taking it. The panic attacks again STOPPED. I have NO idea why this drug did the OPPOSITE of what it was supposed to do,but did. I assume I am the only person out there who had this reaction to it. If there is anyone else out there, I'd love to know about it. In a funny way, having those massively intense panic attacks from the Abilify helped me overall. Now when I have a panic attack-compared to the ones I experienced then, they are NOTHING. lol Hope I am able to help someone out there with this blog.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/38710

I wasn't able to do that before. I still get manic, but not to the extreme I was before. In the combination of the 2 drugs I seem to be holding off the hallucinations and the voices pretty good. Overall I am extremley happy that after a year of doctoring with my new Pysch, we have finally found the best meds for me for the 1st time in 14 years.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/38605

abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2006-02-03 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	Works great, but worried about the weight. I recently switched from Risperdal 2mg to Abilify 10mg. My pdoc had me cross-taper the two medications over a two week period, and I have been on Abilify 10mg and completely off the Risperdal for a week now. So far, Abilify seems to be working very well in controlling the psychotic symptoms. The only real problem I am having so far is that Abilify doesn't seem to be as effective as the Risperdal in controlling my moods. I get upset/worked up more easily now, although not nearly as bad or as often as when I wasn't on any medication at all. With Risperdal, nothing could make me mad or upset. Everything was easy breezy, although I felt a little bit like a zombie (not emotions at all). The only reason I got off the Risperdal was because I had gained 62 pounds in a year on it. I went from 110 pounds to 172 pounds. I have read that abilify does not cause as much weight gain, so I am hoping to lose weight. However I have read all of the above responses and I see that one person did gain weight on it, so I am a little worried. Can anyone else offer their experience with weight gain/weight loss after taking Abilify?Update: I have been off of Risperdal and on just Abilify for almost three weeks now. So far I have lost 6 pounds. I hope I keep losing! I am also finding that it's starting to work better for my moods than it was in the beginning. I guess it takes awhile to really get going.Update: I have been on abilify for almost five weeks now, and have lost seven pounds. I had hoped that I would lose weight faster based on what I had lost in the first couple of weeks, but I guess seven pounds in one month isn't too bad. I forgot to mention before that although I had trouble sleeping in the beginning, that has pretty much gone away.Upadate: It has been about eight weeks since I have been off of Risperdal and on just Abilify, and I have lost ten pounds so far. That is without really exercising (I'm not working ye	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/33399

Speech and language improved drastically. He initiated conversations, used eye contact, self-stim dropped way down - he wasn't constantly talking out loud to himself. His aggression level dropped to near normal. His reading skills improved. It was almost like having a typical child. The rare side-effect that hit was loss of vision. There was short periods of partial and total vision loss, which he did not let us know about until he completely lost his vision. His vision did return in several days after stopping the medication. He did still have occasional loss of vision (could see shadows) for several months before it stopped completely. He was 14 years old so he was in the middle of puberty which changes everything anyway.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35984

Side effects were hard to handle in the beginning, particularly the nausea and drowsiness, but those go away after a week or so. One note-- ABILIFY AND EGGS DO NOT GET ALONG!!! For some reason, the drug interacts badly with eggs in my system, brining on rampant nausea and almost flu-like symptoms. Maybe not for others, but my husband and I are both on it for bipolar, and we both have the same reaction.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35818

However, I did not like it while I was on it, and had a feeling that it wasn't going to get much better.  I definitely felt more anxiety while taking it, and felt kind of weird...hard to explain, but just a little off somehow.  I also felt kind of dumb on it, slightly spaced out.   Could not think of words to say, which only added to my anxiety in social situations.  I didn't feel any positive mood stabilizing effect either for depression or hypomania, and like I said, made anxiety worse.  Granted, it may have gotten better over time...but I had a sense/feeling that it wasn't going to.

Plus I had trouble sleeping at night, I was restless. Not alert at all. Glad to be off it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/33716

I agree w/ the person who said to stop using antipsychotics on people who are not psychotic.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/33683

abilify	Depression	2005-11-25 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Excellent for My Depression I was on Zyprexa for 8 years and I slept all the time. I called in sick just so I could sleep. Saturdays and Sundays, I slept 20 hours each day. I had a ravenous appetite. I gained 20 pounds. My doctor took me off Zyrpexa and put me on Abilify 3 weeks ago and I feel great! No side effects whatsoever. I have my energy back. I feel so good, I stay up late everynight. Last weekend I went out Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I felt like I had been brought up by wolves in the wilderness. I am not used to being with people. It's wild! I take Abilify before I go to bed. I sleep great and wake up refreshed. I also am on Impramine (for 19 years) and Provigil. I am just thrilled with this drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/32505
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2005-11-24 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	3.5	0.5	welcome to Hell Abilify is by far the worst medication I have EVER been on...  It put me in a comatose state.  I could barely hold myself up.  I felt detached from my body in the most miserable way.  It also made my anxiety worse and is ridiculously expensive even with insurance!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/32461
abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2005-11-23 00:00:00		0.0	5.0	0.0	1.5	Just Awful!!!! This med was perscribed because I was unhappy about weight gain with Seroquel-well- it made me so edgy I couldn't sit still and all my mind blanked out-all thoughts and sense of humor. Way awful!! I have been off the stuff for about a year and don't ever intend of trying it again!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/32458

My personal experience may be different than others and by all means try what you can so you can get through this.  It makes me a little tired, a little unmotivated but I have to say the feeling of extreme anxiety and fear is gone.  I can't explain enough how this can help 'some' people.  I also take Wellbutrin and Lexapro with this so, all of them together make a huge impact.  :-)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31346
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2005-11-14 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	2.5	0.5	Worst med ever! This pill landed me in the hospital. I was fine (actually great) on it for about 3 months. Then I was stricken with the worst anxiety of my life - I was basically in a panic attack 24 hours a day non-stop. I also had severe tremors. I wound up in the hospital and the ER doctor told me that he saw the same thing happen to about 1/3 of all Bipolars on Abilify. He said it would take about 3 months to clear up and put me on a daily dose of Ativan to control the anxiety and Artane for the tremors. It was actually about 5 months before I was back to normal. Abilify wrecked my life and nearly cost me my job as a college instructor as well because I had such a hard time coping. Be VERY careful when taking this and go to the hospital immediately for any problems!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31245
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2005-11-14 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	Worked in 3 days I had been very reluctant to try an atypical antipsychotic for bipolar 2 disorder (mainly depressive episodes for me).  This med worked for me with more energy and motivation than I have had in years.  The only side effects I have noticed are tremor and increase jittery and anxiety (but I have always had anxiety problems).  To those reluctant as me to try an antipsychotic, I say try it!  It might be the miracle med that it's been for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31246

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2005-11-12 00:00:00		3.0	2.5	5.0	3.0	Abilify better than Seroquel I am Bipolar I, and was prescribed Abilify when it first came out to help control my outbursts of anger.  I had previously been on Seroquel, which you all may know will make you sleep your life away if you let it.  I don't believe Abilify works as well as Seroquel, but I cannot go any higher on the dose- I currently take 20 mg. 1 a day.  I was taking 30 mg but the muscles in my face began to lock up so we had to back down.  Not a pleasant thing to have happen.  But at least you don't gain weight and sleep all the time on Abilify like you do on other anti-psychotic medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31180

abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2005-11-09 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.0	My experience w/ Abilify &amp; BPD I have been BP w/ mixed symptoms (rapid cycling &amp; depressive states) for many,many years and have been on practically every antidepressant out there.I guess I fall into the category of BPNOS. I do become manic easily when all is good in my life,but if there are ANY little problems I suddenly turn and become depressed and can't handle any crisis or problems. Last Nov. 2004, I was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts during a depressive phase when the Dr's there changed my med's &amp; put me on Abilify. The drug changed my life, or should I say, saved my life. I no longer have those thoughts and am stable in my illness @ the moment. Although the medication is expensive, in my opinion it is worth every penny. I know it doesn't help everyone, but it has helped me w/ no side effects. No weight gain,no tremors,nothing. Even my 9y/o son is on it for his BP. w/ no side effects. I recommend the drug w/ Dr's approval of course as it has helped me tremendously.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35234
abilify	Depression	2005-11-05 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	2.5	0.5	Abilify made me manic I took Abilify at 5 mg. without any positive effects so my doctor raised my dose to 10 mg.  That made me get insomnia which caused me to repeat myself constantly--for some reason it effected my memory, and get manic.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29966
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2005-11-04 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	Working for me! So far so good after a few months taking it. My boyfriend and family have really noticed the difference in how normal I have been with out being sluggish or stupid like other drugs. Gives bit of anxiety but nothing over the top for me.     Have to always take it first thing in the morning to avoid insomnia while on it. In fact after this last month finally sleeping like a normal person again, around 8 hours a night and wake up feeling good.Thought I would mention that at one point was in a mixed episode, upped the dose from 5mg to 10mg and it ended. Never felt so much like myself.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30254

The only reason that I am no longer taking  it is due to my insurance company stopped covering the drug and it made it impossible to afford. ( on social security disability )This drug not only helped on my major mood swings but also felt less depressed when on it.I highly recommend Abilify to those who suffer from BP !!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29809

Before the Abilify, I was taking Risperdol with the rest of the cocktail and was still getting swings. Now, on 15 mg Abilify BID, I feel even-keeled for the first time EVER. The only side effects are a slight hand tremor that comes and goes and some minor weight gain, nothing too annoying.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23897

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2005-10-26 00:00:00		2.5	5.0	5.0	3.5	Not for me. Abilify was added to my treatment as an add on. I didn't really notice much difference after I stopped it and went to a higher dosage of lamictal. I stopped it because it was so expensive! My co-pay was much higher than any other prescription I've had. My doctor told me that I could use it occasionally if I felt I was having a bad day and might need it, I haven't used it at all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30294

Depakote worked for me for 9 years, but the dose had to be increased over time and I gained weight with each increase.  Abilify is nice that it is once a day.  Most people take it in the AM because it can be energizing, but I found out I had to take it at bedtime.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29189
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2005-10-20 00:00:00		2.0	1.0	3.0	2.0	Abilify did the opposite of what it's supposed to My doc prescribed abilify 5 mg once a day, and it gave me Extrapyramidial Syndrome, mainly restless legs and MORE anxiety than before. So I wouldn't recommend it for anxiety, but it could be a good drug for those with bipolar disorder. I just can't understand why a doc would try an atypical antipsychotic for anxiety. I think they get in trouble if they try a benzo as a first line of treatment, so they try everything else first, without a thought to the patient's well-being.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29119

I could not hardly move, I could not leave my house, felt like the walls were closing in and was afraid of everything. I have had panic attacks but this was way above and beyond a panic attack. These have never been symptoms of mine. This med put me very close to a psychosis being on them for just a week. I understand that everyone reacts differently but be very careful and observant with this one. I also, could not eat at all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29006
abilify	Depression	2005-10-13 00:00:00		5.0	0.0	5.0	3.0	Weight Gain!!!!!!!!!!!!! This drug did indeed &quot;Abilify&quot; me, but I started eating like a pig the day I started taking it. I have just lost 40lbs, and having serious back problems, I cannot afford to be carrying around extra weight. Otherwise I found it to be a great drug. I took it in the evening, and it helped me to sleep well, and woke up refreshed, and ready to go! But I was shoving food in my mouth constantly. Sorry I had to stop. Cymbalta is my drug now. It helps with weight loss. I'm not quite as active, but, it works best for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/28551

Unfortunately, it didn't help me a bit.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30680

I have tried this more than once just to be a &quot;good and compliant patient&quot;.  Everytime it's the same-----I am going 100mph in a comatose body.  I can't move, but the panic and anxiety feel like they will kill me and nobody will know.  Like being buried alive!!!!!  IF the prescribing Docs would have to try this medicine before writing the scipt---it would be taken off the market for sure.  This pill is pure torture.Politically, they are trying to make this their little darling, but the truth will come out.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/28065

This is an off-label use that is being tested for but for me it has made a lot of difference versus an anti-depressant alone.  I'd recommend at least talking to your doctor about it!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/27868

After a month or so, others noticed that the old &quot;me&quot; was back, that I was like I used to be.  On Zyprexa I was sedated, but not so with Abilify.  I truly feel normal and have for months.  I have some insomnia, but I'm not sure that it is related to Abilify. Otherwise no side effects for me. UPDATE:  After several months, Abilify was not working any longer.  I eventually stopped taking it, which even at 5mg was painful for about a week, hypomanic and jittery, but it all subsided.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19897

We put her on Abilify after a few years of Seroquel had caused her to gain too much weight.  Unfortunately, although her psydoc said many of his patients do well on Abilify, she was not one of them.  It seemed to be completely ineffectual.  She spent several months in a hypomanic state and wound up in the hospital this summer, where they took her off Abilify and started Geodon.  Since then we've seen her become amazingly focused and stable!  I only hope this continues.  Good luck to all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26812

I am taking (well took, to be precise, since I never want to take another dose again) 5mg aripiprazole in the morning as a mood stabilizer adjunctive to lamotrigine to prevent 'breakthrough' mood swings.Aripiprazole makes me feel weak, but restless. I feel a need to 'do something' but cannot concentrate on any task when I try to releive the urge. I feel a constant urge to sleep all the time, but have to get up and 'do something' whenever I attempt to get some rest. There is also a horrible sense of fatigue and of being 'drugged'.This, for me, has been a truly awful medicine. I think anyone giving this even to a dog should be prosecuted for cruelty!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25925

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2005-08-12 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.0	Abilify got me out of a bind and helped motivation 8/12/05:Abilify has continued to work well for my depression. It seems to synergize well with the Luvox (and maybe Lamictal) that I'm already taking. However, the dose was increased to 5mg/day since I was still having some residual feelings of guilt, self-conciousness, and anxiety. Another good thing is that I still have bunches of samples of Abilify left from a previous trial, so that makes it much more cost effective and economical.ORIGINAL:--------Several weeks ago, I was in a really severe depression (or mixed state). I was suicidal, had emotional pain, paralyzing fear, and my mind kept on getting 'stuck' on bad thoughts. I had to miss several days of work due to this. He prescribed some Seroquel (25mg tabs) in addition to my other meds, but it didn't seem to help me. On Friday that week, I got verbally abusive over the phone with a company for something when I was in the mixed state depression. That day, I thought about driving myself to the emergency room to get help as I was about to go crazy, but I happened to have leftover samples of Abilify from a previous trial. So, instead, I decided to take 1/2 of a 5mg tablet. A few hours later, my mind began to clear. Then overnight, the depression was better. I ended up going to work later the next morning! It was a miracle!!! I continued to take 2.5mg/day afterward. A little over a week later, I had a doctor's appointment, and my doctor officially put me on Abilify at 2.5mg/day in the morning (may possibly go to 5mg/day if ever needed). He also had prescribed Luvox for OCD along (currently at 100mg of that), and Lamictal dose was increased too. I'm now on Abilify 2.5mg, Lamictal 300mg, and Luvox 100mg for bipolar. I took Abilify another time last year with Depakote. But. dose was too high, and I had akathisia, insomnia, and many other side effects. I was taking 10mg/day. Now, at 2.5mg/day, I don't have the problems and side effects are minimal.

I spent the entire 6 months in a very nasty mixed state caused by the med (had been manic, um, thanks a lot).  Had lots of breakthrough psychosis (including command hallucinations).  It really disturbed my sleep and gave me nightmares.  And as if all that wasn't bad enough, it gave me flat out horrid akathisia - I looked like a stimulant fiend (couldn't even type or sit still).  Gotta be worst drug on the market.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30266

Neither of these had been symptoms I had ever had before. This drug scared me to death and I would never take it again. I currently take Geodon and it works well for me. Zyprexa made me fat and Lamictal made me sleepy.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25163

It's like restless leg symdrome but all over my body.  I stayed on it 5 weeks to see if the side effects would lessen and they didn't.  My psychiatrist took me off it and gave me Geodon instead which works much better and has few side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30253

Quit due to moving out of state and couldn't get it through local mental health, I acutally PAID 17.00 per pill on a ssdi income of 600.00 per month, so I must've thought it was pretty good. just tried symbyax and didn't manage the spacy tiredness too well.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24809

Abilify seemed to be working pretty well, but then I went to Johns Hopkins for yet another opinion and the psychiatrist there warned me about long term side effects - I think he mentioned tardive dyskinesia (spelling?).  He mentioned Lithobid again, but finally I went on Lamictal and I am happy with it ... finally some relief.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24647

I switched to Abilify after the negative effects of Geodon (see my review) were too much for me to handle any longer. I had taken one pill before I was up all night long hallucinating - posters on the wall were moving, talking to me, etc. I also experienced severe diarrhea and vomiting. I called my pyschiatrist the next morning and she told me to take it again. I ended up in the Emergency Room of my local hospital that night to make sure I was not dehydrated. I was given a shot to stop the nausea and some medication for the diarrhea. I am no longer taking Abilify.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24089

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2005-06-21 00:00:00		0.0	1.0	5.0	0.5	abilify This was Rx for my school aged child. It simply did not work. We started at 1.25 mg/d and side effects were large. He could not get through the day, very lethargic, laid his head on the table at lunch  he was so tired. Next he was an insomniac on it.  We tried it both AM and the PM-side effects either way. Also, he was always hot. Clearly this messed up parasympathetic control (BP, body temp). Besides intolerable side effects at a ridiculously low dose, Abilify worsened all the sx we were hoping to treat:  Volatility, behavioral rigidity, rage reactions all got worse.  Caution: 5-HTP supplement appears to amplify this medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23906

He would have night terrors and he would have loose stools from it but it worked. Meaning it settled him down from the being Manic.So we backed off to only 10mg in morning and added another in the same family and it seems to not have the night terrors anymore.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23878

I couldn't stop eating and although I watch what I eat the weight gain was tremendous. I also began smoking more which seems to happen to me with meds that affect dopamine. I didn't sleep and drove my house guests crazy by roaming the house all night. I did get a lot of artwork done. I was taking my 150mg Effexor XR for depression and my 20mg Topomax for migraines at this time too.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23504

Dr. cut me to 1/4 of a tab still side effects than i went to 1/4 of a tab every 3rd day and was working up to a 1/4 tab (1.25mg.) every day over several wk. period.  Agitation increased and i deceided this med. was too. strong for me-i quit it.Was also concerned about the diabetes risk as i am borderline diabetic-although i thought if this med. worked i would risk the diabetes connection.VERY STRONG MEDICINE-would start out on minimal dose.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22992
abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2005-05-16 00:00:00		1.0	1.0	5.0	1.5	Weight Gain and Mania I experienced about the same amount of weight gain on Abilify as Zyprexa. Also, it induced mania and mild hallucinations. I have Bipolar 4: Depression with drug-induced mania (rare/unheard of), and am very drug-sensitive, so my results are not typical, but bipolars should be aware. Definitely not the worst drug I have ever taken, but no great effect on my stabilization.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30097

Risperdal was nice for a little while, but caused me to have intolerable muscle cramps which naturally made me feel irritable and more depressed.  Abilify also caused me physical pain so I discontinued it after just a few weeks.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21152
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2005-04-11 00:00:00		1.0	0.0	0.0	0.5	Abilify made me Manic Very manic.  I should have been hospitalized, but my wife helped me through it.  I was on a very stable run for 2 months when I started Abilify to stop recurrent thoughts, which it did.  After about 2 or 3 weeks, I started to go really manic and after 1 month it was getting serious.  I was in an all out rage all day along with being angry and agitated.  I was not nice to be around.  After my pdoc stopped this medication, I came down off the mania in about 2 weeks.  We started Risperdal instead, which seems to be working so far.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31035
abilify	Anorexia	2005-04-05 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	4.0	Positive but has a few not-so-fun side effects I've been prescribed abilify after having more than a lot of trouble with other anti-psychotics and I must say that it really, truly does help with my anxiety and obsessive thoughts related to my eating disorder so I definitely would recommend it to others who have also had trouble finding a steady, stable, actually helpful drug in this major class of medications before, but I must warn you that it has a few side effects that aren't the greatest and don't make me so well...for example, occasionally I find myself dealing with rebound anxiety from the Abilify, a massive headache that sometimes becomes so awful that I have to take major painkillers to treat it, an upset stomach that gurgles and makes lots of unsettling noises and leads me to constipation and pretty bad vomiting, but other than all of those effects which incidentally don't occur THAT often, this medication seems to work pretty well and if you can handle the side effects, I'd strongly recommend it for the treatment of your anxiety, depression, and obsessiveness related to your eating disorder if you feel it'd work for you. I mean, I'd at least give it a try. Plus, it has less of a side effect of causing really bad weight gain unlike the rest of the anti-psychotics and I am perfectly well aware that is a MAJOR issue for those of us suffering from our diseases. So good luck to you all and I hope this information has helped you at least somewhat. Best wishes!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/20875

Prior to that he was using Zyprexa, which had numerous side effects and dulled his personality and creativity a lot.

I began to see improvement within 2 weeks- I was so excited to feel so &quot;normal&quot; and not groggy. Then, after about 2 months on it I began to have horrible anxiety. I usually have some anxiety anyway, but this was totally disabling. I was afraid to leave my house and when I had to I was convinced I was going to die!  It does say on the information sheet that the most common side effect is anxiety- happening with 25% of people who take it. It does work wonders for some people but it definitly wasn't for me!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30579
abilify	Depression	2005-01-23 00:00:00		4.0	2.5	5.0	3.5	Wonderdrug! I have been taking 1/2 of a 15 mg tablet of Abilify for about 2 weeks, and the change is amazing.  I feel better than I have for 3 years.  I also take Effexor, Desipramine, and Lamictal--but all of those together did nothing compared to the Abilify.  UPDATE: I was increased to 30 mg/day--and I could not concentrate at work, and seemed more irritable.  Am now adding Trileptal in response to this, and am back down to 5 mg every other day of Abilify (still taking Desipramine, Effexor and Lamictal--but am hoping to stop the 1st two.).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17456

My brain is on fire, but my body is...just here.

When I tried Abilify, the Dr. I had at the time (who dx me with every symptom but never said BP) only gave me 2.5mg at night. When I would take it my mind would race even more but my body felt paralyzed my husband actually had to carry me to bed a couple of times!! The Trileptal I tried did the same thing when I was only on 75mg it did almost the same thing.  My new Dr. said it was way too low.  I'm on 600mg now and doing better but need to be bumped up again.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17873
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2005-01-01 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	*WAS* a great med for me! I was on 40mg at bedtime, although I needed Cogentin with it to sleep.  That aside, I found Abilify to be an awesome med for me! I was on it for Bipolar. I did get shaky a lot, however Cogentin controlled it. It turned out to be worth taking an extra med(Cogentin). It controlled my BPD quite well, my mood was almost rock stable on it. I was on it from Nov. to Sept., and once off of it, everything went downhill from there. Unfortunately, in Sept., I developed what is called Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome...a RARE, near fatal reaction to neuroleptics - which are anti-psychotics. Obviously, it wasn't fatal for me! But, you can't go back on the med you were on when it happened. And they don't know why it happens. They also have to be really careful if you want to try any neuroleptics in the future. I've tried 2, and so far OK. But all I can say is that I &quot;mourn&quot; Abilify!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17806
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2004-12-24 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	I Had to Rate Abilify for Depression/Anxiety... Despite rating this drug under bipolar depression (a while ago), I simply had to toss in a review for Abilify and depression/anxiety.  This drug, in combination with others, has changed me dramatically, just recently!  And I notice a couple of distinct observations about the med.First, it would seem that Abilify works quickly (or else not at all) in cases where little else has worked, speaking of depression and/or anxiety.  It would also seems that those of us for whom it works suffer from multiple disorders.Secondly, it seems to work where and when the SSRI's fail - hey, maybe when everything else fails.  Why?  I don't know except that it has something to do with dopamine and serotonin balancing.  All I can tell you is that it's made a significant change in my life and my personality when taken in combination with other meds, specifically for the depressive component of major psychological disorders.  Just now I find myself confronted with the holidays.  And as many of you know, this is the most stressful and depressing time of year for us.  It takes all our strength, it makes us feel helpless and hopeless around family, and it's just not the great experience that most folks enjoy.  Well, I can say with some degree of confidence that this is the first time in a long time I've felt capable of dealing with holiday stress!  The only thing to which I can attribute it is Abilify.I have been taking a small dose of this med in combination with my other cocktail for about a month now, and have reserved judgment until now.  The results from my personal experience are great.  In fact, it worked so quickly that I was astounded (about 3 days).  I tapered and discontinued my SSRI, I reduced the amount of other medication I take by at least 1/2, and I feel really blessed to have this miracle drug available, despite the very expensive cost.As far as side-effects, well I have noticed more energy, as in it is simul	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/37052
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2004-12-15 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	cured my impulsive speech I am so grateful that I was prescribed this drug. After several weeks of researching it, I finally convinced the doc to let me try it. I am dx'd BPI and have had trouble in the past with blurting out all sorts of things. Also, my racing thoughts did not help matters, either. Enter Abilify and I feel I've been &quot;cured.&quot; Also, I can actually cut the 5mg's in half and get results.At first it was difficult to time the dosage. For example, if I took it too early in the evening, I woke up ready to go at 3am. It was like the drug only allowed a 5-6 hour sleep. But, after two weeks of having this sleep issue it seemed to even out. Now I take it at 9pm and wake up ready to go at 6. Abilify allows me a full, productive day with no sleepiness---no napping, which is amazing since before I began treatment I took 3 hour naps every day.Since beginning treatment, my impulsive speech is gone completely. My racing thoughts are gone. And as an added benefit so are my migraines. This last benefit I have not heard from any other users.Cost is an issue with this med. I am fortunate to have insurance. I would recommend for anyone having difficulty affording this med to ask their physician how to get on a pharmaceutical program to obtain it free or at a reduced cost. Abilify is definitely worth a try.Sybilla	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30588

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2004-11-29 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	5.0	4.0	Abilify is worth a try Abilify has virtually cured my Bipolar 1.  Like Geodon, I think it has some of its own mood stabilizing and anti-depressant qualities in addition to its effectiveness in treating acute mania, paranoia, hallucinations, etc.  If Geodon has been working well for you, but want to try something different, I suggest abilify. The main, and really only, side effect that I have with it is very strange sleep disturbances.  But they do get better with time (2&gt; months).  I have learned that every single person reacts drastically different to antipsychotics.  Zyprexa turned me into an absolute zombie.  For other people Zyprexa is the miracle drug. Abilify is my miracle drug, but maybe, abililfy will turn you into a zombie.  But I think it's worth a shot if your current cocktail isn't doing the trick.  Like any drug, don't immediately discard it because of its side effects.  They all have side effects.  You have to brave through them for a while if you really want to find an effective treatment for your disorder.  UPDATE:  Maybe it's just me, but careful taking zyban/wellbutrin on this stuff.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30897

I read all about the partial dopamine agonism, thinking my dopamine receptors needed to be partially agonized.  I really couldn't stand more than 3 weeks on this drug, and I pride myself in thinking I'm a trooper with side effects.  I felt really energized and great within the first three days.  After that, I experienced profound anxiety.  It felt like someone had walked up behind me and said--&quot;BOO!&quot;--only ALL OF THE TIME.  I couldn't sit still, couldn't listen, type, etc.  I described it to my doctor as mania, although he doesn't believe it to be so.  So I've decided to go back to good ol' Risperdal, which has worked very well for me in conjunction with 750mg Depakote.  It has abated about 85% of my bipolar II symptoms, and allows me to sleep and eat.  (I tried Abilify in the hopes of getting rid of the 15% left).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/15508

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2004-08-09 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	5.0	3.0	Fantastic!!!...at first. I started Abilify in Sept/03, during a particularly severe depressive episode. I was simply amazed at how fast in knocked out my most major symptoms like the constant crying, s*icidal thoughts, aud/viz hallucinations, hopelessness, inability to get out of bed and so on. I literally felt better within days. Unfortunately, as the weeks/months went on I started sleeping less and less, experienced a dramatic increase in anxiety, and became very agitated and constantly hungry. For me it had a very zoomy, stimulating rather than the typical sedating effects of the other antipsychotics. I have since learned that insomnia, anxiety and agitation are the most common adverse reactions to Abilify.On another negative note, although it is said to be weight neutral, I have gained 25# since being on this drug. Although all of our systems differ, my advice if you want to give it a whirl...start at the lowest dosage (5mg) titrate up very slowly, and always take it in the a.m. to lessen the likelihood of insomnia.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14596

I was very afraid to stop Lamictal cold turkey and suspected that I would have the same side-effect with Abilify than with Seroquel (which worked very well too) : oro-facial dyskinesia and strong dystonia. But after two weeks, I'm feeling very happy with this medicine: it has quite the same properties than the both mentioned above; I feel even more stimulated (it made me pace the first days). It cuts down my up and lows, my anger/impulsivity and makes me very &quot;awake&quot;. The only side-effects I have and that tend to subside are: cramps in the legs and sweating.My cocktail is now the following:         Aurorix 1200 mg/d (moclobemide)         Keppra 3000 mg/d (levetiracetam)         Permax 0.75 mg/d (pergolide)         Abilify 10 mg/d (aripiprazole)         Omegabrite 4 caps/d (omega3)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30310

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2004-07-03 00:00:00		3.5	2.5	5.0	3.0	Could be better I found Abilify to be almost a miracle drug at first -- it brought me out of a mixed episode almost overnight.  However, the weight gain issue has been just as bad for me as it was with Zyprexa.  My doctor continues to insist that Abilify does not cause weight gain, but I am proof that it can.  When I am not taking atypicals, my metabolism is naturally very high.  I continue to balloon up.  My other concern is that I don't quite feel the effectiveness that I felt when I first began taking Abilify.  It initially had a very energizing effect and controlled my moods (definitely take it in the morning) but have since suffered with severe anxiety.  I have just been given Neurontin in addition to try to take care of this.This drug definitely has benefits, but I don't think it's for me anymore.  I hope to be free of it soon.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30214

Abilify has been wonderful with the 'negative symptoms' of bipolar, such as not wanting to be social, not wanting to clean up, take care of personal hygiene, etc.  My thinking is clearer and I'm making better decisions.  I have had some trouble with sleepiness but am currently adjusting the dose to decrease that.  I am so glad that there is a medication that works and does not cause havoc with my blodd chemistry like Respirdal did (i had inccreased blood sugar and trigylerides which subsided after switching meds).

abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2004-06-30 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	A Year Later Just started yesterday, very hopeful, supposed to be different, we'll see......My Dr. seems convinced it will take the place of Geodon and Paxil in my case (Schizo Affective/Bipolar) Tried everything else.....It has  been a week, and I have noticed a big change, although I was just upped from 15mgs/day to 30 mgs/day yesterday, to counteract an intense manic episode. I was simultaneously taken off Paxil which seems to have been contributing to the mania, so I can't be sure if I'm calm because of the Abilify or because I'm off the Paxil..I have noticed though, that I seem to have 'grown a smile'--my sense of humor has greatly improved and I am thinking clearly--nice change!.....It's been a  month and the metamorphosis continues...Amazingly, I am not even slightly manic, as  a matter of fact I am extremely calm and collected. I'm not thinking &quot;unreality&quot; thoughts(halleluia!) and don't seem to be self-castigating or self-recriminating, which is a big difference. I haven't noticed ANY negative side effects, and would recommend this to those who have tried everything, as well as those who don't want to go through trying everything. The doctor has put me on Lamictal for the residual depression. [It seems silly to consider this a symptom, but] I hadn't had the inclination to clean my place in eons, and depression has been ever-present most of my adult (and teenage) years, so we thought it was important to short-circuit any leanings in that oh-so-familiar direction. Btw, I am incrementally dosing up on the Lamictal to avoid that pesky  life-threatening rash, thanks to what I've read on this valuable site. 6/30/04...Well.......Now it's been a year and because of a combination of factors I can confidently say I'm in recovery! Abilify, especially, has been a big factor in my recovery--and I luckily have No Side Effects and have continued to lose weight--after all the bloating meds I've been on over the years, THAT is a welcome plus!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31307

Within an hour, I had a fever and was vomiting and close to fainting. I felt like this for roughly 28 hours. It was horrid. I notified him right away, and he switched me to Geodon, so we'll see how that goes. It's been a long time since a drug has made me this sick.

Increased it to a whole 10mgs Abilify and went back to giving it at bedtime since she complained of being tired all day long when taking it in the morning. She refuses to eat breakfast, skimps on lunch at school but seems to want to eat all afternoon and evening once she gets home from school. This has become a problem since she gained 30# while taking seroquel and risperdal. She's not lost one ounce of the excess weight from those trials and she is tired overall and won't exercise, either. Taking naps for a couple hours after school. Her mood is somewhat fuzzy and she has little motivation to study schoolwork. She describes herself as &quot;lazy&quot;. That is a change from being so &quot;hyperactive&quot; as she was before but she is not any less irritated by life in general. Not sure if we will continue much longer on Abilify OR depakote.

I have been diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features, social anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder. On the Seroquel alone at 800mg I felt so spacey, not myself, but when they cut it to 400mg and added the 10mg Abilify, I started feeling more like myself the first day, and I had a little bit more energy.  I am not sleeping as much, even though I get up 2-4 times a night.  I feel sort of tired during the day, but I'm hoping that after tomorrow, when I cut the Seroquel out for good, I will feel more alert.  Hopefully it won't turn into akithasia.  I've read that a lot of people get that with the abilify.  I'll come back and update in a few days when I'm off the Seroquel.  Also, I'd like to add that when I took the Abilify in the AM, I felt sleepy, although that might have been from the Seroquel, I'll try it again when my Seroquel is discontinued tomorrow.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12018

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2003-11-04 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	Abilify after a week Mainly I've felt tired but couldn't sleep well.  It's weird.  Plus I've been dizzy.  And my appetite is way down.  But it seems to control my irritability and paranoia.  Maybe with time the sleep problem and dizziness will subside.  I've only been on it a week.  I gave up Zyprexa for this stuff because I had gained lots of weight.  I've already lost some weight, either 4 or 6 pounds, I forgot which it was.  So I can be happy that my unhealthy weight is going down.  (And Zyprexa gave me a bad triglyceride count, so I hope that'll go down too)  So far Abilify is doing what Zyprexa did except for helping me sleep...I hope that changes.  In time I'll update this to fill you in on how things are going.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9260
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2003-10-04 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Abilify For years before taking Abilify I had trouble with noises: people talking, radios, tv's and voices.  The problem was that they did not have any ownership.  It was not a big enough problem to interrupt my actions or day but it often got my attention and disturbed me.  None of this has taken place since taking Abilify.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31846
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2003-10-04 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	4.0	Parent review for Abilify I suggested Abilify to my son's PCP after researching for a medication to help him with his bipolar disorder and his inability to remember to take too many pills a day.  He is also not good with having bloodwork.  Abilify was difficult for him at first - he was very thin (117lbs 5'8&quot;)and lost more than 12 lbs.  He was shakey and had sort of fainting spells (his description - he does not live at home). After a few weeks of his depression getting worse he had Paxil(20mg)added.  Still he was not much better.  We actually cut his Abilify from 10mg to 5mg (with Psychiatrist recomendation) and he is more stable.  Not great but also not depressed and was not self abusive any more.  So Abilify with Paxil is working for now.  He had been on MANY different medications over several years - antidepressants, mood stabilizers, etc.  He was doing fairly well until he went away to college and decided he was cured - plus he could not remember when to take what medication.  1 year without treatment showed him differently.  So for now he seems better - yes even he thinks so.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/8587
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2003-09-18 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	1.0	2.0	MAOI interaction I had an MAOI interaction with abilify (I take parnate). This is NOT a recognized problem (yet) and my doctor reported it to the drug company. That was pretty scary for me. Also, I had to have this compounded into 1 mg capsules by my pharmacist, which greatly added to the cost of this already expensive medication.Because it made me sick, I never had a chance to evaluate its effectiveness. It's difficult for me to sort the side effects from the MAOI interaction, but I think it made me hyper, took away my appetite, gave me akathesia from time to time, and made it hard for me to concentrate. Only antipsychotic other than risperdal that didn't make me somnolent, though, so I was able to take it during the day rather than just at night.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30644
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2003-09-14 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Very Encouraged I have taken Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Geodon in that order, since 1992. My symptoms have included depression, low energy, anxiety, dread of almost any event, and to some extent aggressive feelings. I stopped taking Celexa in Dec.2002, because of weight gain. I began Geodon in June 2003, with good results. Then after approx. 1 month on Geodon, I began having heart palpitations. I reduced the Geodon until August, when I ceased taking it. The heart palpitations are gone. I began taking Abilify one week ago. I take 5 mg daily. I have had no side effects. There has been a &quot;lifting of my mood&quot;. I am encouraged by the benefits to my sense of well being. I will update this review in about a month.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/8287
abilify	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	2003-09-09 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	2.5	3.5	Works for me so far....      I had been on Seroquel to help me with OCD and generalized Anxiety but could not tolerate the sedation, so my doctor switched me to Abilify.  This drug seems to work very well overall.  The biggest side effect is a feeling of being extremely wired, which gradually melts away after a few weeks ( in the mean time, it might be a good time to build that deck you've been planning:) ).  I gave it a low ease of use score because I find myself having to splt a tiny pill into 4 pieces in order to get the dosage right (in otherwards, splitting a 10 mg pill into 4 roughly 2.5 mg pills).  My pharmacist says that 5 Mg pills are now availible, however.    Since switching I have been having trouble sleeping at night, but I have had problems with insomnia all my life and I think they were just being &quot;quelled&quot; by the Seroquel.  We are now trying Ambien for the insomnia (another story!)     Overall, I think this is probably the best drug I have tried yet for my OCD and generalized anxiety, although I have only been on it a few weeks...	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29838

It had a totally opposite effect. I literally felt as if I weredragging lead weights. I couldn't even drive because my arms were too weak.

I have battled the buldge with Zyprexa for quite a while, and Abilify was supposed to be the end all solution.  I was so disappointed when it made me violently ill.

I started on abilify b/c my psych. thought this might be a good med. to help me with my anxiety, agitation and irritability along with my other meds, which are lamictal and topomax. Oh well, this just wasn't meant to be. After the first night I took abilify, the next morning I woke up nauseous. The nausea subsided but then the restlessness (akathesia: I think that's what it's called)set it. I could not sit down, I was constantly pacing around my house. I sat in a swivel chair spinning around until my sister thought I would unscrew it. Yet, another disappointing medication experience. Although, I do know people who have had a great experience with it. You just never know...	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/34788

Abilify is supposed to be relatively side effect free, but boy did I hit the jackpot on all of the possible ones!  While taking Abilify, I was extremely restless.  I could not sit still for a minute, I had to get up and jump up and down!  I could not sleep, partially due to the restlessness, and it just seemed to give me insomnia.  For the first several days of taking it, I was vomiting and feeling nauseated.  This pill was terrible for me, I could not wait to get off it.  It helped my paranoia though, but unfortunately the side effects were too much to bear.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31698

I have more energy and feel more alert. Other than the headaches and nausea the first few days, I really haven't noticed any other side effects!

accutane	Acne	2007-10-09 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	4.0	I was on Accutane 15 years ago.  The side-effects were horrible - every part of my body was incredibly dry and cracked.  I was very depressed but I thought it was due to the acne (I would call in sick because I didn't want anyone to be repulsed by my face) and the dryness I experienced with the medication.  Within a few months, nothing mattered other than that my skin was clearing up.  I was on the Accutane for six months and, since then, I have had less than five flare-ups (meaning a pimple that is gone the next day).  My advice - make sure your dermatologist refers to the iPledge Program and follows the instructions to the letter.  If you are unsure about anything or have any questions/concerns, talk to your doctor before taking the medication!  Depression can be a major complication - and the defects to a fetus can be horrendous and devastating.  With that said, I would take Accutane in a heartbeat if it became necessary again...	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56724
accutane	Acne	2007-02-08 00:00:00		4.0	2.0	4.0	3.5	Treat yourself I've had acne since I was 25 and was able able to control it with oral antibiotics and differn.  It improvd a lttle as I got older, but never went away.  I finally found a sympatheic Derm who agreed to put me out of my misery and prescibe Sotret.  He calls it a miracle drug and I just hope he's right.  So far things have been good w/ just small, surface pimples that go away quickly and don't scar.  Don't be afraid!!  I had post-partum depression after my second pregnancy, and went through a short period of treatment w/ Paxil.  I felt no signs of depression during Sotret therapy.  My hair looked awesome and my body felt great (I work out a lot).  Just be aware of the worsening.  It was crazy and painful, but it only lasted about 6 weeks.  Just go to your Derm a lot for injections.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54258
accutane	Acne	2006-11-17 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	4.5	4.0	good while it lasted I took this drug for a few months, and it pretty much cleared up ALL my acne.  I had tried every cream and treatment before accutane.  I had acne pretty bad, on my chest, face, and back.  The only bad part was having to do blood tests once a week (I think?).  Of course this drug is known to cause bad birth defects so don't take it if you're planning on getting pregnant!  I was going to continue taking this medication but my triglycerides went up a bit too far and so my doctor took me off of it.  So now it's 2 years later and my acne has partially come back...so I think that's because I got off too early.  Also I'm still 18 so I'm still acne prone.  I recommend this medication but be careful with it and don't go off too early if you can avoid that.Also I wanted to mention that this medication made me gain weight (or that weight gain might've been from the birth control I had to take while on the medication).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52771
accutane	Acne	2006-09-23 00:00:00		4.0	2.0	3.5	3.5	The long journey with Accutane I started using Accutane my Sophomore year of high school (2001).  Back then, I do not think there was a 6-month limit on dosing.  I have used it on and off, and am now on the last month of my current dosing.  I have probably taken the stuff cumulatively for 3 years.My acne had never reponded to traditional treatments: salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, differin, antibiotics.  Retin-A was somewhat effective.  Each time I took accutane, my face would get worse the first 2 weeks, then gradually get better.  Every time I stopped taking it, 1 month later my acne was back in full swingSide effects were usually noticeable the first week.  The worst of them initally was the CHAPPED LIPS.  I always carry Carmex with me, now.  After stopping treatment my lips stay chapped for a few months, but gradually get better.One day during Freshman year of college (2003-2004) I decided I wanted to increase to 80mg/day.  The doctor said OK.  Within 2 weeks I had blood on the stool.  I immediatley stopped!Currently I am taking 40mg and 80mg, alternating every day.  The risk of rectal bleeding is still there (it happened a few times) but as long as I drink a lot of water and take some milk of magnesia once in a while, it's not usually a problem.  My face, right now, is as clear as it has ever been in my life since I've had facial acne.  My back has cleared up by about 50% (which is a major improvement).  I rarely have breakouts.  However I am about to complete this 6-month period, and wonder what lies in the future.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49982
accutane	Acne	2006-09-03 00:00:00		4.0	0.0	5.0	3.0	acne free for 5 years Well Accutane had its side effects.. And like many others have said the cracked lips - bloody noses were probably the worst.  I had a very strange incident with the accutane that I have about an inch and a half long pocket of puss along my cheek area just below the top layer of skin.. it looked absolutely horrific.. My skin was good for about 5 years.  and then it all came back.. They tried to get me to take it again and I refused.  My mother insisted it ruined my skin because of the scarring that was left after the acne.  The cost without insurance is extremely high.  But easy to take twice a day and in the packet as it unfolds lists about 20 side effects and warnings.  This is a very serious drug.  and pregancy is out of the question.  and would consider waiting a long time after treatment to think about having a child.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48745
accutane	Acne	2006-08-24 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	Worked well, no problems No side effects noticed at all.  It wasn't quite magic in its effectiveness, but did make a big improvement.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48246
accutane	Acne	2006-06-29 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Expensive but worth every penny The most annoying side effect of accutane was the dry lips.  My lips would chap and split very easily, and I was dilligent about using chapstick.  It helped to dry out my oily skin, and my cystic acne was gone.  The best thing is that it was gone for at least over a year after I took it.  After about a year after stopping, I started getting acne again but nowhere near as severe as I originally had.  I did not experience any depression or suicidal thoughts while on accutane.  I have not had any long term side effects that I have noticed.  I haven't tried to have kids yet, and I don't think it should be a problem, especially since it was so long ago now.  If cystic acne is ruining your life and you've taken antibiotics and tried every cream in the pharmacy, this is the right drug for you.  Unrelated to myself, a girl I went to high school with had such bad acne, her acne had acne.  She tried everything under the sun, and the only thing that worked was a combo of topical treatment plus accutane.  I'd be willing to bet that accutane saved her life, because she was extremely depressed because of her skin condition.  The only thing that stinks about accutane is that it is very expensive, and some insurances won't cover it because they do not consider it medically necessary.  Until a generic comes out, cost is going to be an issue for people trying to choose an acne medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/45338
accutane	Acne	2006-05-09 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	Severe Acne treated I had lost hope that I would ever find that medicine that would help me get rid of my acne. I was diagnosed with acne vulgaris, and took three types of antibiotics, and some hormonal pills in hope that the acne would disappear. My doctor finally put me on Accutane, and it has done wonders. Everyone has been shocked at how my face looks now, after only 6 month of being on the drug. Of course I have to deal with the side effects such as continuous dryness of mucous tissue, and being really careful not to get pregnant. However I have not had any new pimples in more than 3 months.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/27973
accutane	Acne	2006-04-08 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	Accutane RUINED my life!!!!! What a MISTAKE I made taking accutane! A few months into treatment I started developing food allergies/wheezing and frequent urination! My doctor kept telling me that there was no way Accutane was causing this! WELL....years after taking it I am still plagued with several food allergies/sensitivities and I have been diagnosed with a very painful disease called interstitial cystitis. The accutane DESTROYED the lining of my bladder and now I live in pain!!! It feels like battery acid was poured on my bladder when I eat basically anything...with a few exceptions. I now am a chronic pain patient with a rare disease that developed during accutane treatment. OH...and I still have acne. Accutane is NOT worth the risks. I have met several people that developed bladder diseases and bladder bleeding while on Accutane.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40735
accutane	Acne	2006-03-19 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	3.0	4.5	amazing results This is what cured me of my cystic acne.  It was the last resort, but I have amazing skin now.  I had to stay on it a bit longer than the recommended time, but it worked and I have been acne free for a couple years now.  The only downside was it really dried my skin out as well as my lips.  I was constantly putting on lotion and chapstick.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39673
accutane	Acne	2005-10-07 00:00:00		4.0	2.5	3.5	3.5	Accutane also for hydradenittis supportiva Accutane is a very effective medication in spite of all the side effects.  I understand the need for the strict packaging but for an adult with arthritis in my hands, just opening those packages was very difficul and sometimes very frustrating.  My doctor is now refusing to use Accutane due to increased reports of possible liver damage - now she plans to use Cleomyacin instead (a wide spectrum powerful antibiotic) before she prescribed the cleomyacin with the acutane - I am praying that I do not have another attack of hydradenittis supportiva	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/28306
accutane	Acne	2005-08-11 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	4.5	3.5	Accutane-best last resort I'd always had mild acne,  but nothing that was not controlled with over the counter products.  My face progressively got worse through college until my face exploded into severe cystic acne (we're talking cysts on top of cysts here) after I turned 20. I tried various treatments with little to no success--birth control, retin-a, topical and oral antibiotics, etc.  People I didn't even know remarked on how painful my face looked.  It was very inflamed and red and just ick.  Eventually my dermatologist put me on Accutane and it was a miracle.  People were remarking on how clear my face was,  I was in heaven.  I know accutane is very controversial but I never really experienced any severe side effects.  I wasn't depressed,  actually I'd never been happier.  With a good moisturizer and proper skin care regime my face was not too dry.  One drawback to Accutane,  it is very pricey.  Mid-way through my treatment I went off my parents insurance due to age and we paid out of pocket.  It was over $600 for one month of accutane so we ended up ordering it from Canada.  There is a program for low-income people to get accutane,  but I didn't qualify.  3 years later though my face is starting to break out here and there... but I think that is more related to diet and lack of exercise than anything.  If you've tried everything under the sun with no results,  Accutane may be a good option.  Despite its controversial nature,  I would do it again in a heartbeat. For people really disheartened by their acne it can be life changing.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25238
accutane	Acne	2005-08-03 00:00:00		5.0	2.0	5.0	4.5	Worked wonders! I had SEVERE acne as a teen, and accutane was a miracle for me. Over a year and a half, my acne problems disapeared. I'm still left with scars from the severe acne on my back, but no longer have the zit problem!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25101
accutane	Acne	2005-06-26 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	3.5	4.5	Highly Recommended I started on accutane when I was 16-17 years old.  At the time I was severely depressed by my acne.  I'd have to say that getting on the medicine was the single best thing I had ever done.  In retrospect, I remember that it caused severe dry skin but on the same note, it was this dry skin that allowed me to see that my acne was going away.  For months after I finished the three month treatment, my skin kept getting better and better.  I am now 22 years old and I have a small breakout here and there, but the important thing is that it is always controllable by regular means (before Accutane I dreamed of being one of the lucky ones for whom Stridex and Oxy actually worked.  I'd weight the risks and benefits with a doctor.  If your acne is not that bad, then I would not recommend treatment with accutane.  I tried it again when I was 18 for a breakout, and immediately quit taking it.  I realized that it wasn't bad enough and therefore the side effects were not worth it.  Effective remedies tend to have cons that one must deal with, accutane is no different.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24253
accutane	Acne	2005-06-24 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	Accutane works, on your face I took accutane 20 years ago and it cleared up the acne on my face almost totally. It had no effect on my back, however.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24183
accutane	Acne	2005-06-24 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	2.5	3.0	Worked pretty darn well I took Accutane (amnesteem) for 9 months. I started on 30mg 1x a day, then increased to 2x a day. It really cleared up my skin a lot, and I have barely had even one pimple, blackhead, or whitehead since going off of it. My skin is much less oily as well. The negative side of this was the side effects, and they were TERRIBLE. My lips, eyes, face, and inside of my nose were dry for the entire course of the treatment. I had to constantly put vaseline in my nose or eyedrops in my eyes. I also got severely depressed, but then again I have always been depressed so its hard to say which it was. And towards the end of the treatment I started to get a ringing in my ears, which went away once I stopped taking it. All in all it was worth the side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24147
accutane	Acne	2005-06-05 00:00:00		3.5	0.0	1.0	2.0	Accutane Should never be used for hearing impaired acne sufferers. Hearing loss is a real issue.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23366
accutane	Acne	2005-05-18 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	4.0	Very effective shame about the side effects. I'm on my second course of roaccutane, having had some spots return 12 months after my first course.  The first month can be tough side effects wise, not just because it can be uncomfortable, sore skin and lips, itchy eyes, but mainly because of the effects on your appearance - very red lips, peeling and flaky skin, red raw areas that are hard to cover with make-up.  But it gets better - after a month the side effects become less severe and with good products you'll be able to disguise the side-effects pretty effectively (see below).The only other major bind is that it increases the toxicity of alcohol by over-working your liver, which means a serious reduction in alcohol tolerance, horrendous hangovers, combined with the stress your giving your liver you need to really restrict your alcohol or cut down altogether.The upside is it works, although spots can come back, they will not be as severe and you can have multiple courses until they disappear for good.To minimize side effects I recommend a good lip balm such as nivea with sunscreen, or lancome juicy tubes for the ladies. Some good quality moisturizer (I recommend decleor aromessence angelique oil followed by their nutri-delice moisturizor), or if you're in the sun Elemis essential day cream has sunscreen in it.  You also need to exfoliate regularly to remove the dead skin, but most bead based exfoliants are too harsh for your hyper-sensitized skin.  I recommend using a muslin cloth to remove your cleanser.  Both Eve Lom, and Liz Earle cleansers are excellent products designed for use with and supplied with muslin cloths.To cover up Prescriptives foundations are the best, as is their Camouflage cream.Isotretinoin is available on the NHS, don't know the cost privately.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22901

acetaminophen-codeine	Migraine	2004-12-11 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Eeehhh...  It's okay. I have used Tylenol III for years as a supplement when I have had little nagging migraines that just wont go away.  Normally the Zonegran takes care of them but occasionally one will leak through.I have had much better luck with Panlor.  It is far and away better that Tylenol III.  It is more expensive since there is no generic. There is some slight chemical difference in the two mostly the Panlor has a bit of caffeine in it.  The codeine is a bit different in some way  hey  Im not a chemist.  I just know its much more effective.  Strange thing is it has less codeine in it.The usual codeine side effects apply to both.  We all know how they feel.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17555

acetaminophen-codeine	Endometriosis	2004-11-06 00:00:00		3.0	3.0	5.0	3.0	Tylenol with Codeine Before I switched to Lortab, I tried Tylenol #4 (and previously, Tylenol #3 from a few different doctors).  The pain relief was minimal, although it did make me a bit goofy (which helped me feel better, even if I still hurt).  Unfortunately, codeine seems to make me *quite* nauseous, so I wind up having to lie down... so it doesn't help me to function much.I did find it was somewhat less constipating than Lortab/Vicodin, which is a bonus.  However, the effectiveness seems to wear off VERY quickly with this particular drug -- after 2-3 days, it's not working at all anymore.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16651

This particular medication helps but enough to only take the pain down from a 8 to a 7. Moderate to severe pain is supposed to be relieved? Each person is different, that's true. The only problem with having surgeries as a kid and taking pain meds since then is now a high tolerance to most commonly prescribed medications.  This Norco 7.5/325 just doesnt cut it.	-

acetaminophen-hydrocodone	Pain	2011-09-26 00:00:00		4.0	0.5	1.0	0.5	I had horrific pain for weeks from a anal fissure and the doctor did a sphincterotomy on me.  Even though the surgery helped me a lot, my pain went from horrific down to terrible.  She prescribed hydrocodon-Acetaminophen 5-325 for which I was to take 1 to 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed.This is a nasty drug.  After taking the first tablet, I develope a headache, pressure in my ears, sounds amplified, nausea and awful light-headedness...but my surgical pain went away.  The half tablet was just as bad.  I learned if I cut the tablet into thirds, I can sort of tolerate a third of it.I don't normally take any drugs, and so this drug is very hard on me.  I will continue taking it for another day or two until then stop taking it.After reading other people's reviews, it looks like I'm the only one who has been affected so adversely by the awful drug.	-

I had shingles and I was taking 8-12 per day for almost a year it was getting harder to get them the doctors were getting begining not to believe I was in such pain. A pharmisist pointed out to me that I was probably addicted and my reply was that I am in so much pain.  She said the drug may be enhancing the pain so you will take more of it.  She suggested that I should detox and see if the pain is less and I did It was horrible but after about 3 days I realized that a lot of the pain I was feeling was much less.  It took awhile for me to recover and that was 6 months ago.  I still have chronic pain and I take 2 to 3 per day now but no more than that and it really helps.	-

Plus it made me sick as a dog! I had all the less severe side effects! Plus after reading the hospital was not suppose to give this to me anyways b/c ppl who has has gallbladder problems are not suppose to take this. I didnt know this until after I looked this up.

Do the research.Recommendation is now to take it for 14 days in a row, and no more.Apparently it does such a effective job, that, with the lack of acid in the stomach, the calcium and minerals do not get broken-down to be delivered to the bones.If you have taken this for more than three months and find that you have back pain or some type of bone pain, be aware and concerned.

My gastrointerologist gave me several different &quot;PPI's&quot; to try. When they all failed he gave me some samples of Aciphex and I haven't had reflux since. LOVE this little pill!!!   My insurance considers it an &quot;Out-of-network&quot; medication and my co-pay is about $70 when I have to use my insurance, I a lucky enough to have a PCP with a in office pharmacy and as long as one of the doctor's there writes the Rx I only have to pay $15 (drastic price difference.

I was on it for a year because it's the only ppi my insurance would pay for, but my condition really deteriorated during that time and I had to go back to taking Prevacid, which works the best for me. It's costing me a fortune, but it's better than the horrible symptoms I was exxperiencing. My doc says there all the same, but I disagree with that.

Aciphex prescribed, 8 weeks later erosive Esophagitis fully resolved. Follow up Endosopy and biopsy a year later, Barrett's Esophagus fully resolved.  Another Upper GI Endoscopy 2 years ago confirmed.  Because Aciphex is high tier drug, my insurance copay started to go up 4 years ago so tried other lower tier, lower cost PPIs.  Did not get same results.  Went back to Aciphex despite the higher cost.  Continue daily dose; as long as I do not forget to take and do not overeat, I have no symptoms of heartburn or acid reflux.  Also take a multi-vitamin and a Vitamin B supplement due to potential side effect of reduced vitamin absorbtion.  Aciphex had been exceptionally effective for me, just wish the manufacturer's cost would come down, my health insurance would cover more of the cost, or a generic version of the drug would become available.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57324

I didn't notice the change in the medication on the label and continued to take it as I had the Aciphex.

aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2006-01-05 00:00:00		0.5	1.0	3.5	1.0	Aciphex &amp; Depression/Eye problems I have been using aciphex for about 2 years. I also started on Zocor (for cholesterol) at about the same time. Since then, I just haven't felt like myself. I assumed it was from the Zocor. I would have eye muscle pain. Several weeks ago I started having severe anxiety attacks. My GERD got a lot worse so the DR then increased my dose of aciphex 2x daily. About a month later, I sunk into a pretty bad depressive state. I was always sad and felt like crying - in addition to anxiety attacks. Well, I stopped taking the aciphex 2 days ago and I do not have the eye pain anymore and I don't seem to be as depressed. Both are side effects of Aciphex. It's amazing how a little pill can cause so much change in your life! Update Jan 2006: Discontinued using Aciphex back in Dec. 2004. My Dr. tried prescribing additional Proton Pump Inhibitors and I had the same side effects. I completely came off all acid medication and a few weeks later had blood work done. My liver function tests were now normal(prior to that, my LFTs were all elevated about twice the normal limit). My Dr. then seemed to take me more seriously about my reaction to Aciphex and my side effects. It was determined that I am allergic to all Proton Pump Inhibitor medications. I now take Zantac as needed and it works like a charm for me. I actually have less Reflux now that I don't take aciphex! According the the Aciphex website, there ARE short and long term studies that document adverse reactions in a few people. However rare, they do happen.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17788

aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2005-03-04 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	4.5	2.0	Rabeprazole and joint pain. Prior to taking the proton pump inhibitor Rabeprazole (Pariet) for my GORD I had previously tried H2 antagonists (Ranitidine, Cimetidine, etc) and the ppi Omeprazole (Losec), but had encountered problems with all. As well as losing their effectiveness quite rapidly I found that the H2 antagonists tended to make me depressed, and produce some minor joint pain. I tried these on and off for some time, and with each trial the joint pain returned, but passed away within a short time of discontinuing the H2 antagonist in question. I then moved on to Omeprazole. These were far more effective in suppressing acid production, but again there was depression, and more significantly, a lot more joint pain which took a lot longer to pass away when I discontinued the Omeprazole. I tried this on a number of ocassions, and on each occasion the joint pain was more severe. Finally I tried Rabeprozale, one 20mg tablet per day. (I had asked my GP for the lower dose of 10mg, but was mistakenly prescribed the higher one.) I have been suffering from worsening arthritic pain in the joints ever since. One theory is that the suppression of acid in the gut puts the balance of the intestinal flora out of whack, and that some of the more insidious of these may then migrate to the joints if there is a leaky gut. Anyone else have this kind of a problem?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19637

aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2005-01-18 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	4.5	Aciphex didn't stay effective for me. I started taking Aciphex over four years ago. At first it worked great. 20mg in the morning was all I needed. Gradually, the hearburn started creeping back and I started having trouble swallowing. They bumped me up to 20mg twice a day and that worked for a couple more years. My insurance recently removed this drug from the list of &quot;approved&quot; medications so it's cost effectiveness rating is way down.I ended up with some complications from a respiratory infection and coughing which caused a large hiatal hernia and I no longer had any sphincter left. I went in for a Nissen fundoplication on November and had submitted a report on that procedure on this forum. I'm no longer on the Aciphex and seem to be on the mends. My thought is that if you can postpone a surgical repair, you should, and Aciphex may allow you to do that.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18091

However, I have been battling insomnia within the past couple of weeks, and wonder if Aciphex is the culprit.  Insomnia is listed as a side effect.  I lie awake, not fretting over anything, but I just can't sleep.  Just as I am about to nod off, I will experience a slight twitch or jerk.  It's not restless legs syndrome, for the jerks are minor and occur all over my body.  I'd rather suffer from GERD.

I have been having serious problems with depression and I think alot of it has been caused by the Aciphex since the deperession and suicidal thoughts have worsened since I have been on the Aciphex.    When hosipitalized for depression I was put on Protonix which also seemed to work about as well the Prevacid however about $2 a pill for Protonic's to be on it outside the hospital and that is after what insurance will pay for.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17218

Prevacid, the first one I was prescribed, produced intense bloating, nausuea, gas and diahrrea.  I was then prescribed Prilosec and it offered some relief, but Aciphex worked better.  I tried Protonix for about 9 months to see if the reflux symptoms could be further reduced after taking Aciphex for a year, but it wasn't any more effective, and was more expensive, so I returned to Aciphex. Recently, I was changed to 40 mg. of Nexxium twice a day, so I'll see if the little purple pill can do the trick.I had no discernible side effects with Protonix Aciphex.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11067

aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2004-02-11 00:00:00		3.5	0.0	3.5	2.5	PPI's can have dangerous side effects I took aciphex for about 7 months initially on a daily basis. It worked fine during the initial onset of the acid-reflux problem. 6 months later, I started to feel weird in the head, was not able to focus or think clearly, started to suffer from severe anxiety and confusion, started to experience tingling sensations in the left side of the head, couldn't sleep well at night, and eventually sank into a depression. At first, I didn't know what was going on, but later I suspected it had something to do with Aciphex and so stopped taking it. Things then started to become better. However, recovery has been very slow. The depression has for the most part gone away. However, the anxiety and nervousness have still to go away. I sleep much better. I reported this to my doctor, but he only pooh-poohed the whole thing saying millions take Aciphex. I don't understand the doctor's philosophy. I have nearly lost a year out of my life, and here the doctor still thinks Aciphex is a wonder drug. I am also very surprised that the literature that came with Aciphex at the pharmacy said that it had no reported potential side effects. I also believe that not many doctors know anything about its dangerous side effects. As to how I cope with acid reflux, I would certainly recommend changing your diet and lifestyle. I stopped eating spicy food, started to chew my food very well so that the esophagul sphincter did not get strained when letting food into my stomach, and lastly I sip a glass of milk through each day. Also, try not to stress yourself. Watch out for those moments when you tighten your stomach muscles unknowingly while sitting erect in front of computer or at a desk, so that you can relax those muscles. All these things are great because they work and you are not dependent on any drugs any more. Not only has the esophagus healed, I think the sphicter has healed too. What's really important to know is that our body is divine and ha	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10394
aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2003-11-27 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	purple what??? I would rate Aciphex as slightly less effective than Protonix but still very good. Protonix cured my GERD, Aciphex is maintaining me after a year. I avoid things that disturb my stomach such as onions, cinnamon, pizza sauce, pepperoni. That's a small price to pay for relief from the extreme pain I was suffering, enough to be hospitalized. Nexium did not touch my GERD. I was taking Vicodin or Hydrocodone to ease my stomach pain which I would rate as severe. After no relief from Nexium my internist prescribed Protonix. For me it was a minor miracle. With one dose my pain subsided. I had relief and it has not come back. I was given samples for 6 - 8 months and then the VA put me on Aciphex (Rabeprazole). I was worried about the switch but it's doing the trick too. I understand they are all very expensive. My HMO prescribed Prilosec to replace the Protonix/Aciphex regimen but I'm not switching just because of cost. The pain was too severe for me to ever go back to something else. In my case Protonix and Aciphex were superior to Nexium and Prilosec both in initial relief and as a maintenance medication in the relief of severe GERD.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9465

It worked well for my GERD at first, but then its effectiveness seemed to diminish.  I started getting pains in my thighs while sleeping and also some pains in my hands and occasionally head or neck pains.  I went to a neurologist for tests before it occurred to me that it might be the Aciphex.  When I stopped taking Aciphex, all my pains disappeared.  Protonix works much better for me. I've been on Protonix for a couple of months now, and so far so good, but I'm concerned about the safety of using PPIs for the rest of my life.  I tried Nexium once and that gave me a serious headache.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/8544

aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2003-08-06 00:00:00		5.0	0.0	5.0	3.5	Scary side effects I took Aciphex for 2 years and developed nerve problems including anxiety, paresthesia (tingling in legs and feet) and peripheral neropathy. (All are listed in the small print as side effects). After lots of testing including neurologists, mri's and blood tests with no results, I stopped the Aciphex and got back all the acid problems. I then took a natural approach with the help of a holistic MD. A change of diet (no meat, alcohol, caffiene, diet or decaf drinks; lots of pasta, rice and vegetables, watermellon, cantelope and bananas and lots of water, including eating very slowly and chewing a lot has taken almost all symptoms away within a month. Slowly, the nerves are healing. Proton pump inhibitors are new and should be used with caution long term.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7449

aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2003-01-17 00:00:00		5.0	0.0	5.0	3.5	Beware of Potentially Lethal Side Effects After starting to take Aciphex I became depressed and suicidal. I was also paranoid and nervous and started having black out periods where I couldn't remember who I was--amnesia. These are ALL rarely published or talked about side effects of Aciphex. After a year of psychiatry and physician's bills I had to stop taking Aciphex because I couldn't afford to take it anymore. Three days after stopping the medication all of my suicidal, and other psychological symptoms disappeared. The voices in my head literally stopped as quickly as they had begun. This medication is dangerous because not many doctors know about or bother to look up these side effects and may not diagnose the problem in time. Stopping this medication saved my life. I have since had surgery for my GERD and am happier than I ever have been. I highly recommend the relatively painless laproscopic fundoplication procedure over this dangerous and insidious drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4171

actiq	Severe Pain	2008-10-03 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I find it appauling that the government has stepped in to stop the prescribing of the medication for severe chronic pain patients,  It's proven itself and is now in a generic form.  It's been my saving grace and CT is crazy to allow legislators determine this most important issue.it's a drug that helps many severe conditions and should be used in more applications for relief of debilitating pain.  I pray Ohio never steps in and makes changes that don't allow me this medication as it's worked miricles with me.  i'm still working with a very serious broken neck condition due to this medication.  I take it for breakthrough pain but can't imagine not having this medication to help me.  I'd be on SSI without it.  Legislators should think about that for awhile....keep pain patients working or bedridden???

When nothing else helps my intense, cervical spine injury (broken neck due to car accident)....I can put an ACTIQ LOLLIPOP in my cheek, lay down and feel better within 15 minutes.  It relieves my break through pain (very severe) as well as the worst of the migraines that I get due to my condition.  I also am on a slow release morphine Kadian to shield me from daily chronic pain but the ACTIQ has changed my life in the sense that I have so much more control over my bad pain days that used to keep me in bed. It has also come out in a GENERIC form so that it's affordable, it works and I'm so blessed to have a Pain Mgt. Dr. who knows what to prescribe and isn't afraid to use these amazing new tools to help people like me who, without it, wouldn't be functioning and able to work,  REMEMBER the hope I have now,  Relief is BLISS and Actiq relieves severe pain quickly (with mininal side effects) LASTS ABOUT 3 - 4 HRS.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57970

actiq	Headache - Cluster	2007-07-16 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Actiq with Fioricet Actiq used in conjunction with Fioricet can stop a cluster headache cold.  You have to work up to it, and you have to be on a base medication like oxycontin.  I have chronic pain care due to reactive arthritis which leads to cluster headaches.  I have controlled them, along with widspread pain throughout my spine and body in the following way.  I take 80 mcg of oxycontin twice a day as a base.  I take one Fioricet in the morning when I wake up, and one or two in the evening when I go to bed or with the second oxycontin. When a headache flares up, I immediately take two Fioricet and one or two Actiq.  The Actiq is for breakthrough pain and stops the immediate panic caused by the onset of the pain.  Actiq takes fifteen minutes to get fully down, rubbing as fast as you can on your gums.  You have to work the dosage.  I started out with 400's, but as my body became used to it, or my pain got worse--I don't know which--I found that I had to move to 800's.  This is a powerful medication, so start out taking one, and see if that works.  It is immediate and obvious.  If you still have the pain, take the second, at whichever dose your doctor has given you.  The nice thing about Actiq is that you can adjust the dose simply by stopping the sucking on it.  If you feel yourself getting dizzy or if the pain has subsided, take it out of your mouth and wait a few minutes, or suck on it more slowly.  Do this only under a doctor's supervision as this is powerful medicine.  The down side here is that Actiq is hugely expensive if you do not have insurance.  There is no generic.  The main ingredient here is Fioricet, which is the all-time greatest headache drug.  It combines tylenol, with a mild barbituate and caffiene as a catalyst.  My body is used to heavy medication from years of chronic pain, so many people cannot take these doses.  Play around with them carefully.  Some people are knocked flat with only one Fioricet.  I have found that two are safe	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55712
actiq	Herniated discs	2006-10-11 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	3.5	Best medication for breakthrough pain Actiq works very quickly 5-8 minutes and for me lasts 4-6 hours.  However once you're on it for long term maintenance of (in my case) back pain, sudden withdrawal can be very stressful.  A change in health insurance coverage requiring prior authorization could force you to be without it for a week. Or it may be removed from coverage in a health plan. The cost for 40 lozenges has gone from $550/mo. to $1100/mo. my co-pay is $100 but I'm sure that our health insurance will eventually decide not to cover this medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51069

This is very common in Lyme patients.  I was given a baseline drug (this is something like methadone or long-acting morphine) and Actiq for breakthrough.  It was far and away the most effective drug I had. You could use a half of one if that met your pain needs.  It only lasts about 4 hours.  Problems:  frequently hard to get, very expensive, and it is sugar-based, so it's inappropriate for diabetics.  Also, all that sugar sitting in your mouth will ruin your teeth.  It is almost impossible to be discreet about it's use, since it takes 15-30 minutes to complete a lollipop.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49610

It is truly worth the money, and I will continue to use it as long as my Dr. will prescribe it.

I also had the Actiq pain pop which was great for break though pain.  Now the Drs. will not give me anything for my pain other than a huge increase of neurontin 800 mgs 3 X a day.  Also Relafen 500 mg tabs. 3 X a day.  I am in so much pain I wilt or can not function.  Lupus is controling my blood pressure, lungs and stomach or digestion.  I also have RSDS/CRPS which is also very painful.  When I was taken off the opiods I had to call 911 at least once a week or more.  I could not breath, and my heart felt like it was going to come out of my mouth.  Also the pain in my stomach can be unreal.  With RSDS, Reflex Sympatic Dystrophy Syndrome (www.rsdhope.org) my arms up to about the middle of the upper arm and my hands burn.  Also my feet up to my knees burn. I feels just like you fell into a fire.  It also has many other complications.Now that I have nothing to help I am so limited as to what I can do.

actiq	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2005-12-15 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	4.5	5.0	Actiq for Breakthrough Pain I was hesitant to take this when my pain Dr. suggested it, but now it is really a major part of my regime.  I take Oxycontin twice a day as my base, but that is a steady background drug.  If I want to play ball with the kids, or do something just a little past what I should, I get breakthrough pain which can lead to much worse pain, spasms, etc.  These things look like lollipops.  You have to keep them far away from kids and lock them up.  They taste good too.  You can only take them if you are already taking a fair level of opiates, or they will make you sick.  You suck on one at a time, placing it between your gum and lip, and finish it in 15 minutes.  It gives you immediate pain relief but only short term.  What is great about these is you can take as much or as little as you want.  You can finish one, or take only half.  Or, if the pain is severe, you can take two.  In dire circumstances, I have taken three.  They are for short term pain breakthrough only.  However, I have found that I have specific times of the day where I always exceed the limits of relief the Oxycontin gives me.  So, rather than go up in dosage on the Oxycontin, which probably wouldn't help stop the pain of a two hour carpool commute anyway, I sit back and break the pain with an Actiq.  Also, it allows me the freedom to do special things with my kids.  If I am just on the edge, or very tired and hurting just a little, and the kids want to play or something special, I can take an Actiq and do it with them because it is immediate.  It allows me to be a father when I need or want to be, and not have to suffer to do it.  These things are great, but have to be taken with care and under a doctor's careful supervision.  I was hesitant to take them because all the literature for them is for use for cancer patients and terminal patients, so I thought it would be too strong.  Those unfortunate people are taking much higher doses.  The 400's do the trick for most of us with t	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/34299

I use actiq as part of my total pain treatment. It works very fast but the taste of the new actiq (within 2 years) is pretty bad. It has a sandy feel and a bad taste.

actiq	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2005-08-23 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Actiq: I was put on Actiq 800 mg 4 times a day, from a doctor at the pain clinic and Narco for break through pain. I wish they had told me that the Actiq would make me lose my teeth. The Actiq works great. I have FMS, bi ladder pelvic hip rotation injury, from a car accident, and carpal tunnel. I can't take most of the medicines they use for these medical problems. The Actiq works so fast and helps me be mobile.  Most of the time I am in a wheel chair. I can use my walker when I take the Actiq. The Narco is better then vicodin or vicodin E.S. 7.5/750 There is a big difference. You can take 1-2 Narco every 4-6 hours 10/350 each. Vicodin only has 7.5 mg of narcotic and 750 mg of Tylenol. That is why you can only take 4 a day. It causes liver damage. Narco comes 10/350 I get more pain medicine and less Tylenol, less chance of liver damage. It works good as a break through medicine. Nothing else worked for me, with out sever reactions.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26257
actiq	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2005-06-30 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Actiq (For Cancer Patients Only) It's funny, the thing that started me on the Actiq wasn't my Fibro, rather it was being prescribed to me by my Neurologist for my migraines.  (Which was working pretty well, I might add.)  Since using it for them, I noticed my Fibro. flares didn't seem quite as bad, so if I had a bad flare one day, I'd suck on an Actiq for a couple minutes (as I was on 1200mcg for my migraines and didn't feel I needed that much for the Fibro), and it worked beautifully!This went on for a few months, until one day I got a phone call from Blue Cross, my insurance company, who were calling to ask me if I had any form of cancer that they were unaware of.  I said no, so they asked what I was using the Actiq for &amp; I told them it was one of the ONLY things my Neurologist had found within the past 4 years that has worked for my migraines.  He informed me that my insurance was no longer going to pay for them since they were approved through the FDA for &quot;Breakthrough Cancer Pain&quot;, and since I didn't have cancer, I could no longer use them.  (At least, not without shelling out hundreds of dollars myself for a script.)  So there ended a wonderful medication that not only worked with my severe migraines, but was helping the Fibro as well.

My neurologist found a study done on it and found that something like 95% of the patients were able to eliminate trips to the ER with this drug. I haven't had to go to the ER since. However, since it's a powerful drug there are some prejudices on the part of some doctors, pharmacists, and insurance companies. While my last 2 insurance carriers paid for it, my current insurance will not. Their excuse is that the PDR does not include migraines as a condition for this drug. It costs the same as Axert though but it's $15.00 per lollipop. Even at that it's worth it for me as nothing else works. Axert, Maxalt , etc, works only about 40% of the time for me.

actiq	Herniated discs	2004-02-29 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	4.5	Actiq is excellent in CHRONIC severe pain  I was put on both 200 &amp; 400mcg Actiq 8 months ago for my 3+ year of severe c-spine (neck) painwhich would not respond to other meds. Within 1 lozenge I can say it worked like Cephalon claims in 15 minutes.1 month later, I was put on Duragesic (fentanyl patches) with the Actiq as a breakthrough med needed for flare uos.The combination is wonderful. I have 90% relief with both, and 5 months after being put on Actiq by my neurosurgeon he was able to do my surgery (discomectomy, allograft, fusion, powdered donor bone)...My recovery has been really rough, so I have remained on the Actiq and Duragesic since and I have been told I may need them both till I am fully fused in 1 year. Any longer term use of either Fentanyl based drug is hard to wean off of, so I will at the time needed go to a 2 day detox inpatient center for medical addictions (for people with legitimate drug use due to chronic pain). But the Actiq is a wonderful drug for SEVERE ONLY pain when other meds don't work, or in my case I am allergic to 2 major used pain meds).ACTIQ IS EXTREMLY EXPENSIVE WITH HAVING TO PAY OVER $1000 A MONTH FOR 2 BOXES OF 200MCG, AND 2 BOXES OF 400MCG.. IF PAID FOR BY CASH! (GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT THE 1600 MCG COSTS!) but for me I have a $30 co-pay.I will say a lot of insurance companies will not pay for Actiq since it is labeled for cancer patients only, but a lot of neurosurgeons and chronic pain centers use them all the time for non-cancer severe pain.It is a hard drug to get RX's for due to the high abuse factor if they get put into the wrong handsof known abusers.Actiq is not to be used unless lesser narcotics will help, and each separate wrapped in foil and plastic that you have to cut to get open package, they clearly state &quot;NOT TO BE USED BY NON TOLERANT MORPHINE OR FENTANYL PATIENTS)*** if your house has children they must be kept locked up in a cabinet since even 1 can and will kill a child or person over	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10983

I was weighing 289lbs when i started out on adipex. I am weighing 250lbs now from being on the pill for 2months.

adipex-p	Weight Loss	2009-01-10 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	First let me say I started in oct 2004 at 283lbs. WITHOUT any meds with JUST diet and exercise and going throug a divorce I lost 110lbs reaching 174lbs in 10 months. I am a 5ft 8in female so this was a good weight and got to keep my &quot;Betty Boop figure. I kept the weight off for about three years. In  the last year I put on 30lbs going to 207 I have been on adipex on and off for about6 weeks. The first 2 weeks I lost 15 lbs with diet and exersice going to 189lbs and platued i had to stop for a week because i had major constipation.  I gained 2 lbs back (prob in poop) When I started back with also eating 4 prunes nightly, i have lost another 4lbs. I think the week break helped to get the weight loss started again.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58965
adipex-p	Weight Loss	2009-01-08 00:00:00		1.0	2.5	4.0	1.0	The first time I took it, I was not overweight. I am 5'9 and I weighed 175 pounds. I was ecstatic because I lost 15 pounds in 2 months..then gained the weight back within a couple more months (although I maintained a healthy diet and exercise regimen). I took Adipex a second time and lost 25 pounds in 3 months. Then I gained back around 35 pounds within just a few months. I took Adipex again, but actually gained weight on it. I am now 80 pounds heavier than the first time I ever took it. I have been undergoing several tests and my endocrine specialist believes adipex may have had a long term effect on my metabolism/digestive system. While it does make you feel very content and happy, almost like an anti-depressent, the long term effects can be horrific. Before I took adipex I was very calm and easygoing. Since taking it, I am prone to horrible mood swings and aggitation. My recommendation is to stay FAR AWAY from this drug!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58945
adipex-p	Weight Loss	2009-01-01 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	Although this treatment is not right for everyone--check with your family doctor--I found that it worked for me. I also found that exercise and a proper diet has to be combined to make the treatment a success. It not only helps you to lose the weight, but it educates you on how to rethink what you eat, how you eat, &amp; that exercising is important. It doesnt call for you to starve yourself or work out for hours. However, working out for at least 30 minutes a day, &amp; eating a proper diet will not only improve your life but also produce results. It is not a fast fix, it takes several months &amp; it take effort, but it is well worth it. It only cost me $30 a month.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58888
adipex-p	Weight Loss	2008-12-12 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	I have been on adipex for 2 weeks now and have dropped 13 pounds.  I find this amazing since I had been on a 1500 calorie diet for 5 months with only a 2 pound weight loss.  I still remain at 1500 calories a day and this is sometimes hard to do since I am not hungry.  The only negitive effect is muscle tension.  I have noticed since I started taking this that my back is very tense and aches.  Other than that I would defintly recommend this to anyone who is having trouble loosing weight.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58661

I have lost 30lbs in 3 months and the only side effect I have is the dry mouth-funny taste thing. I am not hyper and for the first time in 15 years I feel my energy level normal, I even sleep fine at night. My heart is fine and I have to say that long before I started taking these I did have a bit of an irregular heart beat but these pills in no way have caused me any problems. I know many doctors will look at you and say they are just speed pills but they are not. You really are not hungry. Its like gastric surgery without the surgery. And as a bonus with me its also  like an antidepressant. I have one more month left and hope to loose another 10lbs.

I insisted my Dr help me after everything else we tried failed because of allergic reactions to most medications and some food especially hebal treatments. Finally she tried Adpex-P  37.5 mg, once a dayI  I lost more than 25 pounds in 4 months. I still can't do strenous excercise, but I do walk at least a mile a day and I swim twice a week, I have had no  side effects that I have noticed, and  I have missed a dose or two during the few months I have been using Adpex and I had no problems. The only downside, which makes me HAPPY is now I have to buy &quot;SKINNY CLOTHES&quot; :) :)  I have already recommende this treatment to friends of whom one is a physical therapist.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57269

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2008-06-06 00:00:00		4.5	0.5	3.0	2.5	I have been on Advair for about almost 6 years now. I almost never use my resuce inhaler now. This happended about a week or two after starting the medication. I have only had one serious asthma attack sending me to the hospitol since on this. One side effect that I had no clue about was Intercystal Cystitis (spasiming of the bladder) this causes the walls of the baldder to spasm and then scar creating perfect conditions for infection. When I was diagnosed by a Urologist, he advised that he believed it was a side affect of the &quot;asthma&quot; medication I was on. He said he had noticed this in several of his patients over the years and found this medication to be the common link. Through online chatting I also found others who had the same trouble. Now I'm on another med to control that. Think before you take it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57928

Since I had had these spots in my mouth &amp; throat twice and they cleared up with an antifungal prescription I Googled the symptom.  I found out that there have been reports of just that problem, spots on the larynx - some resulting in unnecessary treatment/surgery.  I had to seek a second opinion but he &amp; my GP agreed to give me oral steroids so I could take a break from the Advair.  It worked - a laryngoscopy showed the spots had vanished!  Unfortunately we found out I'm &quot;dependent&quot; on Advair...couldn't stay off it for long without ending up in the ER.  My GP even called Glaxo-Smith Kline &amp; was told there is no protocol for stopping.  If you have severe asthma - please do whatever your doctor recommends but if you have a choice I would not recommend this.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55122
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2007-07-02 00:00:00		2.5	5.0	2.5	0.5	I have been on Advair for 4 years now , I have always had asthma since I was a child but during my 2nd pregnancy it dramatically worsened. I have been on it ever since. At first it was a miracle drug, helped me breathe easier and almost completely stopped the attacks as well as having to use my rescue inhaler. Now 4 years later, I have tremors, chest pain, blurred vision, migranes, fatigue, SOB constantly , brusing , Dizziness and fungal infections of my digestive tract. THIS IS THE WORST MEDICATION AVAILABLE FOR ASTHMA. For the past 3 years I have had re occurant viral infections, rhinitis etc.,I really hope that I am able to stop taking this medication with out complications. I am only 24 years old. Hows that for improving the quality of life? I hope anyone just starting to take this medication is properly educated about the risks.

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2007-06-22 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	3.0	0.5	I have mild asthma.  I usually use an albuterol inhaler per year it is so mild. My allergist decided to try me on Advair for some reason and I ended up in the ER 4-5 times because this medication actually made my asthma worse instead of better. During each ER visit prednisone and other inhalers were prescribed to treat my &quot;severe&quot; asthma.  After about 6 weeks on this drug I was also taking prednisone, flovent, and nebulizing albuterol and ipratropium every 3-4 hours.  My healthcare providers never identified this drug as being the problem.  I did my own research and found out that some of the rare side effects of this medication are &quot;difficulty breathing&quot;.  I stopped Advair on my own and felt much better after 24 hours.  Of course I had to taper off of prednisone, but I was also able to stop nebulizing and taking the other prescribed inhalers.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55079

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2007-02-13 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	3.0	4.0	Advair Works Great for Newly Diagnosed Asthma My doctor recently diagnosed me with asthma and prescribed Advair.  Within 10 days I noted a marked improvement in my condition.  So much so, I wish that I would have spoken up earlier.I regularly go to the gym and am sure to spend at least 25 minutes on the cross-training machine at various levels 3-4 times a week for cardiovascular health and weight control. I could not imagine that something fundamental was affecting my energy levels.  My doctor first discovered abnormally low testosterone &lt;200.  With the addition of depo testosterone my energy levels rose but I was still tired, very sensitive to cold, with frequent sweats.  This lead us to check my thyroid.  Sure enough, I have hypothyroidism.  Levothyroxine soon raised my energy levels and eliminated other symptoms of hypothyroidism.  Yet,  I still felt tired.  Changes in my depression meds did not help.  By chance, I mentioned to my doctor that I felt like I was drowning when I would drink at a water fountain.  Despite my frequent exercise, sometimes I would get winded just walking up the stairs.  He tested me and sure enough I was asthmatic.I suppose after living in some of the heavily polluted urban centers in the world, like South Chicago area, Osaka, and Tokyo, as well as suffering from allergies, I should have expected it.This medication has greatly improved my quality of life.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54311

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2007-01-29 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	3.5	3.5	Bad side effects This med works to control my asthma, but the side effects from the steroids are something I can't live with. I've had three separate types of symptoms at different times, all of which would go away if I stopped taking Advair and each of which caused me to decrease my dosage: 1) flu-like, listless; 2) dizzy/lightheaded, sleepy, tingling in arms; 3) intestinal pain. If I go back on this drug, I soon start experiencing the dizziness, then the intestinal pain. If I were to take a 'normal adult' dose, I would get the flu-like symptoms. I don't think these things will happen to many people, but be careful if you're sensitive to steroids.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54167

advair-diskus	Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease -- Maintenance	2006-12-06 00:00:00		3.0	4.5	4.5	3.5	Advair 500/50 I was started on this medication during a 5 month upper respiratory infection by my primary care physician.  I had been using inhaled salmeterol, inhaled corticosteroids, and albuterol.  It was a lot easier to just use the one inhaler but found the lower doses don't work for me.  It's also cheaper to buy one med with insurance than 3 meds.  My pcp gave it to me in part because she thought the combination of the 3 other drugs was causing thrush although I've been told that Advair can also cause thrush.  It's important to rinse one's mouth afterward.  Unfortunately, I&quot;m often too tired and just go to sleep.  Advair lets me sleep all night; I couldn't do it without the high doses of salmeterol.  Unfortunately, I think it's effectiveness has dropped slightly although it still seems to be the best thing around.  The diskus is easy to use - I can easily tell how many doses I have left so there's no playing guessing games as to whether I'm getting the last dregs of the cannister.  I've also gone back to taking Singular along with Advair to get the most treatment.  Still feel like I have a mild bronchitis going on quite often. My pulmonologist tells me that I have Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease which she says is just a collection of symptoms and asthma is one of them.  I've never smoked so mine is presumably due to severe allergies.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53575

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2006-08-23 00:00:00		4.5	0.0	3.5	3.0	Guarded I tried ADVAIR at my doctor's recommendation.  I have had asthma all of my life.  I believe it started in early childhood around 4-5 years of age.I have used various inhalers all of my life and they have given me the freedom to do everything I wanted to do.  I have played sports, road off road motorcycles, sailed, waterskied and even scuba dived (not a good idea).My asthma has been consistent over my lifetime in that if I kept it under control, I was OK.  If it gets out of control, I can get into serious trouble quickly.  As an example, once I was staking a wood pile that had mold in it.  Suddenly, my inhaler would not work and I was taken to the emergency room where my breathing was so restricted I passed out.  I was given adrenoline and it probably saved my life.I take my inhaler usually once during the night while trying to sleep.  I noticed with ADVAIR, I could easily sleep through the night without the use of an inhaler.  I also noticed that my use of the inhaler during the day was much less frequent.I stopped using ADVAIR only because of the potential side effects I read about on Google.  It can cause death, especially in Blacks.  I did notice while using it, I was great.  But when I stopped using it, my inhaler did not seem to work as well.  That dependency scared me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48159
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2006-08-16 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	A New Lease On Life I more than just impressed with the Advair Diskus, but I credit this medication, along with Singulair, for giving me a new lease on life.I used to be in and out of the hospital, had regular ER visits, and my flare ups were very frequent. I still struggle with my asthma, and still have several times each month that I end up taking nebulizer breathing treatments at home, but I have not had a single ER visit or hospitalization for asthma since I began taking the Advair two years ago.I also found that I was able to be compliant with my medication because it was only to be taken once in the morning and once at night...before this I was on several different meds that had two puffs or 4 puffs at different times during the day and I regularly missed most of them. The counter on the Advair is also wonderful (I wish they would add them to regular albuteral inhalers, as it would help me not to try to use empty ones and the &quot;float method&quot; is inconvenient when not at home). The Advair Diskus not only shows the numbers for how many inhalations are remaining, but when there are only 5 left, the numbers switch from black to red...which is very helpful to cue those of us who are forgetful to refill our medication.I have not noticed much in the way of side effects, accept sometimes a powdery residue left in my mouth which can cause mouth sores...but that is only when I neglect to follow the instructions which specifically say to rinse out your mouth with water after taking each dose.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25310

I have not had an asthma attack since I began using the Advair discus. I use an Albuterol inhaler maybe once or twice a month; previous to the Advair I was using two Albuterol inhalers a month, sometimes three. Advair has been incredibly effective in controlling my asthma.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41940

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2006-04-13 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	4.0	4.0	Good results but very risky? I just started using ADVAIR.  I take it twice a day (morning &amp; night) with (1) inhalation.  I have had asmthma since childhood and currently was only using Albuterol to keep it in check.  I immediately noticed that I could sleep all night without using my Albuterol inhaler.  I use to use my inhaler at least once during the night.Then I stopped taking the ADVAIR for one day to see if it made a difference.  Immediately upon stopping, I noticed that my Asthma seemed to get worse than before I started using ADVAIR.  This scared me.  I then searched Google for more information on ADVAIR and discovered several people have died from using it.  Especially Blacks seem to have complications and a higher rate of mortality.  But White people have also suffered death.  Until this product has more history and testing, I think I will just stick with the Albuterol for now.  It's safer!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40989

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2006-03-12 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Advair is a great combo for me After 20 years of MDI use, I was skeptical about the so-called &quot;dry inhalers&quot; and definitely did not like it at first, but now I think it's a much more effective way to get most of the medicine deep into the lungs.I like that the doses are counted out clearly (unlike your standard MDI, where you're supposed to keep track of all 200 doses yourself -- AS IF! -- has anyone ever done so?!) I like that the case forms a self-cover for the unit. I like that the medication combination is a good one for me, though I wish it had more salmeterol in it (Serevent).Complaints: there's no way to clean the mouthpiece easily and the different dosages do not have either different colors of labels or different color cases. It's impossible to tell a 100/50 from a 250/50 at a glance, and that's a problem in our house, because my four year old daughter uses this medication too. Here's has bright stickers all over it, while mine remains more dignified without the stickers, but it sure would be nice if they were red, yellow, and green, or even white/lavender/purple for the 50s and maybe cyan/blue/navy for the 25s -- anything to make it easy to tell them apart.This is one of the few medications I've been on for multiple years that I feel has continued to work as well after a long time as it did after I built up to a therapeutic level in my bloodstream.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10603

I was going through a rough period of trying to get rid of ongoing coughing and wheezing. The Advair helped me to get through this period. I did get a couple infections on my tongue from using it, though. Once I became stablized, I went back to just using daily Singulair and am very happy with that. I thought the Advair did a good job, and would use it if my asthma put me in very risky condition again. It was easy to use, but I did not like the chalky residue that would end up in my mouth upon use. I am most happy when I can just stick to Singulair for daily maintenance.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35197

After finally having insurance after being unemployed, I went to the doctor to try and find ways to fix my asthma.  He recommended Advair, even though I personally am very suseptible to steroid side effects.  Within a month of taking Advair, I ended up in the ER for 2 days.  Nothing else had changed in my life EXCEPT the addition of Advair.  After the fact, I found that in some cases Advair can cause asthma to get worse, and there is an argument about a 'black box' warning on the drug.  If it works for you great; but if you're sensitive to steroids of any form you might want to think twice about this medicine.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35162

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-12-15 00:00:00		3.5	5.0	4.5	3.5	Seretide This was prescribed to me after I was hospitalized. Normally I use Asthalin inhaler. I was at first amazed at the packaging which is vastly different from Asthalin and it took some time for me to get accustomed to it. But then the breathing patterns etc were the same as it was in Asthalin. The powdery taste at first made me cough but later it was alright. This medication does not give me tremors as Asthalin does. I think in the long run, this would be much better as it controls the symptoms better in the long run. though when it comes to subsiding an attack instantly, it falls back, for which reason i still feel comfortable with my Asthalin inhaler. Overall, this is quite a good product and I would like to use this on a long term basis except for the fact that it is very expensive.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/34285

I started off as a 10 year old using something called Vaponefrin(?) in a glass nebulizer and moved on to Proventil, Ventolin, AzmaCort, Intal, prednisone when in dire need, Serevent and finally in the early '90's when I made my first and only trip to the emergency room I moved onto Advair.  Today, on Medicare, I can not afford to pay US prices for Advair so I purchase it overseas for $50 less than local sources.

I have had asthma for thirty plus years and had been literally tethered to albuterol (which I had to use 3 - 4 times a day). So dependent was I that I would panic if I found myself out of the house without it. All it did really was to mask the inflammation, but given my condition, I was grateful for even this. Then came Advair! After taking it for several weeks without any effect (my doctor told me to expect this) my whole life turned around. Not only have I not had ANY asthma symptoms since (it has been  two + years now), I am able to get through a workout at LA Fitness and be around animals with no trouble. Even more extraordinary, I was able to cut my dosage from the recommended 2 inhalations twice a day to one inhalation every one-and-a- half days.

My vision then seemed distorted and I felt tired in the afternoons.  I was seeing floaters pass before my eyes.  At this point, I was into my second week.  My doctor reduced the dosage to 100/50.  The headaches increased to the point where I felt it was quite similar to a migraine. The eye pain was just horrible.  I felt like I had the flu.  I had body aches that were the worst I had ever felt.

Since I've used Advair (about 3 years), I have not had to take any prednisone at all... prednisone was always &quot;the lesser of evils&quot;, but a very bad evil nevertheless.  I only occasionally need albuterol during peak pollen seasons.  My asthma is mostly under control now, thanks to Advair.  I was never able to use any of the other steroid inhalers.  They caused thrush so bad that I couldn't eat.  I do experience that to a small degree with Advair, but it's tolerable.  The combo of the 2 drugs in the diskus work wonders.  I am fortunate, because in that I have no health insurance and could never afford the high cost of Advair, my physician keeps me supplied with samples.  I am grateful for the newer meds that make it possible for me to lead an active and relatively asthma free life!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24199

Needless to say, that is a LOT of inhaling to do.  Especially if you need to do it properly (i.e., spacing out each inhalation with 1-2 minutes wait time..that's about 6-12 minutes just to take an inhaler!).  I was put on Advair, the 500/50 Diskus, and I've done much, MUCH better.  I can't say more to rave about this medication.  My only beef with it is the price.  Luckily, I have insurance, so I just pay $20.  But I feel for someone who has none.

I don't have chest pain or the tightening I had before I was diagnosed. But before Advair I had symptoms every 2 days or so and now its more like every day but less severe. Its like a constant lowered breathing ability. Not severe enough for anyone else to notice but quite annoying. Its only been a week so I'm hoping it will kick in soon-the humidity this summer isn't helping much. Does it get better with time? May try the Albuterol thing that my allergist prescribed as well.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23521

This year, I found myself using my albuterol inhaler 2 to 3 times a day for almost 3 months...not good.  My doctor had me try Advair and after the first inhalation, I never had to use my albuterol again.  I have reduced the amount of Advair inhalations to once a day and have had no more asthma problems.  I have 2 cats and 1 dog and am allergic to both kinds of animal.  No problems with Advair.  I was very lucky with the side effects.  I experienced nothing unusual and never got a sore mouth. I'm not crazy about inhaling steroids but it beats not breathing!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22654

My asthma was mild, and usually expressed as coughing at night that kept me up.  No problems with that now.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22603
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-05-07 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	Advair Diskus cuts down on wheezing at night. My actual dose is 1 inhalation once a day. I have been using Advair for about 2 years for asthma (wheezing). At first I inhaled twice a day, but that caused me lots of congestion, even though it eliminated the wheezing at night. Before I started using it the wheezing would keep me from sleeping at night or cause me to wake up early and not be able to go back to sleep. Because of the congestion it causes I now only inhale once a day at bedtime and it works most excellently this way! I have very little or no wheezing at all and am able to sleep without any problems. I also have less congestion since I cut my use to only 1 inhalation daily.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22504

I do brush and gargle after using it but I get recurrent Thrush. It took the ENT doctor a while to find out that you have to take Diflucan for 7 days instead of the usual dosage of 1 day to get rid of the Thrush.  I've tried going with out Advair but end up with worse asthma, so it is a trade off, breath or not be able to eat spice food and have the roof of your mouth feel like shag carpeting.:&gt;  I also had to fight my insurance company tooth and nail to get the medicine I needed for 7 days.

I started having some problems, and my dr. became upset when she found out I did not use the Advair because of the difficulty getting to the bathroom to rinse my mouth. (I am disabled). So she convinced me that I should use it when using the bathroom, then rinsing, it surely began to help me much more.

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-03-15 00:00:00		1.5	5.0	5.0	3.0	Effectiveness of Advair 250/50 1dose 2x/day I suffer from mild asthma. My symptoms are more allergic in nature, I think. I will sneeze and I believe the release of histamines precipitates a mild upper and lower respiratory response in the form of mild bronchospasm and the production of a small amount of mucus from my sinuses and lungs. I suffered from some type of respiratory illness in the Fall of 2004. I did not have a fever but for 3 months I had a severe, whooping cough, I coughed up green sputum, and I wheezed and rattled. It was terrible. I have used Zyrtec for seasonal problems and it provided no relief. Could be it works better prophylactically rather than after the onset of symptoms. I tried Advair and Combivent. They provided relief for a short period of time. I am a Respiratory Therapist and I began taking nebulized Albuterol, Atrovent, and Mucomyst at least once a day sometimes twice a day. I would take a UD Albuterol, a UD Atrovent, and 1 cc 10% Mucomyst. I used strict technique when taking the treatment. I take a slow deep breath until my lungs are at full capacity and then I hold that breath for at least a count of 5. The effect and improvement was dramatic. I will not waste my time on inhalers again in the event I have this problem in the future.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19876
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-03-07 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	Advair I also suffer from Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia.  What I have found with those two illnesses is that whatever pre-existing issues you had (i.e allergies/asthma/pms etc) gets exponentially worse in correlation with the severity of your CFS/FM symptoms.I have always had asthma but since the CFS/FM diagnosis my asthma became so bad that I was using my inhaler sometime as much as 8 times a day even with accolate or singulair. Since I started taking the advair I still need my inhaler at night (probably an allergic reaction to something in my bedroom) but now almost never during the day.  I am getting my advair through the glaxosmithklein patient assistance program so I can't speak to cost, but if you can get it, I would definitely encourage you to give it a try.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19711
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-02-28 00:00:00		3.0	4.0	4.0	3.5	Getting better I had complete testing done (blood work and allergy testing) as I was getting bronchial infections, a sore throat and stuffiness on a regular basis. My allergist had me try various meds, including Advair and Allegra D, but I was still getting sick. So my allergist added Gaviscon (over the counter) and prevacid, along with allergy shots. My symptoms have been improving, and I try to limit my intake on foods and beverages containing mold and/or fungi. I will continue to experiment and cut back drugs where possible as my symptoms continue to improve ( I hope).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18238
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-02-26 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	Advair works well for me A friend recommended Advair to me saying it has allowed him to leave the house without his albuterol inhaler for the first time in years. I've been using it for about a year now and pretty much agree. It hasn't &quot;cured&quot; my asthma. I still have some tightness and still feel the need to use albuterol for aerobic exercise, but that's about the only time I need the albuterol when I typicallyt used to use it 3x per day. Only downside I've found are that it sometimes makes you a bit hoarse and of course it isn't cheap.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19251

It is so much easier to remember this and not loose it seeing as it is a bright purple. I have chronic asthma and as long as I take it like I'm supposed to I'm fine unless exposed to an allergen. It has reduced the amount of times I need to take my rescue inhaler. It isn't cheap if you don't have insurance.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19154

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-02-23 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Advair Had tried Dr's sample of Advair 250/25, but thought it gave me a sore throat, so discontinued use.  Then, as my asthma got worse this winter, he encouraged me to give it another try.  I am very happy that I did!  It has helped.  And, the sore throat that I was experiencing was more due to allergies (am going to an allergist today, in fact) than that particular medicine.  It is helping.  He bumped me up to the 500/50 and I feel it is even doing better.  Have had bronchitis three times this winter already and am willing to bet that I will not encounter it again due to the help this medicine is providing my lungs. Have read the earlier cautions about the medicine and am concerned somewhat.  As with any medicine we all know there is always a negative.  So, perhaps, during summer when I never have gotten bronchitis, I will discontinue this medicine and pick it back up in the fall.Overall, a super medicine!  Good luck.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12830
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-02-01 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	5.0	3.5	Effective, but beware of side effects I was placed on this medication after having several sudden episodes of breathing difficulty and wheezing that wouldn't go away. The doctor later determined that the cause was acid reflux, and after six months simply taking Zantec occassionally, I was able to stop this medication.But while on Advair, it worked great, but I noticed that, while normally prone to colds and sinus infections, I got many more colds than before. But the worst part of it occurred on Christmas Day, when I became violently ill with a stomach virus that caused me to throw up at least 50 times over the next day until I could barely move and was ready to go to the ER. I've never had any illnesses that were even close to the severity of that virus, and others in my family were minimally affected. After stopping the Advair in March, I haven't been sick since.While many people aren't as fortunate as me to be able to get off the Advair, be careful of the weakening of your immune system due to this medication!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18446
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-11-28 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Advair is great for asthma! I developed asthma about 5 years ago.  It was pretty much out of control (sick all of the time, er visits,placed on prednisone numerous times, etc.) until I found an amazing pulmomologist that started me on Advair and singulair about two years ago.  My asthma is much more in control than it had been previously.  I'm able to function pretty normally.  I rarely have attacks and it seems to increase my symptom free days.  I didn't experience any side effects when starting this medication.  My only complaint is that this medication is a little pricey, luckily I have insurance.

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-11-24 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	5.0	0.5	Advair Diskus A total wash! I've had asthma since I was age 3.  I started medications around age 27.  I've been on several different remedies since.  Several years ago, my physician started me on Advair, Combivent, and Singulair.  One more thing I should mention.  I smoke heavily, almost 2 packs daily.  I've tried quitting more times than can be imagined.  Oh, also, recently I started DuoNeb.  I'm guessing that only the strongest medications work with me because of cigarettes.To that end, only Combivent and Singulair work efficiently.  DuoNeb works only briefly.  Advair never worked as advertised.  If I didn't smoke, maybe it would.  A woman who got down from one of the twin towers successfully told the manufacturer that without Advair she doubts she could have survived the experience.Now, there is some question about the safety of Serevent, one of the two active ingredients in Advair.  Do you know the concern?I am age 65 and retired, live alone in a small town in Indiana.  I worked during my career inside for the Commonwealth of Kentucky in welfare.  We instituted restricted smoking during the  last few years of my career	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17171

I went to a asthma specialist and have been taking Advair 500/50, singular, allegra D daily with rescue inhaler and neublizer as needed.  My asthma symtoms are well controlled with only two other flareups since my first in one year.  Seems to work well for me. You do have to rinse your mouth after using and the price even after insurance is expensive in my view but breathing without struggling is worth it for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16985

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-09-02 00:00:00		3.5	2.5	4.0	3.0	Advair Best So Far I was diagnosed with asthma when I was a small child.  It wasn't until about 18 years ago when a graduate student that I actually had a prescribed inhaler.  Until then it really just interferred w/my life and doctors didn't pay much attention to it.  I got the Advair about two years ago because my doctor thought I was getting thrush from (among other things) chronic use of Albuterol, the salmeterol (the green inhaler for long term relief) and the inhaled steroid.  Advair is far better as it has all the meds except Albuterol in one med so is less $.  Also, only one inhaler to use and the round discus is more convenient.  But, even so, I still have to use more than the recommended dose at times and when I get bronchitis 2 or 3 or 4 times a year it just does not help.  One allergist told me that what I really have is restrictive lung disease - I can get the air out but have trouble getting enough in.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/15166
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-07-30 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Great medicine Advair is great on many levels.  First, you can go up on the dosage if you're having a flare.  Only the dosage of the inhaled corticosteroid increases.  Second, by increasing the dosage, sometimes you can avoid having to take oral prednisone, definitely a good thing.  Be sure to drink something afterwards, or gargle, to avoid the possibility of thrush.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14386

Since I have had asthma for 40 years, I have used many types of medications including giving myself shots when I lived too far from a hospital.  I have been through two big clinics in California and in Denver, CO.  I have done all the breathing treatments and taken many many test along with taking the allergy scratch tests 9 times, have used a variety of medications through the years along with several hospital stays to get the asthma under control.  I've been too shaky to sign my name, wanted to crawl out of my skin, not been able to sleep and ran my life at 100 miles an hour juggling 6 projects at a time because I was unable to slow down.  I was on 4 pill medications a day and 2 types of inhalers.  Over two years ago I started on Advair 500 twice a day for 6 months and then went down to Advair 250 twice a day.  After a year of feeling great and not taking any pills, I cut the Advair back to only one inhalation in the mornings. I have continued to feel great and have not had a bad asthma attack.  I do use a Albuterol inhaler for emergencies when I accidentally get into air pollution such as smoke or flower or perfume smells or inadvertently ingest red or yellow dye or artificial sweeteners or shell fish.I have a good vitamin routine and I remain a good detective as to what I smell and eat and I never forget to take the Advair inhalation.  Life is a joy now!- the only thing lacking is to get back to my exercise routine!ADVAIR RATES A NUMBER 10 WITH ME	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/13925

During the brief time I was on this med I did notice a slight improvement in my asthma, but this was when I was living in Central California. Once I moved out here to Portsmouth, I noticed it wasn't helping as much as it used to. That didn't mean that I was ready to discontinue using it though. Apparently the 13 year old who is also living in this house thought maybe I was considering it, because I come home one day to find the diskus lying right where I had left it except that there were now 0 dosages left when I know for a fact that there were 4 dosages left the day before and there was powder all over the mouthpiece.

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-05-21 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	Nasty stuff I'm no longer taking Advair, but I wanted to comment on it anyway. It's one of the worst medications I've ever taken. Right off the bat, my insurance company refused to pay for it. My doctor was willing to provide me with samples indefinitely, but the point was moot because the stuff never helped. The weaker dosage did nothing, and the stronger one worsened my breathing difficulty. All that plus the hassle of using the discus, drove me to try Singulair instead. All I can say is, good luck with it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12726

I definitely find when I don't take it regularly twice a day as prescribed, my symptoms get much worse. Also, with this combination, I rarely get bronchitis, which I used to get 1-2 times per year otherwise.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12393
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-04-29 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	I love my Advair! This was such a surprise when I got it! After using spaces and having to count inhalations and all the work, with the Advair diskus --I had my Serevent/ inhaled corticosteroid all in one in a compact diskus, and it even had a counter on it to show me how many puffs I'd taken.  The one draw back, especially on the higher doses is THRUSH!  Even when I rinsed my mouth out well, I still ended up with thrush the three times I had to use the higher end doses.  So now my doctor has me on a Nystation mouth wash, just in case, to prevent that happening again.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12317

Increased up to 500mcg 2 puffs 2x/day and my asthma did improve a tiny bit. What I developed was a horrendous case of oral thrush !!! I rinsed vigourosly a couple of times after using it and still developed this. I have never had this before in my life and it took a little while to figure out that I had this. My doctor took me off Advair immediately and my pulmonologist put me on Flovent 220mcg 2puffs 2x/day and I am miracuosly better than I have ever been. Have had to take meds to combat the thrush... horrible side effect !!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11892

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-03-28 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	4.0	4.0	BEWARE of side effects. My side effect snuck up on me.  I went to a new doctor and all of my medicines were changed at once.  So when I though I was having sinus pressure, due to the new medicines helping asthma, but not allergies, I ignored it. I thought could live with sinus pressure as long as I can breath.  It got slowly worse until my eyes hurt all of the time.  I went to two different eye doctors thinking it was an eye problem, but they couldn't find anything.  The pressure on my eyes was intermittent so the eye doctors didn't measure it as high when I was in their offices.  When I leaned over or did anything to cause extra eye pressure I got flashes of light.  I also got floater in both eyes. I even learned to half way sit up as I turned over at night, because I feared seeing and causing the light flashes. I did my own research and found a rare side effect from Advair of swelling of the tissue around the eyes.  I was afraid to stop taking it without another medication due to my asthma.  So I convinced my doctor that I was having this side affect and she changed me to an older inhaler with different ingredients.  Within 12 hours of stopping Advair my eye pressure faded dramatically.  Over the next year the remaining pressure and light flashes also slowly went away.  The floater however will remain since they don't fade for many years.  I also developed an occasional irregular heart beat while taking this, but I cannot be sure it was due to this drug although I suspect it. Conclusion, this drug helps asthma greatly if you are lucky enough to not suffer its side affects.  You need to be very aware because the side affects can be stealthy.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11426
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-02-27 00:00:00		3.5	1.5	5.0	3.0	Side effects with the Salmeterol component My experience with Advair was, well... &quot;meh&quot;. It didn't provide effective asthma control, through no fault of its own-- my doctor didn't prescribe a high enough dose. And the salmeterol component interfered with my sleep enough so that my doctor even further reduced the dosage. I got to know the respiratory therapists over at the local ER *real well* after that prescription change. Finally my doctor ended the Advair experiment and switched me to the Flovent inhaler (which is, essentially, &quot;Advair&quot; in traditional inhaler form and without the Salmeterol). Flovent is working very well for me.One thing though, in praise of Advair: I find that the Discus is very much easier for me to operate than a conventional inhaler when my hands and arms are stiff with arthritis. Anyone with joint impairment might want to give the Discus delivery method a try.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10916

Couldn't play with other kids for long, always in and out of the hospital. Lots of allergy triggers, stress triggers, cold air, wind. Went through the gamut of Rx available at the time; at least all the ones the drs. prescribed!  Finally had a doctor who sat down and discussed preventative meds (Flovent, Beclovent, etc.) which caused a marked improvement in my symptoms and decrease in number of severe attacks.  I was able to play softball on a recreational team, go out and run with my children.  WOW!  Progressed to where I was taking the two meds in Advair separately, and I asked the dr. if he would prescribe the Advair instead (2-$30 copays vs. 1...hmm, makes sense!!).  He was all for it.  It has been great for me; I rarely have to take my rescue inhaler (Albuterol) and usually only because I have forgotten to take my Advair.  I combine with OTC Benadryl to keep the allergies down.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10531

I couldn't inhale it right and no matter what I did I kept getting the powder all over my teeth and mouth.  It's very cumbersome to use.  It didn't work for me because I could barely get any into my lungs.  I have never had this problem with other inhalers.  I think I just can't do the disk inhalers.

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2003-12-07 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Advair Diskus I have been using Advair 100 for several years in conjunction with the Flovent inhaler.  Recently I switched to Advair 500 and have discontinued the Flovent.  This is why I say I have only been using this for a few weeks.The Advair is very easy to use, especially compared with the Flovent.  I had been using a spacer with the Flovent which meant one more thing to carry with me when I travel.I find that Advair is very effective with my asthma and has minimal side effects.  I had been having problems with hoarseness with the Flovent, but with the Advair this seems to not be a problem.  The Advair does have the problem of leaving a bad taste in my mouth, even though I rinse after each use.From a cost-effectiveness standpoint, it saves me money because I only have one copay instead of two.  If you were paying for this out of pocket, I believe the cost works out to be about the same either way.  I rated this an 8 because if you don't have a copay, this is a very expensive drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9556

Well here we are and Finally, something comes out that provides us with a safe alternative to nebs, to oral steroids, to rescue inhalers.

At the dose I need it is almost $200 a month after taxes. However, I love how convenient it is to use. I used to take 10 puffs a day of Flovent and 2 of Serevent so this one puff twice a day regieme is so much easier to comply with.

Advair is very effective in controlling my asthma attacks, in fact I never get attacks anymore. I only use my rescue inhaler (Ventolin) before exercise to stave off any attacks that I may have. Make sure you combine Advair with lots of aerobics and interval aerobics to increase you endurance and control any shortness of breath. The only side effects I get with Advair are back of the throat phelgm but all I have to do is clear my throat and all is well. Before all of this I used to wake from sleep with asthma attacks and could not run without stopping midway to hit the Ventolin. In fact I was like a crack addict going to the bathroom or other parts of the building or hitting the inhaler before I went out to prevent from getting any attacks, now I am down to 2 puffs/day before exercise or none if I don't work out that day. Ask your doctor to let you try this medicine out!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6802

I still take Singulair and still use my albuterol, but I don't use the albuterol near as often as I did before Advair.HOWEVER!  Be super-careful to rinse 'n spit after using Advair Diskus--I've had three oral thrush infections in the six weeks I've used it.

My most recent dosages were:  220 mcg Flovent (the strongest) 4 puffs twice daily, Serevent 2 puffs twice daily.  This worked great initially (at much lower Flovent dosage).  Over time, I kept increasing the amount of Flovent, but this did not control my asthma.  Eventually, I found out about the azithromycin (antibiotic) regimen at http://www.asthmastory.com and my asthma is now totally gone.  (My rating of that treatment can be found under &quot;antibiotic therapy&quot;.)

I ended up getting a long term sinus infection that I could not shake until I quit using the diskus.  Perhaps it was due to the strength of the steroid component, since generally those suppress your immune system anyway.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1926

I was constantly using my Albuteral inhaler. I was always uncomfortable, making others around me uncomfortable as well. Since my doctor started me on the Diskus, each day is something to look forward to. I only take one dose at night and one in the morning. I go all day long without feeling like I have bricks on my chest. I have not once used my Albuteral inhaler since starting the Advair. I know when I am around my animals, I will feel &quot;normal&quot; which is so much more enjoyable for all. I have not experienced any negative side effects. Per my doctor's advice, I use the Advair in the morning and night right before brushing my teeth. This ensures complete rinsing which eliminates the chance for mouth sores. For anyone who has difficulty enjoying day to day activities, I highly encourage this medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1907

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2002-06-27 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.0	Advair can do wonders for Asthma... I started using Advair about 1 year and 3 months ago. As soon as it came out, my allergist/immunologist, switched me from Flovent 220mcg, to Advair 500. I find it works best when you break the new &quot;blister&quot; each puff, to inhale as deep into the lungs, and for as long as you can hold your breath. It does, however, cause thrush and other mouth problems, from the overload, if you do not rinse and spit, or gargle EVERY time you use it. It has helped my asthma extremely. I am a severe asthmatic, taking Singulair, Albuterol, Flonase, Zyrtec-D, and have a pari neb breathing machine (to use whenever needed). I also get 3 allergy shots each week. I have found that the Advair is very beneficial, considering the severity of my asthma, and how well it has worked. If you put a price on breathing, then you should not choose Advair..In TN, my Advair 500, is about $216.00 a diskus (month). If you can make such a difference in your life by enabling yourself to breathe better, full breaths, than cost should not be compared to the results. My insurance does cover it though. I have twice had to pay cash, though, when my deductible had to be met...it only took the advair being filled to meet it....But, overall, I am 34yr. old female, and it works GREAT!! Made a great change in my everyday life. It really has....Sincerely,...	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1068

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2002-06-04 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Clever design and effective! I have used the Advair Diskus for 4 months now and have noticed that I use my rescue inhaler and aerosol machine less than previously. However, I haven't noticed the  dramatic improvment I had when I used Flovent, despite the fact that this is a combination of Flovent and Serevent according to my Pulmonary Specialist. The small window that counts remaining dosages is ingenious and leaves no guessing as to how many metered doses remain, unlike with rescue inhalers. I also love the compact disk shape as it easier to hold and carry in a purse or pocket. I DON'T like that there is a gritty residue in your mouth after each use and I recommend that you immediately rinse out your mouth or drink something. Allow at least 2 weeks to experience any benefit. Cost is around $64 and isn't available yet in generic form.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/902
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2002-05-21 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	5.0	4.5	Some odd side effects First it is very useful to know than in Europe Advair is called seretide and exists also in spray form under different dosages (125,250,500).I take it one puff 2 times a day and when my asthma gets worse I can increase it to 2 puffs 2 times a week.It really works fine, I almost don't take ventolin anymore. But all singers must know that it affects the voice as well so don't be surprised if you have some mouth dryness and a voice that goes - it's what supposed to happen apparently. You can prevent serious problems by rincing your mouth after puffs. (UPDATE: After a few months using Seretide, I found out it dries my skin, it's common thing but still real nice to know if you are using it. Ask your pharmacist for a moisturizing lotion.I also read an article on Fluticasone, that thing induces laryngitis after a prolonged use, and stops once you stop using that med.If your voice  is hoarse again it seem like a normal effect.)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/830

The reason is because I am allergic to pretty much all the narcotic medications available. It works great, but now I am having stomach problems because of it. It started out as acid reflux, which I was put on medication for a couple of years ago, then, more recently, they had to change that medication to a more potent one and a higher dose. Now I have to go have an upper and lower GI done to determine why I am having such pains in my stomach. So, if you take a lot of Ibuprofen, BE CAREFUL! It can cause many problems in the long run!I wish there was something else I could take!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54301

Nothing spectacular, but seems to help at least somewhat. I've been using it a bit more now that I've been hearing that acetaminophen can be rough on the liver, albeit in large doses.

It's a nuisance, isn't it?****** USE LORATADINE INSTEAD ******* daily, as soon as you wake up, then rest some more before becoming active for the day.  My day currently starts at 1pm.  Quite good eh? ;-).  And this is reliably just about every day now :-).  DO NOT RELAPSE - this is very serious and not good.It takes me a week or more on stomach meds for me to recover from taking 'one' Ibuprofen tablet!!! Shame though.  I really do think that the pharmaceutical industry should be doing more to reduce pain for those of who can't the current anti-inflammatories that are available.... come on drug companies......... hurry up will ya?Try to get hold of a 'short course' of steroids if all your symptoms are through the roof.  This will settle them all down again and then use the Loratadine.  This is latter stages of recovery info.If you are very sick and/or in the initial stages/relapse, use knock out on 10mg-25mg of Amitriptline nightly.ALL STAGES OF M.E.Do use holistic therapies (from a qualified and gifted practitioner if you can locate one), such as massage and 'reiki', use aromatherapy (lavender oils for relaxation - pain relief and bergamot for energy as required), natural products, good natural nutrition and exercise to stimulate blood flow to the brain to aid recovery and of course to promote seratonin output. Homeopathy may help (from registered practitioner). All toxins should be avoided. Avoid processed foods even. Meditation and yoga - when the patient is able (some years later!), may further assist recovery. Total peace and much resting is essential in the initial stages. Keeping the brain active as soon as possible, gently (i.e. some study but nothing major of course, of a subject naturally and thus 'easilly' interesting to the patient), to stimulate (brain) recovery and keep morale up, is also essential.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44969

I have to say, when I have a flare up and I get the Rheumatoid Arthritis, I need Advil every 4 hours to keep my sanity. It is the only thing that gives me temporary relief from this horrific pain (besides yukky Prednisone). Per the Doctors, it is not good for the stomach so I may be doing myself an injustice as far as the stomach goes. I believe it can cause ulcers if not taken with food.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/50606

advil	Lyme Disease	2006-09-18 00:00:00		2.0	3.0	4.0	2.5	Only good if pain is mild I use more ibuprofen than I would EVER recommend to anyone.  My pain doc likes to do acupunture and massage, and won't acknowledge that pain from active Lyme is beyond the ability of these modalities.  So, with what I can get of Rx pain meds, I take huge quantities of ibuprofen.  It helps a little with the aches and pains, and the joint inflammation.  It is hard on my stomach, especially since the irritation manifests as hunger.  Try to find a good pain management doc if ibuprofen is inadequate.  This means one who does medication management and understands Lyme.  If max doses of ibuprofen don't control the pain, you need a stronger baseline drug.  Remember, pain is extremely exhausting and fatigue is your enemy if you're fighting Lyme.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49611

The only reason I continued taking the medication for several months was to see if it was ever going to work and to keep leg swelling symptoms down.  As a person who never really took any medication before, including aspirin/tylenol/ibuprofen, I knew that I had no tolerance built up, so if a medication was going to work, it would.  The amount of pain that I have had was only recently diagnosed and the only thing that has helped relieve the pain is Lyrica in combination with Baclofen.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49377

It was quite effective and cheap, but after a while my blood pressure went up and my ankles and feet swelled terribly, which is the reason I finally gave it up.  I tried many other NSAIDS and some of them did cause me to retain water, but none of them as severely.

I would take it one to 2 hours before rising in the morning just to be able to walk. As the years went by it took more. To avoid stomach problems, i always drank at least 8 oz. water or ate something when taking every dose. When i began antibiotic therapy, i used ibuprophen along with fish oil and turmeric and other anti-inflammatory supplements to reduce inflammation so the antibiotic could reach the bacteria. After 8 months on antibiotics, i completely stopped ibuprophen. My crp is normal.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47877

I was on one of another NSAID for several years. The end result was an ulcer and bleeding into the bowel. I had to take Pepcid for 6 years and even now have to be careful of what I eat as my stomach is still sensitive. I would NEVER advise an NSAID for long term use!Update: I have since met many people who have had the bad side effects with either ulcers or bleeding in the intestines. Also problems with esophagus etc. I don'teven take Aspirin unless absolutely a must any more. I still think these are the most dangerous medications prescribed for long term use.

advil	Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; CFIDS; M.E.)	2006-07-02 00:00:00		3.5	3.5	4.5	3.5	Great migraine relief, not much else Ibuprofen helps me with the migraines that are caused by CFS and the muscle/joint pains I've got from prednisone treatment and its withdrawal, but it really doesn't do much for most of my other aches and it also doesn't affect the fever I have 24/7.I haven't really got any side effects from it, but I only take it from food and I'm careful not to take it too often. It isn't at all sedative for me at least in doses up to 800 mg (it can be sedative for some even in these amounts).Btw, did you know that ibuprofen isn't only a painkiller, it also raises blood pressure? This is a bad thing for many people and ibuprofen isn't recommended for people with hypertension, but it can actually be quite good for CFS folks who often suffer from (neurally mediated) hypotension. It's just a shame that the risk of getting ulcers is so high and that the drug begins to lose its efficacy very quickly with prolonged use.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/45464

The problem with any meds like this is that taken regularly they can cause rebound headaches and you get into such a cycle that you don't know where your migraine ends and your rebound begins.I was nearly always prescribed ibuprofen to take in combination with another med like Midrin or Fiorinal. I thought it helped a little at the very beginning of my experience with migraines, but I know the ibuprofen alone does nothing. And the combination effects have worn off for me, so that taking it at all for migraines is pointless now.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41075

advil	Irritable bowel syndrome - Alternating (IBS-A)	2006-01-23 00:00:00		3.0	4.5	4.5	3.5	Ibuprofin For IBS? I have had symptoms of IBS for more than 20 years. The first GI I consulted suggested doubling the amount of Ibuprofin. That did nothing more than the single dose. He then told me to try to think about &quot;pretty roses&quot; when I &quot;thought&quot; I was suffering from IBS. That was the last of him I saw, and IBS became another illness I just never mentioned to a new doctor. I tried everything I could think of, and nothing helped. Every six months or so I would decide it had to be food related. I would eat plain white rice for 2-3 days and then gradually add back &quot;gentle&quot; foods, yogurt, bananas, dry toast, sooner or later something would &quot;cause&quot; an attack, so I totally eliminated that food from my diet. But it would not be long before I would find myself curled in the middle of the bed thinking if it would not scare the children I would and could scream with pain for hours.Seven years ago, another corporate move and a new doctor. He sent me to a GI because he suspected GERD. The GI put me on Protonix, it immediately stopped the GERD and seemed to ease the pain of IBS!I still have the revolving bowel, but no longer have the pain. He has been all the way through my intestinal systen with an endoscope and has found nothing to indicate a physical problem. I was ready to cry when he said he had the same problem, and could find nothing to even offer much relief.Years ago, deciding no doctor had the answer, I re-potty trained my self. I did not want to spend my life in a bathroom, but I will admit to always locating a toilet in a strange place. This is not a particullarly easy thing to do, especially with the constipation. I took myself and a good book to a bathroom every two hours and sat for 15 minutes trying.I was able to return to the work world until 2002, when the Fibromyalgia became so bad I was counting a good day one I could dress myself. For the Fibro, I take Methadose. I am not sure anything inside would hurt unless I miss a med. Some	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/37078

If the little &quot;buggers&quot; (as I like to call them) are laying on a specific part of your brain, then it is my understanding that they are causing specific flare-ups in your body -- things like Bell's Palsy, Trigeminal Neuralgia, Foot Neuropathy, etc. No amount of Advil, Aleve, Aspirin, or Tylenol is going to take away the pain or the swelling. First and foremost, make sure you are seeing the correct kind of Infectious Disease Specialist about your Lyme Disease -- someone who knows what kind of meds to dispense for the symptoms you are experiencing.

advil	Osteoarthritis of the spine (Facet joint degeneration)	2005-05-30 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	3.0	3.0	Worked, but caused stomach problems I havent taken Brufen for a few years now but, when I did, I found it to be very effective as both a pain relief drug and an anti-inflamatory. I also found it to be very useful as an efficient treatment for a fever, on those rare occasions when I caught a bad cold or flu. So, as a useful drug for the treatment of the pain and inflamation caused by osteoarthritis, I found Brufen to have a very definite plus side. I would actually rate it fairly high on a scale of one to ten, probably about an eight.Unfortunately, I happened to be one of those people who has a rather sensitive stomach and duodenal lining so, if I take the drug on a regular daily basis, I very soon develop gastrointestinal problems including oesophogeal reflux (heartburn), peptic and duodenal ulcers (in less than 2 weeks). Even on regular anti-ulcer medication the Brufen still gave me problems. After having recurrent ulcer problems, which eventually led to a gastroscopy, I was taken off Brufen. In most cases it does, however, help to alleviate the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects if the drug is taken along with food and certainly make every effort to avoid taking Brufen on an empty stomach. I also understand that it is not advisable for anyone suffering from asthma to use Ibuprofen whether in pill or external gel form.I was also, however, given to believe that Brufen, at prescription strength, is an excellent, and highly sought after, treatment for hangovers. Although I didnt really imbibe enough at that time for it to be necessary to test this fact out for myself, I was assured of this by numerous, envious friends who wanted to pocket a few from my prescribed allowance! (This was prior to Brufen becoming available over the counter.)Take care now. Love and light to all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23255

It does have a few advantages, although it didn't work that well for me.  The side effects (especially stomach irritation) seemed to be less with ibuprofen than with many of the other NSAIDs.  And the price can't be beat -- this stuff is cheap, particularly if you buy the over the counter generic, then take the dosage of that you've been prescribe (usually 3-4 tablets).I took this quite frequently when I was between doctors, and it did take the edge off the pain, although I personally find other NSAIDs to be more effective.  Perhaps this is because the prostaglandin inhibiting effect of ibuprofen is not as strong as some of the others.  Overall, it's good in a pinch, but couldn't come close to tackling the truly bad pain.  Still, it's much better than taking nothing at all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16649

advil	Back pain- chronic	2004-10-26 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	4.5	0.5	Advil Ibuprofen - frequent urination bladder Ok, I know my ratings are quite low, but I want to drive home a point that Ibuprofen can be a dangerous drug (thousands die each year from bleeding in the stomach).  I do not recommend taking more than the 200 mg dose - if it does not work to reduce pain, see your Dr. - don't take more.Also, I would not recommend taking any pain medication unless it is chronic and is moderate to severe.  Miss a day of work if necessary.Briefly, I took 1000 mg of ibuprofen during a 10 hour period.  That night I experienced severe frequent urination (20x after going to bed - low volume on each void).  I had to some degree a urinary retention problem so this may have contributed to adverse reaction.  I repeated the same dose the next day and stopped.  I visited two urologists and did not receive appropriate treatment (each night I was getting up 10x per night - 120 days of little rest with no end in sight during the 120 days - I even agreed to surgery on my bladder neck during this time - made the problem worse.Finally, a third urologist prescribed Ditropan and it resolved the problem that same night - but I was in bad shape from what I considered as 120 days of torture.  In any event, stayed on Ditropan for about 3 months  - no longer taking Ditropan and frequent urination problem has not returned.  Still trying to overcome the damage that this stressful period had on me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16441

In my teens I had been mistakenly diagnosed with sinus headaches instead of migraines.  I was in the habit of taking a Tavist and 4 Advil (Motrin, Tylenol, etc) every morning when I woke up and repeating the ibuprofen or acetominophen (whenever the ibuprofen wasn't as effective I rotated between Tylenol and Advil, etc) every 4-6 hours as needed.  I did this for years because I thought it was just something I had to live with - didn't most people have sinus headaches and go on with their daily activities??  I thought i was a wimp.  Later, a new DR. correctly diagnosed me with severe migraines and tension headaches.  He indicated to me that it was far better to take a single (or 2 in combination) prescription drug to prevent the migraines than to take this qty of ibuprofen etc on such a regular basis.  According to him, I was doing far more damage to my kidneys than necesssary and not truly getting the relief I needed.  He was very right.  I would suggest talking to your DR. and asking for better options.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/15135

I have been taking Prednisone for nearly 7 years now and I despise the drug.  Rather than telling my doctor I'm having Edema (swelling) I just pop a couple of Ibuprofen or aspirins and the problem is taken care of.  Chances are, if my feet and ankles are swollen, I've been standing or walking for a significant amount of time and the swelling is not long term.

She said to avoid NSAIDS as much as possible because of the effect they had on my stomach.  Now that I think back on the time I WAS using it, I realize now that it wasn't doing anything to relieve the physical pain, it was just giving me a psychological &quot;boost&quot; and that made me FEEL like it was helping.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4643

advil	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2002-12-19 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	3.5	4.0	Worked for my RA for years In Australia and New Zealand Ibuprofen is available over the counter as 100mg tablets.  Standard adult dose is two 100mg tablets every 4 hours, though I found just 200mg per day was usually enough.  This dosage suppressed my RA inflamation for about 10 years.  Over the last few years I've needed up to 800mg per day which is a hassle to take every 4 hours.  I changed from Nurofen to Brufen which is a prescription-only slow-release 800mg tablet taken once or twice daily.  Both forms have given me no side effects provided they are taken with a good amount of food.  If I miss the food I get intestinal pain and diarroea for several hours afterwards - so if I forget the tablet I have to eat another small meal.  Unfortunately my arthritis has become quite severe and ibuprofen is no longer enough though it still provides some relief.  Several other NSAIDS have also helped me, such as Feldine and Naproxen (Naprosyn) - I'm unsure of the US brand names.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3487

The only over the counter drug that has ever worked for me was ibuprofen. My doctor, a headache specialist, told me to just go ahead and take 800mg as soon as the pain started so that the pain arc of the headache would be cut off significantly. He also wrote me a prescription for the 800mg tablets, which cost $1 for 100 pills on my insurance plan. Way cheaper than advil or anything for that purpose. Hope it helps. Norco has been the best pain reliever that I've found though. Hydrocodone with something else. You can take it and still function because it doesn't knock you out, just kind of relaxed my tense muscles and head.

Each consecutive use provides instant relief but actually damages the lining of your nasal passages.I'd never recommend to anybody. FDA should take off of market. I have had excellent results for nasal congestion with 2 other sprays: Nasalcrom (non-Rx) or Rhinocort (Rx) which do not work as quickly, but are MUCH safer.

I have long used it to treat chronic bedtime nasal congestion when laying horizontally, a condition that requires me to breath through my mouth and causes me to awake frequently.  After warnings from my MD, I have gone weeks without Afrin use but find that the bedtime congestion does not ease.  When I resume Afrin use, I also find no need to increase use beyond the once per day before bedtime.  This tells me that I am not having the dreaded rebound congestion.I have tried nasal steroid spray and nasal antihistamine spray, separately, at my MD's direction.  Neither of those treatments reduce my bedtime congestion.  I only occasionally experience seasonal allergy symptoms, at which time I use an inexpensive, OTC 12-hour antihistamine.  I do take 4 mg of generic &quot;Chlor-Trimeton&quot; every night to cope with the likely underlying allergy condition.  With this approach, I rarely have nasal congestion during the daytime and my bedtime condition is sucessfully controlled.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/45394

I wish it were a maintenance drug. In the past, I would tend to use it too often, in which case it does have the rebound effect and I must always make myself &quot;de-addict&quot; from it. Once I even had to go to the doctor in order to treat myself for overuse. Now I am wise enough to save it for only those times when I need it the most--like when I have terrible congestion from a cold, or am having an extremely stuffy nose night and cannot sleep.  I limit myself to 3, 4 or 5 days at the most, and try mainly to just take it at bedtime to get a decent night's sleep.  It works beautifully and I love how it makes me breathe!

This has been going on for 3 years now.  During the day I take a claritin and 12 hour oral decongestant.  It may be bad, but I am able to sleep at night.

The truth is, I have gone for several years with clogged passages, blowing my nose around the clock, and feeling that nasty, stuffy, infamed with infection feeling. It was so bad I bagun to wonder if I didn't have a more serious disease. I naturally suffer from sinusitisitis, however with the discomfort of a congested nose daily I begun to feel uncomfortable in my surroundings 99% of the time. I know this sounds like a bizarre story, but its true. A few days ago, browsing at the dollar store, I figured anything is worth trying, and so I bought the family dollar nasal spray. And to my chagrin, this product the rid me of all the nasal problems of nasty congestion both my throat the nose that I have been suffering from for years. I can feel myself breathing better and my sense of smell is much more acute. I feel like I have been blind for so long, but now I can see; and it is the most remarkable experience ever. I have used it for about two days, starting in the evening prior to bed, with the next use approximately 12 hours apart. I just don't understand what a difference this product has made.

afrin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2004-01-05 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	4.0	Follow the Directions It always amazes me how people misuse nasal sprays. (Before I knew better, I was guilty of this myself.) They sporadically use the steroid sprays (see my review of Flonase) and wonder why they don't work as well as they claim.  Then they overuse an OTC spray that clearly states on the bottle not to use for more than 3 days. You will get rebound congestion if you use Afrin for more than 3 days in a row.  Save Afrin for really bad allergy days or when you get a cold or sinus infection.  My doctor also told me that you can use it for 3 days skip 3 days and then use it 3 more days.  But if you're still severely congested after that, you need to see your doctor! PS If you want a spray you can use everyday to relieve stuffiness get Entsol spray. It's a saliene spray developed by an ENT.  It's aerosol so it gets in deep.  You can get it at any drugstore, but you have to ask for it.  It's non prescription, but for some reason they keep it behind the counter.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9866
afrin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2002-10-25 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	Always use as directed I used this medication many years ago for  treating my hayfever.... I found that without realizing it overtime was using it more frequently. Discusion with my a friend who was a Resident MD revealed I was addicted.. yes addicted.. not somethng I thought possible with an Over the counter medication.The addiction took the form of increase sinus congestion if I did not  use the Drug and I found I was actually using it every 2-3 hours some times more....just to get my sinus open enough to breath.My first attempt to get off was to  dilute the Afrin with sterile saline.. this did not work... My nasal congestion was so severe.. I  was having headaches and mouth breathing all the time  I ended up on Oral steriods for 2-3 weeks and a steriodal nasal spray to get off Afrin and get my Sinus congestion under control.Personally I will never use Afrin or any of the over the counter nasal sprays.I recommend that any one who does use Afrin  use it only  as directed and if the problem lasts for longer that 7 days or gets worse see your doctor immediately..Do not try to self treat. Do not make the same mistake  I did .  This Medication in my opinion is not meant for long term extended use.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2514

aldactone	Acne	2009-12-18 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	I suffered with acne all of my early teen years and into my mid 20's. I tried everything from creams to acutane and nothing worked. I would get below the skin pimples that would creat huge red bumps that woudl last for weeks at a time.  I finally went to a wondeful dermatologist who thought I had a hormone problem. Sure enough I did. She prescribed me 50 mg twice a day...I was on this dosage for about 3 years and it cleared up my skin beautifully.After the 3 years, I tried to ween my self off of aldactone This worked at first but eventually my acne came roaring back. I recently went to a new dermatologist and she prescribed me 100mg once per day and I can say I am here to stay. My skin looks the best it ever has and I have lost a few lbs too! I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is suffering from acne. No one should suffer with acne. Good Luck :)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61825

Lived on anti b's/creams/diet Nothing worked for years had injections in cyst, had bad acne scars on face &amp; body. Now I am on Aldactone 50mg, benzaclin, minocyclin.

aldactone	Acne	2007-06-21 00:00:00		4.0	4.5	5.0	4.5	I never suffered acne as a teenager, but cystic acne hit hard in my late 20s. I tried everything - I even tried Accutane, but got seriously depressed for the first time in my life and dropped it. I've been on Aldactone for several years and it has worked great for me. I still have a few outbreaks around my period, but nothing like what I used to suffer.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55074
aldactone	Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)	2006-11-09 00:00:00		0.0	3.5	3.5	1.0	Did Nothing, Cost a LOT! I tried spironolactone, and eventually, the even more expensive aldactone for several years, beginning at a low dose and ending up at 200mg per day.I had no health insurance at the time, so I was paying for this out of pocket.  it was outrageously expensive.I never saw ANY abatement in the progress of my hirsuitism or my male pattern baldness.The docs suggested higher doses, try it longer, try aldactone... nothing.  I never saw any results at all.  I do not understand why this drug is still being prescribed.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52416
aldactone	Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)	2006-09-20 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Wonderful This medicine has been life-changing for me.  I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries at age 17 and have struggled with it now for almost 20 years.  I have had chronic cystic acne since my teenage years, as well as an oily scalp, and hursuitism.  I have had to tweeze chin hairs on a daily basis.A year and a half ago I was put on spironolactone.  The cystic acne has completely gone away, my scalp is no longer excessivley oily, and I have found my moods to be a lot more grounded.  Plus, my chin hairs have decreased to the point where I only have to tweeze about once every 10 days.I also believe it has helped even out my food cravings.  In a nutshell: I feel (almost!) normal now.  Better than I have in years.I stopped taking spironolactone for about 3 months when my prescription ran out and I never called my doctor for a refill.  My cystic acne came came with a vengeance in about six weeks, the hairs came back, and I was getting terrible food cravings.  I started again about I will never stop taking spironolactone again, if I can help it.  I think that it should be every doctor's protocol to prescribe it for those with PCOS.  ( I was prescribed it only after going to my doctor for acne medicine to prepare for my wedding.  If I had not specifically requested acne medicine, despite my having PCOS, hursuitism, and elevated testosterone, I would have never been prescribed the medicine.)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49750

aldactone	Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)	2006-08-31 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Bigger boobs?? lol I use to take this pill for pco. And was on it for a few months. I did notice the facial hair come to almost a stop.I did kinda helped it in the begining. I found someone who would wax the facial hair (under chin, face, everything) And I did about 3 waxes during that time I was on it, and with the help of Spironolactone, I think 3-4 months most the hair growth had stoped. Waxing really really slows it down itself, but adding the Sprironolactone seem to be a mega bonus together. (Which was way better then the 5 oclock shadow ever day)THE ONLY problem was when money got tight and I couldnt keep getting all the meds and waxes. It did grow back. Im not sure if I had been able to keep up the treatment would it have completly took care of the problem or not. But my Oddest side effect from the pill was my boobs were getting bigger lol. I have NOOOO clue why. Or if I was just a fluke in the bunch. But they seem to go up a cup size or two.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48549

I stopped using the doxycline because of reports with it's link with breast cancer. I have a history of breast problems and my doctor decided to try the spironilactone.  It turned out to be my miracle drug.  Needless to say, we both were happy with the results. Presetly, I have been diagnoised with Non Hodgkins Lymphoma and my oncologist has decided to leave off this drug for the time being. I am presently using topical Clyndamycine and having pretty good results.  However, they do not compare to the spironalactone.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/43886

Within a couple of days of starting Aldactone, my scalp wasn't oily anymore and the cystic acne on my face stopped, which has helped with my self-esteem.

I stuggled with awful cystic acne all through puberty and adolescence, and even into early adulthood.  I tried all the lotions, potions, and antibiotics and the only thing they did was make my skin worse.  Finally, I found the greatest dermatologist who had me try this and within a few weeks I saw drastic improvements.  Now my skin is so great that I rarely use any makeup on it.

alesse	Birth Control	2012-05-08 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	3.5	0.5	I participated in a clinical study, I only took 2 pills over a period of 1 month. It triggered the most severe migraines possible. It's been 2 weeks now, after I took the second pill. I have had 4 attacks of migraines, and I felt terrible between them (dizziness, heavy head, tiredness, sleepiness, loss of apprtite, loss of sleep, depression, pounding head) I am scared now that these side effects will never go away.	-
alesse	Acne vulgaris	2010-12-03 00:00:00		2.5	3.5	5.0	3.0	My doctor put me on Alesse because I was looking for a birth control and an acne treatment (I had moderate adult acne on my cheeks). The first three months, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. No mood swings, no weight gain, clear skin, etc. Then approaching my period on the fouth month, I woke up with 6 acne cysts on my chin, jaw and lower cheek. I had never had them before, and they were terrible! A couple months on now and I'm still getting the pre-period cystic breakout every month. Switching to Diane-35 next month.	-

alesse	Acne vulgaris	2010-01-14 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	0.5	2.0	I have suffered for Acne since the age of 14 and I am now 27. When I was a teenager I used Diane35, which gave me the best skin after 6 months of use but I had to come off it because of aura migraines. This is when my skin broke out at its worst. Anyway back to Aleese....My Dr prescribed it because it is a low dose pill and therefore safer for migraine sufferers. The day I took it I was sick to my stomach and had bad headaches so, I decided to take it with my dinner the next day so I could try and sleep through the worst. I felt like like this for about a week and then the side effects subsided. I then started to have breakthrough bleeding after intercourse and it was very heavy. My acne did not get worse during my first packet but it was very bad during my 7 day break. At this point I was not sure if I was starting to get a hairy lip and chin so, I decided to keep an eye on it. For sure, I was growing many blond long hairs and I came off it immediately.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/62005
alesse	Birth Control	2009-05-08 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	I took this pill for 5 years -- from age 25 to 30 and was very happy with it.  In retrospect, I think I maybe became slightly more emotional during PMS, but I'm not sure this is the case and it didn't have much of an effect on my life.  Every person reacts differently, but I would recommend giving this pill a try.  I was able to get pregnant easily after going off Alesse and am now shopping for a birth control method that can be used while breastfeeding (after 2nd child).  I don't doubt others have had negative experiences with Alesse, as with any other hormonal form of birth control.  For others examining their options, however, these extreme reactions seen here are not generally the norm.  Good luck.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59979

And the miserable experience of Lupron. Do NOT get a laparoscopy without first trying the pill.I suffered for 20 years and got gerd from taking n-saids for pain all these years when I could have just taken the pill.  It kind of makes you wonder why none of my other Physicians never mentioned it.  Did they want the payout they would get from my surgery?  Try the pill first.  If it doesn't work, try a different brand or dosage before letting anyone inject hormones or lasering the insides of your body.

alesse	Birth Control	2006-08-02 00:00:00		5.0	0.0	5.0	3.5	Hello pill, good-bye health... Alesse, like any pill, does its job; I don't think anyone would dispute that. However, I feel that Alesse  the first birth control pill I ever took  was also the start of my health's decline. I was 25, a virgin (by choice), and started the pill a month before my wedding in 2002. I had never been to a doctor before IN MY LIFE...besides the one time to get the Alesse prescription. That gives you an idea of the state of my health before I started the pill. However, in a matter of a couple months, I went from a vibrant 20-something, to a miserable ill wreck, who could barely make it through the day without a nap. The mood swings were horrible, not to mention the extreme fatigue, GI afflictions, severe bloating, and the horrible cyst acne it caused (isn't it suppose to HELP acne?).  Also, I have never had trouble with my weight, as I eat healthy and exercise. But as soon as I started the pill, I gained about 15 lbs. in a month (this without a change in eating habits or exercise). I've been gaining a bit ever since, and cannot seem to lose it. Also, my thryoid became more sluggish during this time period (I had several blood tests a few months into starting the pill), contributing to my extreme exhaustion, and weight gain. I wanted to die. My doctor (a man) had told me that the pill had very few  if any  side effects. Ladies, please: NEVER believe this. Everyone's body is different, and everyone is affected by medication differently. Who is a doctor to say it wont affect you aversely. I truly believe there are women out there who just *cannot* take the pill ...ANY b/c pill. I feel I'm one of them.   Anyhow, I felt like a freak after talking with my doctor, because according to him, I shouldn't have any problems with the pill. I got loads of blood tests done, which all came back fine. I couldn't figure what was causing my health problems all of a sudden. I still feel horrible and somewhat embarrassed that I decided to	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/46584

I started taking Allese in July of 2003, the first month was fantastic, no side effects at all. The second month I had severe PMS which I had not previously ever had. Soon, I started having which I can only describe as the most horrific PMDD one could ever imagine. I almost filed for divorce from my amazing husband because he said he preferred one car to the car I preferred. Soon, all I could do was cry, all day long, I remember thinking... I'm so young, and being so terribly sad that I had 60 or so years left to live.One day I spoke with my father who thought I could be having some strange reaction to something I was taking (as I have always been a happy person) I slowly stopped various vitamins and finally Allese. Within 24 hours of stopping the pill, I was &quot;myself again&quot; all the dark thoughts had stopped, my head was so clear and light.I remained happy until my period came that month. All of a sudden the hormones started raging and I became so anxious that I was going to feel so bad again that I almost went into shock. I had to stay out of work and of course went to the Doctor. Though he said &quot;it is very unlikely for the pill to do this...&quot; He gave me Lexapro to take, which now two years later I am still on because of flares of depression. I truly feel that this pill took a huge part of my life, happiness and self esteem. I am doing very well now and am a happy person but because of Allese I will have to struggle to be happy for possibly the rest of my life.I know some people love Allese, but I cannot tell you how many people I know who have had similar stories to mine. If it works for you, wonderful but please if you have any doubts get off even if it is for a short time, please let me be an example and do not let this or any other pill ruin your life.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/28100

It did well with reducing the pain and I was able to carry on a normal type lifestyle (when I wasn't being moody or emotional about stupid little things).

I did not know I had endo and didn't have extreme pain with my period until after trying the depo shot. Then went off the pill to try to get pregnant and the pain got worse and worse, so maybe the pill helped all those years and I didn't know it. I had very extensive endo that was diagnosed/treated via surgery just one year after stopping the pill. How does the pill or any other hormone really affect endo? Does it really stop it from growing or just mask the advancement. So how did it get that bad after only one year off of hormonal birth control? (I was on it for a total of 12 years) My doctor could not say. I don't know if the pill is good or bad.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11928

Now the only pain killer I can take is Vicodin - (I'm treated through my chronic pain clinic where I live).  Vicodin takes the edge off my pain, but does not entirely stop the pain like Naprosyn did.  I would give anything if I could once again take an anti-inflammatory med, but alas - no more.

It worked for me for the time I was taking it.I did not want to accept the fact that after spending thousands of dollars to become pain free the year prior to falling and hurting my back again, I was right back to the same old pain only this time the pain went down my leg to my foot causing footdrop and constant burning in my thigh, shin and great toe.  I did this to releive the pain KNOWING THAT LONG TERM USE AT THIS RATE WAS VERY BAD FOR MY LIVER AND OTHER ORGANS. I was just hoping that it would go away, which it didn't.  I ended up going to the Dr. getting a MRI and finding out I had three herniated discs.  The Dr. said I was lucky that I did not damage my internal organs with such a high dosage.  I had to get blood tests to make sure I did not damage anything.   I do recommend taking the correct dosage for short term relief,  or talk to your Dr. about getting a prescription for long term use.  The prescription strenght does not have sodium in it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49151

Since menopause my migraines have morfed into intermittent tension headaches with neck muscle pain and extreme muscle tightness.I have added clonazepam (Klonopin; a benzo) if I get a really bad episode.  The combination of Aleve and clonazepam was very effective for me. A severe headache requires 2mgs. of cloazepam but most headaches that require it need only 1 mg. I don't worry about addiction as it is not a daily occurrence and I go long streches with any any headaches. I have used this for at least three years and, so far, have had not craving for clonazepam. If I take Aleve on an empty stomach I sometimes get a little stomach pain.

aleve	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2006-01-07 00:00:00		2.5	1.5	4.5	2.5	Helpful but not exactly for Fibro I learned to take Naproxen from an orthopedics physician who diagnosed me with osteoarthritis in my knees. I wanted something stronger than the tylenol which I was taking in rather high doses to dull the pain. He explained that lower doses taken EVERY DAY would have a more beneficial effect, because of how naproxen works, inhibiting some special pain reception substance in the body. He also said I needed to have tests every 6 months to make sure that there were no lasting side effects to kidneys and liver.  It took several days before the effect kicked in, but he was right. For me, at least, it helps the fibro in the sense that it lowers my 'average' pain. Now, I only take 'other' painkillers when something really spikes.. a sprain, an injury, a migraine.Minor swelling and water retention are inconvenient side effects of long term naproxen use. Have to make sure to drink lots of water.So, while I find naproxen useful, it isn't a direct help with my fibromyalgia and doesn't take away the painful lumps and bumps and soreness, it does lessen my entire pain-load overall.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35717

aleve	Osteoarthritis	2006-01-03 00:00:00		4.0	0.0	4.0	3.0	Alleve for Osteoarthritis The above dates are approximate, but I took two (2)Aleve tablets twice per day for severe osteoarthritis, not just one per dose. I was diagnosed with &quot;severe generative joint disease&quot;, in my late 20's and had a hip replacement at the age of 48. I may need the other other replaced in the future and have arthritis in most, if not all, of my joints.  Aleve worked pretty well for the pain, but over time it gave me chronic heart palpitations and terrible upset stomachs, even though I always took it with food or on a full stomach. I've since switched to Tylenol Arthritis which works just as well without the above-mentioned side effects. I still have some level of chronic arthritis pain, but it's not chronically debilitating.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35356
aleve	Tension headaches	2005-12-27 00:00:00		4.0	2.5	5.0	4.0	Seems to work better when taken regularly I try to ration the nsaids I take since I've only got one liver and two kidneys.  I take a whole generic Aleve in the AM with breakfast and a half one with dinner.  Most days this does the trick for my chronic headaches.  As long as I maintain my regular sleep patterns and watch what I eat and drink I'm pretty pain free.  When I miss a dose or have to supplement with Tylenol or something else to get thru the day (which throws my regular breakfast/dinner dose schedule off) it seems to mess up the effectiveness of the naproxen.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35089

aleve	Lyme Disease	2005-11-27 00:00:00		0.0	5.0	5.0	2.0	Didn't Help My Neurological-Based Symptoms If you have Lyme Disease that is affecting you neurologically then products such as Aleve, Advil, Aspirin, etc., are virtually worthless. I thought it was &quot;all in my head&quot; until my Infectious Disease Specialist confirmed that the Neurontin I had been taking for Epilepsy/Complex Partial Seizures was more effectively relieving the symptoms associated with Lyme -- Bell's Palsy and Trigeminal Neuralgia simply because they were nerve related. (That said, before you take my word as the Bible, ask your own Pharmacist and Physician.) However, all I can tell you as a lay person is that in many respects as a result of not taking over-the-counter medications to relieve pain I believe I am a much healthier person. God knows I already take enough prescriptions meds!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/32538

I got intense and debilitating headaches from it.  If I reduced the dosage to 1/4 of the proescribed amount the headache dulled enough to barely function.  Truly, I got much more pain from the drug than it ever relieved.  My orthopedic surgeon told me don't take it - you can't tolerate enough to do you any good and your side effects are scary.  He said his hand would never write me any NSAID prescription because he could not treat my side effects.  He thought they were affecting my neurological system.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31354

Each time I used it, my blood sugar would drop very low, and I would be very weak, shaky, dizzy and nauseous. These symptoms were so acute, I had to go to bed and stay there until the drug ran its course.  Only after Aleve was out of my system would I feel better.

For FMS, it is like taking a water pill.  Completely ineffective.  It was less expensive, though, than most drugs, and I like that a lot.  However, to get any help from it at all, I had to have 2 pills every four hours.  I don't think it is cost effective that way  :)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/147

I'm concerned that it may be a factor in recent episodes of wet macular degeneration (a blood leakage problem). For that reason I stopped taking Aleve. My bruising has stopped and my MD issues seem to be clearing some. Unfortunately my arthritis pain has greatly worsened. See my comments on Tylenol for arthritis and Synvisc.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18145

The doctor asked me to try taking Aleve, and to my complete surprise, it did the trick.  One Aleve a day actually keeps me mobile.  Without it, my muscles freeze up within two hours and can hardly move.  It usually wears off late in the evening, so I rarely take more than 1/day.  None of my doctors have been able to explain why it works at the 1/day level or what it's affecting, but it definitely does something!  I highly recommend Naproxen Sodium (generic Aleve) or Aleve to anyone who can tolerate it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17206

aleve	Migraine	2003-04-18 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	3.5	5.0	The only thing that works on my migraines When Aleve first came on the market, I was ecstatic. I'd been buying prescription naproxen for several years to treat my migraine headaches, and had found it the only medication that seemed to alleviate the pain, since aspirin, Tylenol, Advil, and all other such drugs I'd tried had been competely ineffectual. Since the arrival of Aleve on the over-the-counter pain reliever market, I have relied on it exclusively to treat my migraines, and find that taking 440 mg consistently prevents the migraine pain (if taken early enough) or alleviates it (if taken after the pain has already become bad). I don't know what I'd do without it, and I've never experienced any side-effects, even the nausea that I often experience with other pain-relievers. The only problem I have with Aleve is that it cannot be taken as frequently as other pain relievers (only once every 8-12 hours), and so if I don't take enough on the first try, I'm stuck with the pain until enough time has passed. So when I'm having my absolute worst migraines, I sometimes take 660 mg (3 caplets) at once -- since that is similar to the prescription dosage I was taking for so many years -- though that exceeds the dosage recommended on the bottle. I only do that when the pain is really excruciating, though, because 440 mg (2 caplets) usually does the job just fine.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5672

Of course there are days when Aleve just isn't enough - But for someone like me (with no health insurance and limited funds available for treatment) it works well enough to have become a part of my daily routine. taking scheduled doses rather than just dosing in response to pain seems to be more effective for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1670

alprazolam	Anxiety	2012-05-01 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	The strongest, fastest acting, and most effective Benzo on the market. Only issue is when first taking it, it will make you want to sleep and very tired. The best strategy to combat this is take a smaller dosage, and always take with plenty of caffeine. Starbucks drip coffee has the most amount of caffeine out of any coffee, average coffee has 80-140mg, a medium and large Starbucks are 330/430 respectively. Get the milder coffee it has more caffeine. Never start your day with it, your body needs at least 1.5 hours to wake up. Also, don't take everyday, an addiction to Benzo's is the hardest drug addiction to quit (yes, harder than heroin).	-

In fact I get 90 pills once a year and they last the whole year and then some. My anxiety wasn't only situational but with therapy and treating my ADHD I have it under better control. I know the addictive nature of this drug and that being ADHD means that addictive behavior is something that I have to guard against.

I am currently taking clonazepam, but it does not stop the over-production of adrenaline. Alprazolam  did.

When I told my doctor those problems, she told me  I shouldn't be worried about that. But it was really bother me, so I decided not to take it everyday.  Occasionally, I  take it for helping me fall to sleep. As a sleeping aid, Alprazolam is really effective. When I couldn't sleep, I took it and in minutes I felt to sleep for all night long.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56761

alprazolam	Panic Disorder	2007-04-20 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	4.5	Rules for finding the right psychiatrist:  *HMOs are generally the enemy.  They are interested in spending the least amount of money on you.  *Use a recommendation or physician referral service to locate a psychiatrist that is experienced or specializes in anxiety disorders.  *Avoid psychologists or other professionals who believe only cognitive and/or relaxation therapies are the final solution.  *Interview the doctor personally(even for 2 or 3 minutes) and specifically ask about Xanax therapy.  *Try to find a psychiatrist who works with severe mental health patients in a hospital setting.  *In my experience only 25% of psychiatrists are qualified to help someone with severe panic/anxiety attacks - the rest of them are either in- experienced, afraid to prescribe the medicine, only in it for the money, or specialize in some other mental illness therapy.  *Helping yourself will be expensive.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54724
ambien	Insomnia	2012-09-25 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	2.5	I can fall asleep most of the time but then 2 hours later I am wide awake, so take a pill.  I can get 5 hours of sleep which for me is good.  Sometimes I take 1/2 pill.	-
ambien	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2012-09-12 00:00:00		3.0	1.0	4.0	0.5	I have severe Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue in conjunction with lupus. Doc gave me 10mg at night to help with the sleep problems and it worked great. That is until I started gaining around 6-10 pounds a month without changing any of my eating habits during the day (I eat healthy, no sugars, no anything, and exercise daily). I have never been over 125 pounds except when I was pregnant and this terrified me. When my 17 yr old daughter told me I was getting up in the middle of the night, cooking meals and eating it all I realized the Ambien was the cause (waking up at the beach in my car and not remembering driving 8 miles of major roads helped solidify my decision). I'm going off it and praying I will lose the weight (I'm 5'3&quot; and 158 pounds now, compared to my normal 125 pounds). I'd rather be awake for days dealing with my FM pain than dead from a caloric heart attack at 50 or drive my daughter to school and not remember doing it.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2012-08-15 00:00:00		3.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	I have been on Ambien for years and it did really help me at one time. I take 20 mgs a night due to my severe insomnia and that is in addition to benzos to relax my mind. The ambien used to really help me sleep, but I suppose I've built a tolerance to it and it is time to try something new. I am eager to see what the CR has to offer. I wake often with the ambien and have tried suppementing it with melatonin per my Dr. I have also done strange things over the years, sleep cooking, online shopping, forgetting conversations in which I'm told I say odd things... but as far as my health goes it hasn't hurt me. Just some drowsiness sometimes the next day. I say its worth a shot! It was for me, it just ran its course.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2012-06-27 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	4.0	I have never gotten very good sleep, but when I developed Generalized Anxiety Disorder my sleep plummeted to two hours a night. I would lie awake for several hours, fall asleep for 45 minutes, wake up, have a panic attack, finally fall asleep for 45 more minutes, and then wake up unrested. I get especially anxious at night. Along with an SNRI, (part of an) Ambien helped me become less anxious and fall asleep. Sometimes I would wake up and have to take another piece, but I began to sleep much better. My doctor said it was much less addictive than a benzodiazipine and if it helped both my anxiety and insomnia, I should continue taking it. It may not work as well as when I first started, but it still works for me. My only worry is that I do feel I can't sleep without it, but that is probably because I have such severe anxiety at night before I go to bed. I've also discovered what it is like to sleep well, after dozens of years of sleeping poorly, and I don't want to go back to that!	-
ambien	Insomnia	2012-03-04 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	To avoid a Traumatic Brain Injury and coma with years of rehab, there are two things you must know to survive this drug. 1- I did not get a tired feeling for hours after ingesting. 2- When I did go to bed later, I immediately fell asleep, as in pasted out. This combination caused my TBI: After working late, I took a 10mg Ambien. A couple of hours later I got a call from work and had to go back in. As I walked to my car, I bent over to pick up a piece of paper and passed out hitting my head on the concrete causing bleeding around my brain. A week later I could see again as I was moved from intensive care to a rehab hospital. I was a healthy 62 year old at the time.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2011-11-09 00:00:00		1.5	4.5	5.0	0.5	When I first used Ambien it was wonderful, I slept great. Then I found after about a week that it was not working like it was originally.  I even went to taking it only on a Friday night so I could get one good nights sleep. It only helped slightly. I guess your system just get use to it fast. My dosage was 12.5 mg.	-

ambien	Insomnia	2011-07-23 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	5.0	0.5	After being on only 5 mg for about 5 months I developed EXTREME itching of torso, legs, arms.  Tried Cortisones, Benadryl, alcohol, bleach, Calamine, and tea tree oil, and more more more.  No bumps or hives.  Couldn't wear underwear, own sweat made the itch and prickling and needles worse.  Stayed indoors with air on.  Took 3 cool showers day, changed sheets daily, bombed for bugs, changed detergent...then on internet someone said it caused her itching.  Stopped cold turkey, 2 wk ago,soooo much better, I thought I would kill myself over this condition. Have not oppened new bottle.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2011-05-28 00:00:00		5.0	2.0	5.0	5.0	I have taken Ambien for 10 years and honestly I believe that I would be dead if I didn't take Ambien. I was getting an hour and a half sleep each night prior to taking Ambien and could not function during the day. I take 10mg every night and am now I am able to get six hours of sleep and feel completely rested. I have tried every kind of sleep medication and have insomnia so severe that I even have to take a partial dose to be able to take a nap when I am really tired. I have learned to take this medication and get right in bed or I do odd things with no memory of them(email &amp; text people, eat, purchase items off of the internet).	-
ambien	Insomnia	2011-05-19 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	1.5	I took the 12.5mg Ambien CR to help me sleep through the pain of torn ligaments in my knee.  It worked great to help me sleep when previously any movement during the night would wake me up. At first there were no noticable side effects, aside from the occasional bizzare dream. I stopped taking it when I woke up on a flight to Albuquerque, it seems that I had driven to the airport, purchased a ticket, and boarded the flight. The really odd part of this is that I don't know anybody in Albuquerque, and had no reason to go there.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2011-03-30 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Ambien has helped my husband and I tremendously. We have had no problems. A piece of helpful information.  Ambien also came in 12.5CR which is time released.  This is more effective for some, as it generally helps you stay asleep all night.  However, they no longer make the name brand, it only comes in generic which is Zolpidem Tart ER 12.5mg (also time released).  It works just as well and is cheaper. If you have insurance you could pay as little as $7.00 depending on your plan.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2011-03-22 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	2.0	BE CAREFUL, the major pharmacy's are buying generic Zolpidem that is orange colored and tiny oblong pill, and they switch you automatically to this medication without letting you know, IT DOES NOT WORK IT IS LIKE TAKING A SUGAR PILL, it says 10 mg on the front with a logo on the back and is called Zolpidem Tarraet Logo, DO NOT LET THEM SWITCH YOU!!!!  It is junk, shouldnt even be sold and the insurance companies shouldnt pay for that junk!!!  I think it is not a real zolpidem and those big chains are buying up loads of it.  As a person who lives with Lyme Disease and Zolpidem has always worked fine for me until Walgreens switched me to that.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2011-03-17 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I nave used ambien for past couple of years to deal with increasing hot flashes and emotional distress. Usually split 10 mg tab is enough to induce sleep but not always, have not done anything weird while taking it. Still do not sleep longer than 5 hrs but is better than nothing. and able to work full time without feeling groggy half the next day as with other medications.	-
ambien	Bipolar II disorder	2011-02-07 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	4.5	3.5	I take 10 mg (generic) at night around 11 pm.  It usually takes about 40 mins to kick in.  If I don't go to bed right away I will do stuff that I don't remember.  I usually clean thank goodness cause I've heard of people actually going out and driving.  I will also have a conversation with my boyfriend that I won't remember any of it.  I've heard that its kind of like a truth-serum.  But it does help me fall and stay asleep.  I do feel groggy in the morning sometimes.  It is also cheap to get.  I have been taking this for about a year.  This and one other sleep med has worked for me.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2011-02-06 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	5.0	5.0	Major depression and anxiety 3yrs ago due to traumatic life experience. I lost 60 pounds in 3 months but was able to work only b/c I knew if I could have sleep that I could make it through anything in my life. Ambien is the only medication that would let me sleep. I could not tolerate antidepressant...maybe didn't give it chance but could not handle zombie feeling. I survived with ambien for sleep and rare xanax for anxiety. With Ambien, I go to sleep and don't dream for 4-6 hrs. My dreams wake me up but I am fine with the amount of sleep that I get.  I still take ambien 10mg--not extended.. probably 5 times a week and maybe I will always .... if I can sleep, I can make it through the day.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2011-01-21 00:00:00		0.5	5.0	5.0	0.5	I can use 10mg. and still be awake for 24 hours or more.Once in awhile if i chew it and take it with liquid it'll help me sleep.I've heard Trizepam works great.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2010-10-03 00:00:00		3.0	1.0	4.5	0.5	Started taking 10Mg in December, would wake up in the morning realizing I had been quite busy during the night.  Started taking only twice a week.  The last one I took, in February, I remember taking the pill, but my next memory is being in handcuffs in the back of a police car.  According to witnesses I was driving erractically before I hit a pole (thank God only me and my care suffered damages.  This happened on the corner of a major intersection - No telling what could have happened.  DO NOT TAKE THIS IF YOU LIVE ALONE!!!	-
ambien	Insomnia	2010-09-17 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	5.0	4.0	I have used 12.5 mg. of Ambien CR for a few years. I have become reliant on it to fall asleep. In addition to that I frequently get up at night and eat or work on the computer with little knowledge of it the next day. I have also occasionally had sex with my husband with no memory of it the next day. I like it to get the needed sleep but the side effects are strange.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2010-08-30 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	4.0	Ambien is the only sleep aid I've found to  help with my occasional insomnia. The other treatments tried were warm milk, foods that were suppose to help with sleep (turkey, honey,bananas, etc.), over the counter sleep aids (Excedrin pm, Tylenol pm , etc),melatonin (I had nightmares at night taking melatonnin),and other prescription sleep aids. None of these worked for me like ambien. I've found that the 10 mg is too much for my body, so I take half of the 5 mg at night. Best sleep I can get and I wake up refreshed and ready for the day.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2010-06-13 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	My husband takes Ambien but it causes a kind of amnesia. He does roams around the house, runs into walls, falls, and wakes me up to give me something to eat. He sometimes gets food all over his side of the bed from eating in his sleep. One night he went downstairs to the kitchen, got out the blender, assembled ingredients for Pina Coladas, made a pitcher full, filled up glasses, left them on the counter and went back up to bed. He doesn't remember any of these things in the morning. It would be funny if it weren't scary. Thank goodness, we have a burglar alarm system, so I would know if he were to go outside.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2010-06-13 00:00:00		3.0	3.5	5.0	3.0	I've taken this drug to help me sleep. It gets me to sleep quickly, butit does not keep me asleep throughout the night.I also will be tired in the morning and sometimes get dizzy during theday from this drug. I have to take the smallest amount now, I cut the pillso I can get only 3 mg, otherwise it's too much for my 110 lb body.Use only as directed and try other means to get to sleep that are moreeasy and natural to your body. And women, try some hormones, thebio-identical ones to balance your system, that might be why youcan't sleep. They are really helping me.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2010-03-30 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	5.0	0.5	This drug never kept me asleep more than 4 hours which I thought was odd.  It got me to sleep but did not keep me there.  Also, I'd wake myself up talking in my sleep.  I'd feel spacey and weird and dizzy.  I don't like the drug and don't plan on trying it anymore.	-
ambien	Insomnia	2010-01-19 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	I've been using this Ambien for months now and it really works for me. I am very happy with the result of this product on me. I got this drug from www.medsheaven.com.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/62044
ambien	Insomnia	2010-01-05 00:00:00		3.0	1.0	0.5	0.5	I used Ambien for 5 months and ended up at ER non responsive one morning, stopped breathing, I was lucky my girlfriend found me!I would not reccomend this drug to anybody!There are other alternatives such as Xanax, Ativan or Lunesta instead. Ambien is dangerous	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61932
ambien	Insomnia	2009-09-28 00:00:00		0.5	4.5	4.5	1.0	took ambien for insomnia, 4 hours after taking it, i was still wondering when i would fall asleep, and once i did fall asleep, i was up every 2 hours anyways. it just didnt work for me	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61167
ambien	Insomnia	2009-09-13 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	3.0	2.5	Let's just say, ambien works VERY well to put you asleep (if you have an empty stomach).  But it has so many side effects...particularly intense visual hallucinations.  If I went to bed after I took it I found myself walking around and seeing LSD like hallucinations (though these were more intense visual experiences than LSD).  Like my curtains with vines on them began to spread up over the wall and my chairs started crumbling and there were faces in the windows.  Once I even found myself staring over a lake and almost fell in.  Thankfully thunder knocked me into 'reality' where I quickly walked back in and woke up on the floor.  Very intense drug...don't ever take more than 1 on an empty stomach or you WILL sleep walk.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61038
ambien	Insomnia	2009-09-03 00:00:00		1.5	1.5	3.0	1.5	I only have a couple nights' experience with this drug, but so far all it has done for me is help me fall asleep for a brief period of time.  I soon wake up, feeling stoned yet wired, and almost disconnected from everything.  I will note that my insomnia started recently after my doctor stopped Seroquel after about five years of treatment.  Perhaps my system is just too messed up right now, but Ambien does not seem like it is the way to go for me personally.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60960
ambien	Insomnia	2009-08-18 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	2.5	2.5	Take EXACTLY as prescribed, I warn all of you. Take one at bedtime only. Go straight to bed. Ambien isn't so much a sleep aid as a mood alterer like Ativan. If you stay up you will feel very mellow and get used to the feeling. If you wake up do not take another. Do not take if your insomnia is due to serious and deep anxiety. Better to take a heavy sedative like Seroquel.I took Ambien when I was going thru a devastating job loss and &quot;needed to sleep&quot; Soon Ambien was the only escape from my pain, and I was taking 10 mg, every four hours 24 hours a day for a week.  I ended up in an emergency room. I went thru a 48 hour detox that was like a trip to Hell and back.Ambien, used properly, and temporarily, is a good drug. But BE VERY CAREFUL.Don't go thru what I did.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60834
ambien	Insomnia	2009-08-13 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	My dr. prescribed 10 mg ambien for me instead of hormones for my night sweats.  I was waking up 20 times a night burning up!  With the ambien I just sleep right through most of them.  It has been wonderful.  But like so many others have said, you must go to bed soon after taking it or you will do strange things that you won't remember.  My husband gained 30 pounds before we realized he was eating chips, ice cream, etc. after taking his ambien.  Since I go to bed earlier than he does, I didn't catch on for a while.  I guess this might happen with any drug that sedates.  Overall, I would recommend ambien for insomnia.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60796
ambien	Insomnia	2009-07-29 00:00:00		3.0	4.5	5.0	3.5	I was prescribed 10-20 mg as needed for insomnia. Ambien only worked the first night where I felt like I was slowly slipping into a dream (pleasantly). It can definitely help you sleep through the night. The only problem I think I have had off of it is increased urine production. I wake up every morning I take this with a full bladder haha. It still isn't as strong as I need to help me sleep, but I would recommend it to someone with less severe insomnia. No other side effects, except the [mild] grogginess in the morning.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60677
ambien	Insomnia	2009-07-25 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	3.0	I loved ambien.  I took it several times to get back into normal sleep patterns because I suffer from chronic insomnia.  I loved it because it made me fall asleep quickly and reliably.  I had to quit taking it because I noticed that it caused me to start getting migraines again.  I would rather stay awake and be exhausted than get migraines.  Since I can't take ambien anymore, now I take one benedryl and on 5mg melatonin to go to sleep every night.  Although these don't put me to sleep like a rock, I do get drowsy and can go to sleep most nights, and I have no side effects from these.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60647
ambien	Insomnia	2009-07-14 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	2.5	0.5	HATED IT!!!!!  I had insomnia for years and tried lots of stuff, over the counter and prescription.  I would rather be up all night than take Ambien.  It didn't put me to sleep so much as make me unconcious for a few hours.  I still woke up feeling like I hadn't slept.  If I took it for more than one night I would start feeling depressed as well.  It's better to treat the cause of the insomnia (usually depression or anviety) than the insomnia.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60554
ambien	Insomnia	2009-06-12 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	Love it..except when I wake up the next morning and ppl tell me all the crazy things I was doing and saying ;) eek	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60300
ambien	Insomnia	2009-03-29 00:00:00		2.0	2.5	2.5	2.5	I've been having problems staying asleep - I can fall asleep with no problem, but i wake up after 4 hours and cant get back to sleep.  I was just precribed Zolpidem 10mg (generic Ambien) for this problem, and instructed to take 1/2 to 1 per night. The first night I took 1/2, and though completely exhausted, i couldnt get to sleep at all! I finally took the 2nd half and got 6 hours of sleep. Last night, I took the entire 10mg to begin with, and once again, I couldnt get to sleep for hours. After reading other reviews and my own experience, I'm scared to try again.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59649
ambien	Insomnia	2009-02-24 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	4.5	3.5	I just started using Ambien last week after a loved one passed away and I had a hard time falling asleep.  It will make you fall asleep, but I always wake up a few hours later no longer tired at all, and then I still experience the same restlessness and sleeplessness.  Plus, i have had the WORST headaches on this medication.  They last all day and they're like a vice all the way around my head.  If you're just wanting something to help you fall asleep, this is a good medication.  If you're wanting to stay asleep or feel overall better, this probably isn't for you.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59327
ambien	Insomnia	2009-01-27 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	Ambien is probably the best anti-insomnia drug there is out there. Unisom, benadryl, trazodone don't compare. Makes me have a euphoric, dizzy/drunken like feeling most the time before it puts me to sleep. It relaxes you often too. I take 10mg, the highest dose. I highly recommend it. =)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59107

ambien	Insomnia	2009-01-06 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	I first tried Ambien about 5 years ago and it worked like a charm! There were a handful of 'episodes' when I did things that I could not remember. They were usually returned to memory in pieces the next day. My doctor wrote me a prescription a few days ago and I received the generic brand Zolpediem. It does nothing. I get the same, or better results with Tylenol PM. But Ambien 10mg is the best for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58928

ambien	Insomnia	2008-12-18 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I work three  night shifts per week, but they are never the same nights each week nor are they always consecutive.  I have been taking Ambien   2-3 times per week for the last 3  years, with no increase in dosage.   I have never had any ill side effects from this medication.  I do not  take it on my days off or if it isn't essential for sleep prior to work..  It works best on an empty stomach and taken immediatley before your head hits the pillow.  I think sometimes people use this drug for the &quot;effects&quot; which I suppose can happen if you try to stay awake and fight the sleep or if you take it with alcohol.  I believe this drug is a valuable tool to help me adjust sleep since i work nights and actually want to have a normal life on my days off.  All the other sleep medications i have tried left me dopey and drowsy the entire next day.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58727

ambien	Insomnia	2008-11-28 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	5.0	0.5	Ambien amnesia resulting in overdose and near death experience!  I was angry and frustrated that day and I couldn't sleep so I took a 5mg ambien at bedtime 10pm.  The next thing I remember woke up in the ER 2 days later.  My fiance said that I sat staight up in bed and then went out to the kitchen and came back to sleep.  Later she said I started foaming at the mouth and she said she called the ambulance.  According to my fiance, I took 30 klonopin, 30 seroquel, and all kinds of vitamins and supplements.  (I had the klonopin and seroquel filled that day so I hadn't taken it before.)The nurses said they couldn't get the hoses down my throat to save me so they just stopped and prayed.  I came through 2 days later thank God!  I can't recall anything after I took that one pill.  If anyone takes this drug PLEASE READ THIS.  In my opinion it isn't worth the risk to take ambien because the results could be DEATH in which there are no second chances.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58614
ambien	Insomnia	2008-09-29 00:00:00		2.0	1.0	0.5	1.5	The first night I fell &amp; stayed asleep for 8 hrs.  The 2nd night, I awoke speaking loudly to an &quot;audience of strange animals, cartoon characters, 2 big white ducks, and weird people&quot;.  I said to myself, &quot;Ok, I'm hallucinating!  Roll over and go to sleep!&quot;  I had a couple more nights where I slept good, but I had too many more with hallucinations.  They really weren't scary.  But, they are not restful either.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58425

This was even after I had taken it for a while.  While I appeared alert and communicated, I have no memory of any interactions. (this was the next day) At night if you do not go straight to bed, you will stay up chatting and acting drunk. Do NOT take this med alone. Make sure you have someone else has your keys and can make sure you are capable of driving. (Although everyone thought I was okay, and I still drove with no memory)  Just be careful and take extra precautions	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58338

ambien	Insomnia	2008-08-31 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	5.0	2.0	I was prescribed zolpidem for my insomnia.  I used it for two nights with no side effects.  Then on the third night, I slept walk. I remember staring in the mirror and crying (I always cry when I get drunk, and ambien seemed to make me do the same thing).  I didn't WALK to the mirror though...I also remember, and this is the most scary thing, taking 3 more pills.  Again I wasn't &quot;conscious&quot; and I don't remember walking to the closet to get more pills.  I just remember viewing this.  After taking 3 more pills (a total of 40 mg), I found myself in my bed, with visible hallucinations in the window.  All I remember is faces looking at me through the window, and I thought there was a large forest surrounding me with people traveling on pilgrimages like they did during the dark ages. Also, after everything, I spoke to some of my friends who said they had conversations with me on the phone and that I was crying and I couldn't talk properly.  I had no recollection of this.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58307
ambien	Insomnia	2008-08-11 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	5.0	0.5	Even though I would not take Ambien until I was in bed, I would sleepwalk to the kitchen and indulge in binge eatting. Entire cheesecakes and full half gallons of ice cream would disappear.The last time that I used Ambien I tried to fly from the top step of our staircase just several feet from our bed. I don't remember anything but my husband said that the fall had shaken the entire house. I had broken my left hand, I fractured two left ribs while falling through a wooden table at the bottom and then landed on my head causing a severe concussion and herniated a cervical disc.This drug should carry a strict warning and for some should NOT be used at all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58222
ambien	Insomnia	2008-07-04 00:00:00		2.0	2.0	5.0	1.0	I honestly believe that this drug should be pulled off the market. I have had severe insomnia for many years and I have found that ambien is very dangerous......after one month, 10 mg does not cut it so my doctor actually put me on 20 mg per night.....wow that worked....for awhile...then she realized how addicted I was and tried to wean me off....it was awful and I ended up being so desperate for them, that I purchased via internet.....I was taking 50 mg PER NIGHT and I slept for 3 hours maximum.  I found another doctor, explained this to hime and now, I would NEVER take this drug again!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58029
ambien	Insomnia	2008-07-03 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	Fall asleep within an hour. My tolerance is high. For most people sleep comes within 15 minutes. After one hour if I am still awake I repeat the dosage. The only negative aspect is sleepwalking and I have attempted to cook a few times. Unfortunately, I have no memory of these events the next day. However if I can't sleep I head directly into a manic episode so the side effects are tolerable for me.Marsha	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58024
ambien	Insomnia	2008-05-19 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	3.0	3.0	May be a little too habit-forming for patients who have a problem with chemical dependency/addiction. ALWAYS go to bed AS SOON AS YOU TAKE IT, or in half an hour you'll be sleepwalking and will end up either eating 5 sandwiches or driving your car to the store to get olives or something. Seriously, these really happened to members of my family.NEVER take more than 1 every night. As well as being physically dangerous, it decreases the effect the next night when you try to take it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57859

ambien	Insomnia	2008-02-26 00:00:00		1.5	0.5	1.0	0.5	Took both Ambien and Ambien CR, disliked both.  The Ambien didn't keep me asleep, but the Ambien CR made me exhausted and jittery at the same time.  Woke up every two hours on it, alternated between hot and cold sweats and had that hangover feeling after.  I have friends who love it, but not for me. For me, Lunesta 3 mg works like a charm	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57429

ambien	Insomnia	2008-02-20 00:00:00		0.5	2.0	5.0	1.0	I wanted to post this because I think my experience is a bit different from most people here. This is night 2 of taking Ambien CR. It's now almost 1 am, I took the pill almost 2 hours ago and it is having NO effect on me. I am so disappointed. No luck last night either. I have taken regular ambien in the past, and that knocks me on my butt within 20 minutes of taking it, to the point where if I wasn't yet in bed i'd be stumbling my way there. But I feel so hung over the next day on the regular stuff. Lunesta works great, but my copay is expensive for it, and my doc will give me samples of this. I guess I&quot;m in the small percentage of people who it just doesn't work for. My symptoms are: I lay in bed awake for...ever...and I wake up at tiny noises, lights through the window, my husbands toe touching my foot...I'm tired of being tired.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57393
ambien	Bipolar II disorder	2008-02-19 00:00:00		5.0	2.0	2.5	4.5	Works well, but works quick, so go to bed immediately after taking. Also, tolerance can develop after several months or years.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57387
ambien	Insomnia	2008-02-14 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	3.5	I was on hepititas c treatment when I started taking Ambien. The treatment ended up lasting for 2 years and I had to take the full 10 mg tablet by the end to be able to sleep. When they changed it to the generic I could no longer split the pill so I have been unable to slowlly reduce the amount and get off of them which is frustrating. I have instances of fixing food in the oven and eating it at night, made phone calls that I don't remember at all and even done some college homework which is very scary. I have tired to go off of them but end up with restless sleep and vivid dreams , sweats and the shakes. I am exhausted after all of that. the longest i've been able to go with out it is four days and they are completely miserable. Then I end up taking it again so I can sleep and function in the real world. I'm really angry that no one told me the great dangers and side effects before I started taking it. I was told that it was non-addictive what a lie. .	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57361
ambien	Insomnia	2008-01-23 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	My psychiatrist prescribed this to me after a series of late nights (one all-nighter) at work.  Suddenly, I found I could no longer get to sleep at a &quot;regular&quot; time, and being bipolar, this was not a good thing.  The inability to sleep often heralds a manic episode... or it can cause one.  Anyway, I was prescribed Ambien CR (15mg, I think) and I loved it.  I'd take it about 25 minutes before I wanted to go to sleep, and then hop into bed to read or watch TV for a bit.  I would feel myself relax and drift off nicely, and I would wake in the morning quite refreshed.  This was a novel concept for me, because with fibromyalgia, I often experience fragmented sleep, but the Ambien seemed to help that symptom as well.I never experienced any type of hallucination, amnesia, or sleep-walking/eating/driving episodes that have been reported.  Love the med!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57216
ambien	Insomnia	2008-01-20 00:00:00		3.0	5.0	5.0	3.0	When I was hospitalized for viral encephalitis, I had trouble sleeping afterward, I still do a year later. I was prescribed Ambien and at first it helped. Then, it just stopped. However, I often have that problem. Things like Nyquil never work on me. Sleep aids of any sort never really work. I didn't have any side effects, but it just didn't really work for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57193
ambien	Insomnia	2007-12-20 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.5	4.0	Effective sleep medicine.  Much fewer withdrawal symptoms than benzodiazepines.  Loses some of it's effectiveness over time, but in my experience, can be taken long term with few problems.  It doesn't always last long enough, but doesn't leave you hung over either.  I take it due to insomnia related to fibromyalgia and anxiety problems.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57024

ambien	Insomnia	2007-11-16 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	I have been on Ambien 5mg since 1999 after having an ovary out.  Have the ovary out seems to have changed my sleep patteron.  If I do not take the ambien for a week or more I am lucky to have slept 2 hours per night and some nights going without any sleep.  Crazy doctors don't know why I have insomnia so bad.  Have a very happy life, no stress, just can't fall asleep.  So this med does work well for me and I have never asked to up the strength because of the abuse fact with this med.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56885

ambien	Bipolar II disorder	2007-10-19 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	This medication is a godsend, before Ambien I had to use drugs that would render me useless the next day or flatten my affect to the point of a stone-face in order to sleep. With Ambien I can sleep and live a 'normal' life the next day. Ambien is great at fighting the 'sleep monster' that mania can be and will put me to sleep within 30 minutes usually -an hour at the most. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT that you do not 'try' to stay awake on Ambien, or you will experience symptoms another rater described. If you intentionally fight the effects of Ambien then I would call that abuse of the drug and you should not use it. Take Ambien while you are in bed and then shut the lights out and listen to some soothing music. I only use Ambien when I absolutely need to, therefore it is still effective for me, at a reasonable dose, many years later.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56766
ambien	Restless Legs Syndrome	2007-10-19 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	3.5	My suggestion is to try Ambien -especially if you are like me and your symptoms are worst when first beginning to relax into sleep and you feel like you have to get up and run the treadmill or do the 1 minute mile on the exorcise bike -or alternatively feel like you might get relief if you were to break both your ankles. The Ambien will get you past that and into sleep.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56765
ambien	Insomnia	2007-09-18 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	4.5	4.0	Works well, and has continued working for a long time (3 years now). I had SEVERE insomnia, to the point of being awake two or three days nonstop and/or sleeping only, at most, 1-2 hours a night. With Ambien I always sleep at least six hours. I've stopped taking it for a month or two here and there and had no withdrawal problems, though my insomnia returned eventually.In terms of side effects, be sure to go to bed right after taking it. This medicine makes you CRAVE carbohydrates	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56618

Hundreds of dollars I was jacked around doctors, no one wanted to say it was the ambien. I had no memory whatsoever when i called used my debit card. Until I got a letter from bank saying I had overdrawn!!! I would not tell no one to take this if you are sensitive to meds.. Which i am.

ambien	Insomnia	2007-06-26 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	I just need a little help quieting down the &quot;chatter&quot; in my brain before I fall asleep.  I break a 10mg pill into three small pieces and take it on the nights I really need to sleep (Sun-Wed nights) because of work the next day.  I sometimes will take 1/2 of a very low dose xanax instead.  I find that I can still sleep on weekends without a sleep aid because I don't have the anxiety about getting up early and being exhausted.  I have been doing this for several years and have had no trouble at all.  My only caution would be that I do have a little anxiety when I think about not having these meds.  Also, this would be a bad combination for anyone who doesn't have good self-control and who may not be able to stay at these very low doses.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55097

ambien	Insomnia	2007-04-30 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	Definitely helps me sleep and keeps me asleep through the night.  Important for me to only take however when i can get a full (at least 7-8hrs) sleep as the medicine states.

I didn't really sleep for at least 21 days except bits here and there.  Before this I always slept like a baby.  Now I still battle insomnia and take it for a while and then stop.  It causes some anxiety during the day but not many side effects.  Takes me about three sleepless nights to get off of it for a while.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54481
ambien	Insomnia	2007-03-02 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	4.5	Only thing that works for me Ambien has greatly improved my quality of life. Without it, I stay awake for hours tossing and turning.

ambien	Insomnia	2007-02-28 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Helps a lot, but long term? I use Stilnox from some months, but try to use it a maximum of 5 times per week. I usually use only 1/2 tablet (so, using 5mg).No side effects at all, but when I use it more than 4 or 5 times in a raw when I stop I have 1 nigth of REM rebound (a night of intense dreaming and I wake up often). It lasts only one night.The best sleeping med I've tried, but I don't think it's perfect for long term use.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54428
ambien	Insomnia	2007-02-13 00:00:00		4.0	2.0	5.0	3.5	Ambien works, but a little unnerving I've been a big fan of Ambien since I started taking it  months or so ago.  I have a very stressful job and I often have a really hard time getting to sleep and staying asleep.  The other night, though, I took 2 Ambien and didnt' tell my fiance that I'd done so (just as an oversight).  The next morning she told me that we had been sexually intimate for 30-40 minutes the night before and that I was &quot;strangely quiet&quot; and it ended in me &quot;snoring&quot;.  This may sound funny, but the truth is I am unnerved by it.  I've heard of people eating in the middle of the night and not remembering it, etc., but to have sex with your parther and have ZERO recollection?!?  It's a little freaky.Will I still take it?  Yes, because I really do need my sleep and it really does help.  I think that in the future it is important that I tell my partner that I am taking it when I am so that this doesn't happen again.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54312

ambien	Insomnia	2006-11-27 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	Love it, but..... I love ambien, and it works almost all the time for me.  However there are some times when I can't quite fall asleep, but then I just take half a 10mg pill, and that usually does it.  I do have a problem with being so restless that I can't sleep in the same bed with my husband, because I keep on smacking him, and wake up every time I do, but I figured out that it was from taking my wellbutrin XL later than 11 am.  My one complaint would be the snacking side effect.  I always have to eat something after my nighttime meds, and that can get dangerous, because some of my meds inhibit swallowing.  Sometimes, I have to keep snacks on my nightstand, and munch as I fall asleep, or even as I wake up.  However,  I've had extremely severe insomnia all my life, and the ambien (with 200-800 mg seroquel depending on the time of year), does the job. If I could only take one of my meds, this would be it, because you simply can't be mentally or physically healthy without enough sleep. - L	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53246
ambien	Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; CFIDS; M.E.)	2006-11-23 00:00:00		1.0	1.0	5.0	1.0	almost useless on it's own On it's own 15mg of this stuff would give me about 1 hours sleep and that's it. Combined with 0.75mg Clonazepam I would get about 6 hours sleep but left me feeling absolutely miserable. It felt as though I was barely getting any sleep and may me feel mildly depressed (something I have been lucky not to have to deal with yet). I would sometimes take more when I woke up to get an extra 2 hours sleep but this just made me feel even worse.This is one medication that you can not get in New Zealand so I had to order it from overseas and with all the hassles you have to deal with to get it through customs this little tablet definatley isn't worth it. Cost was $2-3 per 10mg tablet.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53125

ambien	Insomnia	2006-11-19 00:00:00		3.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	Works pretty well Id have to say that it works well without any side effects.. only problem i had was easily forgetting things.. helped me fall asleep much quicker and wake up feeling well rested	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53007
ambien	Insomnia	2006-11-19 00:00:00		4.0	4.5	5.0	4.0	Works well... too well. Ambien is the only thing I've found that will always and consistently &quot;knock me out&quot; regardless of whether I'm tired or not before I take it.  Truly a great sleep medication, in my opinion (despite the fact that waking 3-4 hours later is common with the non-CR formulation... either just get the CR instead, or take another 5mg and go back to bed.  Either way works just fine).I made an initial script for 14 tablets last for three months, but recently got a bottle of 30 prescribed and I find myself drifting toward Ambien addiction.  Not only does it help me fall asleep, I cherish the feeling of deep relaxation and &quot;care-free&quot; attitude as the drug takes effect, very much like the gentler/freer thought patterns right before drifting off to sleep.  To my knowledge, I get none of the reported strange side effects at all... never once hallucinated or forgot anything (that I was wanting to remember, anyway).  I've always been able to handle benzos well, and although Ambien isn't one it works in many of the same ways.I will have to be very careful... either that or I'll be stuck sleeping every-other-night trying to get used to actually being drowsy again and without Ambien!  This stuff seems made for my body chemistry and really works 'too well'.  It's very hard not to allow it to dictate when I sleep, rather than establishing a healthy sleep pattern.  And it feels so good that it's hard not to use it even when I don't need it.  The inner calmness and delicious drowsiness call out from deep within a little white bar-shaped tablet.Update - I've discovered there's a minor withdrawal syndrome when abruptly stopping zolpidem after using more than 30-40mg/day.  For me it involves watery eyes, sweating, anxiety, abdominal pain and nausea.  All of it fairly mild, but decidedly unpleasant.  Seems to resemble a minor opiate-type withdrawal more than benzo withdrawal.  Don't over-use the stuff if you can help it... if you can't, I recommend you stop	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/50918

I tried taking Ambien in hopes for better sleep at night so that I would not fall asleep during the day.  No such luck!!  From the moment it kicked in...until it wore off...my mind began racing 100mph.  I'm telling you, if my mind was a race car, I'd have given Mario Andretti a race for his money!!However, if I took Ambien during the day to help me stay awake...as it did for me at night...my mind would be so hazy that I couldn't think straight.  I wouldn't necessarily be tired, but I felt very very out of sorts and talked like i was drunk or something!!  I've heard for some this med works great with fewer side effects than that which they were on...more power to you...personally, If you want something to help you sleep...and sedatives work for you...May I suggest Passion Flower, an herb....AWESOME STUFF!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52402

I may wake up a few hours after taking the medication but easily fall back to sleep within a few minutes.  I wake up feeling refreshed.  It is an amazing sleep aid.  Almost too good to be true.  After a long period of time (years) where I woke up several times a night and had trouble falling back to sleep this is a real miracle.  I am just a little worried about whether or not I can take it indefinitely, or if I can just use it for a few months.5 mg is a small does and that works well for me.  The CR tablets were too long-acting and I could not shake the drowsy feeling during the day.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52239

This drug is one of the choices that allow me to fall asleep, and sleep relatively well. But i've read many opinions how dangerous is this drug due high risk of dependence and nasty withdrawal. I sure don't want this to happen, but the thing is, I need to sleep in order to function. I keep changing types of meds for sleep to avoid such risk as much as possible, but when I'll get my ability to fall asleep and sleep well, I'll be very happy to discontinue this treatment.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52173

I have never been one to fall asleep before my head hits the pillow (how I envy those who regularly can do this).  And - once asleep - I am a VERY light sleeper - anything and everything can wake me up (couple this with bipolar II disorder and you have a sleep-deprived, horribly irritable person).  Ambien makes me fall asleep within 30 minutes of taking it, and helps keep me asleep.  As long as I take it as prescribed (&quot;allow at least 6 hours between taking the dose and having to get up&quot;), I'm fine.  It is a bit pricey, but well worth it for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52148

I try to have two nights a week without using it, and occassionally have periods up to to ten nights when I can sleep without medication. Happens about two to three times a year.I think it makes me rather &quot;flat&quot; for the first few hours on waking, and I think it may tend towards depression, BUT it is balancing that against really serious insomnia, which is both depressing in itself, and the lack of sleep contributes to depression too. So, for me, it is the lesser of two evils. I just hope a more &quot;natural&quot; feeling sleep inducer will be developed soon, with no &quot;hang over&quot; or flattening effect.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51681

ambien	Insomnia	2006-10-19 00:00:00		4.0	3.0	5.0	3.5	the most effective compared to others I've suffered from insomnia since early childhood: trouble falling asleep, not waking up during the night.  The condition worsened when I started taking SSRI's for depression and anxiety when I was 19 years old.  A previous psychiatrist prescribed imipramine, which was not very effective and made me feel tired and fatigued the next day, all day long.  We also tried trazodone, which had the same fatiguing effects and seemed to make my RLS worse at night.  So, we tried Sonata which only put me to sleep for about two hours!  I only took Sonata a few times during a period when I wasn't suffering from RLS, so I don't know if it was effective for relieving RLS symptoms.  Next, she put on Ambien, which is very effective and rapidly helps me fall asleep.  It seemed that every once in a while either the Ambien would exacerbate my RLS, or it would wear off during the night and I would be woken up at three or four in the morning with RLS symptoms. Because of this, I tried taking Lunesta once, but stopped because it caused me to have the most hideous taste in my mouth for most of the next day!!! I think that overall, Ambien is extremely effective for insomnia, but when my RLS is severe, nothing but benzodiazepines (Klonopin) help me find peace all through the night.  I have found that taking Ambien CR helps me sleep through most severe RLS symptoms.  Sometimes I do feel groggy and fatigued the next morning, but at least I'm getting some sleep and not driving my husband crazy during the night!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51422

But the next day once I got up and moving I started having chest pains/ heart arrhythmia's. This is the 3rd sleep aid to give me that side affect. The other 2 were Trazadone and Elavil. All of these sleep aids work great though. All the sleep aids that don't work for me don't cause chest pains...figures! The sleep aids that didn't work for me were Lunesta 2mg, Rozerem 8mg, 5-HTP and Gaba (herbal), valerian root (herbal).Right now I'm taking xanax as a sleep aid which works great with no side affects but I don't want to take it long term because I've already had to increase my dosage to keep it working. I Don't know what to try next.

I was prescribed ambien cr and thought it was working well until I recieved a fed-ex delivery.  It seems I had created a new email address and purchased one of those new gadget type drills that are seem on info-mercials. It took a few weeks for the bills to come up but it seems in the middle of the night I ordered this drill. It was an anxious period as I was afraid of a tractor trailer pulling up to my house full of unknown purchases.

However, I almost always wake up again within 4 hours. As long as I take it 3-4 hours before wake-up time, there is no hangover effect. However, If I use it more than a few nights in a row, I develop a tolerance and have to double the dose (to 5mg, which is still low). I have occasionally taken up to 10mg in divided doses (taking 2.5 or 5 at bedtime and then again when I wake up in the middle of the night. I have not had any of the hallucinations or other problems others write about. The best things about this are no hangover/grogginess next day and it works so fast that you don't have to take it unless/until you really need it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51071

If I did not get a good 7-8 hours sleep it did cause me side effects during the next morning. The directions make this very clear.  I plan on going back on it.I know a lot of people who take it and are satisfied with it.  It is expensive and when I had insurance it would not pay because of the expense.  The way I feel, if it helps me sleep which it does its worth every penny of expense.  I have major problems with insomnia and have had all of my life.

BEWARE! short term use only...go straight to bed.  do not exceed 10 mg or after you begin to build a tolerance to it, and under no circumstances do you want to drink alcohol with it unless you like waking up in some cold jail cell wrapped up in some big guys arms with the name Bubbu.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/50900

ambien	Insomnia	2006-10-03 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.0	Get the Controlled Release tabs After going through a nasty experience one summer, the Doctor put me on Ambien CR after taking me off Ativan. Initially, I was so upset the original version Ambien put me to sleep but I woke up 2-3 hours later exhausted but unable to go back to sleep. Thus, Ativan. When he took me off of Ativan (which is brilliant but they hate to give it for long periods), I asked for Ambien CR. That worked like a charm. I slept all night and woke up pretty clear in the morning without any fuzziness or sleepiness during the day. The only problem with the Ambien is that it did produce some odd sleep behaviors. One night I evidently got cold and turned the heat on and woke up to a 90 degree house. I occasionally woke up and ate which I had no memory of but I found various containers in my garbage. That part kind of sucked. But otherwise, this works really well. If you are going through a really bad experience, ask for the Controlled Release tabs so you go to sleep and STAY asleep. Right now, my MD has me switching to Trazodone.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/50685

Initially, I thought it would last only 7-10 days, but actually it lasted 2 months.  Unfortunately, the effectiveness diminished after that keeping me lying awake longer before falling asleep.  I have found that after a few months of Restoril it becomes effective again.

Ambien works best for me when I keep the dosing to 3 days a week or less.. anything more, and my brain seems to figure out something's going on and compensates.. it stops working nearly as well.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/50337
ambien	Insomnia	2006-09-26 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Ambien Very Likely Saved my Life IN 2002, after years of doctors and therapysts, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Myofacial Pain Syndrome, RLS, neurocardiogenic syncopy, sinus tachycardia and essential tremor, plus something called hypnogogic jerks! I was not a psycho,I had a real illness, but I could no longer sleep. For more than 2 years I averaged 2-3 hours a night, with 5mg of Ambien, but without it I could and did stay awake for as long as three days! A sleep study test said I get no Rem sleep at all. I stayed for months in a viscious fight with the idea of suicide. I just could not imagine anything could make me feel better and frankly I had no desire to stay around to be sick and in pain all the time.When I was accepted at the Rhode Island Hospital of Rehabilitation, the Ambien was raised to 10mg and 8mg of Gabitiril added. I too was told I could have amnesiac experiences, but as of now, I have not have. The only side effect I have ever experienced was being groggy if I took the med on a night when I knew I had to be up in six or seven hours. The bottle clearly says not to take it if you have less than 10 to 12 hours to sleep.I still do not have what I think of as a deep restful sleep, but I do sleep for sometimes as much as 10 hours. The most important thing Ambien does for me is to allow me to again join my family in a routine of a regular bedtime. After having my life turned totally upside down, it feels so good to have at least one part seem to be normal again.Shari	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40356
ambien	Insomnia	2006-09-26 00:00:00		2.0	0.0	4.5	1.5	I had a horrible experience!! I did go to sleep within about 20 minutes of taking it, but after about 4 hours of sleep I got up and thought I had a house full of company waiting for breakfast.  I ot up thinking all were in the bathroom or bedroom getting showered or dressed. I peeled potatoes, shredded potatoes, fried bacon, fried sausage, and put together a large breakfast caserole.  I went into the living room to sit down after ll this.  After sitting there for about 10 minutes, I began to doubt what was happening.  I then realized I was halucinating.  I would never take it again, nor would I recommend anyone else take( if you live alone) it as you don't know what will happen.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48383

Sometimes, I wake during the night or too early.

I switched to 12.5mg Ambien CR and it worked great to get to sleep.  I had a hangover effect the next day, and it is supposed to be addictive.  I found out that ambien is the same drug as ativan only in a much higher dose!  When I heard this, I switched to Trazodone.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49846
ambien	Insomnia	2006-09-18 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	4.5	5.0	Never Groggy The best thing about Ambien is that when it wears off you are NOT groggy - perfect if you need to be alert the next day. For me, they wear off in about 7 hours. Then, BING! You know that you are awake. I think that the level of my sleep is deep enough to be refreshing, however my husband has said that when he takes Ambien this is not always the case.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49602

Ambien helped me fall asleep when I should. Unfortunately it wouldn't always keep me asleep. I found that using 10mg Ambien with 50mg Desyrel was a perfect combonation for me to get quality sleep throughout the night as long as I didn't need to wake up and be alert early otherwise I had to cut the dosage a bit and/or go to sleep fairly early. I'm on Lunesta now, but they seem exactly the same to me. I only switched because my medical practitioner was set on it. When using Ambien, Lunesta, or Desyrel they tend to kick in fast,so I would get in bed right after taking them and avoid conversations or eating. They tend to make me a little less inhibited.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48537

ambien	Insomnia	2006-08-24 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Long term use of Ambien I have been on Ambien for years (under the care of a doctor). I have extreme insomnia; problems getting to sleep and problems staying asleep. I take a rather high dose as well---20mg. Ambien has definitely worked for me better then herbs, accupuncture, or other medications such as Benadryl.  I have been on this for so long, it's as common as taking tylenol.  I take it around 9:00pm each night and I am asleep within an hour. I have learned to not take it and then engage in some activity, you should take it right before you go to bed! While on Ambien I never experience insomnia. I have deep, restful sleep. In the past I would wake up at the slightest sound (like thunder) or sirens---I sleep through both! It's important to get at least 7 hours of sleep while on this. If you get 4-5 hours you DO wake up feeling groggy and feeling as if you just need much more sleep. The fact that I have remained on this dosage for so long and have not developed a tolerance is probably unusual.  I hear others state that they no longer get the same effect after a few weeks.  As I said, I am totally under a doctor's care and I stress that this is very important! You have to remember that even though you are just taking this at night, other medications will have a cynergenic response. I.E, I had herniated a disk in my back and my doctor had me on painkillers. DO NOT MIX Ambien with muscle relaxants, benzodiazapans (like Xanax) or painkillers such as Vicodin.I know I felt so groggy the whole day!At the beginning of using Ambien I felt a slight hangover and my memory seemed to be somewhat impaired. I felt that I absolutely needed coffee in the morning. After time, I have 0 side effects. My doctor and I weighed the consequences of long-term use and getting 0-3 hours of sleep. Lack of sleep took a toll on my mental and physical health.  I have been an insomniac for as long as I can remember, Ambien has been a godsend to me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48272

When it loses effectiveness I use something else for awhile (Lunesta, Sonata, Lorazepam, even Benadryl), but I come back to Ambien.  I like it the best. I had bad effects with Trazadone. Never tried Klonopin.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24228
ambien	Insomnia	2006-08-22 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Great unless you stop Falling asleep is my main problem, not staying asleep, so I prefer the regular formular compared to the extended release.  If you use it for more than a week or two and then stop, there is rebound insomnia and too much REM rebound.  That lasts for about 3 nights.  I used it every night for about 4 months when there was a family medical crisis and I needed a good night's sleep to have the energy (mental and physical) to deal with the situtation.  The same dose was effective the entire time and there was never any residual drowsiness the next morning.  The quality of sleep is also pretty good with Ambien.  I tried Lunesta a few times and thought the quality of sleep was better, but the awful after-taste was too nasty to continue using the pill.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48020

ambien	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2006-08-09 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	5.0	3.0	Ambien caused more troubles than it helped I tried Ambien because my doctor was worried about my building up a tolerance to the Xanax that I normally take.  I only took it for four days.  For the first two nights I slept really soundly on it and don't remember dreaming or anything, but felt okay the next day.  Starting the third night, I slept the same, but I felt more achy and headachy than usual the next day. After the fourth night, I felt really terribly achy, so I quit taking it.  Also, I heard recently in the news that sleepwalking is a possible side effect of Ambien, and one women who took it found out the next day that she had been up cooking during the night and had no recollection of it!  A man who took it drove to the store in the middle of the night and bought something, and the clerk called the police because he must have been acting funny.  That's the only way that he found out what he had been doing.  Pretty scary!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47201

ambien	Insomnia	2006-07-31 00:00:00		2.5	1.5	5.0	2.5	Still sleepless I've been taking Ambien for many years. Works most of the time but major problems now with the amnesia. Pretty scary things I'm doing at night that I have absolutely no memory of. Minor things like no memory of phone conversations to major things like an incident involving a fire alarm and evacuation from a large hotel. I have not memory of this at all.    Sometimes now I take it and if I don't fall asleep within 45 minutes, it seems I've lost the chance of falling asleep ever that night. Occasionally I'll take a 6.25 SR tab and 5 mg of the regular version. This usually works reliably well. But the cost of these are very high and I have lots of trouble just getting prescriptions filled since it is a controlled drug.  Sometimes I take a flexeril tab with the ambien. This worked for awhile but isn't so great anymore.    Lunesta did absolutely nothing for me. Not even the infamous bad taste.  Tonight I'm trying Rozerem.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/46504

I also take valium up to 10 mg per day with no side affects. I find that the combination wards off insomnia and depression that allows me to make it through each day. On occasion for classic migraine I also take a codein with aspirin tablet that works within 20 minutes. I am in my seventies and still going strong with all parts working including a normal sexual drive.

My dr. prescribed this for me for long term use. I will insist on blood work being done to check liver functions though! I have suffered for years from insomnia and am just really pleased even after one nights use.  I do find a strong cup of coffee needed though to shake off the hang over the next morning, and I did sleep longer than 10 hours the first night mostly on purpose however, just was really sleeping hard and deep and peacefully what a joy!  I did go straight to bed though.  Will post updated comments soon.  Best wishes to all and to all a good nights sleep! June 19, 2006-still taking this and doctor is following me closely is a life saver for me insomnia wise, I take it and sleep peacefully.  I have really benefitted from this drug! Dr. plans to keep me on it permanently and tests my liver levels regularly to be sure no damage and so on... We shall see in time how I do with this plan I sleep about 8 hours a night however this is what is required by my body everyone is different I used to be this way many years ago...prior to insomnia troubles...coffee is still a must however or at least some kind of caffeine to shake off the lingering fog effect the first couple of hours after getting up out of bed.  No dizziness or sleep walking but I do take it and go straight to bed and do not mess around with this medicine. I do drink more fluids while on this med however it does do some minimal drying out of your tissues not bad though at all.. It is a very serious medicine so I take it and head directly to bed &amp; do not play around with doing other things after taking it!   Will post update in several months. Best to all and I am sleeping really great for the first time in many-many years.  And to all a good nights sleep!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41303

There are better sleep aids on the market; however Ambien's success I think is mostly in part to their overzealous marketing.  Did it work?  Ehhh, not so much.  It put me out fast, but apparently I did not stay asleep, though I thought I had.  Confused?  Yeah, me too.  Lead to sleep walking, talking, reading, eating, vacuuming (YES, vacuuming) though I have NO memory of any of these activities occurring and assumed I had slept each night through.  Dare I say a rohypnol effect?  I never felt rested in the month I took this each night.  I awoke without drowsiness, but the fatigue was obvious physically and mentally, which proved to me I was not achieving good sleep with Ambien.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44018

Just get up and go the next morning.  After alternating on and off with lunesta I started having side effects of brain fog.  Because I took a sleep aid for longer than a year I became dependant.

I usually make sure I take it on an empty stomach, right before I go to bed.  Ambien is really the only thing that has worked for me.  I have tried many things for insomnia, but this seems to be the best thing for me.  I have noticed lately it has gotten a bad rap, but so far I haven't suffered any bad side effects.  If I don't take it to sleep at night, I'll literally stay up all night.  I have anxiety problems, also, so that makes it hard for me to relax at night.  I take 1 mg Xanax 3x day, but it doesn't make me sleepy.  However, it does help greatly with my anxiety.  I wish I didn't have to take anything to help with my problems, but I have learned to accept that alot of it is my genetic makeup.  Anxiety, depression, and insomnia runs in my family.  I thank God for medications that help me with my problems.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/43414

ambien	Insomnia	2006-05-22 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	3.5	It made me sleep but it also affected me badly When I started taking Ambien it was because I was a total insomniac.  I could go days without sleeping but felt miserable.  I have problems with anxiety, so I would lay awake at night and worry about everything.  That was part of the problem... the other problem is convincing myself to go to sleep because I hated the whole ordeal of going to bed.  I started taking ambien and it really would knock me out.  Usually I could take half a pill and fall asleep.  I tried the time released version too, and it didn't put me to sleep at all, by the way.  Only the regular 10 mg pill.  The problem I have with ambien is that it gave me such headaches and I honestly didn't put two and two together for awhile.  It gave me headaches and made me irritable.  There has been a lot of hype on tv about the sleepwalking, and that was true for me too, but I didn't get up to eat.  I would get up and just do normal things but I wouldn't remember it the next day.  When I stopped taking it my insomnia was worse than before, but that only lasted a couple of days, rebound insomnia I think its called.  I ended up taking desyrel to help me sleep when I quit the ambien and did that for about 2 weeks to get me over the ambien.  I take Buspar regularly now I don't have as much anxiety now so sleep is a little bit better for me.  I still tend to be an insomniac, although now it isn't as much worry as just not being able to sleep.  Overall, yes it totally helped me sleep.  It was kind of a weird sleep, kind of vivid weird dreams but those were fun.  It would knock me out within 30 minutes.  I mean if I didn't go to bed I would feel drunk and like I wasn't sure I would make it to bed.  That was amazing to be able to take a pill and know I would get to sleep in 30 minutes.  But, like I said I was so irritable that I was miserable the whole time I took it regularly.  I still have some and I take them on occasion if there is some really big thing the next day a	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/43151

When I woke in the morning I always felt full or sick, never realizing what was happening until my husband caught me in the kitchen eating everything and anything.  He thought it was funny so never said anything to me about it.  One day I asked him why there was evidence of someone eating after hours and he than told me about it. That is frightening to me. Since that is the only drug that helps me I continue to use it.  I am 67 years old.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/42481

It also gave me the worst heart palpitations I've ever had--and I've had my share. But this was different.

ambien	Insomnia	2006-04-25 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	Good for falling asleep My doctor said to take only 1 pill at night, which I did and there weren't any results. So I decided to try 2 pills together at night and it knocks me out like crazy. I almost feel like I'm drunk if I don't get into bed at least an hour later. So for getting me to sleep it's wonderful.But...I only stay asleep for about 5-6 hours. I wake up at 5 am feeling WIDE AWAKE. I'm still kind of ok with it though because I would rather wake up early then not be able to fall sleep at a regular time. And I've also noticed that I can't remember little things that I did the night before if I wait too long to get into bed after taking the pills. Nothing big like driving or anything, just small things that make me laugh the next day. So I would recommend getting into bed no more than an hour after taking it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41584

ambien	Insomnia	2006-04-15 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.0	Works pretty well... just don't mix with alcohol! I prefer Ambien over the typical benzos as it doesn't leave me with a cloudy hangover or a feeling of weakness the next day.  As indicated in the advertising and elsewhere on this site, Ambien works QUICKLY -- I have found that if I take it and am on the couch watching TV, I will wake up the next day still on the couch or even on the floor!  I can't stress enough how important to get to bed quickly as soon as you take this medication.The advertising and prescribing information casually mention &quot;you should not take it with alcohol&quot;.  I beleive this should be a much more prominent warning -- I have twice made the mistake of taking Ambien after consuming alcohol.  The first time was after just two beers, and I woke up the next day having no recollection of how I got in bed.  My housemates told me I seemed fully conscious and aware for several hours after I took it, and even walked the dog around the block... very scary -- I'm very glad I didn't get behind the wheel!Ambien has proven extremly effective for me if taken as directed.  Common sense dictates, and I would strongly advise, not mixing it with any other depressant drug or alcohol... you might be able to get away with it on a benzo.. but definitely NOT on Ambien.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41093

Needless to say I never functioned very well, which led to poor reviews, which led to eventuall termination -- which led to even more nightime anxiety, well you get the pic.Anyhoo, I had to beg and beg my Doc for some relief!  It was only when he prescribed Wellbrutrin for me and knew this would complicate matters worse that he prescribed Ambian. And the Ambien worked!!  Well, it made me dozey to fall asleep, but I'd usually awake after 2.5 - 3 hours (it has a metabolic rate of 2.5 hrs). I would have to take another half pill to knock off again to slomber land.Today, he changed my sleep elixor to lunesta.  ahhh, full nights sleep.... finally!!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40249

ambien	Restless Legs Syndrome	2006-04-02 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	No hangover with good sleep I really felt Ambien was a Godsend and don't know what I would have done without it. One has to take it in bed and get the whole 8 hours of sleep or suffer the amnesiac side-effects. I just follow the directions and get my full sleep and I do well. It will put you to sleep, but a RLS/PLMD sufferer also needs a med to calm the muscles in addition to a sleep med. Without Klonopin I slept 8 full hours, but would move about so much that my husband would have to leave the bed and I would awake totally exhausted. My doc said it was because I never reached stage 4 sleep because of my movements. Klonopin and Mirapex have helped this a lot. Sonata did not help me sleep.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40416

ambien	Insomnia	2006-03-31 00:00:00		2.5	2.5	5.0	3.0	Induces Sleepwalking I've taken Ambien since May 2004. Until a few months ago Ambien worked fairley well. I realized I was having unexplained weight gain and a few bruises. Actually what was/is happening is that I am sleepwalking. Unknowingly I get up during the night and find something to eat. I would notice the morning after dishes in the sink. Empty ice cream cartons in the trash and absolutely no memory of have eaten.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40324
ambien	Insomnia	2006-03-30 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	NO problems after over 5 years. Ambien (Zolpidem) gives me No side effects except mild occasional amnesia.  I do stupid things unless I go right to bed like cut my hair too short, paint my fingernails awful colors, eat fattening things, etc.  But nothing too serious, just poor judgement skills.  4 hours on Ambien is worth 8 hours on anything else.  Supplementing with a little Benadryl or doxylamine keeps me down longer, but leaves me feeling groggy next day.  Ambien alone has no bad side effects at all and I get sick (colds, flu) far less often now that I get the best sleep I've ever had.  I had sleep problems from very early on, 10 - 12 years of age.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40320

The only problem is that if I am awakened in the night for any reason (for example, if my children cry in the night) I am non functional.  If I can wake at all, I am dizzy, naseas and confused.

ambien	Restless Legs Syndrome	2006-03-30 00:00:00		4.0	2.5	4.5	3.5	Ambien I took this medicine because I have Fibromyalgia and Restless legs, and server insomnia, to the point I well hallucinate if I dont sleep in a week. I took this medicine when I was going off a high does of Effexor xr 450 mg and 10 mg a day of Valium, they stopped working and gave me Night Terror/ Night mares (badly) after taking this over a year, and before I could go on another anti depressant he want me to be totally off of Effexor, and I was getting psychotic do to not sleeping, so he gave me the Ambien and it did help, but I found that it made me feel drunk, or I guess a high felling, stoned feeling. I still had to take it for this short few months to get well rested and the black circles under my eyes went away after a month, and I got color back in my face. I then went of this into Paxil Cr and Klonopin, and was on that for three years, then now I am on the Klonopin for my restless leg syndrome. I will take this medicine again if I have to, but I am also 34 and disabled, I cant even begin to think how someone who works, can wake up and go to there job? It did make me sleepy all day long, and unable to wake up....Brain Fog feeling.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40307
ambien	Insomnia	2006-03-30 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	Still the best there is When I first started using Ambien in 2002, I had the initial problem of amnesia.  I tried Sonata, Trazadone, as well as over the counter medications, but nothing worked like Ambien.  I went back on Ambien and stayed on it and within a couple of months the side effect went away.  Since then I have also used Lunesta, but the Ambien is still the most effective for me.  I test for sleep disorders and of all the patients I have had over the years that have used a sleep aid, most tell me that Ambien works best for them.  Only a few have reported the problems with Amnesia, and most have followed the guidelines of going to bed immediately after taking Ambien.  I did have one patient however that woke up every morning to a spotless house and never remembered cleaning it.

ambien	Insomnia	2006-03-19 00:00:00		3.5	1.0	4.0	2.5	Ambien = Amnesia Just wanted to put in my two cents regarding this drug. It really does cause total amnesia. Not every single time you use it; for me, it happened perhaps 10 times over a three year period. I would never have even known that I had been getting out of bed &amp; doing strange things, if I had not seriously injured myself the very last time. I have no history of sleepwalking. Just chronic insomnia for the past 8 years. But one night I awoke in bed because I slowly became aware of an extreme throbbing pain in my hand. When I turned on the lights, I was covered in blood. I had absolutely no idea what had happened. I got up to bandage my finger, and as I followed the trail of blood out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, I was shocked at what I discovered. Obviously, I had got up and sleepwalked into the kitchen with the intention of cooking. There was a empty pot on the stove, with the burner turned up full blast. Another pot contained a mixture that looked like butter &amp; milk. The burner under that pot was not on. The worst part was the way I injured myself. I saw a large onion on the cutting board, hacked into quarters. Blood was all over the board. However, the knife was missing from the scene of the crime. And mysteriously, there was full roll of paper towels laying in the sink, soaking wet with water &amp; blood. I would not have believed that I actually did this. But seeing the trail of blood as evidence, was convincing enough. When I showed my boyfriend what happened, he finally told me that it was not the first time. He said I would get up sometimes from bed, while he was up late watching tv, and would come to the couch for a little while, and speak to him in tongues (gibberish.) Other times I would get up, eat ice cream, and put the empty container back in the fridge. I had always thought that he was the guilty culprit, as far as the empty containers go. I had NO IDEA that I was doing these things.The point I am trying to make here is that Ambien works	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39674
ambien	Insomnia	2006-03-18 00:00:00		4.0	0.0	5.0	3.0	Ambien Hell Have been using Stillnox (ambien) for only 2 months, and the withdrawal has been terrible. I started the Ambien to help sleep following surgery, and this is my first and only experience with any sleep medication.  I first tried  just stopping using Ambien completely, but the anxiety was terrible. I slowly weaned myself over several weeks, and am now sleeping without the Ambien.  Have never had nightmares before in my life, but now I am having them many times every night.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39536
ambien	Insomnia	2006-03-16 00:00:00		3.5	1.0	5.0	3.0	Amnesia side effect I started out on a 5mg dosage of Ambien at night along with my 600mg of Gabapentin.  I fell asleep a little faster, but could not sleep through the night.  So then I began taking the full tablet 10mg.  I fell asleep fast - as long as I was already in bed.  I have a different side effect than I have read about on this site.  I get &quot;amnesia&quot; for a few hours after taking the ambien.  I looked it up and this is a rare side effect that Ambien can have on some people.  I have been known to have a full conversation with someone over the phone or even in person - and can't remember it at all.  In the beginning - my husband and I did not realize that the &quot;amnesia&quot; was occuring.  Apparently I was fully capable of being &quot;intimate&quot; with my husband and did not remember it the following day.  This is a very hard thing to deal with - for both of us.  So, now I make sure to take the Ambien after I have snuggled myself into bed.  I have FMS and need the Ambien to help with sleep.  Although, it is only effective for about 4-5 hours.  Then I will wake up - but going back to sleep is not a problem.  I like the Ambien because it does not make me feel groggy the next day.  I am in contact with my doctor to see if I can try the new Ambien CR. Maybe that will help me sleep longer than a few hours at a time.  Has anyone else had the &quot;amnesia&quot; side effect from Ambien????	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39332

Now I can add Ambien to the list.  It helped me get to sleep sometimes, but I needed something more powerful and longer lasting.  So now I have my wife hit me over the head with a frying pan before bed.  I'm on Lunesta now.

But other times I wake up on it usually after 3hrs and then can't get back to sleep til morning when I have to get up for work. The hangovers are awful when they happen - so much so that I very rarely take it now unless I can sleep in in the morning. However, I found that the more I exercise the less severe the hangover when it happens.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/38484
ambien	Restless Legs Syndrome	2006-02-23 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Ambien works....if taken My RLS started as a young girl. Mom had it too.  For years it was brushed off by doctors as &quot;nutty patient.&quot;  Mine is painful sometimes and can involve the arms and hands, as well as onset in the daytime if prolonged sitting {extended car travel] or in the evening, long before bed.My original prescribing doctor gave me the guideline of no more than 4 x per week, max.  I almost never use it that often, as I really dislike the sensation of &quot;giving up control of falling asleep.&quot;  It's a little hard to properly explain.I still tend to waken early; back pain complicates my situation.  I have not had a sleep study, so I don't know if there are other factors.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/38294

ambien	Insomnia	2006-01-26 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	Ambien Ambien works very well for me. The only problem is that it takes longer to work than it used to. So I take it early; 9-9:30 PM is ideal, tho it is easy to forget when one is busy.  It used to take 5-10 minutes, as the write-ups say. Now it takes an hour or so. Up to 2 hours. I would not take it at work though (I work till 11 PM some days) as I might get sleepy too soon. I.e., it varies.Another thing is that it is said that ambien is &quot;addictive,&quot; so I am afraid of getting &quot;hooked.&quot; So I take 1/2 tablet for the last few months. If I try to go without it, I might fall asleep if it is very late, but I will wake up very early, like 5-6 AM. So I know it does work.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/33552

However, since my problem was sleep hypopnea and narcolepsy, it really just masked the symptoms and it took longer to get a diagnosis.  It also made me forget anything I did approximately 1/2 hour before I took it and everything after I took it.  That was scary as my children would tell me somethings I had to remember and I wouldn't even remember us talking about it.It did not get me into a deep sleep which is my problem, so really didn't help except for me to get a full nights sleep, which made me think I was crazy or lazy for not feeling refreshed in the mornings.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/37197

The doctor even gave me a prescription credit card to assist in the copay cost!  Great, huh?  Not so much!!First, the credit card didn't work.  Yes, I called and activated it before I tried to use it, but it seems CVS doesn't take it.  When I got home, I called the 800 # and was told Walgreens would accept it, so I figured the next refill I would use the card.Well, after 11 days with maybe a few hours of sleep a day, I finally gave up on Ambien.

Not something you'd want if you really want to sleep. Especially with anxiety issues.If you do sleep you can often wake up groggy or with a headache. I didn't care much for this at all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/36018
ambien	Insomnia	2005-12-30 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	4.5	Ambien Long Term Use I began taking Ambien about 10 years ago, but only took it (5 mg.) for a while until I was able to establish a good sleep pattern again. A few years later, my sleep problems resurfaced and never went away. At first I would take 5 mg. just on one weekend night to get at least one good night's sleep a week. Eventually, I increased it to 2 and then 3 nights. Sometimes I would substitute a 10 mg. tablet to really get a good night's sleep. Then I switched permanently to only 10 mg. tablets about 3 times a week. I hated the nights that I didn't take it, so finally I began taking 10 mg. per night.  For a while, it was wonderful. I still take it every night, but it is not very effective any more. However, I will not allow myself to increase the dosage--and if I do not take it, the night is worse. So I continue to take it every night even though it no longer has the desired effect. I keep hoping that something better will be invented.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35192
ambien	Insomnia	2005-12-22 00:00:00		3.0	1.5	4.0	2.5	Ambien for sleep - Bipolar II One of the worse things for a Bipolar II is not getting good sleep. A lack of sleep, even for one night can cause a full blown mania the next day, especially for me, a rapid cycler.  Anyway, I tried Ambien but it didn't work for me.  It took a long time for me to get to sleep and then I had no REM sleep.  I woke up feeling groggy, tired, and was listness all the following day. Like a bad hangover on cheap booze.  I gave it a try for two weeks, but it never got any better.  I figure it's just not cut out for Bipolars, it may work for others who have depression or generalized sleep disorders.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/34966

I now use other relaxation methods as well and I usually have a reasonably good nights sleep, waking up about twice but always getting back to sleep.One day I would like to not take any sleep medication but doubt if that will happen.

ambien	Insomnia	2005-12-09 00:00:00		1.0	1.5	3.0	1.5	Ambien Review I have used Ambien for years, and the effectiveness was hit and miss. Most of the time miss.  Take the med, lay down to sleep, ... 1 hr, 2 hr, 2:30, I might go to sleep. Once to sleep, I sleep until 12:00 the next morning.Then, recently, I have been going to sleep for an hour and a half, and waking up unable to go to sleep.  I hate sleep.  I have osteoarthritis of the back and am on pain medication for that. I have now switched to Lunesta. The first two nights were great.  Here it is 12:37, and I am not asleep.  I also use a C-PAP machine, which worked better with Lunesta than the end times of Ambien.Well, so that is that.  I will try to go to sleep for me. It doesn't seem to help if you pray to God for sleep, because, ... maybe he/she is sleeping. You think?  My dog, Sassie, can doze of anywhere and actually snores.

ambien	Insomnia	2005-12-07 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Long Term use of Ambien for Sleep Disorders My experience with long-term usage of 10 mg Ambien was excellent for the first few years, then it began not working as well and I could only use if effectively about 2-3 times a week.  Ambien for me at the beginning was a miracle drug!  I was finally able to sleep after years of not sleeping well or just not sleeping.  I would like to try the new Ambien CR, but don't know what my doctor thinks about it yet.  The dosage of the 5 mg didn't work for me, the doctor had to immediately go for the 10mg dosage.  I'm a hard person to knock out at the dentist, or with any type of anesthesia, so I was very relieved that the 10mg dosage of Ambien worked so well.  I slept, was able to get up to use the restroom and fall immediately back to sleep.  The best part was when I awoke in the mornings, I wasn't drowsy and didn't feel anxious or groggy all day.  Other sleep medications had made me feel bad all day, but Ambien was and still is in my opinion a miracle drug.  It wasn't until the insurance companies decided that a person could only receive a total of 14 pills a month that I began having problems.  Who are they to determine how much medication I can have when my doctor was prescribing 30 a month??????????????  It was at that point my doctor had to switch me to another sleep medication combination that I'm still using.  It's not as good as Ambien, but it works and I do get sleep.  I would love to try the new dosage of Ambien CR, but wonder if the insurance companies are controlling the amount you can receive on it also.   - Member: Melmorris	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/33514

The physician who had ordered Ambien for me decided that a month of treatment should solve my problem. From what I can recall, I tolerated Ambien very well. I slept well during the treatment. However, he had decided that I didn't require Ambien anymore because I had reported an improved sleep pattern. Three months later the insomnia returned with a vengeance. Recently, I have been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea in addition to my Fibromyalgia, Chronic Pain Syndrome, Osteoarthritis, Degenerative Disk Disease, and Asthma.

ambien	Insomnia	2005-10-17 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	ambien works for me I use Ambien about 2 5 mg tablets per week, and have done so over the past four years.I do not suffer from side effects, and so far I have not had to escalate the dosage.I have tried acupuncture, hypnotherapy, exercise, valerian, melatonin, homeopathic remedies, shiatsu, craniosacral therapy, massage and so on, so far only Ambien works specially if I treat myself to 5 mg.    I can usually fall asleep but wake at 2 am and then cannot get back to sleep.I have been told this pattern is linked to liver difficulties.   In addition I take statins to lower cholesterol, this has insomnia listed as a side effect.   I have been on statins for about five years, my insomnia began November 1999, I do wonder about this.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/28742

ambien	Insomnia	2005-10-14 00:00:00		3.0	2.5	3.5	3.0	A few issues with Ambien I tried Ambien for about two months after being diagnosed with CFS.  It is very possible that the fact that I have CFS/FMS affected the way I responded to the drug.  I found that Ambien was not a very effective medication to help ease my insomnia.  To begin, the worst aspect of my insomnia is probably my inability to STAY asleep and sleep for a sufficient period of time.  Ambien did not help this problem.  After taking the pill, I would usually end up falling asleep, however I would find myself wide awake about exactly five hours later.  I never was able to sleep longer than that period of time.  Once I awoke, I also had a &quot;wired&quot; feeling that prevented me from even trying to go back to bed and continue to rest.  Another aspect of Ambien that I made it difficult for me to use is the fact that it really does need to be taken on an empty stomach in order to work.  I usually need to have at least a small snack in the evening because I tend to get very hungry at night.  Thus, I found myself starving when trying to fall asleep, which didn't help me get to bed either.On several occasions I took Ambien and did not fall asleep.  It may have been because I had eaten too recently.  On these nights, I became very aware that Ambien can cause major hallucinations.  I would lie in bed and start to think and imagine some very strange thoughts.  Problems arose if I tried to get up for some reason.  On one occasion I was sleeping in a hotel room with my parents.  I got up to go to the bathroom, saw my Dad, and genuinely thought he was a ghost.  I let out a bloodcurdling scream that is still etched in the memory of every member of my family.  It was very strange. All in all, I was very disappointed with Ambien.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/28601

Well,it does.However, I do have to take something else with it, like a low dose of Restoril.  When I first started using it, I would wake up during the night and do things I didn't remember the next day (like eat).

ambien	Insomnia	2005-10-13 00:00:00		3.5	3.5	4.5	3.5	Ambien and  Osteoarthritis I have serious Osteoarthrits/degenerative arthritis of my entire spinal column. I have had one operation in 1990, and it helped for about 7 years, but spurring grew back.  My lower back is extremely severe and no neurosurgeon I have seen about it, would even consider an operation.In 1998, I found myself losing sleep. For 4 years I struggled with sleep every night and would go to work a zombie. Drinking a Mtn Dew would help me wake up, but it would do a big time number on my life sentence with Irritable Bowel Syndrome.One morning I fell asleep doing morning breakfast duty at school.  Standing, helping the kgs and first graders empty their plates, I suddenly felt very tired. I sat down at a table.  I guess I fell asleep, mumbling and ended up on the floor. Mumbling is not unusual for me when I used to go to sleep without medicational help.  I used to go to sleep reading my kids books, and my reading would end up mumbles and I would fall asleep before my kids did.Ambulance to the hospital, it only took a few blocks before ambulance personnel realized that I was not on drugs and was vividly awake. My doctor did some work ups, including a carotid artery check which was fine. I should have retired two years earlier than I did, which was in 2002.  My last semester I spent 2 weeks in the hospital, with pneumonia and severe uncontrolable IBS.I retired and applied for my salary protection. My company agreed that I was medically incapable of going back to work.  They eventually forced me to file for SSI, which I was awarded.I sleep better if I take a half tab of Vicodan with a 10mg Ambien tablet. Two tabs leaves my innerbrain numb and triggers irritability episodes.  I have tried a half tab of Ambien, but find it less than sleepful.  I am in pain 100% of the time and am on high blood pressure diuretics, gout medicines, anti-spasmodics, and others.  Ambien does not help me sleep if I am going through a night-time IBS episode.

ambien	Insomnia	2005-10-13 00:00:00		0.0	5.0	5.0	1.5	My expierience with Zolpidem as a chronic pain pat It didn't work for me. I had high hopes, since it was a non-benzodiazepine, chemically speaking, and it woudn't affect the different stages of sleep. I took one, 15 min befor bed, and it didn't do anything, not even calm my racing mind. In Belgium the maximum recomended dose is 10mg, so I didn't up the dose. After 3 nights, there I was, back at the GP's asking for something else. I think people should be aware though that Zolpidem is chemically not a benzodiazepine, it still works in pretty much the same way, by modulation of the GABA-A receptors in the brain. It should be effective for a longer period than a standard benzo, but in the end, the same effects of tolerance and withdrwal wil occer. In my case, I now take 2 mg of Flunitrazepam; Rhohypnol, combined with 20 mg, half a tablet of Clotiapine, and I get my 8 hours. Downsides: Rhohypnol is habitforming and Clotiapine, a neuloleptic, works for about 8 hours, so I NEED to sleep that long, or I'm extremely dizzy, much like being totally drunk.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/28511

I woke up feeling very refreshed with no hangover or sedative effect.  I found that after taking it for about a year, it just stopped working for me. I must have built up a tolerance to it.

ambien	Insomnia	2005-09-25 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	4.5	We the People are getting ripped off! I have had a serious chronic illness for over 25 years.  Was put on Ambien when it came out in an effort to offset my staying awake all night due to using Prednisone.  It worked fine then and it works fine now.   HOWEVER, my doctor and yours are being told to give us all this new &quot;wonder&quot; drug named ever so quaintly, Lunesta, which operates almost the same way, but doesn't work very long.  The major complaint about Ambien is it really only works for three or so hours.  True enough but giving us something good for an hour and a half is hardly an appropriate solution.More to the point is that Ambien is about to come off patent and will be much less expensively available to consumers.  Lo and behold, our civil servants who of course rely on the data they receive from the manufacturer of the new product, have made the decision to throw We the Patients to the wolves.  And as an interesting aside, it's more than ironic to note that Lunesta is being manufactured for us in Canada of all places where we are told it is dangerous for us to even shop for medications.Ambien is not obviously for everyone.  I read about the bad back thing and wonder if people haven't been taking higher than needed doses and falling asleep and staying in one position too long.  But for those who do have complaints about Ambien, fine.  You should have the opportunity to try other products.But for the insurance companies of this country and the FDA to assure the death of one rather innocuous medicine so that the new product will win, borders on the criminal.  They all yap about the rising cost of medicine but neglect to take into consideration the many people who have used Ambien successfully for years.  My dose hasn't changed from day one through today and it still works just fine for me and it costs less than ever and if had had remained a covered medicine, it's cost would have plummeted.I truly resent the manipulation of the marketplace that is	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/27838

ambien	Insomnia	2005-09-18 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	3.5	3.0	Constant Hangover...Unable to converse I've been on Ambien for the past 6 weeks at 20mg/night. Although, the meds put me to sleep and the &quot;buzz&quot; can be quite enjoyable at times, the feeling the next day is horrible. I stay tired (exhausted) both mentally and physically ALL day long. By afternoon, I'm so depressed from the tiredness that I have began to ponder suicide. This thinking has shown me that this medication is NOT for me.The first two weeks were tolerable because I was able to wake up around 8:30am while going to sleep around 11:00 pm. However, the past three weeks have been horrible due to a new job that starts at 7:00 am. Now I try to go to sleep at 9pm and get up at 5:30am. But the Ambien is carrying over sooooo bad. I don't know if it's because my body has gotten use to the 11pm - 8am schedule or if I've always been this tired on Ambien, but never noticed it until I've had to function at a FT job. I've almost quit my job on 3 seperate occasions due to the tiredness. Even now, I still don't know if I'll have any energy to function at work. My mind is so drugged (or tired) that I cannot focus, recall information, and have even lost the ability to communicate verbally. It's like the words slowly come out or the brain isn't able to put the words together. So, I sit there like a mute almost all day. This behavior adds to my anxiety and makes the depression worse. Even though I've been able to link the lethargy, depression, and suicidal thoughts to the sleep meds, the need for sleep outweighs the consequences.For now, I've decided that although the meds work at a higher dose, the hangover is too great for me. I'm looking to try a more herbal or supplement route, but I've had NO success with this route in the past. I'm so worried about losing my job (best pay I've ever had), the lack of sleep, the depression, suicidal thoughts, etc...that now I'm beginning to dread each night.I rated this drug as Effective with side effects because the drug does ind	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/27507

ambien	Insomnia	2005-09-17 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Review of Ambien I find Ambien to be very effective even after multiple years of use. I have no problems with side effects. I have had problems with Insomnia for at least 20 years. I began taking Ambien about 10 years ago. I have problems with both falling asleep and staying asleep. The Ambien has helped me fall asleep anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour from the time I take it. Unless I am having a bad-stress time it can carry me at least 7 hours or more, even if I get up for the bathroom, I can fall back asleep easily.

I have insomnia because my mind gets so active with so many thoughts that I couldn't fall asleep. Ambien works well for me. Initially, when I took Ambien, I was having non-violent psychotic eposides (hallucinations, bizarre behaviors, lack of memory) but I swear I felt like I had a long night sleep when I woke up. Fortunately, those nightly psychotic eposides went away after two weeks of continued treatment. Now, I could take Ambien and get a full night sleep. And wake up totally refreshed. I am trying other sedatives because I don't have drug insurance and Ambien is very expensive. One more thing, Ambien won't work if you take it after eating. It has to be on empty stomach.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26952

The short half-life, (the time it takes for the drug to leave your body) was purposely designed so people would not wake groggy. But for me, I experienced a terror, agitation, and anxiety I've never known. I asked my local pharmacist if this happens in some people taking this drug and he confirmed that it did. VERY SCARY.

No W/D effects at all upon stopping the Ambien.Then around June / July of 2002 I had a sudden onset of hypercortisolism (apparently due to a malfunctioning of the HPA Axis) that resulted in numerous symptoms, to include severe anxety and severe insomnia. I went on Ambien about three different times (for weeks at a time). First 10 mg, then 15 mg, and then 20 mg. In each case the ambien would (usually, not always, but usually) get me to sleep initially but then I would wake up after 3 - 4 hours and be unable to get back to sleep.I was then put on Restoril (75 mg) for a while. Somewhat better. More consistent in getting to sleep, but would still only sleep 4 - 5 hours and be unable to get back to sleep.Insomnia cure finally came about through use of Remeron. I was put on Remeron not for purpose of AD but due to studies showing Remeron has significant anti-cortisol effects. An interesting side effect (in my case) was the sedating effect has completely knocked out the severe insomnia.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26231

ambien	Insomnia	2005-08-01 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	Forgetfulness caused by ambien, ADD or old age?! I've been taking ambien for 3 full years since a death of a close family member.  I took b/t 2.5 mg (cut pill in half) up to 7.5 mg (three 1/2 doses on night b/f surgery, when traveling, or stressed out).  It worked very well for me as I took only as needed; ie: tried to fall asleep on my own w/o medication before taking half a 5 mg tablet, took another half 5 mg if I awoke or still couldn't sleep.  However, I seemed to become very forgetful and I'm not sure if that was caused by mild ADD (recently diagnosed at age 42) or daily ambien use.  For example, I left spare car keys hanging at back of car as I drove with another set.  Also, went to make a cup of tea and threw the travel sewing kit into my cup and proceeded to pour instant hot water over it instead of a teabag!  I was active duty officer in US military for several years, so I used to be much more detailed.  I wonder is my forgetfulness really mild ADD, ambien, or old age?  Now I'm giving Lunesta a try.  It's quite a bit more expensive, but worth it for a good night's sleep, I hope.  Have tried it a few nights and had to supplement with half dose of 5 mg ambien first night and slept the following two nights through the entire night.  So far, so good.  I think I'll be switching to Lunesta for long term use instead of ambien.  Only noticable side effects are bitter taste and hard to score.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25071

ambien	Insomnia	2005-07-03 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Circadian Cycle I have bipolar disorder II and at one point (though not experiencing mania), I kept going to sleep later and later and later until I didn't sleep at all before going to work the next day.  It was due to several months of stress at a new job.  I was an emotional and mental wreck.  I called my boss and told him I was taking a week off.  I called my psychiatrist and made an appointment to see him.  At the time, I knew very little about being bipolar, little about the meds I was already taking and nothing about sleeping medications or how they worked.  My psychiatrist had prescribed me Lorazepam in the past, so I asked him for that to work out my sleeping issues.  He didn't want me relying on Lorazepam to sleep, instead he gave me a prescription for two weeks of Ambien (I had never heard of it - several years ago).  He didn't prescribe more because he said it could be addictive, too.  He told me if I took it for two weeks straight, my problem would be resolved and I should be back on a normal sleeping schedule.  The first night I took Ambien, I tossed and turned for a couple hours, slept fitfully and woke up a couple times, but I did sleep that night.  I was disappointed, though, and thought I'm never going to sleep regularly and soundly again. On the second night that I took Ambien, I fell asleep within an hour or so, and slept through the whole night.  I took it for 1-1/2 weeks, stopping short of the two weeks to see if I was back on schedule and would be able to sleep without the Ambien and I was!  Oh joy!  I've used it periodically since then, but the alterations in the combination of other meds treating my bipolar disorder has mostly resolved the sleeping issues I experienced back then.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24471

But as the weeks went by, (7-9 weeks)the 10 mg. stopped working. It's not really recommended to take more. Now, I was taking longer to fall asleep 1-1/2 hours and waking up wide awake at 3:00 am!

My sleep cycle is really out of whack and no matter how hard I try to force myself into a schedule, my body wants to be awake at night.  If I have an early appointment, staying up till sunrise just doesn't cut it.  But 10-15 mg. of Ambien takes care of that and leaves me with no side effects at all.  Due to the outrageous expense, I have never used Ambien on a long term basis.  Only as an emergency sleep aid when I absolutely, positively have to be somewhere in the morning.  I did discover that it is important to take it and GO TO BED!  If you try to stay up, the sleepiness will wear off after a few hours and you may not remember much about what you did, anyway.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24231

I took breaks of a week, or so, every three months, to ensure I was not getting hooked.  Ambien did a good job of keeping me asleep, but I had to wait until I was nodding off before I took it, or it had no effect.  It could not take me from a mentally alert state, into sleep.

The first one never really put me to sleep so I took a second once about two hours after the first.  Another time I took one I slept for 3 hours and woke up wide eyed in the middle of the night.  Another time I just kept tossing and turning and felt funny.  I couldn't really sleep at all.  My personal favorite it a 50mg-100mg of Trazodone with .5mg-1mg of Xanax.  Problem, as usual, is that if you use these aids every night, you will get use to them.  Also I don't want to use Xanax anymore and have stopped using it because of its depedency/addictive issues.

ambien	Insomnia	2005-06-14 00:00:00		5.0	1.5	4.5	4.0	works but damn. I took Ambien for insomnia caused by major agitated depression.  When nothing (and i mean nothing) else would knock me out this would do it 100% of the time.  But at one helluva price.  Consistently and every time the next day featured some of the blackest depression i have ever known.  I eventually went with sleeping an hour a night for days on end rather than take this stuff.  Trazadone worked ~ 60% with none of the side effects.  Eventually I found an anti-depressent (Mirtazapine) that worked and cured the insomnia.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23585
ambien	Insomnia	2005-06-12 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.0	Effective, but perhaps time to be wary I haven't had the tolerance problems that other reviewers are quick to point out.  But I'm becoming keenly aware of a dependence, whether psychological or physical I'm not entirely sure.  Also, mystifying intestinal problems are telling me it's time to break free of this drug.  Otherwise, I'd have to say that it's quicker and more effective than Valium or Sonata, and for a long time I assumed there were no catches.  Some members of the medical community are beginning to warn that Ambien is really not all that different from the notorious benzodiazapines.   I'm hoping withdrawal and stoppage isn't anything like breaking a benzo habit.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23550

In both cases, the drug caused significant deviations in my psychiatric well being. These deviations manifested themselves as thoughts of suicide and violence, which were very difficult to fight with. I was very scared by these side effects and never used Ambien again. A different doctor prescribed Imovane and that works very good: I fall asleep without any weird thoughts and wake up refreshed.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23479

ambien	Insomnia	2005-05-24 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	Excellent sleep aid Update 5/22/05: My faith in Ambien has been restored!  As noted below, after a half year or so of nightly use, Ambien had started to poop out on me - 5 mgs was no longer enough and I was anxious about building up more and more tolerance.  Well, at the advice of my pdoc, I cold-turkeyed the Ambien to see what would happen, and guess what, no big deal.  ONE fitful night and then I was able to sleep OK without it (however, I do take Xanax which also helps with sleep).  Anyway...I have insomnia so after about a week without the Ambien I was starting to sleep irregularly again.  I tried taking 5 mg one night a week after going off it, and guess what, it knocked me right out - no tolerance at all.  In short, for me the good news is that if I take an &quot;Ambien break&quot; I can return to the drug and it's effective as if I had not built up any tolerance.  I've been limiting my usage to 2-3 x per week and that really seems to be working in terms of not having to up it to 10 mg.  Before this experiment I was thinking about trying Lunesta, but then I saw the mediocre reviews here and also my pdoc was less than enthusiastic about Lunesta (he is familiar with it and does not think it is a good drug).  So I'm really pleased that with a little ambien break, it comes back strong and effective as when I first started it.***Update 4/4/05:  Just wanted to say that after about 6-7 months of pretty steady use, Ambien is starting to poop out on me.  For the last few months I was falling asleep quickly on 5 mg, but in the past 2 weeks 5 mg has been having no effect and it has taken 10 mg to get me to sleep.  Of course, 10 mg is a &quot;normal&quot; dose so there's nothing to be alarmed at quite yet, but it is disconcerting to see the tolerance start to build up.  I did, however, get half a year of daily use out of it before the tolerance kicked in. I will be continuing to use it at 10 mg, but when that poops out and more (15 or 20 mg) is required, I will find something else. H	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18784
ambien	Insomnia	2005-05-21 00:00:00		4.0	3.0	4.0	3.5	Benzo Tolerance because of Ambien I was first prescribed Ambien at age 15 by a general practitioner, started on the 5 mg tablets and eased up to 10.  I took it for several months, but my tolerance built up higher, so I chose to take myself off of it and use Benadryl for my chronic insomnia.Later on in life, I started back on it -- and even after three years off of it, my tolerance was such that I couldn't take a 5 mg tablet and have any effect -- and a 10 mg barely did anything.I also noticed at that time that my benzodiazepine tolerance was through the roof -- at least for sleep-inducing properties.  I could take 4 mg of Xanax, and not be sleepy.  One night when I was very tired but couldn't wind down, a neighbor gave me two Valium 10s.  I took both, hoping it would put me down -- I ended up cleaning my apartment because I just wasn't sleepy. Ambiens not a bad drug.  But it does have some seriousissues with tolerance-inducing effects, and since itbinds selectively to one particular benzodiazepinereceptor and not the rest, when you gain a toleranceto its effects it also affects how you react to otherbenzodiazepines -- they work fine for anxiety relief,which is their primary purpose, but sleep-inducingeffects are diminished.I think it's perfect to take for very short-terminsomnia.  You absolutely MUST take it on an emptystomach, take it with a glass of water at your bed,and immediately lay down to go to sleep, and make sureyou have allotted eight to ten hours for sleep, toavoid the amnesia effects that &quot;Ambien-naive&quot;individuals have occasionally.It's been two years since I've taken any, and I wasout of town this week.  A friend had one 10 mg Ambien,and I often have worse insomnia issues in hotels.  Itook it last night, then immediately brushed teeth andlaid down.  It took between 15 and 20 minutes to fallasleep, and I employed specific breathing exercises toassist as well.

ambien	Insomnia	2005-05-16 00:00:00		4.5	0.5	5.0	3.0	Very addictive! Ive been using Ambien for about 3 years. First year took it 2-3 times week and had no problems. With time my dose has increased to 1 and half tab to two tabs for any effect . Tolerance builds up fast if taken daily. Also side effects have definitely become very problematic. Next day anxiety and memory problems really bad. Slight depression worsened dramatically with usage as well. Currently attempting to taper off but experiencing withdrawal side-effects like tremors and rebound insomnia. very addictive and lots of cognitive impairing problems. Use for short term only!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11958

ambien	Insomnia	2005-05-13 00:00:00		1.5	1.0	5.0	2.0	Powerful, if only temporarily My review might be slightly tainted.  I had been on Prozac for 6-7 years and got off.  Was fine Jan-March, but then fell into a deep depression with anxiety.  I was waking up every night several times, couldn't get back to sleep, had horrible anxiety, etc.  This pattern increased until I asked my doctor for help.  He prescribed Lexapro and Ambien on the same day.  Well, little did I know that Lexapro could cause symptoms to get worse initially.  So I'm assuming my resistance to the Ambien may have been exacerbated by the Lexapro.However, I took 1 10mg. of Ambien while sitting in a chair next to my bed.  Not long after, I was seeing double and could hardly get myself to the bed.  Part of me was worried about how drugged I felt, but part of me was looking forward to sleeping for a change.  3 hours later I woke up, wide awake.  Decided to take half a pill to get me back to sleep.  It worked and I was out again.  2 hours later I was wide awake again.  Took another 1/2 pill to get back asleep.  Woke up again a few hours later.The next day I felt lethargic.  I could barely move.  I was exhausted but couldn't sleep.  That was the first day I couldn't eat either.  Tried to, but things tasted like paste.  That happened for 3 days before I got a dose of Klonopin.  That stuff works great.  In fact, I get the best sleep results if I take a Klonopin right before I go to sleep.  Keeps my mind from racing.So, I'm hesitant to take the Ambien again.  Thinking I'll probably continue to rely on my old standby, Benadryl, when I need help.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22734
ambien	Insomnia	2005-05-12 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Ambien I have had &quot;early-awakening&quot; cycles that totally screw up life in general over the past couple of years.  Wake up after 2-3 hours and can't go back to sleep at all.  Then I am groggy and irritable all day, falling asleep while driving, etc.  Take a &quot;nap&quot; at night and starts again from there.3 times in the last 4 years I have fallen into this cycle and Ambien has been very effective to help me back to normal.  My insomnia is not a constant problem though, it is a habit I fall into once in a while.  The effectiveness definitely drops off the longer you take them.  The 1st night I took  one and was out (I mean fell asleep sitting up!) in a half hour.  I must admit after it rids me of the problem, I find myself using up the rest of the bottle because they are addictive.  (After about 2 weeks, my problem is gone but I keep taking them and can actually stay up 4 more hours.)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22699
ambien	Insomnia	2005-05-11 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Tricks to using this medication.... I have been using this medication for 10+ years and it will only work when you have no food in your system. For example, it won't work at all if you eaten 3-4 hours prior to taking it. However, if you eat AFTER you have taken the pill it will work. I take Ambien at 9pm and eat at 9:45pm. It does lose its effectiveness over time, but having an empty stomach makes it work better. When I started taking it, it did make me &quot;see things&quot; and I forgot everything that happened the night prior. This is a good drug, but don't EAT many hours prior to taking it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22688
ambien	Insomnia	2005-05-06 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.0	Ambien I liked the fact that Ambien really knocks me out however I'm nervous about becoming dependent. I have portioned out a small prescription (30 pills)over a year to take when I am in desperate need.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22497
ambien	Insomnia	2005-05-04 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	3.5	3.5	Memory Loss of Ambien When I first began taking Ambien I thought that it was the answer to all of my sleep problems. I was finally able to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep for the duration of the night (something I hadn't done in 15 years). The drawback was that I experienced serious memory loss problems, and not just at night. I would lose parts of my day and not realize it until it was pointed out to me. I suggest using caution when taking Ambien on a daily basis.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22346
ambien	Insomnia	2005-05-03 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Ambien Ambien works long term if periodic breaks from it (two or more days) are taken.  However, in my opinion it is very addictive and withdrawal from it is painfully miserable, both physically and psychologically.  For me the ability to even take a nap without ambien occurred after several months of using it.  Like any other addictive substance, it's heaven when it works, but hell when it doesn't and a tolerance to it can be expected.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22332
ambien	Insomnia	2005-05-01 00:00:00		4.0	4.5	4.5	4.0	Ambien This medication was effective for me and worked even if I used less than the prescribed dose. I have used it a few times per month for several years. I was fresh and awake in the AM. It is fairly expensive but seems worthwhile.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22288
ambien	Insomnia	2005-04-29 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	4.0	Hangover without the fun I really did well with Ambien at night.  Unfortunately, the half-life is rather long, so every time I stopped moving during the day, I fell asleep again.  After some time with this side effect (fortunately I wasn't working at the time), I cut back to 5 mg.  That was somewhat better.  Then I cut back to 2.5 mg.  When I got to that point, I gave it up since at 2.5 mg, it was probably more a psychological benefit than a physical one.  However, the Ambien did &quot;break&quot; the &quot;insomnia cycle&quot; for quite a while. Now, when I have a bout of insomnia, I take Sonata.  It has a much shorter half-life.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22200

ambien	Insomnia	2005-04-27 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Ambien showed me what sleep was... I have never slept much, childhood, college to adulthood, 4-6 hours a night.  I wake up about 10:00pm, no matter how tired I have been all day.  I would get up in the night to go to the restroom and stay up and read or clean the kitchen or do a craft for at least and hour before being able to go back to sleep.  I have asthma, lupus and other various aliments, which means a lot of medications.  I have always resisted taking a sleeping pill because I knew I would be hooked if I tried one.  Well, I was partially right.  I could not believe how rested I felt after a whole night of uninterrupted sleep. Before, I slept through the night maybe 2-3 times a year, and my first thought in the morning would be that I was either dead or had wet the bed. :&gt;  I don't have to take Ambien every night and sometimes I just take 5 mgs, sometimes 10 mgs. After a few nights, my body seems to get the rhythm of rest, and it is blessed.  My overall health is improved because I am rested for the first time in my life.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22118

ambien	Insomnia	2005-04-27 00:00:00		2.5	0.0	5.0	2.0	Ambien I've been using 10 mg Ambien for at least a year but find that some nights I need to take a half a tablet more unless I take it with Benedryl. If I take it @ 10mg alone, it takes me a while to get to sleep (if I do at all) and I usually don't sleep all through the night.  I've been taking 10mg tablet with a benedryl tablet at night and sleeping without fully waking for 9-12 hours.  I need more sleep so don't base your findings on what my sleep needs are.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22100

ambien	Insomnia	2005-04-27 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	bluesharp Insomnia for me is caused by arthritic pain both in my lower back and between the shoulders. I don't know how it works, but it does.  I find it works better with a C-PAP machine. Without a C-PAP machine, early awakening happens a lot, with Ambien. With the C-PAP machine, I can sleep more than 8 hours. But no matter how long I sleep, once awakened, my pain is all encompassing. I drizzle out of bed, eat breakfast and go laydown with a trusty thermophore for 2 to three hours before I can walk without &quot;all encompassing&quot; pain.I have tried a half tablet. Not effective.  Two tablets, leaves me with the &quot;dead brain stem syndrome,&quot; where I spend the day with some part of my brain sleepy.Ambien does not work, in any form, 2 tablets, etc. if I am going through an Irritable Bowel Attack.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22093

Threw a whole bottle away.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22085
ambien	Insomnia	2005-04-27 00:00:00		3.0	2.5	5.0	3.0	Ambien and long term use Hello, I have severe Interstitial Cystits and severe Fibromyalgia as well as Endometriosis(in remission, for now!) I meditate everyday for and hour.  It's not just meditating, it is a system called Holosync technology.  This actually helps me to form new neuro pathways, therefore creating a dramatic improvement in the threhold of stress in my brain.  I mean, everyone has a maximum threshold for stress before the body feels that fight or flight reflex.  By creating these new neuro pathways by listening to sounds in low carrier frequencies, I am developing a new threshold.  It really does work, but with that said, having IC means having urgency, PAIN and frequency.  I have nocturia, which is frequency at night.  I can get up every 10 mins when I feel my worst.  I have to use a catheter every time I urinate.  So, I need to practice relaxation techniques in order to use the cath, but relaxation techniques, meditation, etc are not going to help me get any sleep.  For me, I am happy that I am able to use Ambien. It helps me at least to fall asleep and to get back to sleep more quickly than without it.  Now that Lunesta is out, I am looking into whether or not it will be as effective as Ambien.  I like Ambien.  I have been on it for over 5 years.  Lunesta is suppose to be safe for long term use.  It studies have only gone as long as 6 months.  As far as I am concerned, I hope I am able to stay with the Ambien.  It works for me with minimal side effects.  If I am unable to sleep immediately in one night, and have taken the ambien, sometimes I have memory problems.  Only for the period of time immediately after taking the med.  It is recommended that you take Ambien right before you put your head on the pillow. For me, I have to get up so often, that sometimes that is not possible for me to do.  When this happens, I have a small amount of short term memory loss.  I am not unconcerned at the fact that memory loss happens, it is just a reasonable side	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22077
ambien	Insomnia	2005-04-27 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	Ambien I take 1/2 tablet 4-5 nights per week and it works very well except I still have times when I wake up on it @ 3 a.m. and cannot return to sleep. When that happens, I feel shaky and jittery when I get up. That feeling continues for a few hours. I don't know if some of my vivid dreaming is caused by taking this drug or not but I know that if this medication is taken over an extended period of time, you can suffer rebound insomnia. I'm very afraid of becoming dependent on it so I go off of it in cycles until my insomnia returns.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22068

Regardless, I was sleepwalking and even getting into my car unknowingly.  I told my psychiatrist this and she immediately took me off.  I've never even seen this listed as a side effect.  I also had some groggyness and it was hard to find a right dose.  I switched over to seroquel .25mg, which isnt commonly used for sleep.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21889

It was effective for the first 10 days, helping me fall asleep in just minutes. But after 3 weeks it no longer helped me sleep at all. When it did work, I only slept for about 5 hours.

After 10 yrs of taking ambien, I am concerned because I'm having problems w/short term memory, and depression.  but it could be also menopause (I'm 51)   So, I cut down to 5mg every night, and it doesn't keep me asleep all night, so I take the other half around 1 or 2am, if I need it and I can still get up for 6am.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21224
ambien	Insomnia	2005-04-12 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	3.5	3.5	Sleep Options Ambien is very hypnotic I think-meaning sudden and rapid onset.  I've taken it for several years.  I take 10-20mg a night.  I like how good it can work for 5-7 days if you haven't taken it in awhile.  I do not like how addictive it can be.  How when I first took it I hallucinated.  I also do not like how costly it is.  Some people have to take two 10mg tablets to get relieve.  That cost a small fortune.  I think that this drug is safe, albiet all that I have said because it is very advanced in it's mechanics of action from what I've researched.  Compared to 10mg Sonata, it is twice as strong for me.  Compared to Lunesta 3mg it is probably as strong but hard to compare because they work a little different.Ambien needs an extended release version because it is way to short acting for people who have all the types of insomnia-getting asleep, staying asleep, and getting up too early. They now have an Ambien 30 day back, it's ambien in a packet to help you keep up with how many you take.  THat is a good thing because it can make you can forget!I do think Ambien's makers price the drug unrealistically, knowing well that insurance does not always cover it, and that many chronic patients have to take high dosages.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21147

ambien	Insomnia	2005-04-05 00:00:00		1.5	1.0	4.5	1.5	AMBIEN IS A POOR CHOICE FOR A SLEEP MED I initially liked Ambien because before it put you to sleep it gave you a buzz. But, of course, that in itself can be a problem. I think when it first came out they said it wasn't addictive but they were very wrong. That's problem #1. Problem #2, it only let me sleep 4 hours, then I would have to take another one to sleep another 4 hours, therefore, my dosage kept going up. Problem #3, (and I'm really not sure which was the biggest problem for me) I had terrible memory problems. Like blackout memory problems. The next morning I could not remember the last couple of hours before I went to bed. A couple of times, I found out that I even drove - yes, pretty terrifying and extremely dangerous. It scared me to death to hear this. Needless to say, I discontinued taking Ambien. It didn't work that well anyway.Oh, and it wasn't until many years later that I found out I wasn't the only one who had the blackouts on Ambien. A couple of friends told me their similar stories. And on the tv commercial, one of the side effects was memory loss.Just wanted to let you know.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/20883

I find when I have a very stressful or eventful day, and PMS I need to take it.  I don't feel I need to take it every night, but when I do, it does help, so much.  I was told by my sleep specialist, that a higher dosage is fine for people that are bigger and have taken it awhile.  He knows of some that take three times of what I take!  WOW!  I feel this has been a life saving drug, as if I never had it, I would have many nights of not sleeping and taking care of an ADHD BOY who is 8 years old.  I am also a single parent, so I need to sleep and be awake with no side affects.  As I take this, as needed with also Clonidine .2mg, and 2mg of Clonazepam, and 800mg of Neurontin (Generic SP???

ambien	Insomnia	2005-03-29 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	This stuff scares me. I've been taking 15 mg of Ambien per night, because 10 didn't do it for me.  Apparently this is a high dose, and it worries me, but it still doesn't keep me asleep through the night, particularly since starting Lexapro... No real side effects, just I worry about addiction, so right now I've tapered down to 12.5mg.  I don't like this stuff, but a girl's gotta sleep.----------------------3/29/05--I complained to my psychiatrist that I wasn't staying asleep for more than 6 hours on ambien, and she told me I should take 2 tablets per night. I told her that worried me, given its addictive nature, but she didn't think I had to be any more concerned than I was...  I don't know.  I think I do better with the 20 mg, but nothing miraculous.  I do love how quickly I fall asleep, but be aware--on 20 mg, I don't remember a lot of things that occur right before going to bed.  Which is fine, I don't really do anything noteworthy, but just something to be careful with!We're hoping that stopping Wellbutrin in a few weeks might help my sleep.

I fall asleep but will wake up 3 or 4 hours later and have trouble getting back to sleep.

ambien	Insomnia	2005-03-20 00:00:00		4.5	0.5	4.0	3.0	I LOVE THIS STUFF I only take ambien maybe once a week if needed.  sometimes 2x's a week. I take 10mg or sometimes I just take 5mg.  usually within 30-60 minutes Im out like a light.  My insomnia problem is I cant fall asleep sometimes.  Anyways, I've tried ativan (it worked but took about 3 hours to kick in). I've tried tylenol pm, benadryl, valerian.  All of these work if it is just a mild case of insomnia but some nights its hardcore and only than will I take ambien and its never let me down yet.

ambien	Insomnia	2005-03-16 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	4.5	Ambien and Wellbutrin I've never been a strong sleeper, and when I had to go on Wellbutrin XL 300 MG for depression, I had nights when I could barely sleep at all. Wellbutrin has that effect on many people: It &quot;revs you up&quot; (some people get dangerously manic) and then come 10:30 PM, the brain is still revving even though you know you have to get up at 6 AM to go to work. Wellbutrin stopped short of making me manic, but it definitely made my insomnia worse.Enter Ambien. My MD says it isn't addictive and you can take it indefinitely. (Clearly, not everyone experiences it that way.) I haven't been on it long enough to know for sure (I will update this rating if anything changes) but so far, after a few weeks I have seen no evidence of tolerence.I tinkered with different doses, and what seems to work best for me is this: I cut a 10 mg Ambien in half, and take one of the halves right before bed. The first dose takes effect in about half an hour, and keeps me asleep for about three hours. If I can't fall back asleep in another half hour or so, I take the second half, which gives me another three hours. Alas, by then it's time to get up again.Here's the interesting part: *Half* a 10 mg pill works just as well, and for just as long, as a *whole* 10 mg pill. Amazingly, a *third* of a pill works as well too! Go figger! My MD suggested that that might be the case, and told me it was cheaper to buy the larger pills and split them. The 10 mg splits well into halves, and with some care into thirds. I haven't been able to divide a pill into quarters yet without reducing it to crumbles. I do recommend that you use as small a dose as will work. Try a third. It might work, and it will save you money, and perhaps hold off tolerance a little while longer.So far, I have had none of the side effects that seem to torment others reviewing Ambien here. None! I was holding my breath on that one, because I had read all the umpty-ump reviews here before I started the drug. It s	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19947

Then would not be able to sleep through whole might, so Dr. prescribed 25 mg seroquel.  This doen't help me get to sleep, but does help me stay asleep once ambien knocks me out.  Doc said I could take up to 2 seroquel, but have seldom had the need to.  Really don't like taking the seroquel because of diabetes /lipids risk, but doc said at such low doses, it shouldn't matter.  Totally incapable of sleep without meds now, but I could barely sleep at all before, so I'm not that concerned.  Want to take lunesta when it comes out, as that is supposed to last longer and thus may make it unnecessary to take the seroquel.  The lunesta also may help with depression.   I have insurance so I rated cost at 4 because it is a third tier medication costing $35 for me.  If you don't have insurance it is very expensive.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19457

Ambien has helped me to sleep more soundly.On the flip side, ambien makes me feel like I'm &quot;drugged&quot; the next day.  Also, if I take one tablet I will sleep great until about 3:00 or 4:00am, two tablets and I wake up at 5:30am.  And when I wake up I feel wide awake and can barely go back to sleep.  If I'm not asleep 30 minutes after I take ambien I stumble around like a drunken idiot and can barely remember what happened before I fell asleep.  I have definitely experienced some memory loss with ambien.  It has also caused me to have some pretty crazy, vivid dreams.Ambien is a useful drug for me but has some serious side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19402

When I tried Ambien it worked great and I thought I could sleep like a normal person. I found later I could only take it every 3 days or so, as it was ineffective with daily use. When I need a good night of sleep I take it but it doesn't work on a daily basis. I have no side effects from it and I take the pill and go to bed, fall asleep. When I've taken it and stayed up a while I missed that sleep &quot;window&quot; and was awake all night. Even so, I think it is a good sleep aid used the right way occaisionally.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19019
ambien	Insomnia	2005-02-23 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	3.0	1.0	AMBIEN I have suffered from insomnia on and off throughout most of my adult life and have tried many different over-the-counter remedies with varying success. When I'm in a &quot;bad sleep cycle&quot; I usually take an over-the-counter medication for 1 or 2 nights to help get me back on track.  I generally don't like relying on pills and I had always been reluctant to try prescription medication.  However, I'm now in the early stages of menopause and my insomnia has been getting worse lately, so several months ago I finally decided to ask my doctor for a prescription for Ambien. Unfortunately, I must report that I do NOT find it very effective. Over the last few months, I've tried it a few times (never more than 1 or 2 nights in a row).  I take it early enough in the evening to insure that I'm able to get &quot;8 hours of sleep.&quot;  It makes my body feel numb but I still find it hard to fall asleep ... it's like my body is asleep, but my brain is still awake.  I also feel very lethargic the next day.  To tell the truth, I find over-the-counter antihistamines more effective, with fewer side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18970

Prior to taking this medication I could not sleep for more than 4 hours in any night and that 4 hours was very broken sleep. With Ambien I take a tablet when I go to bed and will fall alseep within 30 or less. I wake after 6-7 hours refreshed and ready for the day.

Prior tothat I would have no difficulty falling asleep, but Iwould not be able to get back to sleep once I woke inthe night. I take small pieces (1/4 to 1/3) of the10mg pill which I find (sometimes) works better takingthe entire 10mg at one time. After an illness about 3years ago, I began taking ambien also to fall asleepinitially. That's where I am now. I don't seem to haveany noticeable side effects and I never have thedrugged out feeling in the morning. Its unfair thatthis drug that works so well (for me) needs to beprescribed, and is restricted and expensive, whereasthe cheap, easily available over-the-counter drugs arethe ones that are debilitating (bad hangover). Mydoc's opinion is that ambien is not harmful when takenlong term. About 10% of the time the drug doesn'twork, but generally I have not experienced diminishedeffects over the years I've been taking ambien.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18498

ambien	Insomnia	2005-01-14 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	2.5	3.5	Ambien is superior to other benzos for insomniacs Ambien is much more effective for me (a long term insomniac that has frequent early morning wakening) than Xanax or Ativan. I couldn't believe that I was falling deeply asleep a half hour after taking this medication! It was especially useful for those 3AM awakenings- I would take half a pill and sleep another 4 hours instead of being up the rest of the night and dragging myself miserably through the next day. I used it approx. 2-4 times a week for about 2 years until it began losing its effectiveness and I noticed an increase in headaches (which I almost never get on my own) and lethergy during the day after taking it. Then my Kaiser work insurance plan dropped it from the allowed covered medication list (are they crazy!?!) and I was given Ativan as a replacement, which is not reliable or generally very effective. Now I'm on Trazedone (for concurrent depression) which I find to it to work decently, though not with the wonderful speed and efficiency of Ambien. Oh, as an aside, often as I was falling into that one of a kind 'Ambien dreamland' I would find myself feeling very creative and I wrote a lot of poetry and prose until (30 minutes later) I was completely knocked out. Looking forward to that patent expiring in 3 years so it can be a much more affordable generic.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18050

At first it worked great, but I got used to it and it no longer made me sleepy plus I always woke up in the middle of the night.  I discontinued use for about 4 months and was using Sonata because I could take it when I woke up without morning sleepiness.  I went back to Ambien because I needed something stronger and again it worked for a little while. I'm disappointed in Ambien, but I still take it usually with klonopin to boost the effect.  We'll see if it works because I'm waiting for the drug to kick in so I can go to sleep.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18010

ambien	Insomnia	2005-01-06 00:00:00		1.0	5.0	5.0	2.5	Is the best relaxation, stay awake medication. For some reason Ambien makes me feel good, relaxed and gives me energy.  It does not put me to sleep.  I actually took 2 10 mg. tablets at bed time (10:00pm or so) last week, and stayed up until 6:30 am.  I then went to bed and slept for 6 hours just fine.  They just aren't very useful for me when I really need to be knocked out, but can help relax me. The one exception is if I have not slept for 3 or 4 nights in a row for more than a couple of hours, and really need to sleep - That &quot;too tired to sleep&quot; mode.  They have helped me sleep a couple of times in that situation.I probably have taken 50 pills over 4 years, so haven't been habit forming, but also haven't really helped. I have had some memory problems the nights I stay up and work on computer, etc. Not forgetting, but a little fuzzy.  This could be because I understand the drug is actually a hypnotic.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17910

I know that everyone and their mother loves Ambien, but it doesn't work for me. 5 milligrams or more puts me to sleep (it always puts me to sleep) but I feel soo tired the next day, and invariable I feel depressed--like the world is terrible/life is meaningless depressed (this never happens with other sleep aids). Half a 5 mg gives me dream-filled broken sleep, which for me is much worse than taking nothing.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17778

ambien	Insomnia	2004-12-17 00:00:00		1.5	0.0	2.5	1.0	Bad Drug - This is why... This drug is not all its cracked up to be.I first discovered this when my wife kept telling me that I would wake up in the middle of the night, and do strange things.  Like, fix a bowl of cereal, then poor Orange juice over it.  Then go back to bed.  We would periodically wake up to find all kinds of strange messes, or things around the house moved.  I went to my doctor after a few weeks of this, and he told me this is common!  COMMON!!  He told me that many patients on Ambien suffer a type of amnesia or memory loss after taking Ambien, and that some patients may do strange things, he told me one of his patients was found by his wife in the corner of the basement one night, naked, and cowering next to the water heater.  He swears its not possible, and doesn't remember a thing.  I sympathized, because I don't remember doing any of the things my wife keeps telling me I do at night from time to time on Ambien.  I have NEVER done these things before taking this drug.  I told my Doctor I did not want to take this awful drug any more; I was scared I might do something dangerous like try to drive!So, he put me on Restoril 7.5mg, which I must say, works fantastic.  No hang over and its $20 a month cheaper in co-pay on my insurance.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17659

I've been taking Ambien for over four months and I find it works very well as long as I don't eat anything within a few hours of taking it. It is supposedly addicitve but I don't see a tolerance effect and I occasionally use other sleep aids instead to break away from using it every single night. I used to use marijuana to help me sleep and frankly, I think it's much better and much safer to take a few hits off the pipe and fall asleep, with no hangover effect - Ambien does make me feel hung over a bit for the first hour of the day. Now a clinical researcher in insomnia told me that he believes that it is not addictive and will continue to work as long as I take it, with the exception that the hangover effect will clear up as time goes on. But my doctor disagrees and says we will need to taper off and find some other solution in the near future.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17094
ambien	Insomnia	2004-11-16 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	5.0	4.5	works fast, BUT take it on the way to bed! My sleep pattern has been messed up for years, either sleeping too much or not enough.  Ambien works great, and quickly, but if I force myself to finish watching that movie or get involved with an activity that will keep me from laying down and falling asleep when the very drowsy stage hits, it will pass and I'll be awake all night.  I have also found that breaking the tablet in two works great.  I take 1/2 tab (5MG) as I go to bed, it makes me just a drowsy as the full tablet and then if I do wake up around 3 or 4am I take the other half.  This way I really do get a full nights sleep.  Sometimes when taking the whole tablet I still wake up at 3am, and if I cut it in half I don't take more than is prescribed.  It just seems to make it work more on a time release that will work for a good 8 hrs and not just 4.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17071

Finally, I had a doctor perscribe AMBIEN.  It puts me to sleep right away, in fact, when you take ambien, go directly to bed as it is an amnesiac.  At first, I would take it, then stay on the computer until I &quot;got sleepy&quot;.  It took a while before I realized I had been ordering books on Amazon.com and not remembering any of it....until my Visa bill came.  Anyway, I have been on Ambien for 8 years.  It is still effective for me, though now with my pain level so high, I take it with one vicodin at bedtime.  I get a straight 5 hours sleep for the first time since I was 18.  (I am now 45)  The advertisements say not to be used for over 2 weeks, but I have not had insurance tell me no to the monthly perscriptions nor have I had to increase the dose much, thank God.  I hope this helps someone out there.  Don't be afraid to ask your doctor for this drug.  Best of luck!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16822

I've been diagnosed Bipolar and have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember.  I also have a wicked caffeine habit (probably contributes to the sleeplessness) during the work week of at least two liters of Diet Coke per day plus.  I generally wake up throughout the night with a definite wake up at 3am without this stuff.I'm 5'9&quot; 225lb.  This little white pill does a number on me.  I take it about a half hour before I want to sleep and it knocks me out cold.  Some mornings, I'll wake in the same position I went to sleep in the night before.  I feel very refreshed and recharged for the next day.  No groggy side effects like those of Melatonin sold over the counter.That said, here is the warning my Psyche doc gave me: don't take it at 2:00 or 3:00am expecting to wake at 6:00 am and be ready for work.  She says she's had some patients try this and do strange things like wake up and eat a pound of raw bacon or drink a bottle of wine.  When taking, make sure you have 7 - 8 hours of time to sleep for the night.Update 11/9/04 - Been reducing dosage to half a pill (5mg) with the same effects.  Seems there is less sluggishness in the morning with only half a pill.  I've had no side effects however friends on the same medication urged me to get off of it because of their side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/13894

ambien	Insomnia	2004-10-15 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	4.0	Scary side effects, but worth it This is by far the most powerful and effective sleep medication I have ever taken. I have never been unable to fall asleep after taking it, and I have had hardcore chronic insomnia since I was an infant. The drawbacks? Well, this drug makes you trip. I mean vivid hallucenations. And what's even scarier is that you don't even realize you're hallucinating. The first time I took it I scared the heck out of my boyfriend because I started talking to a faerie that was sitting on the side of the bed. I really believed it was there, and it didn't even freak me out at the time. I also didn't remember any of it the next day. I have had many many episodes like this that have been related to me by other people. Scary! The other problem with it is oversleeping. Sometimes the alarm goes off and I hear it, but it's like I don't know what it is or recognize its function. Overall, though... if you have severe insomnia like me, its worth all that hell. The side effects are nothing compared to the natural effects of sleep deprivation.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16212

ambien	Insomnia	2004-10-11 00:00:00		1.0	0.0	5.0	1.0	Worse than LSD It put me to sleep the first few nights, which was nice.  But then I started to not fall asleep and just see things, and the worst part was I BELIEVED what I was seeing - I couldn't just think, &quot;Oh, it's the Ambien.&quot;  Walls moved, my judgement was severly impaired and usually I remembered little the next day - I'd just find evidence of my doing crazy things around the house.  I will never take this medication again.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16147
ambien	Insomnia	2004-10-10 00:00:00		4.0	3.0	5.0	3.5	Ambien works w/combination of other meds I have been on ambien (10 mg.) for several years.  I have always had trouble sleeping, mostly staying asleep.  Chronic pain from spine problems, fibromyalgia, arthritis depression and sleep apnea were continually waking me at least every hour.  Ambien put me to sleep right away but  I still woke every 2 hrs.  I would stop and then restart due to desperation to get sleep.  I tried many different antidepressants over the years but not until recently have I gotten the right combination of drugs to help.  I take pain medication (vicodin), cymbalta for depression, CPAP machine for apnea and ambien.  I am now getting to sleep 3 to 4 hrs. before I wake, but can usually get back to sleep for another few hrs.   I worry about addiction on alot of drugs, but my Dr. says there is a difference in being addicted and being dependent.  I have never taken more than prescribed of ANY medication and when I have to get off, will taper down.  The only bad side effect of ambien I have experienced is the amnesia it produces if I wake and GET OUT OF BED.  I do things, eat things, phone people, send e-mail and who knows what else, that I do not remember doing the next morning.  Now, I have trained myself not to get up if I wake during the night.  I think ambien can work for most people if they are treated for ALL problems with the correct combination of meds/treatments.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16136
ambien	Myofascial pain syndrome	2004-09-25 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	Ambien use with Chronic Myofacial Pain My rheumatologist prescribed Ambien when my Chronic Myofacial Pain began waking me every night and forcing me to take a hydrocodone (hydroco/apap 5/500) in order to return to sleep.  This despite the use of CPAP for Sleep Apnea.  I am a 53 year old male and have been a &quot;late night&quot; person since childhood.  Regardless of the time that I go to bed, sleep comes when my body is ready, usually between 10:30 PM and 12:00 AM, and not before.  This is typically when I get my recreational reading done.  I have dealt with worsening Chronic Myofacial Pain since my second total hip replacement in February of 2002 (I also have what has been described as Atypical Rheumatoid Arthritis).  As a result of my sleep patterns and having to get up about 5:30 AM to get to work on time, I was simply not getting enough sleep and so my CMP got worse.Taking the Ambien at about 9:00 PM together with a Hydrocone tablet allowed me to get to sleep by about 10:00 PM and sleep through the night.  I did not notice any lack of efficacy over the 3.5 months that I followed this regimen.  However, I began having sharp pains behind my eyes towards the end of this period and found my blood pressure skyrocketing (196/105) and discontinued the Ambien at that time.  Lisinopril has my hypertension under control and my rheumatologist has increased my dose of Hydrocodone to allow a tablet during the night.  I have also filed for disability with the Social Security Administration as my condition keeps going downhill.  I should mention that one of my older sisters has suffered with Fibromyalgia for 18 years so there seems to be a familial connection with some of this stuff.  I believe that the Ambien is fine for short term use but caution should be exercised over the long term.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49768

ambien	Insomnia	2004-09-21 00:00:00		4.5	0.5	4.5	3.5	Effective, but side effects intolerable This was the most effective drug I ever took for insomnia. However, there was a huge problem with side effects. It took about 30 to 45 minutes to take effect. During this time, its effect on me was equivalent to having a half a dozen drinks. My judgement was severely impaired, and I would have no recollection of the wild things I'd said or done when I awoke the next day. Because I have two little ones at home, this was not an acceptable side effect, and I had to stop taking it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/15782

It has wonderful effects for a few minute to an hour, then if I don't go to sleep, I get hyper crazy ideas and write pages of wonderful plans and poetry that I trash the next morning. There is nausea, nasal stuffiness and a lingering memory loss that is disturbing, especially with the job I have working in a healthcare facility. I starts out feeling like the best mood in the world the it is the most depressing feeling you can have when you finally get to sleep. I've even got up at 4 am to try and put new speakers in my car stereo. WHAT IS THAT????	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/15238

ambien	Insomnia	2004-09-03 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	4.5	lorries Started using Ambien about a month ago and it works really well for me, affording me 8 hours of sleep per night. My psych prescribed it because the Alprazolam therapy I have been on for 13 years was not really effective any more for sleeping. I would get 4-6 hours of sleep per night and have to be up at 6:30AM for work. I would just drag through the days. After my vacation, he has suggested I try ANOTHER anti-depressant to take care of the anxiety ergo the insomnia. I may or may not try this. There have been a night or two that the Ambien, even in conjunction with .5 Alprazolam, just does not work. Usually, an extremely severe anxiety attack. I may take .25 Alprazolam after a couple of hours and then I will sleep but still have to be up at 6:30 AM. However, I will continue to use it until something better comes along.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/15185

ambien	Insomnia	2004-09-03 00:00:00		3.0	3.0	5.0	3.0	Ambien Review Ambien is one of the better sleeping aids on the market. Unfortunately, it doesn't work after about a month for me because I develop a tolerance for it. I have heard that the pharmaceutical firm that markets Ambien is working on a time-release version for those with sleep maintenance problems. Of course, this would not solve my tolerance problem.Since the Ambien hasn't been working very well without Ambien holidays of up to 30 days on and 30 days off, I decided to just discontinue taking them and see what happened. I had a couple of days of rebound insommnia but that was all. I actually slept much better after I had cleared the Ambien from my body. With this medication, I do think there is a crossover point in time where it no longer helps you. It becomes your cross and actually exacerbates your sleeping condition. I don't intend to ever take it again.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/13286

ambien	Insomnia	2004-08-25 00:00:00		1.5	0.0	3.5	1.5	Weird side effects I only took Ambien for a few nights, because it caused me to have some very bizarre hallucinations.  It seemed to be effective in making me sleep, although it took about 2 hours to kick in, and by that time I had seen the carpet swirling, the Christmas tree spinning, and a bear picture on the wall come to life.  And no, I was not on any other drugs at the time!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14971

ambien	Insomnia	2004-08-22 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	4.5	4.0	The best, but wary of side-effects This drug enabled me to get off of Valium for sleep.  It's fast, effective, and has no morning after-effects.  Have noticed no tolerance.  Sometimes 5 mg. is enough, sometimes 10, but never over, and I've been on it for 10 years.  Caveat:  For the past 2 years I've experienced stomach pain--IBS or simply a somatic syndrome that started late in the afternoons but now sets in during the forenoon.  It's relentless, the same intestinal discomfort spreading to the back and even armpits each and every day.  I've read that intestinal disorders/stomach problems are &quot;common&quot; side-effects with Ambien.  As a result I'm beginning to taper off of this drug.  If I need something for sleep, I plan to stay off of benzodiazapines, which can also be problematic, and go to a tricyclic like amtriptyline or doxepin (Desylrel does nothing for me).  In any case, my problems began after 7 years of using this drug, so I'd have no hesitations going to it for short-term use, as the directions indicate.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14691
ambien	Insomnia	2004-08-15 00:00:00		4.0	3.0	4.5	3.5	Not good for chronic insomnia Ambien works great when used 'as needed'. However long term use requires larger and larger doses to create the same effect. I take ambien usually 1-2 times a week. But find that in the past when used nightly its effectiveness decreases dramatically.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14707
ambien	Insomnia	2004-08-14 00:00:00		4.5	0.5	5.0	3.5	Awful.. but puts you to sleep All I can say is it puts you to sleep.  After a week of use, my tolerance rapidly went from needing 5 mg to sometimes 30 mg.  I felt like I was going crazy during the day, was having massive panic attacks and shakiness... awful w/drawal after just a few weeks of average use.  I threw the rest out and said I'd never touch the stuff again (and I won't.)  I sometimes take Xanax or Valium now, but I won't ever touch that nasty Ambien again.  It was a nightmare and I thought I was going to go insane.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14686
ambien	Insomnia	2004-08-12 00:00:00		3.0	4.5	4.0	3.5	Not very effective if used often I've been taking Ambien for 2-3 years and have found it to be useful when taken sparingly. After a several consecutive days it takes a while to kick in and is good for 6 hours of sleep, seldom more. Another reason to skip days is my insurance will only pay for about 30 pills per 60 days. Amatriptylene helps in combination and is very inexpensive	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14671
ambien	Insomnia	2004-08-12 00:00:00		1.5	0.5	4.5	1.5	Positively Psychedelic... This Rx worked much better than Sonata for me.  However, it didn't always make me tired very quickly, if I was still awake an hour or 2 after taking it, I would start hallucinating or having this bizarre waking dream phenomenon. I would also have no memory the next a.m. of anything that happened after taking the Rx. I didn't like that @ all. Also, as with Sonata, even though I didn't really feel groggy or out of it when waking up like many sleep Rx do. I would feel weird the next day after taking it. Everything seemed foggy and surreal.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14642
ambien	Insomnia	2004-08-05 00:00:00		2.5	0.0	5.0	2.0	Really messed up my life I was given Ambien for about 2 years.  At first it was the wonder drug that had no side effects.  After taking it for more than a year I suddenly started having strange side effects that I could only term sleepwalking.  I had never been told anything about that being a side effect.  I also had amnesia so I don't remember what I did during the sleepwalking times.  I had a serious episode once where I woke up at a hospital in the psych ward.  I had no idea what happened but when I got home I learned of my very strange behavior.  The one big concern for me was that all the pills I had practically (of every medication), I had hidden or done something else with.  I didn't know for sure that time if I had taken more Ambien but I am sure now that I had.  I guess that I half way woke up and became animated and took more Ambien.  After overdosing on it then things got really weird.  I even went to visit a neighbor in my bath robe at about midnight one time.  Well, that scared me and I told the doctor that I didn't want that anymore.  However that didn't get logged into the computer and I needed something to help me sleep a few weeks ago.  The doctor was out of town for a couple weeks and the only way I could get anything was to have the pharmacy request a refill of something I had been prescribed recently.  Well, I thought that if I requested Ambien that they surely would not fill that but maybe they would give me something else.  Well, that didn't work and I did get Ambien.  I figured my previous problems with Ambien was related to using it in combination with my pain medication and I had not had any of that in my system for a few days so, being desperate to sleep, I took one pill and went right to bed.  I woke up about 26 hours later getting into the back of a police car.  I somehow had gotten up, went into another room to where the Ambien was at and taken more.  The first day I went outside to smell the roses while I was naked and the next day	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14527

I have yet to find a &quot;complete solution&quot; but some things have proven to be more effective than others.  Ambien is NOT one of them.  I was up to 5 times the standard &quot;startup dosage&quot; and still had no reaction whatsoever.  I tend to be very resistent to meds, but having no positive effects at this dosage was still quite a surprise to me.  The only real effects I had from Ambien were negative.  It made me dizzy and nauseous, which would have further impaired my ability to sleep even had it provided the drowziness that it did not provide.  I know several people that claim that it has been helpful to them, but Ambien might as well be a placebo for all the benefit it was to me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14321

ambien	Insomnia	2004-07-10 00:00:00		2.5	1.0	4.5	2.0	Excellent for inducing nausea A never did like Ambien, and I've given it many chances because so many other people like it. I had two main problems with it. Firstly, the sleep felt more like a coma. That is, I'd suddenly be out, and then suddenly be awake again, without the feeling that time had passed at all. It certainly didn't feel natural.In addition, it caused a great deal of next-day nausea. I think this is a rare side-effect, but for me it was enough for me to hate the stuff.It's probably best for people who have trouble falling asleep, rather than people who wake up during the night.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/13988

I had the best night of sleep on Ambien &amp; woke up feeling refreshed.I used Ambien (short term) because a medication I was on caused insomnia. While in the hospital, the noise and activity did not bother me at all because the Ambien was so effective. It didn't take long for me to fall to sleep...the kind of warm, fuzzy black sleep where you don't dream. I would agree with the others that its best to bed in bed before taking the medicine.

It definitely has a kick to it and you need to be in bed after taking it...a word to the wise is sufficient. Over a period of time one has to take more to get the same effect.  Not sure what that means for the long term.  Do notice a bit of short term memory loss for a few hours after use.I now usually take 2 to 4(10mg) to get to sleep.I don't recommend this for everyone and it takessome getting used to.  But if you need more it may help to increase the dose.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5779

I once had a nurse tell she went out driving and didn't even remember it. Ambien also only works for about 3 hours at a time for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7895
ambien	Insomnia	2004-06-17 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	5.0	4.5	good medicine I love Ambien, unfortunately I don't get scripts for it anymore though.  I had an addiction to prescription painkillers (legal scripts) and they also removed that during de-tox.  The times I was off of it I did have some minor withdrawal symptoms, mine were usually panic attacks and yes rebound insomnia.  It was a pleasant drift off.  I miss it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/13353
ambien	Insomnia	2004-06-16 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	Excellent insomnia pill! It helps me sleep through the night and doesn't give one a sluggish feeling in the morning.

ambien	Insomnia	2004-06-08 00:00:00		1.5	1.5	4.0	2.0	Doesn't work for long . . . Ambien caused severe memory loss -- I was apparently asking the same question 3 or 4 times and not acknowledging the answers.  I also would have nighttime conversations that I couldn't remember.  Very scary!  All in all, I stuck with this med for several weeks (9-12) and it became less and less effective in helping me to sleep.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/13079

ambien	Insomnia	2004-05-08 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	4.5	nightmares I don't like to use sleeping pills and my doctor ordered this one as having the least side effects which is almost correct.  I find that even on this small dose there are days when I feel the after effects of drowsiness and what I realize - now that I've read some of these other comments - nighmares. Actually I've had just one but I put it down to the Ambien. I'm not in the US at the moment and see that there's a newer sleep-aid - tho it's been in Europe for 10 yrs - and it's Estorra(Sepracor, Imovane, Amobon) On my next visit to the doc I'll ask him for this one.  I find that the smallest dose is the best for me being that i'm elderly. It would be interesting to see the reports on this other med.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12505

It was like I was dreaming but not sleeping..which is totally counter productive to my chronic insomnia.a year later I tried it again and it didnt help at all...i think it is good for occasional insomnia but not for chronic insomnia with panic attacks.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12397

After it wears off you cannot go back to sleep naturally; you feel hyper, not relaxed.  10mg is good for about 5 hours of sleep, maybe less.  I like Benadryl better.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12298
ambien	Insomnia	2004-04-29 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Ambien Ambien at 5mg did not work for me at first, so I took 10mg.  My Neurologist informed me that the usual dosage is 10mg.  However, I did research on the product and discovered that it is not recommended for long-term use, so I cut back to 5mg since I have experienced Sleep Disorders for several years.  This time I found it to be quite effective -- in fact, it is good to be close to the bed after taking it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12289

ambien	Insomnia	2004-04-21 00:00:00		4.5	1.5	5.0	3.5	Good short-term - Harmful Long-term I was given Ambien to help lack of sleep from FMS (BAD INSOMNIA!) after I went off of Elavil because of weigth gain it worked like a dream! My doctor never told me not to take it every night. Each month he refilled it. I loved it. I took it for 2 years. It was probably 6 months before I began experiencing extreme depression and agitation. I would ping pong from depression which totaly incapacitated me to extreme agitation where I damaged my home extremely! I was not fun to live with during this period of time and did alot of damage to my marriage and friendships. At about 2 years of use my doctor swore up and down that he had tried to get me to stop using it...go figure - he had never said anything like it....Toward the end I was down to 5 mgs a night and took my last pill almost 3 years ago and went back on Elavil. Still have some emotional issues and wonder if the Ambien did permanent damage to my neurotrasmitters... Oh well may find out some day!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12081

ambien	Insomnia	2004-04-21 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Ambien and CFS insomnia Ambien is recommended by most physicians to restore Stage IV sleep, which is something that most CFS and Fibromyalgia patients *lose* as a result of the illnesses. My quality of sleep has improved dramatically, as has the overall length of sleep I am able to achieve on a nightly basis. I tried almost every anti-depressant on the market to help me sleep, and not a single one of them worked to relieve any of my symptoms. I now sleep around 10 hours a night, and it's a deep, peaceful sleep. Not physically restorative, but much better sleep than I have had since becoming sick in 1995. I highly recommend it. I have been using Ambien for relief of the insomnia caused by CFS for a couple of years now. It works wonderfully for me, with no noticeable side-effects, and I have yet to develop a tolerance for it requiring more than my original dose.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10379

ambien	Insomnia	2004-04-18 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	5.0	2.0	wow I tried Ambien for insomnia a few years ago. It did give me a couple of nights of sleep, but then I ended up waking up by 3:00am again. One night I took it and did not go directly to bed. In about 15 minutes I was hallucinating (the pictures on the walls all came to life as if I was at Disney Land). It was scary and embarrassing as I was trying to explain to my husband and friends what was going on and the confused look on their faces.My doctor could not explain to me why that had happened. I have not taken it since.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11957
ambien	Insomnia	2004-04-16 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	5.0	4.0	Too much fun to be legal I started taking 1/3 tab of 10mg Ambien about 2 years ago, and over the course of a year upped my dosage to 30mg / night. After taking this pill, everything seemed fluffy like a cloud, as my vision was altered. As I am a chronic insomniac, I became more and more dependent on it, until I found that during the day I had extreme anxiety, and the only thing I wanted to do all day was take the pill. Clearly, I needed to be careful about becoming addicted, but that's not easy when it means one or two sleepless nights. The effect of 10mg on a person not on any meds can be profound; in other words, you can pass out regardless of what you are doing. For this reason, I recommend not getting out of bed after taking it: you may have to crawl back!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11921
ambien	Insomnia	2004-04-15 00:00:00		2.0	0.0	0.5	1.5	Do not take this medicine more than 2 weeks! This is a very powerful addictive drug!!!  When I first began it I thought It was a miracle. 6 months later I began having more anxiety and depression than usual. I just thought it was hormonal. I began to need more and more. 1 year later I was up to 6 a night! The rebound anxiety the next day was horrible. I came close to suicide when my doctor made me go down to 1 a night. The Ambien only worked for 1 half hour. Then I would pace all night and all day. It was a living hell!  Finally my doctor gave me Klonopin instead. I have been on it for 1 year a dosage of 2 a night. I do have dreams now, but that is fine with me. When I first started the Klonopin I had nightmares (still withdrawing from the Ambien) They soon turned into normal dreams with no real feeling attached to it. I sleep a solid 8-10 hours. Sometimes I need an alarm clock and a bit of caffeine to get going in the morning. I'm fine with this.  My new doctor told me that Ambien is not approved by the FDA for more than 2 weeks for a reason. It is very bad for you system !!

ambien	Insomnia	2004-04-07 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Ambien Revisited I had previously given a mixed/negative review of Ambien after having tried it over a year ago.  I am currently using it again, this time in conjunction with Requip to treat PLMD which contributes to insomnia.  I think the reason that the Ambien was ineffective for me previously is that I had other issues which I had not addressed and the Ambien was not able (and is not designed to) overcome all of them.  Now that I am taking treatment for OCD/Depression, the Ambien seems to do its job very effectively, it sedates me within about 30 minutes, and I don't feel any hangover or groggy after effects the next day.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5726
ambien	Insomnia	2004-04-04 00:00:00		4.0	0.0	4.0	2.5	Ambien use over time mimics alcohol black-outs I had no idea until I discontinued it that after taking Ambien for almost eight weeks that it was causing fibro &quot;fog&quot; like symptoms extending progressively from morning until late afternoon.  When I switched back to temazepam, I was more alert the very next morning.  I would read at night waiting for the drug to take effect and I could awaken in the morning, examine the book I had read, and as many as the last 20 pages had not one single event or word that struck any memory in my mind as something I had read before.  Very similar to what I have heard about alcoholics having black-outs and not remembering anything.  The only positive thing I can say about is Ambian was it would definitely, unfailingly put me to sleep.  The risk/benefit equation was weighted way too much to the risk side when I was dragging around in a fog for most of the day.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11561

I was also having mild hallucinations and this morning I feel like$&amp;!@ so I am going to try and avoid taking this for now!

ambien	Insomnia	2004-03-09 00:00:00		3.0	1.0	5.0	3.0	Ambien for FMS sleep problems I have Fibromyalgia which causes me not to get a full nights sleep.  I took Ambien for several months, the first two months it worked fast and I felt rested, although my spouse said, I was still getting up several times a night briefly, I was unaware of my behavior.  Eventually Ambien didn't work at all for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11157
ambien	Insomnia	2004-03-08 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	Use of Ambien OK I guess...BUT...very expensive. I've stopped buying Ambien and have switched to Lorazepam which seems to be doing well.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11140
ambien	Insomnia	2004-03-06 00:00:00		3.5	5.0	5.0	4.0	Effective and side-effect free I've used Ambien for several years (ok, about 8 if you want to know). It doesn't work quite as effectively as it once did, but I still think I've gotten a pretty good run from this med (and some new sleep aids are going to be appearing in 2004 that have similar properties.) Yeah I know you're not supposed to use sleep medications for more than a few days or so - since they may disrupt the natural sleep mechanism.  But with the sleep disruption brought on by my CFS I quickly realized that getting a good night's sleep was essential to any hopes I have of recovery. I break a couple of 5 mg. tablets into thirds and take one or two pieces a half hour before bed. Since Ambien only seems to work for 2-4 hours for me I take a couple more pieces once or sometimes even twice in the middle of the night too. 10 mg. total.  I'm careful to not let this amount creep up over time and my doctor seems to think that it is probably ok to use at this dosage.  Weaning myself of it might be tough, and I sometimes wish I had never had a need to take sleep medications at all, but of the ones I have tried Ambien is far and away the most side-effect free option.At one point I was taking a total of 20 mg. a night and when I mentioned this to my doctor he said a very clever thing. He asked me how quickly I was falling asleep again in the middle of the night after taking another Ambien. &quot;About 15 minutes&quot; I said. He told me that it was unlikely that the medication had been absorbed that quickly (it probably takes closer to 30 minutes to take effect) and that I was really just using the Ambien in the middle of the night more for its placebo effect. When I realized this was true I was able to lower the amount I was taking back to 10 mg. over a period of a few weeks.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3
ambien	Narcolepsy	2004-03-05 00:00:00		4.0	0.0	5.0	3.0	Narcolepsy and Ambien I have narcolepsy.  It's been somewhat of a struggle getting the right dosage down of taking different meds.  It is common for narcoleptics to take a sleeping aid.  I have tried ambien and the first 2-3 nights I got sleepy and actually fell asleep- I did wake up with no side effects- I actually felt good.  Taking ambien after 1 week and increasing the dosage it did not work for me.  Everyone is different - it might work longer for others.  All I know if it would have continued to work - I would still be using it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11084

ambien	Insomnia	2004-03-03 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	4.5	4.0	Side Effect I have found Ambien to be quite effective. However, after having used it for three or four nights in a row and then stopping, I am plagued by vivid nightmares for at least several nights. They are so vivid that they awaken me. After a few nights, the nightmares cease. So, I try to take Ambien no more than several nights in a row at most.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11055
ambien	Insomnia	2004-03-02 00:00:00		4.0	0.0	5.0	3.0	Sleep eating and more crazy behavior When I first started taking Ambien, it was a wonderful drug. I fell alseep fast and woke up refreshed. After about a year on it I started sleep eating. My family now has a lot of awful memories about me waking and acting crazy and spooky. I would wake with no memeory of any of it. That was very bothersome to me and it only got worse. The same thing happened with Halcion. If used for short term, I would recomend but long term...no way. It is way too dangerous especially if you live alone and have nobody to watch you during your crazy escapades during the nights.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11027
ambien	Insomnia	2004-02-29 00:00:00		3.5	4.0	4.5	3.5	Ambien helps I take Ambien on average once  a week. It only sems to give me about six hours of straight sleep. My problem has been early morning awakening. While it doesn't completely solve this problem, it does leave me with a lot more energy the next day than when I take nothing or when I have taken Restoril. Sometimes 10 mg. is not enough, when I am particulalrly anxious. So I take two, i.e. 20 mg. This usually but not always works. For example, before a recent plane trip I still couldn' t sleep well, but in spite of that, I was not exhausted the next day and not hung-over.So, Ambien helps and I beleieve is  better and has less day after side-effects than Restoril or other benzodiazapines.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10998
ambien	Insomnia	2004-02-29 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	A caution for those prone to oversedation I was prescribed Ambien when I was having serious sleep problems, and it knocked me right out.  Unfortunately, I'm also sensitive to drugs that can cause oversedation, and Ambien had me so hungover the next morning that I slept through breakfast and nearly missed lunch.  I wanted to wake up and go to breakfast and participate in the activities for the day, but I couldn't because I was still trying to pry my eyes open without much success.On later nights, I tried the 5 mg. version, but even this left me groggy in the morning and fighting to become mentally alert.  It just wasn't the right med for me because of my inherited over-sedation problem.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10997

Nothing worked, or left me with a terrible drunken feeling.  The night I used Ambien for the first time, I was out within 3 minutes.  I kid you not.  There is NO groggy feeling the next morning, and NO side effects whatsoever. I would not use Ambien longer than 7 days, unless you plan to be on it long term.

ambien	Insomnia	2004-02-24 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	4.0	Ambien, 5-10mg Ambien makes you sleepy, and you must lay down in bed and take it and turn out the light. Do not drive, or drink or leave the house when you are on it, because it makes you very drugged and you will get hurt or in an accident. otherwise it works great for sleep, dont take it during the day either. and dont take it everyday, only when needed or you will build a dependency. One of the side effects is memory loss, and foggy thinking , so dont be suprised if you feel stupid the day after taking it. That goes away as soon as you stop the medication. I use it on occasion if I cant get to sleep.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10785
ambien	Insomnia	2004-02-20 00:00:00		4.5	1.5	4.0	3.5	Ambien-use with caution This is all my experience: compared to almost any herb or supplement I've tried, Ambien is far more powerful. 20 minutes, BAM, you're asleep. HOWEVER: 1-it only lasts for 4 hours and then you have to take it again to get 8 hours sleep. 2-Ambien, to me, is like crack to a crack-head--it rapidly becomes addictive (mental first, then physical) as its effectiveness diminishes with constant use. 3-side effects include slight memory loss, grogginess. Conclusion: great for emergencies but I personally try never to take it 2 nights in a row or more than once a week.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10627

ambien	Insomnia	2004-02-10 00:00:00		3.0	0.0	3.5	2.0	Ambien Blackouts After using Ambien for about a year, I started experiencing &quot;blackouts,&quot; i.e., I would get up during the middle of the night and perform tasks in my house without having any recollection of doing so when I awoke the next morning, although I would find evidence of my nightime ventures throughout the house.  I also left my house and drove in my car on at least one occasion in one of these &quot;blackouts&quot; - the only reason I knew this happened was because my car was in my driveway and not in my garage the next morning.  Very unsettling, to say the least.  I still take Ambien, but I take it for 7 days then I don't take it for a month so it won't build up in my system and cause &quot;blackouts&quot; like it did before.  I've never experienced this effect with any of the Benzodiazepines (Restoril, etc), so I alternate with these sleep meds when I'm not using Ambien.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10361

I found that I only got an hour or so of sleep and still had a horrible time getting up in the morning. I found that it still took me at least an hour and a half to fall asleep after taking it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10246

ambien	Insomnia	2004-01-03 00:00:00		5.0	0.0	5.0	3.5	AMBIEN-esia: MEMORY LOSS I believe that doctors and the pamphlet that accomapanies this drug UNDERPLAY THE MEMORY LOSS component of Ambien.  I definitely had an overdose, and with little memory of the crazy things I did while &quot;under the influence,&quot; I was horrified to hear from my now-ex-boyfriend that he came home to find me passed out on the couch with the smoke detectors wailing, a pot of &quot;stew&quot; on the stove (essentially, every thing I could find in the freezer placed in a stew pot and set to BOIL!), pasta sauce all over the key board of the computer, photos of his ex wife torn up and placed under his bed (I must have been doing voodoo!), and worse.  It was so humiliating not to recollect having done these things.  Worse yet, I apparently drove my car to the store during the overdose episode: three days later I found the grocery trip's purchases IN THE TRUNK! Be sure you have an accountability person dispense this medicine to you and STAY IN BED is the cautionary phrase when using Ambien. BE CAREFUL, please.  I no longer take it. I take Melatonin, work out and sometimes take a few Benadryl.  That's it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9851
ambien	Insomnia	2003-12-29 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	5.0	1.0	I'm Wide Awake! I took my 10mg pill as prescribed, probably half an hour ago.  As you can see, I've gotten out of bed to look up the side effects of Ambien.  This has happened to me a majority of the times I've taken Ambien, while the rest are nights I would've fallen asleep naturally.  First of all, I'm more energetic now than I was before I took my pill, and most of the objects in my room are &quot;breathing&quot; and lights have a revolving-color fiber-optic-glow effect.  Sometimes things &quot;melt&quot; out of the corner of my eye, too, and sometimes I hear music coming from my fan.  Let me just say that I honestly wanted something to help me sleep at night because I've always been nocturnal, but that makes a career kind of impossible.  Unfortunately, instead of sleep, I usually start tripping and decide to do artwork or dance around my room!  After a couple of hours I eventually decide to go to bed.  When I wake up in the morning, I'm a little foggy about the details of my night.  Well, I'm going to go paint, I think.  Let's see if I remember this in the morning!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9806

ambien	Insomnia	2003-12-13 00:00:00		5.0	2.0	5.0	4.0	Ambien Sleep Aid I took Ambien 10 mg for several weeks.  I thought it was a God-send until I awoke one Sunday morning with an empty bottle of pills (a full 30 day supply), beside my bed.  I do not store my meds in the bedroom.  Without any memory at all, I had awakened Friday Night or Saturday night conscious enough to know where the pills were stored but not conscious enough to know not to take them.  I could have died of an overdose because I have no memory of anything except putting the pills in the cabinet and taking 1 to bed.  Because of the fast-acting nature of the drug, I sit on the side of the bed to take it just to make sure I'm safe.  If you are taking Ambien, be aware that the warning about &quot;temporary memory loss&quot; is very real. I've had conversations with people on the phone while &quot;sleeping off&quot; this drug.  If you must use this drug (it is an excellent sleep aid), it is best to have an accountability partner who stores the med and dispenses it to you on a nightly basis, reducing the risk of accidental overdose.The great news is when you take it as prescribed, you get good sleep and do not wake up with a hang-over.  It takes quite a while to develop tolerance to the drug so it's a good choice for avoiding intentional overdoses.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9630

However, whenever I took it, the next day, around 4pm, i would get extremely tired and then often not sleep the subsequent night.I am now taking 2.5mg daily of lexapro.  I wish somebody would have recommended this to me earlier.  It is a miracle sleep cure.  I have been suffering from insomnia for 20 years.  The last 3 months have been absolutely problem free with lexapro.  I haven't had to resort to ambien in months.ambien worked as a temporary solution, but for anybody with a longterm problem, ask your doctor about lexapro.  I highly highly recommend it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9322

ambien	Insomnia	2003-10-15 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	5.0	1.0	Ineffective for me My case was a case of insomnia and treated with first Ambien and then Restoril (both ineffective within a few days), Ativan, Xanax and 4 different antidepressants (Zoloft, Imipramine, Lexapro, Remeron) in as many months. I believe dose tolerance and serious anxiety developed due to the symptomatic tolerance withdrawal (SEE Ashton Manual on www.benzo.org.uk or www.benzoliberty.com).My anxiety began to increase between dosages. I developed random muscle spasms that left me achy and unable to sleep even on powerful sleeping pills.I am suffering bad random muscle spasms due to this poison stew.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/8902
ambien	Insomnia	2003-10-13 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	3.5	Ambien Ambien is wonderful for sleep BUT...Not without side effects. I started this medication several years ago and used EXACTLY as prescribed.  It is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE and the web sites will tell you so. I have had Chronic Severe Insomnia for years (before FM).  My dr. kept prescribing it to me and knew I was having to take it every night. Within the last 6 months I have had to up my dosage to 20 sometimes 25 mg a NIGHT just to get 2 maybe 3 hours of sleep. After 2 years of taking this nightly and telling my doc that I was having to take 20mg a night he decided to cut me off COLD TURKEY.  You CAN'T do that without serious side effects. After my 4th consecutive night of NO SLEEP, NONE...I finally got some more. I simply cannot  sleep without them.  They make my already Fibro Fog worse because of the short term memory loss you get with this drug.  Like the other person mentioned which is TRUE and I will tell anyone...it DOES make you do things you CANNOT remember.  I sleep walk and have NO memory of it or the things I've done in my sleep walk episodes.  I also have binges of going into the kitchen and making things to eat, bringing things back to bed with me to eat, wake up with plates on my stomach, dishes on the bedstand, etc...As hard as I try I cannot remember EVER DOING ANY OF THOSE THINGS!  That is SCARY AS HELL to not remember any of those things.To the fellow who's girlfriend did not believe him, I'm sorry because I can TOTALLY relate to doing the sleepwalking stuff.I don't recommend anyone to start taking this unless you KNOW that you will only need then occasionally - no more than once a week.  Find other natural rememdies if you can.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/8859
ambien	Insomnia	2003-10-12 00:00:00		5.0	1.5	5.0	4.0	Black Outs Although I sleep really well on this medication, I started having &quot;black outs&quot; periods of time where I would do things completely out of character and couldn't remember it the next day.  I called my girlfriend several times and said things to her I would never say and didn't even remember calling her.  A lot of nights I would sleep walk on this medication and binge eat too.  I raided the kitchen in a black out many times and my parents would ask me what the dishes I left out were from and I couldn't remember what I had done.  I apparently switched ego states on the phone with my girlfriend and was talking to someone in my room who wasn't there.  She said I was talking to her in a completly different voice and everything.  This drug is a little scary.  E-mail me at emtstaff@yahoo.com if you have had similar experiences.  My pdoc put me on seroquel for sleep now but not before I lost my girlfriend, and she doesn't believe it was the Ambien.Gary	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/8836

SO back to ambien I went.  i think now that it may possibly be interacting with my new medicines Effexor and Nuerotin.  I am going to try to take them in the morning.  Well with the Nuerotin it is 3 times a day.  Then at night try not to eat too much before I take the Ambien.  I have horrible insomnia.  I got less than 2 hours of sleep yesterday and I am up at 5 am again.

ambien	Insomnia	2003-09-11 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	Finally - a sleep medication that works! I've tried everything for my chronic insomnia, and nothing had worked until Ambien. Since it only stays in the system for about 6 hours, I don't wake up with that &quot;sleeping pill hangover&quot; that other meds have caused in the past. You do have to be careful with this drug, as it can become habit forming, but so far, I haven't had that problem (I've been taking it on and off for about a year, and only on an as-needed basis). With Ambien, I can actually fall asleep pretty quickly, with no tossing and turning, and I sleep through the whole night.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/8211
ambien	Insomnia	2003-09-08 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	2.5	4.0	Not what I expected this is definitely not what I expected.Because of anxiety and suffering at times of extreme vertigo I did not want something to kick in and then feel like I'm falling hard (that's the worst sensation, sheer terror).--So I broke the 10 mg tab up in 4 pieces.  At first I took a sliver of the first piece.  Nothing.I kept taking More and more until I finished 1/2 a tab.--I felt very calm and didn't care much of anythingworks great for anxiety, but I wasn't sleepy!I got up the urinate and felt a little uneasy.Laid down again and stared at the clock it was now 1:30 an hour after the first tab.  Nothing but some general relaxation and double vision.  No hallucinations or anything like that.  Just the sort of double vision you would get normally if you are exhausted, but I wasn't.---So I took another half 2:00 sat up in my bed and had no thoughts.  This stuff really just clears your head.  The chatter in my head just turned to babble.  Its like I cant speak anymore...,I tried to recite the alphabet out loud and it came out clear as a bell.  So this stuff is not like alcohol at all.  I feels more like cannabis without the nerves.  I musts blacked out after that cause I don't remember falling asleep.--	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/8139

ambien	Insomnia	2003-08-23 00:00:00		5.0	1.5	4.0	4.0	Sleep finally, after years of insomnia I've had insomnia all of my life. Can't get to sleep, can't stay asleep and constant vivd dreams that keep me from reaching deep restful sleep. Now ambien gets me to sleep and nortriptylene keeps me asleep through the night. I have to take the combination or it doesn't work. I've been on ambien for a year and can't get to sleep without it. All of the doctors I've seen promote the value of actually getting to sleep as opposed to going off of ambien. It's not addictive in itself, just wanting it to sleep makes it feel like you're addicted, although not in a bad way. Just psychological instead of physiological. I wouldn't trade it for anything. Although you have to watch out for the side effects. GET IN BED BEFORE TAKING! You can black out on the drug and go about your normal routine without any recollection. For me, I was too honest if I had a conversation with anyone after taking. So it is kind of like taking away your inhibitions as alcohol does, but times 10. I guess it would be similar to sleep walking in the end. I turn off my phone and my computer so I don't send out any e-mails or call anyone. It has been a truth serum. Funny to me, but not always good results.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7839
ambien	Insomnia	2003-08-22 00:00:00		1.0	4.0	5.0	2.5	ambien I found this a very ineffective sleep aid.  It is usually prescribed for elderly people because it is so mild.

ambien	Insomnia	2003-08-19 00:00:00		2.0	4.0	3.0	2.5	Zolpidem usage long term I have been using zolpidem for some years now almost constantly. For me it is very addictive and my doctor has stopped prescribing this class of sleeping tablet for me altogether. My problem is the poor quality of sleep Im getting. I wake up most mornings feeling awful, with lots of lower back pain. Since I wake feeling awful and know if I don't go back to sleep (with a sleeping tablet) my day will be a complete right off! Anyhow my consumption increased greatly, for instance I had taken a months supply 28x10mg in just five days! I am now determined not to take this medication again! I now use zopiclone which I have also been using sporadically for some time. I feel it gives a greater quality of sleep, the only problem with zopiclone is that it leaves a bad taste in your mouth which is awful.I now source my medication through a UK based internet pharmacy for about 6.00 pounds per 28 x 7.5mg. In conclusion be careful when starting zolpidem, you may just get a little used to them.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7702

ambien	Insomnia	2003-08-12 00:00:00		5.0	2.0	5.0	4.0	Strange Actions I have been using Ambien for several months and have been extremely pleased with the results. My husband was out of town last night and I'm now a little concerned because my son asked me this evening whether or not I remembered coming down stairs last night after I had gone to bed.  I said I vaguely remembered him helping me on the computer. I apparently got up after going to bed and came downstairs and got on the computer.  I was searching for a website.  Once I found the website I tried to email the director, but was having problems.  I asked him to come in and help me.  He finally told me he thought I needed to go to bed and finish it in the morning.  He then copied it and pasted it to notepad and saved it on my desktop.  When I read it I was shocked.  It was partly legible, but part of it was a jumbled mess.  We had hosted exchange students in the past and I was apparently trying to write to the director of the program at one point and say hello.  Then I had gotten into the part of the website where the students are suppose give a profile of themselves.  I was trying to write a profile on my family and say what a great homestay we were for eight years.  I am now a little concerned about taking the medication when I am alone.  I had recently told my husband that he needed to make sure I was out of the house if it should ever catch fire because I felt that the medication really knocked me out at night.  I had not slept for more that three hours at a time for more than ten years.  I felt like Ambien had saved my life in that respect.  I sleep through the night and I feel great the next morning.

I don't think that it is addictive, I can take it or leave it but if I need a good night's sleep, I'd take it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7564
ambien	Insomnia	2003-08-10 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.0	4.5	go right to bed i have to say i don't fall asleep easily and this pill truly takes care of it. As time went on sometimes i would not go to bed right away and then i can stumble, call people, answer questions to the television.  I have tried a lot of things in my life and never once had hallucinations - this pill can take you there so sure you go right to bed.  The next morning i have to say i feel damn wonderful, even if i sleep walk and found my coffee can in the oven and dish washing soap on the table i think i drank.  Be careful.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7515

ambien	Insomnia	2003-08-06 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Good Mornings! I am one of those people who had trouble falling asleep and then once asleep would wake up several times each night.  It has been years since I've had a full night of sound sleep.  My doctor prescribed Ambien for short-term use.  It has been very effective.  I fall asleep within 10-15 mins after taking a tablet and I sleep soundly for at least 6 hours, many nights I sleep 7 or 8 hours straight through.  (I find that if I sleep less than 7 or 8 hours, I tend to get sleepy feeling a few hours after I get up.) I am feeling much better and am waking up to a  GOOD morning.  My doctor says this is not recommended for long-term use. He has also prescribed another medication for long-term use for me (SSRI).  Once the other med kicks in, I should be able to come off the Ambien, but it has been a wonderful sleep-aid for short term use.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7463
ambien	Insomnia	2003-08-04 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	Great for hardcore insomnia Great for hardcore insomnia.  This is one of the only meds which I've used for insomnia which actually works quickly and reliably.  The only problem is that with frequent usage, higher dosages are required to get the same effect.  I started on 5mg and it worked great.  Then, I had to go to 10mg to get the same effect.  I've been taking it for 3-4 years now.  Unfortunately, now the 10mg dose is starting to not work, guaranteed, every time.  The problem with this is that most docs don't want to prescribe more than 10mg at a time and of course it is extremely expensive.  This is the only med I can take if I wake up early in the morning to knock me out for another 2-4 hours without any hangover effects.  I would heartily recommend this med to anyone who desperately needs a med which will work for hardcore insomnia.  Even though it costs a lot, if you absolutely can't sleep, it's still worth it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7423

ambien	Insomnia	2003-08-03 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	4.5	4.0	AMBIEN IS GREAT -- if used properly Most important - after taking the Ambien GET RIGHT INTO BED. Often it will start working very soon after you take it.  If you are not in bed by then you may stumble drunkenly getting back to the bedroom..Do not start taking Ambien with too strong a dose. For the first few days start on 5 mg, especially senior citizens like me (I'm 83)If it works, stay at this level. If not then try the 10 mg. tablet. (Most side effects occur with 10 mg. and stronger).On the positive side -- Ambien works great!!No waiting to find out when you are going to fall asleep.  Six to seven hours of good sleep.  No drowsiness upon awakening. I've used Ambien for 3 years taking 5 mg. mostly, sometimes 10. I've had some side effects but they were not too serious. The good effects more than balance the bad ones.  Of course it may not work the same for everyone but it's worth trying.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7405

ambien	Insomnia	2003-07-22 00:00:00		3.0	5.0	5.0	3.5	Ambien after about a year In order to attempt increased effectiveness with my 10mg @ bedtime dose of Ambien, I went about 3 weeks without taking any.  Took one at bedtime last night, approximately midnight...It is now 1:30 pm the next day and I have NOT SLEPT YET.  For me, this med has lost the majority of it's effectiveness.  However, I also take 5 other rather strong meds that SHOULD knock me out by themselves, for chronic/intractable pain, depression, anxiety, and PTSD.  Meds include MS-Contin and MSIR, Xanax, Zyprexa, Zoloft, Wellbutrin.  So, to make a long story short, I think that most likely the Ambien would work if I  weren't already taking all these meds for a long time, and none of them except Ambien are optional.  It was quite effective the first month I used it.  Since then, the results have been on and off.However, someone close to me also used Ambien for a short period of time, and it put HER to sleep quite well.  I am a 6 foot 2&quot;, 272lb man, so perhaps they could give me a bit higher dose?  I was told that 10mg was the maximum, but from what I've seen here that is not accurate.Question for anyone who reads this and takes more than 10mg at a time:  How much do you take, are you on other meds, and do you know if splitting the pills is safe?  Respond to swsmiddy@hotmail.com    Thanks and I hope this review is helpful.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7232
ambien	Insomnia	2003-07-22 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	4.5	Works for a time Very relaxing. Regular Benzos dont put me to sleep this did--for the 1st 6 months. I require long term sleep aid use due to neurological problems. Too bad it kicked out after that time. Now all it does is make me a little relaxed and 'assist' me to fall asleep. It is short lived effect however.Still for periodic Insomnia, I dont think anything competes. It supposedly doesn't effect sleep cycles like Restoril and Ativan and the benzos do. So this is an added plus.I like it a lot just wish it still worked for me	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7225

The first day couple of days I took it I was really spacey in the morning but it went away.  I am not going to take it anymore though, because a few times I forgot things I did or said in the morning...amnesia?

I've always had difficulty falling asleep, and now I fall asleep so fast, I don't even remember closing my eyes. I feel rested in the morning, without a &quot;hangover.&quot; If I wake during the night, I fall right back to sleep.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5659
ambien	Insomnia	2003-06-30 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	Ambien When I first came down with CFS l0 years ago, I took Doxepin to sleep.  It caused a lot of weight gain but I did sleep at night.  After a year or so I got off of it because I was also drugged and sluggish/fatigued/tired during the day that I couldn't tell what was CFS and what was the Doxepin.The doctor then put me on Effexor and Ambien.  It made a big difference.  The Ambien puts you to sleep quickly, so you need to be ready for bed; I can wake up during the night for my child if I need to and am able to function, then can go back to sleep.  There is NO drug hangover the next day.It has been effective at the 5 mg. dose for almost 9 years, but this last year I've had to go up to l0 mgs., plus 2 mg. melatonin.  That's a pretty incredible record for a sleeping pill.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6876

The first week it was amazing, although I didn't feel that I was getting restful sleep - it seemed more like the sleep you get after drinking a lot of alcohol, but without the constant waking up in the middle of the night.  I also have severe memory loss.  Things these past three weeks seem more like dreams than anything else.I would not suggest this medication unless you're going to take it for less than a week.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6848

ambien	Insomnia	2003-06-23 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	Good for a while I have fibromyalgia and suffer from insomnia as a result.  I took ambien for a bit more than three years.  The first week or so I was totally loopy after taking it, laughing hysterically as I stumbled around trying to find my way to bed.  I totally freaked everyone in my household out.  After a short time (less than a week) those effects wore off.  It gave me a full night's sleep but I don't feel it was good sleep because I had vivid dreams all night long (which apparently indicates mostly REM sleep) and I didn't usually feel rested.  I can gage a good night's sleep based on how much pain I have the next day.  The better the night's sleep, the less pain I'd have.  It put me out for a good 8 hours or more, but it didn't seem to me like restful sleep.  Over time its effectiveness wore off.  I would take breaks as frequently as I could tolerate, sometimes for 2 weeks at a time (which was nearly intolerable for me) but even after the breaks it didn't seem anymore effective than before the break.  I have now been off of Ambien for about a week because it got to the point where it wasn't working at all anymore for me.  I have yet to find something that works well for me, I have tried resterol but it doesn't seem to work very well for me at all.  It did work one night out of about four and the sleep I got was brief (about 4-5 hours) but it seemed more restful than the sleep I got on Ambien.  I'm hoping that I can try something for a bit and then try ambien again.  Maybe after a long term break from Ambien some of the effectiveness will come back - I hope so because even though my sleep wasn't completely restful, it's better than no sleep at all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6698
ambien	Insomnia	2003-06-21 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	4.0	3.5	works great! but use it as a last resort use 1/2 a pill, if can't get sleep by 2AM, immediately puts me to sleep in 20mins.

I have not tried remeron, but certainly, it might be the magic pill, based on user surveys.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6662
ambien	Insomnia	2003-06-19 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	My approach works for me: I have been using Ambien &quot;on and off&quot; for the last 8 years.  It is very helpful when I need it, but I take varying dosages depending upon how much difficulty I think I will have falling asleep.  I have also been taking Antidepressants (more for OCD) and one side effect of this type of medication is that it tends to wire me, making falling asleep much more difficult which clearly isn't helpful in the overall picture.  So, I often use Ambien (or Lorazapam as an occasional alternative, but I prefer to keep that for anxiety during the day).  Ambien is for sleep &quot;only&quot;.   I never take it until I am ready to go to bed or have already tried going to sleep but have given up, or I awake during the night unable to go back to sleep. In all of these cases, it usually works well, getting me over that edge into sleep. But at the doses I take, it usually does not &quot;keep&quot; me asleep all night; however, I usually get up once or twice a night anyway to go to the restroom and can usually go back to sleep once I've already been there.  If not, I'll take another piece of Ambien (or lorazpam .5mg if its really getting late in the morning).  The doses I take of Ambien usually run between 3-5mg at a time.  Fortunately the elongated 10mg tablets are easy to break into smaller pieces if you have even halfway decent fingernails, making smaller doses easy.  Often that is all that I need, but if the first doesn't work fairly quickly or I feel especially wide awake, I'll increase the amount.  Rarely do I ever actually take the entire 10mg tablet at one time.  If breaking it up works for you, it can also help with the cost of your medication because it will last longer.  Also, if you take a smaller dosage in the middle of the night, when you have fewer hours left to sleep, the likehood of feeling drowsy the next morning/day is lessened. Personally I have never had any serious problem taking Ambien other than getting the precription written.  It really does	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6413
ambien	Insomnia	2003-06-17 00:00:00		2.0	0.5	5.0	1.5	Be Careful With Ambien I've had intermittent insomnia all my life.  Last year, after I left a longtime job and had more than usual problems sleeping, I tried Ambien for the first time.  It worked ... very well ... for a short time.  I found that my tolerance of the drug developed rapidly; after a week or two it was not effective unless I took 15 or 20 mg.  At that point, some troublesome side effects begin to occur.  Rather than sleep, I would wander to the kitchen, in a hallucinogenic, half-aware state, and begin to binge.  I would also hear -- and talk back to -- voices.  The general effect reminded me of long-ago days when I smoked the occasional joint.  I can't tell you how sheepish I felt when the &quot;morning after&quot; my wife would ask why there were two empty half-gallon containers of ice cream in the sink.  (Normally an endomorph, I gained about twenty pounds on Ambien.)  Of course, at this point the drug was ineffective in promoting good sleep, but I continued taking it for some months.  Its effect on the unemployment blues that I had wasn't so hot, either.  On a final humorous note, I got an e-mail just the other day (actually, it was sent in the middle of the night) from an old friend that I hadn't corresponded with in years ... I'd bet my bottom dollar it was written on Ambien.  I just knew.These days I take Trazodone for the occasional sleepless night, and though it's not as sedating as Ambien, it works well enough for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/771
ambien	Insomnia	2003-06-15 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	knocks me out! I have suffered with sleep problems for many years. I was a tylenol PM addict.  My Dr. gave me trazadone which would help me stay asleep most nights.  I now have difficulties with anxiety and sleep is impossible.  I have been taking ambien for about a month.  It works well, but I have to be careful not to try to stay up too long after I have taken it.  I will be alittle dizzy and feel weird.  The other night, a half pint of ice cream was eaten by either my husband or I in the night.  He said it wasn't him and I have no memory of doing it.  Scary to think I was out of it that far. I went to bed and the ice cream was gone in the am ????	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6566
ambien	Insomnia	2003-06-15 00:00:00		1.5	0.0	5.0	1.5	Unnerved I am writing because of my husband. My husband has always had bouts of insomnia, he has never been a good sleeper. April 29, 2003 he had surgery. Since then, his sleeping has been the worst ever. After trying everything else the sleep disorder clinic recommended (he has sleep apnea, too), his doctor prescribed Ambien on May 29. The first few nights he began taking it, it had little effect on his sleeping except to make him feel groggy, agitated and even have nightmares. He was still getting up in the night and stumbling around. I have been up and down with him since 2am this morning. This has been the worse night since he began. It is worse than sleep walking. He appears to be sleeping for 15-45 minutes. Then he becomes agitated and tries to get up. With my help he gets up, shuffles, can't seem to pick up his feet to walk, mumbles and talks about strange things that make no sense. I am missing work because I am afraid to leave him alone. I'm afraid somehow he will stumble his way to the basement steps (no lock on the door) and I would find him at the bottom. After reading this site, I am determined he will not take anymore of these pills. The cure seems worse than the lack of sleep. Hope this helps someone else.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6551
ambien	Insomnia	2003-06-10 00:00:00		4.0	2.5	5.0	3.5	nightmares I was prescribed Ambien due to a post-operative side effect from meds used during surgery which left me &quot;wired&quot;.  It was very effective with a lack of &quot;hang-over&quot; side effects.  I have taken it for three nights.  The first two nights I had very strange vivid dreams, which was OK due to my extreme need for sleep.  Last night I had the most horrible nightmare of my life, which prompted me to register on this site, quit taking this med, and to caution people about this side effect.  I hope this is rare because it did allow me several hours of uninterupted sleep, but it's not worth it to me now.  My nightmare was so horrible that right now I don't ever want to sleep again.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6481

I have spent time cleaning house or talking on the phone and won't remember a thing the next morning after taking the medicine and not going to bed.

Before Ambien, I would wake several times a night and toss and turn. Now most of the times, I wake up in the same position I fall asleep in (we all know when you do that you're getting good sleep). I cannot say enough good things about how I feel in the morning either. I am, for the most part not a morning person and a bear to deal with, but after my first night on Ambien, I woke up in a fantastic mood, well rested and talkative. My girlfriend thought I was somebody else. The memory loss that everyone describes is the only thing I have found to be true out of all the listed side effects. I can't remember falling asleep or when I fell asleep but, WHO CARES!!! I'm sleeping the best I ever have in 34 yrs..

I also like not having that groggy hangover feeling the next day that some give you. Beware when you first take this drug it can make things move that aren't moving. It is fast acting for those who are just starting the drug, it now takes about 2 hours for it to make me go to sleep. Over all I think this is a very good drug for helping those who can't sleep finally get a full nights rest.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6116

If you need to go on sleep medicine, go on ambien.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6041
ambien	Insomnia	2003-05-04 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Wonderful :) It works very well for me. No grogginess at all in the morning, and I wake up feeling very rested. I do think people need to remember that this is a drug that needs to be followed to the letter -- as in, taken as directed. I don't understand the bad reviews from people who say something like the following: &quot;well, I was doing dishes and having a conversation with my husband a half hour after I took it and I don't remember it! This is dangerous!&quot; or, &quot;I was watching TV a little while after I took it and the TV started growing hair&quot;... hello!! Ambien's directions SPECIFICALLY state to take it and get RIGHT INTO BED. There's a reason for these instructions. Ambien is a *hypnotic-sedative* medication. People, if you can't or don't want to follow the instructions, you shouldn't be taking it. It's very simple. You take the pill, get right into bed, and turn out the light. Make sure you're given yourself enough time for 7-8 hours of sleep. Just these two things alone would avoid quite a few of the problems written about here... although as with any drug, there are going to be people that it just doesn't work for or who have bad reactions. I think it's definitely worth trying.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6001
ambien	Insomnia	2003-05-03 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	4.0	Beneficial, yet use with caution Like the commercials for it say, Ambien DOES indeed work like a dream, only that dream can turn into a nightmare if you aren't careful. While highly effective when it comes to falling asleep, it is the moments before hopping into bed, right after taking the drug, that are dangerous. For some odd reason, Ambien has an incredible tendency to effect me in mind-altering ways, such as creating a sense of mania in me, or causing me to become severely depressed, and so if I am not laying in bed with my eyes closed, funny things happen to me. My brother is a major drug addict and one time I was talking to him about ten minutes after popping the pill and he asked me what I was on and if he could have some because I seemed so &quot;talkative&quot; and &quot;high,&quot; so that shows me that it changes my way of thinking and the way I present myself in front of others, which reminds me that I need to be careful while taking this drug. Ambien can also create a sense of spontaneity in you...for example, I once randomly decided to clean the house and cook elaborate gourmet meals in the middle of the night because it just seemed like the right thing to do. So as you can see, Ambien has the potential to create strong side effects in a person and must be used with extreme caution. Another thing to consider when taking it is that it's highly addicting and you can easily become dependent, so I have found that it's best if possible, to take a few nights off from Ambien here and there so you don't develop a tolerance for it. All in all, I'd say this drug is very useful in treating short-term insomnia and/or stopping those middle of the wakings, and I'd very much recommend it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5969

ambien	Insomnia	2003-04-30 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	Ambien I started out with 5mg and it worked out wonderful for about a month, then I had to up it to 10mg at bedtime.  That worked great for about another couple of months, but now, I feel that I need 15mg.  I think Ambien is a great drug for insomina, but not for long term.  The effectiveness of long term use wears out.  That is a bummer, since it's the only way I can get to sleep at night.Mermaid	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5904
ambien	Insomnia	2003-04-29 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	Perfect for me I have chronic insomnia resulting from head trauma, and even though Ambien is prescribed (predominantely) for short-term use, I hope to continue indefinitely. It has been the only drug I've tried that works.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5897
ambien	Insomnia	2003-04-25 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	4.0	Ambien My doc started me on this drug for chronic pain issues.It was intended for long term use.  I started on 5mg.  After 2 weeks my blood pressure rose 30/15 pts.  I was very depressed and felt as though I was in a drug induced stupor.  It took 3 days after quiting before I was myself again.  I looked back on those 3 wks. and wondered what in the world I was thinking!  My doc then wanted me to try 2.5 mg.  After getting my blood pressure back down I tried again. After another 2 wks. my blood pressure was fine, but depression set in again.  The depression wasn't as bad, about 50% of before.  While I didn't feel like I was in a stupor again, I definately was having trouble with cognition. I am now trying 2.5 mg every other night.  It's been 2wks. again, I am having trouble with depression but cognition seems to be doing well.  I sleep very well with a 2.5 mg. dose!  It really works beautifully for sleep.  I did have significant 'hangover' at 5mg.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5839
ambien	Insomnia	2003-04-25 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	4.5	4.0	It works for me... I've taken Ambien on and off for the last 4 or 5 years.  It almost always gets me to sleep at 5 mg., and if I take 10 mg. I'm guaranteed to get to sleep, and to sleep better through the night.  My only complaint is that at times I've had the impression that I tend to be a little more anxious than usual the day after using it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5835

When I started taking it I would take 5mg right before bedtime.  Now all I really need is to take a 1/4 of a 5mg tablet most nights.  One thing I've noticed is you need to have an empty stomach for it to take quick action.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5667

ambien	Insomnia	2003-04-18 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	Works great! minor side effects tho I only took this drug once, and I slept like a log! I didn't feel groggy or strange the next day either. I did feel odd when the drug started to take effect though. I took it, and as I was brushing my teeth I felt it &quot;kick in&quot; fairly fast.( in less than 10 minutes!)I then decided to get to bed quickly, as I was feeling dizzy. As I lay there, I noticed a feeling of some anxiety and mild apprehension, (which I thought strange, considering it was supposed to relax me and put me to sleep!) then I felt a hot feeling in my face, sort of a flushing sensation. This only lasted about a minute or so. Next thing I remember was waking up feeling well rested and energetic. I did not, however, like the side effects before I actually fell asleep. Other than that, I think it works like a charm for what it is intended, which is put one to sleep...FAST! It's a shame about the (minor) side effects, though. I will probably only use Ambien occasionally, when I have to sleep well for an important day. I was given a low dose (short acting) of Seconal while in the hospital in the 80's, and I had no such side effects before falling asleep, nor any side effects the next day. Problem with Seconal is,it is seriously addicting. Guess you can't have it all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5662
ambien	Insomnia	2003-04-17 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	4.0	4.5	Ambien The key to the success of Ambien is to take it on a very empty stomach; otherwise, forget it.  For me it totally knocks me out within a half hour of taking it but if I try to stay awake I find that I can't remember ever going to bed.  After five years of nightly use my tolerance has only grown from 10 mgs to 20 to 40 mgs per night, but at higher dosage comes the inevitable diarrhea the next morning. This usually goes away in a few days and isn't overly bothersome.  Discontinuing after long-term usage doesn't require tapering or have the dangers of benzodiazepines, but rebound insomnia will occur for up to three nights, at most.Personally, I love Ambien.  Unfortunately, I have no health insurance and the cost in the US is approximately $3 (USD) per pill.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5641
ambien	Insomnia	2003-04-15 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	Great I think this works great for my insomnia.  The only bad thing about this is the cost of the drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5612
ambien	Insomnia	2003-04-13 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	4.5	Here's the DL I've been on Ambien for more then a year now.  (I'm on it this very moment, watching the words swim around the screen.) I'll usually take it for a couple weeks and then take one off.  The side effects I have are:  HUNGER!  I go hunting throught the house seeking anything edible.  I also hallucinate.  Some people say they don't like it but it get a kick of out it.  Like right now I look over a pair of pants on the floor and it's wiggling around.  Then in the morning I have nomemory of what happened.  Also my eyes feel like they fell to the bottom of my head and everything looks heavier.  It works great at getting me to sleep and i don't feel drugged in the morning.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5566
ambien	Insomnia	2003-04-12 00:00:00		0.5	0.0	2.5	0.5	caution My husband was precribed Ambien for insomnia during an acute depressive illness which had only manifested 2 days before the prescription. He took one tablet, had a terrible night sleep during which he was yelling and crying out in his sleep, obviously due to nightmares which he said he could not remember the next day. Within 24 hrs of that dose, he was dead, having commited suicide. Although I cannot prove it, I question &quot;where&quot; this drug had taken his already depressed mind in that nights sleep. Just read the cautions and do some research. This is a very powerful drug, has some mind altering capabilities and should be used with extreme caution if used for insomnia during an acute depressed state.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5563
ambien	Insomnia	2003-04-12 00:00:00		0.0	5.0	0.0	1.5	Zolpidem - Made Me Hyperactive   I was prescribed zolpidem as an alternative to zopiclone, which was giving me a bitter metallic taste in the mouth.   Soon after taking the two capsules, sitting at the kitchen table - thinking of making my way to bed, I began to notice that the walls looked quite dirty and could do with a good clean! This was at 11:00PM. By 2:00AM I had finished washing the kitchen walls - it only seemed to take half-an-hour, but to my surprise I had been cleaning furiously for over three hours! I had to get up for college early and was quite annoyed that it was now in the early hours of the morning, so I took another two capsules thinking that it would help me sleep for what little of the night was left. The second dose only made me more hyperactive, with similar resuts.  Eventually it came to 7:00AM and was time to 'get up' - I hadn't slept at all and was feeling quite tired and irritable. For some reason it took me longer than an hour to get dressed and have breakfast, so I missed the bus and ended up late for classes.  I took six capsules the next night, and just lay in bed hallucinating - still no sleep. On the third night I took nothing and slept like a log! The rest of the prescription went in the bin.  Judging by other ratings of zolpidem, my own experience must have been some weird paridoxical reaction, although hallucinations have been reported quite often.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5559

It worked great for what I need it for (arthritis), but you'll be hooked on it, you won't be able to sleep at all without it. I tried a couple of times to quit. Right now, I'm doing good. I'm actually down to just a 1/3 part of the 5mg tab for 5 days, after I took 1/2 for 7 days and 2/3 a couple days before that; these little pills break apart pretty easy. I've started Melatonin 3mg to help me through this.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5413

ambien	Insomnia	2003-03-18 00:00:00		2.0	1.5	2.5	2.0	Be Smart! I highly recommend you avoid taking this medication at all costs.  It is too easy to become dependent on this drug.  I have been using it for over three years and I don't think I'll ever be able to get off of it.  I must keep upping my dosage to get any effect.  If you do decide to take this medication it is in your best interest to discontinue use as soon as possible to avoid becoming dependent.  The drug causes memory loss after long term use.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5307

It does wonders to help me fall asleep, and prevents me from tossing and turning and waking back up. The only side effect I have are hallucinations and a drunk feeling if I wait for it to kick in before bedtime. Being in that state makes sex much more intense however!! I love it to help me sleep, but I do tend to feel like I'm not done sleeping yet when I get up. That might just be me since I am all about 10 hours of beauty sleep a night.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5272

ambien	Insomnia	2003-03-07 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	Great sleep aid I have used this med for 4 months. Only side effect I've noticed is that it doesn't allow you to dream. I use the 10 mg dosage. This gives me approx 4-6 hours of sleep. I often cut the dosage in half by splitting the pill.  Doing so hasn't lessened its affect with the exception of how long I have a sound sleep. This is considered a narcotic class drug but I haven't found any narcotic type side affects. Insurance companies will usually only cover a one month prescription.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5153

ambien	Insomnia	2003-03-04 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	5.0	4.5	It Works, But Not Without Consequences I have suffered severe insomnia my entire life, even as a child.  I am now 35 and have taken ambien nightly for almost two years. It feels great to finally sleep.  Ambien works perfectly, even after two years.I do find, however, that its effects are sporadic. Some nights I get sleep in 15 minutes, some nights it takes 2 hours.  When I first started taking it and didn't go right to bed, I got VERY dopey with a heightened sense of well being, and VERY euphoric, similar to marijuana.  The really bad side effect is the memory loss.  If I get the dopey feeling, I cannot remember anything the next day, sometimes having memory loss of two or three hours from the previous night.  During that &quot;high&quot;, my wife tells me I am very talkative, and say things I probably woudn't really want anyone knowing due to the &quot;not caring&quot; feeling at the time.On occasion is gives me slight hallucinations, such as static objects (like the TV) appear to be swaying, but I have researched this and found that the hallucinations are very common from sleep deprivation (i.e. my body telling me to sleep but I'm fighting it because I like the euphoria).I have quit ambien cold turkey several times but only for a couple of weeks and each time the insomnia is right back.  There are no physical withdrawal symptoms except insomnia.  The psychological addiction, however, is quite powerful.The memory loss can be disconcerting, and the dopey feeling can make you act quite stupid.  However, it also gives a very hightened sense of sexual arousal and my wife and I often take it for that purpose, plus the awesome sleep you get afterwards.I highly recommend that anyone with an addictive personality not take this drug.  Though physically safe according to all research (unless you have liver problems or take anti-depressants), it has memory loss and euphoria side effects which can be problematic.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5127

I found that I would become &quot;dopey&quot; &amp; chatty within 10-15 minutes of taking it, but have no memory of falling asleep.  After prolonged use, it is not as effective at &quot;knocking me out&quot; &amp; it can often take upwards of an hour for me to fall asleep.

ambien	Insomnia	2003-02-18 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	5.0	1.0	Ambien I hate this stuff! I took ambien to see how it would compare with seroquel and I will take seroquel any day! The ambien doesn't last all night with me and keep me soundly asleep like the seroquel does. The very first night I took the ambien, I kept waiting for it to kick in and before I knew it I was taking the wall paper down in my bathroom and telling my life story to my fifteen year old son, at one a.m.!! None of this did I remember!! I had to be told of this the next morning! Ambien has an &quot;amnesia&quot; affect to it and it also has a kind of truth serrum to it. My son could have got anyting he wanted out of me that night!!I don't like a drug that can have that much control over me! I just want my seroquel that puts me out till morning!

I have learned the hard way. Before taking this I was taking fruit tea to relax and the next thing I knew I saw things coming out of my ceiling fan, my phone had fur and my TV was moving. My brothers girlfriend tried to help me vomit anything that might be left but it didnt work. By the way at the time I took this was a New drug and the pharmacists nor the drs. heard of this before!

ambien	Insomnia	2003-01-31 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Wonder drug - For me As with any drug, each will have it's different effect, whether it be pro or con, on every individual. I can say that as far as sleep was concerned, Ambien is KING. It would make me feel good right before I fell asleep (A sort of dopey sense of well-being) and my sleep was uninterrupted and peaceful.  The best thing about it was the way I felt when I woke up. Unreal!!! I felt awesome, ready to conquer the world. No grogginess,  no feeling ever of wanting to do a roll over and crash back into the rack. I would wake up earlier even when I didn't have to and wouldn't want to return to sleep. I would get up and start doing things immediately. I felt rested and energetic.  I can't say enough about this, for me this truly was a sleeping pill for the ages.  The only negatives I can say about Ambien is that it did have a tendency to put me into a state between sleep and being awake. Which in turn I had slight hallucinations, which got me into trouble with the wife.  I would talk in my sleep, something I have never done, and it was during the above times that I would say things that were better left unsaid. I once was in my dreamlike state and began talking about an ex-girlfriend, something I had no control over, but trying explaining this with a foot up your ass.  This was fairly common (not the ex thing, the talking). The only other negative was that it seemed after taking it for some time (approx 3 months) I had to take more to get the same sleep. I suppose you build up a tolerance to any drug but I didn't want to &quot;chase the dragon&quot; so I am now currently off of Ambien and on Trazolodone.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4503
ambien	Insomnia	2003-01-30 00:00:00		0.0	1.5	5.0	1.0	ineffective The doctor said &quot;take as needed&quot; so I took it three times over the course of 2 weeks. Each time I used it, it had absolutely no effect on the duration or quality of my sleep - if anything it made it worse. As for side effects, it's hard to say if bad memory was from the drug or the sleep deprivation. But sleep deprivation doesn't cause rashes or constant itchy-ness, so that part came from ambien. I'm hesitant to try it any more from all the stories I hear about addiction/withdrawal, and seeing as how it has not been effective for me so far.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4465
ambien	Insomnia	2003-01-26 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Ambien is Great!!! Ambien works within 30 minutes and continues to be effective after over 1 year of use.  I have no drowsiness in the morning and feel refreshed.  Because it has no active metabolites, I feel confident that it is completely safe for long-term use.  There are no significant drug interactions and no contraindications.  Ambien also does not alter natural sleep architecture like the alternatives do.  This is a much safer drug than the over-the-counter antihistamines that pose as sleep agents!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4349
ambien	Insomnia	2003-01-23 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	4.5	Great....So Far! Just started using Ambien a couple of weeks ago and so far so good.  I usually only take half of the 10mg pill and depending on my tiredness, sometimes I have to take the full amount.  Never feel groggy in the a.m. and no side effects as of yet!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4289
ambien	Insomnia	2003-01-21 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Ambien Has Worked for Me I was given Ambien for severe insomnia in combination with clinical depression/anxiety.  The first night, I took one 10 mg tablet, fell asleep almost on the computer, went to my bed and slept for 16 wonderful hours.  I woke up refreshed.  I am sure I needed the sleep after months and months of sleep deprivation.  But I didn't take 10 mg again.  I took only 5 mg and it still worked well, fell asleep fast and stayed asleep for 8-10 hours.  I definitely did not overuse it - a one-month prescription lasted almost two years.  My husband works nights and I was hesitant to take it alone with the children in case they needed me.  When I had my prescription renewed, I asked for the 5 mg tablets and I have split them into 2.5 mg and it is still effective for me.  I have had no side effects from my occasional use and always wake up feeling well rested.  My husband, on the other hand, will sleep for four hours and is then wide awake.  His brother cannot fall asleep after taking Ambien at all.  As quickly and effectively as it works for me, I can't even imagine!  It has definitely done well for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4251
ambien	Insomnia	2003-01-21 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	Years of Ambien Use Been using it for 5+ years as needed, and have definitely noticed a drop off in effectiveness, but I dont dare take more  I try to do without for awhile to hopefully finish the recuperation cycle. Without repeating what Ive already read on this list, I learned a few tricks myself:1.Take it on an empty stomach so it hits faster and harder. Eat earlier if you have to. 2.Chew the tab partially just before swallowing so more surface area of the med hits your stomach quicker. Else you risk the pill being passed into the intestine before its been absorbed by the stomach. Especially if youve eaten 2-3 hours ago and youre unfortunate enough to take it right at the time your stomach is emptying anyway. I think this is whats happening to those who claim the med does nothing for them. If this happens to me I just take a half again and that usually does it.3.Beware of weird hypnotic state if you try to stay awake. Ive been told Ive done bizarre things.4.Dont take it until its 11pm-12am and youre sure you still cant shut your mind off. There is the chance youll fall asleep on your own, isnt there? ;)5.Beware of psychological addiction  increased nervousness at the thought of Oh God, I just know I wont get any sleep unless I take a tablet!!. Thinking about this will certainly keep you awake. Following step #4 will help diminish this as you learn that you CAN fall asleep yourself now and then  you remember, like in the old days?6.Due to federal and insurance dispensation limitations, ask for the Rx in 10-tab doses with 5 refills. Fed law limits 6 fills of this med on any ONE SCRIPT, and most insurance cos wont pay for more than 10 tabs each 30 days. Of course if youre paying for it yourself then this isnt a concern.7.If you dont use insurance, go to one of those drug dispensing websites (e.g. www.drugstore.com) - for first-time customers you usually get a nice discount. This scheme works with any drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4240
ambien	Insomnia	2003-01-20 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	Ambien 10 mg I only wish I had a basket full of Ambien to take every night.  Because I get a full nigh's sleep and there is no after effects. You feel great. If you cannot sleep every night it is hard to do a good job at anything. They say that it is addictive, but for me if I can get a good night's sleep then let it be.  I can't perform a job if I am always tired, body burns, stressed out from not having a good night of complete rest.  If something happens and you are needed in the middle of the night and take a ambien then you are alert and there are no hungover?? feelings.  The only gripe I have is I have no insurance and it is very expensive and your doctor will only prescribe you 12 to 15 tablets once in a while.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4225

It wasn't as effective after I had been taking it for a while.  The worst side effect was the memory loss.  I couldn't remember entire conversations that occurred within 15 minutes of taking the drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4224

ambien	Insomnia	2002-12-31 00:00:00		3.5	1.0	4.5	3.0	Ambien Overall I would conclude that ambien overall did work well for occasional boughts with sleeplessness. Over a long term I have not tried, as this is advised against due to addictive possibilites.Largest drawback in taking this drug was loss of memory..short term memory. Coudn't tell you what I did the day before prior to taking the medication. Short term amnesia. It is scarey. But overall..Ambien did allow for a decent night sleep. Mild hangover feeling afterward, nothing that would stop you from doing normal duties.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3735
ambien	Insomnia	2002-12-30 00:00:00		4.5	1.0	4.5	3.5	Not for long term use!!! I used Ambien for over 3 years, and boy was I sorry later.  The doctor assured me that this was OK even though the manufacturer says not to use for more than 7-10 days.  I could not sleep a wink for 11 months after I stopped using it.  I literally went days at a time with no sleep.  Just recently my sleep returned to normal.  It works great while you're taking it, but watch out when you stop!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3699

For me, I take one and 20-25 minutes later I'm sleeping like a baby for 7-8 hours waking refreshed. On the other hand, my wife is immune to even (2)10mg pills. I haven't a clue why, she's healthy and on no other medication. The cost (no insurance) is very high so I shop prices at different pharmacies.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3416
ambien	Insomnia	2002-12-11 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	4.5	Ambien I have used Ambien off &amp; on for over a year. I have chronic headaches associated with Fibromyalgia. With the Ambien NIGHTLY after about two weeks, my headaches are manageable. If I try to go w/out Ambien for a time, my headaches gradually return. The headaches seem to be a byproduct of lack of REM sleep for me. I hate to use a drug nightly to sleep, but have come to realize having a useful life w/a drug is so much better than always being out of it.  You do need to go to bed immediately after taking your pill. I usually read for 10 minutes or so before dozing off. I have deeper sleep and actually dream w/Ambien...not nightmares, but dreams! No hangover the next day like w/Tylenol pm for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3349

ambien	Insomnia	2002-12-01 00:00:00		4.0	0.0	4.0	3.0	Husband Loves Ambien ! My wife used to take Ambien for her insomnia.  It worked very well for her - as long as she went directly to bed after taking it.  The first time she decided to stay up after taking Ambien, we found that she completely lost all inhibitions, and her entire personality changed.  She became a total nymphomaniac!  She thought up numerous kinky, sexual things to try and stayed up ALL NIGHT LONG.  She also had total amnesia (about 1 hour after taking it) when she took Ambien, which was a good thing b/c if she could remember ALL of the wild and crazy things that she said and did after taking Ambien, she would be absolutely MORTIFIED!  We've had conversations, gone places, and she even telephoned and e-mailed friends and family - and DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING AT ALL about it the next day!  We decided she needed to quit taking Ambien when she drove to a strip club one night, applied for a job, and worked for one night!  Needless to say, in these rare cases, Ambien should NOT be taken!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3190

It worked great for about 2 weeks - it's probably why they tell you that it's a short-term solution.  But then I started waking up earlier and earlier untill it just didn't work anymore.  Furthermore, if you stop taking it abruptly after your body becomes used to it be ready to experience the worst side effects ever.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3115
ambien	Insomnia	2002-11-23 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Relief for Convulsive Attacks/Improved Dream State I suffered from extreme sleep deprivation for more than four years. The cause has yet to be properly diagnosed, not even by a Mayo Clinic Sleep Study. The symptoms include the nightly onset of extreme adrenaline like sensations throughout my entire body. (Like being plugged into an electric socket)The &quot;electricity&quot; kicks on just as my body relaxes for sleep. The intensity of these sensations at times border on seizure and continue for 4 to 5 hours nightly. After suffering for years with 0 - 3 hours of sleep each night, I was finally precribed Ambien. Because of its anti-convulsion properties, Ambien completely relieves these symptoms and enables a full 8 hours of sleep, free of convulsive attacks. After six months of continuous use, its effectiveness has not diminished. If I do not take Ambien, I am still awake until 9:00 a.m.I've found other &quot;sleepers&quot; to be ineffective because they impair my ability to function the entire next day and leave me in a deep mental fog. Ambien has no side effects the next day and I can function better than I have in years. If I take Ambien more than an hour before bedtime, it does create a powerful muscle control effect, similar to drinking a lot of alchohol. It is difficult to walk, I stagger and I must brace myself from falling. My conversation also becomes slurred and almost incoherent. These symptoms are completely gone within a few hours and only serve to prevent convulsive attacks and enable me to fall to sleep quickly. Delightfully, Ambien has also positively effected my dream state. Previously, my dreams were consistently nightmarish, dark and often apocolyptic for many years. Ambien has enabled a more consistently positive, lighter dream state. This is a very nice &quot;side effect&quot;. Ambien is truly miraculous and has given me back my life.Tim Jessup, email: SoundDsgn@aol.com	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3085

ambien	Insomnia	2002-10-26 00:00:00		3.5	1.5	5.0	3.0	AMBIEN Review I had been prescribed Ambien a few years ago.  While I did find that Ambien is effective, even a 20mg dose was only minimally effective.  The side effects that I experienced from Ambien were unpleasant and frankly unacceptable.  Most of these side effects were related to digestive problems:  on the morning following nights which I took Ambien, I had frequent bowel movements throughout the day.  Also, I had one experience with Ambien which convinced me that this medication was NOT for me:  I had an episode of sleep-walking and do not recall this incident.  My wife told me that I was attempting to leave our house without clothing.  Ambien is really no &quot;break-through&quot; treatment over other sleeping medications.  The major difference is that it costs more than other sleeping medicines, and it also produced side effects that were intolerable for me.  I have read many positive reviews of Ambien - but, in reality, it's not really all that different from any of the benzodiazepine (Dalmane, ProSom, Halcion, Doral, etc.) medications that are already marketed.  Personally, I would never use this medication again.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2537

ambien	Insomnia	2002-10-21 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	Ambien I have been using Ambien for about 3 weeks. I am under a tremendous amount of financial and business stress and had trouble &quot;turning it off to go to sleep. I have always been a &quot;light&quot; sleeper anyway. Ambien allows me to get to sleep very quickly after taking it. No &quot;morning after &quot; side effects to date. The only problem I have with it and I noticed at least one other reviewer had the same problem, is that it only seems to last between 4 to 5 hours. But I seem to have normal sleep, dreams etc. I have never taken two tablets to find out if it would last longer but I am going to tonight and will report back.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2407
ambien	Insomnia	2002-10-20 00:00:00		0.0	5.0	5.0	1.5	Not for Chronic Insomnia What can I say? It simply does not work. 10mg does not work. 20 mg does not work. 40mg might work if you've been up 18 hours already and had a few beers.  I know it does great things for those who suffer from occasional sleep disturbances, but if you actually have a genuine sleeping disorder, you would do better to hire someone to hit you over the head with a steel baseball bat every night.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2391

However, it was too good to be true as eventually its' effectivenss diminished. But for short to medium term use, it worked great for me.  Sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night I will still break a 10mg tablet in half and take it.  Seems to still help some.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2206
ambien	Insomnia	2002-10-03 00:00:00		3.5	2.5	5.0	3.5	Now the bed is my friend I used to hate to go to bed, I suffer with awful restless leg syndrom.  About 4 years ago my doc put me on Ambien after a sleep study in NY Meth hospital.  IT has been a God Send to me.  I am thankful for each night I can sleep without the creepy crawling of my legs &amp; arms.  It is habbit forming but non addictive.  That means; yes I need it to sleep nightly, but no I never sit at my desk &amp; crave it.  I never think oh I need an ambien.  I just know 30 minutes before bedtime it works great.  I have found that walking about 9:00pm and taking it after knocks me out.  I guess the blood is really pumping good.  Sex is better with it and you do want to eat (just about anything).  Good luck- i hope your bed is no longer your enemy!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2140
ambien	Insomnia	2002-10-03 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	4.0	Very effective...... I recently had a severe injury which for some reason gave me insomnia.  My doc gave me Ambien and I sleep like a baby now.  I also wake up feeling refreshed.....However...if you take Ambien I advise going to bed immediatley.  If I don't I usually display strange behavior like talking to people and things that aren't there, hallucinating, having unusual telephone conversations (usually self initiated), and inability to balance myself.  It also makes everything seem to &quot;make sense&quot; and puts a whole new spin on the way I see things.  Basically this is not a drug to take lightly and one should lay down immediatly and not leave the house once Ambien is taken.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2136
ambien	Insomnia	2002-09-18 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	Has safed my life! I have chronic leg &amp; back pain, which keeps me up all night, but developed insomnia after having my kids - that's been 11 years now. I have tried ALL different kinds of sleep aids...most not ever working (I have a very high tolerance for pain meds &amp; sleep meds)...and most giving awful groggy side effects the next day. When I discovered Ambien over 2 years ago, I was so excited to have slept the way I did and to NOT have any side effects the next day - unbelievable!! I am still on Ambien and take it every night. I have voluntarily tried nights without it, just to see if I could sleep on my own - I cannot, my mind just races. Ambien, calms me down very fast...allows me to relax and quickly makes me sleep. The only thing I do not like about Ambien (I haven't heard this happening to anyone else) but it gives me the most intense &quot;munchies.&quot; Most the time I will not have any recollection of eating anything - but will wake up to find empty wrappers of chips, candy, cereal, etc., around me. It also will make me feel very &quot;playful&quot; (if you know what I mean :). Since I have been on Ambien for over 2 years, I am up to three (30mg) a night. I know that is a lot, but does the same thing to me as when I used to take 10mg. You can grow a tolerance to it, just as any other meds. All I know, is that this medicine has saved my life, because I run a busy law office, have two kids and a huge household to run and could never do it without sleep. There are times, however that Ambien works best on me. I've notice that just before my monthly cycle, it's not as effective...also, Ambien works better on me with a full stomach...go figure!! Anyway, thanks to whoever came up with this Medication - but it is very expensive without insurance!!! Thank you.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1948
ambien	Insomnia	2002-09-18 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	4.5	4.5	Ambien I have been on ambien for over two years and have become dependent on it. I can fall asleep without it but wake up every 2-3 hours. I often break the 10mg tablets in half and find that it is effective. I also have found the effectivness greatly depends on how much food you have consumed approximately 3-4 hours before taking it.Ambien does cause me to have complete memory loss regarding my actions if I stay up more than 45 minutes after taking it. I highly recommend taking it and going right to bed!! I, apparently, also get very talkative and exhibit strange behavior when on the medication. I liken it to being extremely drunk (I remember my early 20's!)-I have difficulty walking or doing anything if I don't go right to bed.I credit my ability to function on ambien. It has allowed me to get the sleep I need.I highly recommend it for people with insomnia. But it is extremely habit forming - in my opinion.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1947

ambien	Insomnia	2002-09-06 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	3.5	It's the best It's the only medication that enables me to sleep for a couple of hours without waking up.I normally cannot sleep more than 1 1/2 - 2 hours without waking up, then can't fall back asleep.  I actually feel better rested when I take it, although after about 1 year or so, it's effectiveness seems to wear off.  All in all, I think it is extremely helpful to me in getting a better night's sleep and improves my quality of life with no side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1854

ambien	Insomnia	2002-07-19 00:00:00		5.0	0.0	5.0	3.5	Ocular Migraines Ambien caused me to have ocular migraines.  It worked great for sleep but as I work in heavy construction, I could not keep taking it and risk the temporary loss of sight.  The listed side effects dance all around this issue but this is the diagnosis of my opthalmologist and is very apparent to me.  It works like this: if I take just one Ambien, I will have an ocular migraine within a few days.  If I quit taking Ambien, the ocular migraines go away.  This also happened to me when I tried Sonata although Sonata was totally ineffective.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1239

It is the only medication that has helped me sleep without the morning hangover feeling, but if you do not go straight to bed after taking, please know that you will experience weird things!!  And maybe not even remember.  You have to be extremely careful.  I have had 2 drinks before and came home an hour later and took one.  It flipped me out.  I have these thoughts of everything I can do with my life.  Its like writing the best &quot;To do List&quot; in the world, but not remembering one part of it!!!  Anyway, I am 4 wks pregnant so I had to stop taking it and I'm back to my same old insomnia again.  The medicine is definetely addictive and don't let anyone tell you it isn't!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1154

ambien	Insomnia	2002-07-02 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Effective, but habit-forming For a short-term solution to sleeplessness or difficulty in falling asleep, Ambien is great. However, I do find it habit-forming quickly. After the 9/11 attack I went through a long period where I a) couldn't fall asleep and b) couldn't stay asleep; after a month of this, I was a walking zombie. Upon dr recommendation I tried Ambien and it worked like a charm; I didn't have side effects (i.e. drowsiness) the morning after either and felt fit during the day. But I noticed that after using it for just one week, I was unable to fall asleep at all without it.  So I cut the dose in half and initially took 1/2 dose every night for 3 nights and then stopped. That worked! For temporary insomnia though Ambien works like a charm. But I do believe it is habit-forming.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1094

After having one of these for 2 days, went to the doctor who decided to try Imitrex, 100mg. It did help. So she gave me anRX for Imitrex 50mg. My insurance no longer covers Amerge, so it's Imitrex for me. Amerge took 2 hours to work, the Imitrex takes an hour or less. But Amerge would last for 24 hours, not the Imitrex.

I have been on so many other medications, but Amerge seems to help the most.  As when I get the migraine, my one eye gets zig zags, and the patterns change.  I had an EEG done, and it came out I was fine, other than I was depressed, at the time.I take it as soon as I start seeing the Zig Zags, so the headache doesn't start.  Sometimes, I will still get a slight headache,then it will go away with the medication.  This is the first medication that has helped with my Aura Migraines.  The price is high, insurance will only allow me to have 8 a month.  Once I had to buy one, and it was the best $50.00 I spent!I have a hard time keeping a job, as I do suffer with BP 2 Disorder, but when I get the Aura Migraine, I can't drive, and I usually have from 1-9 a month.  Weather, PMS, when I have my period, and just because!I know most of my new Docs never heard of Amerge, but I make sure they know it helps with the Aura Migranes, but a bit expensive, but worth it if you have to live with them.Hope everyone that suffers with Migraines, find out something that helps them!Hugs,Dawn	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/27359

amerge	Migraine	2005-08-02 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	4.5	4.5	Amerge is a &quot;kinder gentler&quot; triptan drug I've had migraines since childhood and I can now appreciate the many medications available to choose from.  When Imitrex first came out, I thought it worked like a miracle, especially the injection.  I went on to try Zomig and Maxalt but experienced too many side effects, especially from the Imitrex.  So, when my Neurologist tried me on Amerge, I was very pleased because it did not cause the side effects like tiredness, tight chest, dry mouth.  It takes a little longer to work if my headache is bad, but it lasts longer.  I don't like the expense of the drug, but it is worth it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25073

(Zonegran works better than anything EVER has for MY migraines--I take 400 at bedtime)  But since my higher dosage of the Z. the Amerge hasn't seemed to work and I'm trying Immitrex but I don't like how it makes me feel 1/2 hr after taking it.  Amerge didn't give me an icky taste, or a tight chest feeling or a feeling that I might vomit.  After taking Imitrex, I sometimes wish I hadn't--and I never felt that after taking Amerge.  When Amerge was working for me sometimes I had to take a second pill an hour later and that helped.  Sometimes neither pill helped.  Sometimes the first one took the migraine away in 2 hrs.  I just never knew :(	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22105
amerge	Migraine	2005-04-26 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Amerge for Menstrual Migraines Amerge has been a real blessing for me during my menstrual time.  I have had migraines for over 22 years but my worse ones are right before my cycle begins and again at the end of my cycle.  I have been prescribed Amerge to start taking a couple of days before my cycle begins and continue until the packet of Amerge is gone.  I HIGHLY recommend giving it a try.  It has reduced the number of menstrual migraines I have and when I do on occassion have one during that time it has severally dimished the intensity of the ones that creep through.I have had no side effects at all to Amerge.  Again, I HIGHLY recommend it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22032

amerge	Migraine	2003-11-06 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Amerge My physician prescribed Amerge for migraine headaches that accompanied a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Amerge took away the tingling and stinging sensation in my shoulders, neck and face (the stinging sensation was so severe that I could not distinguish the neurophy from burning my neck with a curling iron). I was also prescribed Nortriptyline with Tramadol for fibromyalgia.  I participate in a heated pool water exercise class 2 to 3 times per week at durations up to 90 minutes.

amerge	Migraine	2003-01-03 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.0	Amerge I have had migraines now for 20 years and I'm only27. I have tried other meds such as Imitrex, Zomig, and, of course, all over the counter drugs available. Now I take Amerge only when I feel the migraine in my temple for over an hour and I always try Aleve (taken with caffeine) before I feel I need to take the Amerge. I have found over the years that any medication taken for pain over a long period of time loses its effectiveness and can cause rebound headaches. I suffer from menstural migraines before, during and after my period, so the month is pretty much covered. However, I am currently trying Inderal (Propranolol) which is a blood pressure medicine (it relieves constriction of the blood vessels).I have only been taking it for about two months and my migraines have decreased in frequency (from about 10 per month to @ 5). The dosage is the key, so far I am at 20mg.  I take them only at night since it makes me sleepy and I was suffering from insomnia anyway. Inderal is the oldest PREVENTIVE dating back to the 70's). I decided that a bandaid was not good enough, besides what do I have to lose, but the pain right?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3782
amerge	Migraine	2002-12-27 00:00:00		3.0	4.0	4.0	3.5	Imitrex + Amerge Amerge isn't very effective in aborting a full blown migraine, but works great if you catch it early.  Amerge is also helpful after an hour or two if 1 dose of Imitrex doesn't quite get rid of the headache.  I also use it for &quot;rebound&quot; headaches.  I have less side effects from Amerge than Imitrex, so it is a great alternative.  I've tried other triptans, but most seem to have the same side effects as Imitrex, but not as effective as Amerge.  My copay for Amerge is about double the copay for Imitrex.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3622
amerge	Migraine	2002-11-25 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.0	amerge works great Works well on my menstrual migraine.

amerge	Migraine	2002-11-24 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	Amerge I usually try Excedrin-type pain relief first. Usually coupled with pseudophedrine hydrochoride.  (At on-set of headache, I can't tell what kind of relief will work.)  So if that doesn't work, I go to the Amerge within a couple of hours.  Headache usually is gone within an hour.  Very little side effects.  Sometimes it tries to return the next day and I will take a second Amerge.  Rarely have to take one on third day, or more than one in 24 hours.  It's expensive, but works for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3105

If you know or feel you are going to be getting a migraine, then take it before it starts [if possible].  That is the best way it works.

Although it is expensive, it is covered by most insurance companies down to a copay of around $35 for 9 pills. I also like Maxalt for menstrual headaches.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2239
amerge	Migraine	2002-08-26 00:00:00		4.0	2.5	5.0	3.5	Amerge My neurologist has me on this during my period to preventatively abort migraines, however my insurance does not cover this so there has been much ugly fighting over this.  It also tends to make me rather tired, but not as tired as a migraine.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1593
amerge	Migraine	2002-08-18 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Amerge I have had menstrual migraines for years.  They were completelydebilitating, lasted for days, and didn't respond to anything, not evenprescription painkillers.  I was missing work and started having horribleanxiety the day before I knew the headache was coming.  Eventually itcrossed my mind to ask my doctor about actual migraine medicines, and shegave me samples of Amerge to try.  The first time I took it I thought I'ddied and gone to heaven.  Amerge is FAST and works COMPLETELY.  Within 10minutes the headache had subsided and within 30 minutes I was able to getup, shower, get dressed, and have a party at my house.  All the sidesymptoms of my migraine were gone--no nausea, no shakiness, no soundsensitivity or light sensitivity.  I had no side effects whatsoever, andnever once has a headache returned.I am currently nursing a 10 month old and switched to Imitrex because it isshorter-acting and approved for nursing mothers by the American Academy ofPediatrics, but twice I have taken Amerge and nursed 6 hrs later and thebaby had no effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1500
amerge	Migraine	2001-08-19 00:00:00		4.0	3.0	5.0	3.5	Works for me! I have now been using this drug for a few years and it is the best thing I have ever tried.  As long as I take it early enough in an attack, it always works, apart from on migraines associated with my period.  It does make me tired, but usually works within the hour.  I find it best if I take a tablet and then sleep for the hour.  It is normally completely gone by the time I wake up.  In England it is quite expensive as you only normally get 6 tablets for every prescription.  Each tablet usually last me about 20 hours.  You should only take another one if the original migraine has disappeared and returned. I usually have to take 2 or 3 in each migraine attack over 2 days.  The maximum dose is 2 in any 24 hours.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/519

amitiza	Constipation -- Chronic	2012-10-01 00:00:00		0.5	5.0	5.0	0.5	Constipation continues on a 3-day cycle. Have not noticed any improvement after 1 month.	-
amitiza	Irritable bowel syndrome - Constipation (IBS-C)	2011-04-27 00:00:00		2.0	0.5	4.0	0.5	After using this product for 5 days I started breaking out in hives and having swelling and it took 5-6 days for the swelling and itching to go away. The product worked pretty quick since I was put on it after it I was put on this medicine after a colonoscopy. I had to stop taking this med and just start taking benefiber twice a day and diet to try and get this under control. I was taking the Amitiza 1 time a day.	-
amitiza	Constipation -- Chronic	2010-09-21 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	3.5	4.0	I had Stage 4 colon cancer and had extensive surgery.  After that I suffered with chronic and const constipation.  Used Miralax, Dulcolax and other products.  Taking Amitzia has made my life as close to normal as possible after I was lucky enough to survice the cancer.	-
amitiza	Irritable bowel syndrome - Constipation (IBS-C)	2009-06-23 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	5.0	I have suffered my entire life with IBS-C.  I would go 5-7 days without a BM until I tried Amitiza.  Now I go every morning like clockwork.  My doc also prescribed an antibiotic to help with bacterial overgrowth.  I feel amazing!  Yoga, meditation, and dietary changes have also helped with my treatment, but I believe the Amitiza made a HUGE difference.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60390
amitiza	Constipation -- Chronic	2009-03-29 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	2.5	1.0	This drug caused such bad diarrhea that I had to run for the bathroom daily. Also, the nausea, dizziness and forgetfullness was intolerable. I was prescribed it for chronic constipation, which often led to bacterial overgrowth. I take great probiotics (VSL#3, Align) and eat a diet that eliminates problem foods. This drug is NOT worth it. Now that I've stopped, my bowels won't move at all... not even with suppositories. Stay away.... this is a drug and not a cure.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59648

amitiza	Constipation -- Chronic	2008-12-21 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	4.5	5.0	I have had chronic constipation issues for a number of years and to be honest, I have never been what anyone would categorize as &quot;regular&quot;.  I did try Zelnorm before it was taken off the market, but it only worked every now and then.  But the good news is that I've now been using Amitiza for about two months, and I'm happy to say I have seen amazing results.  There are even days when I actually have two bowel movements in one day, when, before I began taking Amitiza, I could easiy go seven days without any bm at all---unless I took a laxative.  The only slightly negative comment I have is that when I first began taking Amitiza, I was a little nauseated but then I began taking both my 8 mcg pills at night before bedtime and was fine.  Then, after maybe two weeks or so, I tried taking one in the morning again with food (and even without food) and then one before bedtime and I no longer feel any nausea at all.  This drug has certainly been a lifesaver for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58777
amitiza	Irritable Bowel Syndrome	2008-12-17 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	This is a miracle treatment for me. After 40 years of problems which have become progressively worse, i found something that worked! I took it twice a day for a day and a half and all my problems were gone!

amitiza	Constipation -- Chronic	2008-08-01 00:00:00		4.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	I have suffered with constipation for 30 yrs. I recently had a colonoscopy and a cancerous polyp was found and removed. The Dr. said  I had severe scarring due to years of constipation. He prescribed Amitiza and I can finally have a much needed &quot;normal&quot; bowel movement. I have lost weight and have more energy now.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58192
amitiza	Irritable bowel syndrome - Constipation (IBS-C)	2008-07-20 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	For me, Amititza has proved to be a wonder drug. I've been taking 24mcg approximately once every 3 days for about 3 months now, with minimal side effects &amp; great results. I also take FiberCon daily with meals, which didn't help much before the Amitiza, but seems to make a difference in conjunction with it.  I am 37 and have suffered from chronic idiopathic constipation for 10 yrs. Without much success, I've tried elimination diets  for food allergies, fiber and water treatments, exercise, acupuncture, stool softeners, bulk-forming laxatives, etc. Amitiza actually makes me feel normal again. Doctor says I can choose the frequency with which I take it. For me, one pill every 2-3 days is best. I do occasionally get very mild nausea or diarrhea, but it's and well worth the outcome. I'm so glad to finally have found something that works! (Note: without insurance coverage, this drug is extremely expensive.)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58115
amitiza	Constipation -- Chronic	2008-05-16 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	5.0	5.0	After reading other user reviews, I almost cancelled my dr appt to try Amitiza.  I'm glad I didn't - I've been on it a week, 2x/day, and today was the first time I felt just a little queasy. It went away after about 2 minutes and everything else has been fine.  I use the bathroom about once a day which is a HUGE improvement over once every 10 days.  My stomach has been a little gurgly now &amp; again, but that's hardly a bad side effect.  If you start taking it, you might feel too sick to stay on it, but you won't know unless you try - it might be exactly what you've been waiting for to help.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57847
amitiza	Constipation -- Chronic	2007-11-26 00:00:00		3.0	0.5	1.0	1.5	I have chromic constipation, which is pretty painful.  After several uninformed doctors saw me, prescribed more fiber (which is the opposite of what people like me need - I am a vegan, I get TOO MUCH fiber in my diet) and sent me out the door, I had one doctor who listened to me and said that this medication used in conjunction with polyethylene glycol would help me move.  It works occasionally, though that is hardly a sufficient reason to endure the nausea, dizzy spells, and OUTRAGEOUS cost of the medication.  Everytime I took it, I got sick.  Sometimes I vomited.  It seems like a horrible choice to make - would I rather be severely constipated and in pain, or nauseous and vomiting?  I think I am going to try to find something else.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56918
amitiza	Irritable bowel syndrome - Constipation (IBS-C)	2007-08-29 00:00:00		0.5	5.0	5.0	0.5	I might as well have taken a sugar pill.  I felt nothing.  The doctor gave me some samples and a prescription.  She warned me that my insurance probably wouldn't cover it and that it is expensive.  She also gave me some discount coupons.  I'm so grateful for the coupons, because this med did absolutely nothing.  I took it for about a week.  Did I take it long enough?  Should I spring for more pills and give it a longer try?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56517
amitiza	Irritable bowel syndrome - Constipation (IBS-C)	2006-11-06 00:00:00		2.0	0.0	5.0	2.0	Horrible This medication made me so unbelievably ill, even when taken with a lot of food.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Even though it had the desired effect for IBS-C, the side effect of nauseua is intolerable. Never, never, never would I advise anyone to take this medication.  It was a total nightmare.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52265
amitiza	Irritable bowel syndrome - Constipation (IBS-C)	2006-08-16 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	horrible Okay this stuff is amazing. First of all i started taking it when it first came out and from the beginning was getting dizzy spells and weird head rushes. Then i started getting the nausea so i tried to eat with it, did that work, NOPE, of course not becuase of the fact that it just made me worse and i started vomiting. Just say that i use it soo sparingly now that its a last resort because it works so well to empty me out. I get immediate response from it well within a half hour of taking it but i am so sick with side effects its not worth taking to me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47708
amitriptyline	Social phobia (Social anxiety disorder)	2012-08-08 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I actually take it for anxiety. I have been on so many medications - this one does really well. I also take .25 of one milligram Clonazepam per day         (divided 1/2 tablet every 12 hours) which is a very very low dosage.The doctor prescribes me 4 Amytripiline per day, but it's been over 3 months now and I am only up to 3 a day, and not every day.The Love and forgiveness of My Savior the Lord Jesus Christ has been my biggest help.... and He actually allows the medication to help me.

amitriptyline	Insomnia	2012-06-24 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	4.0	5.0	I have bad back problems that cause me to not be able to sleep. This drug has helped me so much! I've slept so well since I've been taking it, it's like I didn't even know I could be this awake during the day. It's really easy to take because it's small, but I only take half a pill and it tastes awful. The only side effect I've faced was dizziness, but it's not severe at all.	-
amitriptyline	Depression	2011-08-21 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	5.0	0.5	I took amitriptyline (25 mg) for 29 days and the side effects built up over time.  Facial rash, bruising, fast heartbeat; but the worst were the hallucinations.  Never having hallucinated before I just thought it was a nightmare. After the third hallucination I finally realized what it was.  Now I'm afraid to go to sleep because when I wake up that is when I have the hallucinations. I stopped taking the drug. I have tried many antidepressants none being effective; this experience has convinced me to not try any more I would rather be depressed!	-
amitriptyline	Pain	2011-06-11 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	5.0	5.0	I used this drug for esophageal spasms and it saved my life. I started with 25mg and built up to 75mg over a three week period under close supervision of my doctor.The side effects were dry mouth and sun sensitivity so I chewed gum and drank water.I was able to wean off it within two years and am healthy again but this drug literally saved my life and allowed me to live a normal life when I had given up.	-

Not a nice feeling.	-
amitriptyline	Fibromyalgia	2010-04-08 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	5.0	5.0	Amitriptyline was the 2nd medication I tried for fibromyalgia.  This med gave me my life back.  I was started on a low dose and then increased.  I could tell a difference in a few days. It took a few months to feel more like myself.  I would highly recommend you at least try this one.  The side effects are at least bearable, for me the pain and exhaustion were on longer bearable.  The only side effects I've had are dry mouth, weight gain, and at first it made me very sleepy.  I try to take it early enough at night so I can get up at a reasonable time in the am.  The worst side effect for me is the weight gain.  I am starting to feel so much better that exercise and daily life is getting back to normal, So I am starting get a handle on the weight.  I have been taking this for 18 months.  The 1st med did nothing at all.  Give it a try!!!	-
amitriptyline	Depression	2009-12-15 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I had to start by breaking pills and taking 5 mg every other day and eventually built up to 10 mg a day.  I'm in my late 30s and weigh about 125 lbs.  I am very sensitive to medicine.   After an initial cloudy head feeling and slight ringing in my ears that went away...the effects have been amazing.  I sleep great, I can relax and think more clearly than before. Life's daily trials are much more manageable to me than ever before.  I am usually very sensitive and jumpy  - now I feel normal on this great drug.  PMS was a huge problem for me in the past - now it's disappeared.  I could not be happier and wish I had tried this years ago.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61810

This stuff got me off sleepingpills (oxazepam) immediately. I used to sleep just about 4/5 hours. 25mg of this stuff made me sleep a decent 7 hours, and I still sleep well. In the second week I felt better everyday and after two weeks I'm over my severe depression that lasted for 3 months.I'm enjoying life again. Side-effects are a dry mouth (I can live with that, I just take a sip of water now and then), and laziness in the morning.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58302

I tried it only for a couple nights because it made me really angry and didn't help me in anyway. It made my days longer and harder. I stopped taking it and a week or so later I finally felt less edgy. I wouldn&quot;t recommend this to anyone.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58043

I can now go up to 4-5 months with out having any migraines. The migraines are also much less server when I do get them.

Been going on three weeks of a sinus infection, feel much better now, but both have messed up my insides,  Been eating Activia Yogurt and eating more fiber bars each day, and taking Acidophillis each day too, waiting on these meds to get out of my system, so I will start feeling like myself again.  I would be very wary of taking Amoxicillan, I personally will never taken it again, it made me crazy for two weeks, and affected some other folks that I knew that was on that dosage as well.

It also REALLY helps my obsessions/compulsions/tics.  Sometimes also helped anxiety.  As far as treating symptoms, it was basically the perfect med for me.However, there are side effects such that I only take it now during short periods when my obsessions/compulsions/tics are really bad.  1) It made me fall asleep too late and wake up too early; I barely slept.  2) Sometimes it would make me hypomanic.  3) Weight gain.  Significant.

It makes ejaculation more difficult and causes a dry mouth.

If taken in conjunction with antipsychotic drugs this sedation may prove troublesome. However, the mood enhancement effect on this drug exceeds that achievable from the more recent SSRI drugs, e.g. Prozac, so it is not to be written off as a possiblity in all cases.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48319
anafranil	Depression	2006-08-19 00:00:00		1.5	0.5	4.0	1.5	Anafranil - Relief from Depression @ last Anafranil seemed a good choice because its the only TCA that can help treat Depression &amp; associated OCD, Anxiety. I started @ a low dose then rapidly increased to 300mg/day and I felt like a Zombie, the sedation was unbearable and I still felt deeply depressed. All the usual TCA side effects which decreased after 2-4 weeks (approx). After several months of taking Anafranil I had to stop this drug because it wasnt the answer to my prayers.

I was suffering extremely bad panic attacks and ended up being admitted to hospital for 10 days to get it under control with benzos while the Clomipramine kicked in. Took about 2 months for full effect but completely stopped panic.I came off due to virtual complete loss of libido but have never found a drug that works as well. I have tried SSRI's with modest results that have now failed and I'm back with the panic. Tried Cymbalta - no good, Moclobemide, No good now on Nardil but early days, covering with Xanax.If you dont mind no sex life use this med - it works!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47748

anafranil	Depression	2006-06-22 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	2.5	4.5	Together with an SSRI, it's a magic bullet I've been on SSRIs (mostly Prozac) for 11 years now.  I've had them poop out on me several times, and really bad depression has come about.  But when I add 50-75mg clompiramine, the depression always lifts.  It's very nice to know that the clomipramine is there in case I need it.  It has tons of side effects for me (dizziness, sleepiness, anorgasmia, dry mouth, etc.).  But it sure beats depression.The only other drug I've found that is akin to a &quot;magic bullet&quot; is ProVigil together with an SSRI.  But even that has failed me recently.  So it's back to the low dosage clomipramine together with the SSRI.Be careful adding a TCA to an SSRI.  The latter can increase substantially the serum levels of the forum.  So don't do this without your doctor supervising.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44996

anafranil	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2006-04-06 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	My First Antidepressant I was precribed this drug for panic attacks and agoraphobia brought about my stress from facing trial in court due to a school fight that I had in 1990.  I had hid out from the law for over a year and a half because of my charges and it was horrible as the school fight could have been avoided if the damn school would have interceeded and stopped the bully and her gang who was harrassing me.Moral of the story is that after the fight I had and stress of hiding out after fight- my agoraphobia with anxiety attacks came over me again.  The law inevitably caught up to me and I was ordered to face court when they arrested my mother at work.  It was actually the greatest thing that could have happened in my life and I'd actually trade places where I'm at now to be there again.  Enough time had passed, had the right people- and essentially all that happened was I was fined, sentenced to probation, summer school, repeated the 8th grade and ordered counseling of which we had trouble finding on our own.  Seems like it takes the strong arm of the law to pass anything through.  This time it worked in my favor.They placed me on Anafranil and Xanax.  I do not remember the exact dosage- but it was quit high until I was placed on a matinenance dosage.  After trying Desipramine and Tofranil, this was the only AD I could tolerate and was highly effective.  This did miracles for depression, agoraphiba, panic attacks, ocd (to the point I was a bit numb to all, AKA, didn't care...which was good), aggression.  I also became interested in and excelled in Art and Music in school which lasted even after I left school.  I became interested in God again.Now that I'm older, and bi-polar is suspicioned, I've heard plenty a story that Anafranil will not neccessarily make it worse (or as bad).  I'd reconsider giving this one a shot again.When I was a teenager on it though (due to the high dose I was on), my hands did shake some in the morning and my appet	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40664

I talked to my doc at the time and was told it had nothing to do with my weight gain..at that point I was up about 12 lbs.When I suddenly found myself weighing more than I did when I was pregnant I decided to take myself off of it. I gained about 20 lbs. I had a friend go on this med and she gained about 11 lbs--she no longer takes this either.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22624

I AM very sensitive to meds though-I only take 25 mg. of Luvox and 37.5 mg. of seroquel (for sleep and anxiety), so maybe I'M a little weird, cause that's all I can tolerate.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22340

Last year I went into a deep depression and the only thing that helped was this medication, but I had to increase the dose to 200mg.  At that dose the side effects sucked, very dry eyes and mouth and difficulty urinating.  Other than that no other side effects really.  This is the best antidepressant out there in my opinion if you can put up with the side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21306

anafranil	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	2005-03-17 00:00:00		1.5	0.5	2.0	1.5	Good Medication if you can't afford a newer ssri I took this med for about 2 years they kept upping my dose till i didn't feel like myself anymore more like a zombie.  I eventually tried 2 or 3 other ssri's until lexapro came out.  I've been on it for almost 2 years now at 50 mg per day and have not had to increase once.  No ocd side effects came back unlike on this drug and the lack of side effect in upping dosages was so minimal compared to anafranil that i would never recommend this drug to anyone.  Go with a newer SSRI's just as technology gets better so do drugs.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19953

anafranil	Social phobia (Social anxiety disorder)	2005-03-13 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	2.5	4.5	for panic attacks / social phobia and depression I am on 150mg a day (3 capsules) of 50mg 3x 50mg. Through self experience of using this drug, I found it to be extremely effective if taken on a constant long term usage as stated. The effectiveness of clomipramine will seriously subside if you suddenly lower your dosage or alter your dosage schedule. I went from taking this drug every day to 2 times a week, big mistake!. Go by what your doctor tells you. Altering the dosage of this drug can cause serious severe side effects. I stopped this drug due to personal problems without my doctors permission, example, stopped it without warning, again big mistake. If you suddenly stop this drug it can cause (in my own experience) severe nightmares, feelings of panic / anxiety, heart palpitations, sweating, fatigue, can cause your mental state to drastically fail. Apart from the side effects clomipramine comes with, it is highly effective, and for the time i was using it at its best, non stop, I felt on top of the world. Its exceptionally effective for me if i take it non stop for a week or so without missing doses. I have asperger syndrome, social phobia, depression and anxiety. When this drug works its best for me i don't really notice any of them. Clomipramine is quite powerful if used like it should be. Again go by what your doctor tells you.

anafranil	Depression	2005-02-25 00:00:00		4.0	0.0	4.0	3.0	Anafranil I took Anafranil for about 2 and one half years.  While it was the perfect  medication for treating my depression, the side-effects were horrendous. First there was the copious sweating , to the point where it would soak through all layers of clothing and even drip down my legs and soak my hair to the point where it looked like I had just come out of a swimming pool.  Very embarrassing!!  Then, I also had uncontrollable weight gain- I gained fifty pounds in two years- while dieting. I finally went off it when I started experiencing extremely rapid heartbeat upon even mild exertion. My psychiatrist, with typical tunnel vision did not want me to quit, but I refused this, pointing out that though severe depression was a potentially fatal illness, so were obesity, and heart problems.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19168
anafranil	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	2005-02-08 00:00:00		5.0	1.5	3.5	4.0	Anafranil (mylan) User Review Anafranil has been effective for the relief of my severe depression and OCD obsessions. Relief from the obsessions has provided appreciable lessening of the OCD-related compulsions. I've been taking Anafranil's generic (mylan) for two months. I started at 25mg 1xdaily. I'm currently taking 25mg 4xdaily. I have not noticed any drug related weight gain. I do suffer from quite a few of the expected side-effects such as marked drowsiness (especially in the morning), constipation, dry mouth, sedation, and muscle weakness. Although these side effects can be difficult to live with, I've found them an acceptable trade-off for the depression and OCD. I found that I could not live with the weight gain and sexual dysfunction that is typical of SSRI's. I've tried Prozac, Paxil, Lexapro, Celexa, Zoloft, and Wellbutrin (which is not SSRI). None of these have worked as well as Anafranil. My only complaint would be the severe drowsiness. I slept about 18 hours a day for the 1st month I took the drug. Now I sleep 8 hrs a day, but more because I'm back in college and have to go to classes than because I'm not tired. Feel free to drop me a line with any questions or comments about your experience with this drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18246
anafranil	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	2004-11-15 00:00:00		4.0	4.5	5.0	4.5	Pretty dog-gone good ! My son who was diagnosed with OCD last year was put on this. What is nice about it is that he uses 25 Mg. capsules which can easily be adjusted. He takes 3 of them before he goes to bed and sometimes only 2 of them. They allow him to sleep quite well and are very affective. He can still have a small &quot;slip&quot; while on the medication but it never seems to be as bad if he didn't have it. If you are not careful however, you can get too much which seems to have an opposite affect. I say this because I had him up to 100-125 Mg. at one time thinking he needed a little more and it appeared to worsen OCD symptoms as opposed to stopping them. This drug used with a little Ativan (1 gram) if needed in the morning or during the day works absolute wonders.Anafranil can be touchy however sometimes just changing the time you take it can make it better or worse. I found that giving it to him during the day is a no-no as sometimes it can cause a few unwanted symptoms. Taking it at night looks to work real well.Overall, I am very pleased with it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17065
anafranil	Depression	2004-08-24 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	4.0	3.0	Pretty good I was on this for years (combined with Sinequin) and  until I was put on Mirtazapine, it was the most effective drug for depression I had ever been on.  Unfortunately, the side effects were unpleasant (dry mouth, reduced sexual drive).  In fact, I had to take tic tacs with me everywhere because otherwise the dry mouth would prevent me having a conversation.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14930
anafranil	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2004-04-30 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	4.0	1.0	Anafranil etc. (Clomipramine) Clomipramine was one in a number of meds. that my Doctor tried on me to help with my disorder. The majority including this one had no positive  effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12335
anafranil	Bipolar II disorder	2004-01-08 00:00:00		5.0	2.0	1.5	4.0	Best AD I have tried The only antidepressant that has helped me so much. I've been on it twice and both times it worked. I had some bothersome side effects like lethargy, dry mouth, difficulty urinating but it seemed worth it. Unfortunately my doctor wanted to take me off this because of the side effects as he said  or because he wanted to prescribe something more expensive?). Since then I 've been on several newer ads but nothing worked like anafranil. I'll always keep that in mind for a period of crisis.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9905
anafranil	Bipolar I disorder	2003-07-01 00:00:00		4.5	1.0	4.5	3.5	Found it dangerous for bipolars The day after taking the first dose, I became hypomanic. The next week I was totally manic, with rage outbursts and the full symptom range. I didn't reported that to my PDoc, because I was not feeling ill... But after 5 days of restlesness, insomnia, fever I've finally gone to the ED where they've sent me to the psychiatrc ward. There, they stopped this med immediately. For me the main side effect was extreme sweating.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30313
anafranil	Social phobia (Social anxiety disorder)	2003-05-11 00:00:00		3.5	1.0	4.5	3.0	side effects, side effects, SIDE EFFECTS!! Anafranil made me soooo dizzy- when I stood up and other times. When I would ride roller caosters, I would black out NUMEROUS times- even if they didn't go upsidedown! I'm a dancer, so I could not do many things, such as bend over, because when I stood up I wouldn't be able to see at all. It also made me sweat like nothing else. I didn't know it was possible to sweat that much! When I took Anafranil, it worked more efficiently than anything I'd taken at that time, but now I know that Anafranil really didn't help me all that much. It started working fairly well, but I got used to it and it stopped being beneficial. I'm glad I switched off of it despite the terrible side effects I experienced with other bad meds before finding a good one!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6141
anafranil	Depression	2003-04-01 00:00:00		4.5	2.0	5.0	4.0	Great, but gained weight After trying various SSRIs, I tried this medication.  It was much more of a miracle drug than the SSRIs, which in essence just &quot;took the edge off&quot; my depression--on Anafranil I had the sensation of moving out of a black and white world to one full of vibrant colors.  But I gained weight, and even a two week diet of cabbage soup and exersise did not help! And with my back problems the weight gain is a serious issue. I'm going off trying other possibilities, but if I fail I may return to Anafranil.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5425
anafranil	Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; CFIDS; M.E.)	2003-03-28 00:00:00		4.0	2.0	4.5	3.5	Clomipramine in ME I have found clomipramine to help significantly with levels of fatigue, and the general &quot;flu-like&quot; feeling of ME.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5381

antivert	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2006-11-29 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	Antivert? I was given this medication 23 years ago for those dizzy spells, which of course had nothing to do with motion sickness, just hyperventilation.  I was recently given this medication again for vertigo, and of course this too did not work as it is supposed to be useful for those people who suffer from motion sickness, it is not helpful for the dizziness one feels during a panic attack, nor the spinning sensation of vertigo.  Side effects?  I guess I can say my mouth got a bit dry and perhaps the most useful side effect was that it helped me go to sleep at night.  Great sleeping pill, horrible for panic.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53349

antivert	Dyspepsia	2006-06-04 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	Very effective for  motion sickness and/or nausea An extremely effective medication for motion sickness due to flying, driving, and ocean travel that rarely causes drowsiness or other side effects other than dry mouth.    Usual dosage is 25mg/day.  However, dosage may be increased to as high as 100mg per day if needed .  For prophylaxis of motion sickness, 25mg taken the night before travel and another 25mg taken the morning of travel seems to be almost 100% effective in those predisposed to moderate to severe motion sickness .  If the patient already experiencing motion sickness with vomiting , remember that the medication takes approximately 30 minutes to one hour before becoming effective.  Take into account that the medication may not benefit the patient if it is vomited out within fifteen to 30 minutes of dosing.  In that event, a repeat those would be required.  Do not mix this medication with other motion sickness medications.  For vertigo due to inner ear disturbances, sinusitis, etc dosages as high as 100mg per day are beneficial.  Start with a low dose of  25mg and increase every two hours,  if needed,  until a maximum dose of 100mg daily is established .  Meclizine is also affective for dizziness and nausea related to certain antibiotics and other medications.  However, before using meclizine to counteract the negative side effects of other medications,  be absolutely certain  to check for drug interactions.  Most interactions result in increased concentrations of drugs taken concomitantly.  Review Antivert's full prescribing information or speak to a pharmacist before taking this medication with prescription  or nonprescription over-the-counter  medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/43983

I had been experiencing dizziness, vertigo and balance disturbances for several months prior to my MS diagnosis. In February of 2006, I began taking half of an Antivert 25 mg. tablet each night. Even with such a small maintenance dose, I can see a dramatic difference in the aforementioned symptoms. I was diagnosed with RRMS in March, 2006 and my neuro says it is completely fine to continue the antivert each night if it seems to help!! Hope this will help others w/ MS who are suffering from the same symptoms!! Take care and GOD bless!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/42355

Before using this drug, I had a great deal of trouble dealing with people and crowds drove me nuts to the point of panic attacks.  I do much better at these while taking this drug. My phobias and panic attacks are caused by a diagnosed inner-ear problem and this drug goes right to the source of that problem.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/20292

My panic is caused by an inner ear malfunction (Official Diagnosis by an ENT specialist: endolymphatic hydrops). I found this inner ear link through a book called &quot;Phobia Free.&quot; Meclizine cleared my anxiety within 45 minutes of taking the first pill 14 years ago and haven't had a single panic attack since.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/20290

Fortunately I have not needed to use this medication much since the vertigo and dizziness I exhibited with my ONLY major exacerbation has not reappeared. If I feel &quot;off balance&quot; due to dizziness or something, though, I take a single dose and it still works great! It may not work so well for others (as with any medication) but it works great for me!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4158

arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2009-11-25 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I was diagnosed with RA 5 years ago. My rheumatologist immediately prescribed Arava. I read about this drug, &amp; agreed to try. My hands, knees, wrists, ankles were so painful &amp; swollen that I could hardly move &amp; my fingers had started to bend. After 2 months on 20mgs daily the pain was virtually under control, the swelling was reduced &amp; the finger bending had stopped. Now, 5 years on , I take 10 mgs daily plus Milk Thistle tablets to try &amp; protect my liver. My doctor gives me blood tests on a 3 monthly basis, so far so good!  I have had no side effects up until this moment; although I'm still uneasy about that list of possible side effects. However, the ability to walk, move, go to the gym for 2 hours every day, drive thousands of kilometres to dog shows, show my dogs, live a normal life, is more important to me than what MIGHT happen.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61670

arava	Sjogren's Syndrome	2008-05-25 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	2.5	Arava has been one of the best drugs I have taken for my severe RA, and I've tried pretty much everything over the years including the all the TNF inhibitors, Imuran and Methotrexate.  Arava has markedly reduced my inflammation and improved my range of movement and my energy level.  The only side effect that I have had is diarrhea and some weight loss.  The weight loss part is welcome even if I had to tolerate the diarrhea.  I don't recommend anything to others because all the drugs work differently on everyone, however, my experience with Arava has been positive.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57887
arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2007-10-25 00:00:00		2.5	1.0	5.0	1.0	I started taking Arava in December of 2006. 20mg/day. It was prescribed to prevent flare-ups of Relapsing Polychondritis. I had a flare-up while on the Arava but my doctor said I should continue to take it as it probably lessened the severity of the flare-up. In February of 2007 I began to suffer pain like the bones in my feet were bruised and a 'needles and pin' sensation in my lower legs. I was diagnosed with moderately severe Peripheral Polyneuropathy, a condition caused by the nerves in the legs and/or hands dying. A web search of 'Arava polyneuropathy' turned up evidence that the Arava was the cause; about 2% of the people who go on Arava are found to be afflicted with Peripheral Polyneuropathy. There is nothing about this in the Arava literature. My neurologist is convinced that Arava was the cause of the neuropathy. I am off the Arava. I had no other side effects from Arava.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56796
arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2007-03-22 00:00:00		4.0	4.5	5.0	4.0	I love it! After 23 years of RA, with little to no treatment much of that time, I started Arava in 2006 after a second failure on MTX.  First it was combined with Enbrel (and a host of other non-RA meds) then combined with Humira.  I didn't think it was helping for about 4 months until due to chronic diarrhea we decided tofirst cut my dose in half (to 10mgs) and then switch to Imuran.   Within days of cutting back I started swelling, and I've never been a sweller. My pain levels increased a lot.  In fact, we ended up increasing my pain medication with little effect at the time. Still the diarrhea persisted.  I have to say it wasn't new with starting Arava, I've always had issues and was given a diagnosis of IBS at one time.  Switching to Imuran did not slow, stop or change the diarrhea in any way.  So, the next month I asked to go back on Arava given how miserable I was off of it.   Going back on Arava, it took longer to feel the effects of it again.  In fact, it's been 2 months and I'm still not doing as well as I was before stopping it.  I'm not convinced Arava is behind my diarrhea. I think it is just IBS.  Aside from that, the only side effect I have is a tiny bit of hair loss (which I never had on MTX).  But, I continue to take folic acid which my rheumatologist said I could stay on or go off of it.  I originally went off, but after noticing the hair loss I asked if it would help that to restart folic acid and they said it might, wouldn't help.  So, I take it.  But, to me my being able to move is much more important than if I'd lose all of my hair.  Hair can be replaced, moving with RA doesn't always happen as easily.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54530

arava	Lupus	2006-12-05 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	4.5	3.5	Arava worked for my joint pain I posted a review about Arava that I am now revising.  I started Arava a little over a year ago.  I experienced and continued to experience stomach upset and diarrhea throughout treatment.  We often don't remember how bad are symptoms are when they go away...at least I don't.  When talking with my family, they reminded me that before Arava, I couldn't even brush my teeth.  Arava is excellent for joint pain.  It does not help my pleurisy, but I take steroids to treat that problem.  My former employer, which I have a COBRA plan from, switched health insurance companies recently.  My new provider will not cover Arava, and I am forced to take Methotrexate now.  I just started Methotrexate today.  I am very sad that I have to quit taking Arava, as I felt that it was doing a fairly good job.  Arava, apparently, is just not economically feesible.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52396
arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2006-11-12 00:00:00		4.5	0.0	5.0	3.0	Liver problems, hair loss I was pleased with Arava at first--it restored my flagging energy level and made it possible for me to garden for the first time in three years. Only three weeks into treatment though, my blood test showed liver enzymes 4x higher than normal. Had to stop it at once. A couple of months later, I had hair shedding (a delayed reaction to medication) which was alarming. Liver is now normal and I'm on minocycline.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52521

The doctor decided I was having an extreme drug interaction with it as I was becoming increasingly lethargic.   After I was off the drug for two days I then began to feel much better.   Now, I will not take Arava again without being very careful and monitoring my energy level closely.  For me, as a medecine for RA it probably worked because I did not have a lot of pain while I was on it but the side effects were really severe and not manageable.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51327

arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2006-10-09 00:00:00		3.5	4.5	4.5	4.0	Arava has helped a lot over the past few years The past year of my life has been a rough one.  I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease, and my RA has bothered me more.  I also have a problem with urticaria (migrating hives).  I do not believe that doctors are educated enough about Lyme Disease, and how it affects RA.Patients suffer immensely, because doctors do not understand the symptoms of Lyme, and do not want to treat you.  They say you should see a psychologist.  It is so frustrating when you are non-funtional, and the doctors do not seem to care that you cannot do the things in life that you want to do.Until I got Lyme Disease, Arava really worked well, but now I have a rough time with my RA.  The swelling from the urticaria causes my joint to hurt more than in the past.I pray and pray that someday, somehow- a doctor will understand my frustration, and do something to make me better, and that I will be able to function again.God Bless our Troops and the USA.And people out there, please pray for me, and I will do the same for you.K-in Virginia	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/50944

I actually hadn't realised just how well it had been helping until he took me off it.  However I have developed what appears to be peripheral neuropathy, although I have other underlying health issues and we are not sure which is causing it.   Having come off Arava and being off for about 4 weeks now, I am back to day one with the pain of my RA. I am waking with every joint screaming in pain, something I am at the end of my ability to deal with.  This pain is awful!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49920

arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2006-08-22 00:00:00		1.0	1.0	4.5	1.5	Developed rash and had to discontinue Started Arava in May 2005 after failing on methotrexate.  I could not tell if Arava was having any effect on my RA.   Then my doctor started me on Enbrel along with Arava in June 2005 and after a few weeks of the Enbrel/Arava regimen, I started feeling much better, almost as good as normal.  I attribute the good effect more to Enbrel than Arava.  Dr. started me out on 20 mg/day of Arava but had to cut it back to 10 because I complained about hair loss.  Then a few months ago I noticed a rash on my forearms, along with some very slow healing sores on my face and body.  Discontinued Arava in midJuly 2006 and the rash is slowly disappearing.  Early this month dr. put me back on methotrexate, along with the Enbrel.  I really can't say whether the Arava did anything for me, I feel Enbrel is the drug that works for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48118

arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2006-08-17 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	4.0	Arava least of evils for RA I am extemely drug intolerant - liver enzyme deficiencies. Arava inhibits fewer of the Cytochrome 450 enzymes than some of the other disease modifying drugs.  It has been very effective for joint swelling and inflammation.  However, I have Autoimmune Vasculitis and Sjogrens Disease, so I have to take low dose prednisone and Celebrex in addition for more complete relief of my pain and inflammation.  The prednisone relieves many of the side effects of the Arava, which have included diarrhea, acid reflux, skin rashes - folliculitis and some Migraine symptoms.  The 20 mg dose was intolerable. It caused elevation of my liver enzymes.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47798

I had no stiffness, no pain, and was able to resume normal activities after about 2 weeks on it.  After about 9 months my hands, arms, legs and feet went totally numb.   I had an EMG to test my nerves and was diagnosed with Peripheral Neuropathy.   I was told to stop the Arava, and after about 3 weeks, I noticed a huge improvement in my numbness. My rheumatologist said that the same thing had happened to ten of her patients.   Its almost gone.   I was very sorry to give up this drug as now I'm back to sore joints and have to try a TNF.

The Dx was aplastic anemia. Through a process of elimination including the results of a bone marrow biopsy over 18 months we found that the Arava may have been a contributing factor. I've been off Arava since Jan 2006 and I have noticed only an occasional minor flair, usually coinciding with weather changes. Now that my HGB counts are once again in normal ranges, my quality of life has improved tremendously though it was not only the removal of Arava that affected the anemia. Transfusions and some major anibiotics were also part of the treatment plan for the aplastic anemia.Overall, Arava is/was a great help with the RA. I'm sure it will be very effective with fewer or milder side effects for many patients. I've dealt with anemia since infancy so there was a pre-existing circumstances that may have caused the aplastic anemia to act up.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/38875

arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2006-02-20 00:00:00		4.0	4.5	5.0	4.5	Arava review by Professor Arava is the only drug that has caused  remissions for longer periods of time than any other drug for me. Other drugs didn't work or side effects were worse than the cure. The side effects ( slight hair loss) are minimal so far.  My hair is very important to me and the few long strands that have come out are ok, seeing that I have been on Arava for a long time.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/38190

arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2005-12-22 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	5.0	3.5	Arava works but OUCH I took Arava for only 3 months and found great relief within the first month, but my hair fell (and is still falling) out FAST. I had a lot of hair and now it's very thin. I also had a rash on my body at the daily dose and had to go down to twice a week in the 3rd month. My liver function tests were not looking good either. It sure helped my RA but really had some nasty side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/34922

arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2005-10-17 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	5.0	3.5	Arava This medicine has helped my joint pain significantly. However the side effects are not fun. I was initially on 100mg x 3 days then 20mg daily. I lost 12 pounds in 1 month due to diarrhea (how pleasant, hope you're not planning to eat your dinner soon)! Then hair loss and hair color change. The girl who does my hair was in shock as it wasn't same color she had done. I went from light brown with highlights to this hidious brassy red. I guess this sounds pretty vain but it is a pain. Then there are the life-threatening side effects that scare the hell out of me. Just google Arava and you willl see some lawsuits connected with it and the threat of pulling it off the market.  Good news, my joints are much improved and I'm almost off prednisone. Hopefully they will be able to find a drug that isn't so tough on your entire body.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/28775

arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2005-08-19 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	A new life I have been taking this drug for 5 years and it has given me a new life.  After using various combinations of methotrexate, various anti-inflamatories, sufadiazine, prednisone for years and slowly losing funtioning I tried Arava. To put it as simply as possible 5 years ago I could not open the door where I worked or walk the stairs.  I just completed a 25 mile 4 day back packing trip (I didn't carry a pack) at 10000-15000 feet.  I even slept in a tent and was able to crawl in and out with no problem.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25943

In fact, my swelling has gotten worse, which I was not at all expecting! Has this happened to anyone else? My doctor just got me approved for Enbrel which I will begin in a couple of days. I hope that does something for me. I'm going to continue the Arava for awhile also since I'm not experiencing any bad side effects (a bit of nausea for 1 day in beginning and a bit of stomach upset, but not bad).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22998

arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2005-04-20 00:00:00		3.0	0.0	4.5	2.0	Arava I broke out in a rash of itchy tiny red bumps all over my body.  My physician thought the Sulfasalazine I was taking (along with the Arava) had caused the reaction. So I suffered under the Arava for another 3 days before I stopped taking it.  It took about 7 days for the itching to stop and another 3 weeks for my skin to return to &quot;normal&quot; (I was peeling sheets of skin for days).This Arava experience, along with a Methotrexate/Sulfasalazine hair loss experience, coupled with the 30lb weight gain from   Prednisone had left me distrusting presciption drugs.  Therfore, in Novemebr 2004 I stopped all of my prescription drugs and found more natural alternatives.  While I am not completely pain-free, I am about 90% there... and I have had NO negative side-effects from the supplements I am using.  I have changed my eating habits and have lost 15lbs.  For the first time in a very long time I have hope for painfree healthy life!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21597

I also changed doctors and the new doc does not like Arava because its hard on the liver.  I never had any abnormal liver enzymes because of it.  I wish I could go back on Arava.  This was the first DMARD that I was placed on.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21568
arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2005-01-27 00:00:00		4.0	1.5	4.5	3.5	Arava worked for me, the first time I took Arava (with Plaquenil and 5 mg prednisone) for about one year about 5 years ago.  It actually worked wonderfully until I had to go off of it when I decided to have a child.  After the birth I tried to take it again but it didn't work at all.  When it did work, it created stomach problems.  Half way through a meal I had to quit eating because my stomach would churn.  I lost several pounds (which was kinda nice) but it was a pain not being able to eat a whole meal without feeling my stomach turn over.  However since it significantly reduced the symptoms of the RA it was worth the gastric distress.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18284

arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2004-10-07 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	4.0	0.5	Arava and side effects I have RA and fibromyalgia for about 3 years now.  I was on methotrexate, sulfasalazine and then Arava.  Taking Arava was a mistake.  I couldn't eat for over a week and that was after I stopped taking the Arava.  This is a slow drug to get out of your system.  Even now, a week and a half since the last pill was taken, I can only eat small amounts of food and no dairy products or high fiber food.It is now almost 2 months since I quit taking Arava.  I still have trouble eating, my stomach hurts constantly and I am being referred to a GI specialist after undergoing an ultrasound and a ton of blood tests.  I only took this drug for 2 weeks. I strongly suggest that people talk with their dr before taking this drug. Serious side effects can happen and the FDA is being petitioned to recall Arava.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14986

I have failed so many DMARDS, that we are afraid to mess with this one!Expect to begin to wean off of this, when and if I am ever able to get off of Prednisone!

(I had a tummy tuck) I was out of work for 2 years, had a home health nurse for 12 months and a hole in my abdomen from hip to hip that took 2 years to heal...all because the surgeon didn't have enough sense to tell me to stop taking the drug before surgery.

It almost killed me!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7123
arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2003-05-02 00:00:00		3.5	3.5	5.0	3.5	Arava I switched to Arava from methotrexate because of the nausea the methotrexate was causing me. I was (and am) very happy with Arava because it had none of the side effects of methotrexate and the only adverse side effect I experienced was tinnitus in my ears. It was somehow exacerbated by the Sulfasalizine I was also taking to the point the tinnitus was unbearable, so I had to drop the Sulfasalizine. Arava is certainly better than NSAIDS, but no where near as effective as the new biological drugs (I'm currently on Arava plus Humira). I was a little concerned about all the lawsuits and hullabaloo over the 11 deaths Arava has supposedly caused until I discovered that more than 1.5 MILLION people have used Arava with no ill effects. EVERYTHING we take has some adverse side effects, and I think 11 deaths out of 1.5 million people are pretty good odds, so I'm not concerned about it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5955

arava	Sjogren's Syndrome	2003-01-21 00:00:00		4.5	2.0	4.5	4.0	Arava Arava was prescribed as a treatment for Sjogren specifically to increase lacrimal and salivary functions.  After the first month, I had ease in swallowing food and an improvement in dry eyes.  Blood work showed no adverse affects.  I continued Arava 3 months, had another check-up.  Blood work was fine but I was concerned about substantial hair loss.  I dropped the dosage to every other day.  In December, blood work showed my white count extremely low.  I stopped Arava.  My white count rebounded.  However, current white count level is extremely low again.  I am not taking Arava pending further tests/examinations.  I am pleased to see some improvement in my hair.  A recent eye exam to monitor placquinal effects resulted in suggestion to try flaxseed oil capsules 2x daily.  This seems to be helping the dry eyes which is one reason for trying the Arava.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4241

My rheumatologist suggested it after another medication failed to produce results.  I realize that this drug is for Rhuematoid Arthritis but my rheumatologist wanted to try it after reading about three patients that actually did better on the drug. I have not reacted well to Methotrexate, Imuran, Cellcept or Plaquenil.  I have been taking prednisone for seven years and have not been able to reduce the dosage without going into pneumonia or severe pain.  I took Arava for two weeks and saw remarkable results.  My shoulder and wrist pain was markedly reduced.  I have carpal tunnel syndrome and it has not bothered me at all since I started Arava.  It has even cleared up the horrible acne-like break outs on my face.  That did take a couple of months.One downside to Arava is that I am losing more of my hair.  It is so subtle that you don't notice until you go to blow dry your hair and there isn't much there!!  Another downside is the price.  Arava is very expensive and I thought that I was never going to finance this.  Health vs the almighty buck. Luckily I have insurance, but if you don't, the pills cost approximately $600 for 30.  I pay $189 and I have a 35% copay.  I am taking 20 mg a day and it has changed my life so dramatically.  I still have down days, but the Arava has helped me drop my prednisone from 20 mg to 7 mg without all the lung or body pain. I have been on Arava now for over 3 months and hope that this medication sticks.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1562
arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2002-01-26 00:00:00		4.0	2.0	4.0	3.5	Arava I have used Arava for the last two years. For the first two years I was very happy with the results. My rheumatoid arthitis improved better than on any of the 6 earlier DMARDs I had tried.I have lupus also, so take hydroxycloroquine also.Now I am researching new RA DMARDs, as my arthritis is making a slow comeback. Unfortunately, I have Lupus too, and that complicates things. But Arava was wonderful for me for two years. I was in extreme pain, with RA in my shoulders, knees, hands, wrists, neck and jaw. Arava absolutely brought that down to RA in wrists and hands only, and for a long time, I had little arthritis in my hands and wrists. Diahrria was/is a big problem, I take over the counter meds daily for that. I hope I can find a new DMARD as good for the next few years!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/692
arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2001-07-03 00:00:00		4.0	3.0	5.0	3.5	ARAVA Arava worked extremely well for the first 5 months after I started taking it..It lost effectiveness and I stopped for 6 months Started taking it again and it worked well for 4-5 months.  It helped my RA but the most noticable thing was it helped my very severe Fibromyalgia a great deal..Nothing had helped prior to this.  Caution arises as I heard of an Arava induced hepatitis from a friend who has taken it for some time.  I will keep up with the liver tests!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/413
arava	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2001-03-02 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	Great Success For Me I have been on Arava for three months and have had great results.  I have even gone back to work part time after 2 years off work!  I was afraid of side effects as I often have severe side effects from medications but I have had NO side effects from Arava.  It is expensive but when something works well it is hard to complain about cost.  It has given my life a greater sense of 'normal&quot;. Another example of the notion that different things work for different people.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/123

However, being on the 10 mgs has been extremely difficult, with extreme exhaustion, memory loss, serious flu symptoms and nausea.  This only occurred with the 10 mgs.  I'll return to the 5 mgs and hope I return back to the way I felt after my first week.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56945

After 2 weeks, noticed improved memory, less confusion, less feeling overwhelmed, less &quot;fuzzy&quot;. By way of a less subjective measure, over the past week my ability to solve &quot;difficult&quot; Sudoko puzzles on my computer has gone from 50% of puzzles to 100% of puzzles attempted.

My husband had several side effects (hallucinations, insomnia, etc.)  Our neurologist told us that this drug is rarely used in Europe any more -- as studies there have shown it to be ineffective.   I did not perceive any positive effect from the drug -- but I'm sure any effect would be difficult to observe.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53911

aricept	Autism	2006-01-10 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Aricept - medication review We have been using this dose for three years and have great improvements with no side effects. His social, raises his hand to participate in classroom discussions, calls people on the telephone, reading skills improved, word and information recall improved greatly. He has so much personality now. If there is one medication you must try it is this one or other Alzheimers medications. The government has just now started testing it specifically for autism spectrum disorder use. He was 13 years old when we began using this medication. We saw a total regression within two days after trying to stop the medication (we were temporarily stopping all medication due to Tardive Kinesis from antipsychotic medications). When he started taking the medication again he improved immediately.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35985

A lifesaver!  I still forget things, but I think I'm forgetting less on this drug.  It does not help with higher level memory recall of facts or information, but works very well to improve activities of daily living.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22265

aricept	Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder predominant inattentive type	2004-04-14 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	5.0	4.0	Aricept as part of an ADD &quot;Cocktail&quot; I have used Aricept since 2002 when I heard a Harvard researcher discuss its effectiveness with ADD. I am an adult female for whom a &quot;thinking&quot; cocktail was necessary to make the work day function effectively. The &quot;cocktail&quot; has been Adderall-XR 30 mgs in the morning with a &quot;booster&quot; dosage about 4-6 hours later (which varies) of Adderall (regular) followed in mid to late afternoon with 10 mgs of Aricept and 150 mgs of Effexor.The only negative side effect I have had with Aricept has been occasional lightheadedness. This comes and goes depending upon the amount of sleep I have had. I found introducing Aricept into my regimen enlarged the &quot;net&quot; of my thinking abilities; allowing quicker and more efficient processing of information. I have NEVER tried Aricept as the only drug I take.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/32782
armour-thyroid	Hypothyroidism	2011-12-28 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I have had hypothyroidism for 50 years.  When I was on synthroid every year when I went in for my annual check. I would tell the Dr. I felt was about 70% treated.  They would explain my THS is in normal range.  I would get a prescription for another year. After years of this another Dr recommended Armor Thyroid.  I now feel 99% treated.  I have been on it for at least 10 years now.	-

Eventually, I went to a hormone replacement therapist and they placed me on Armour.  I finally was able to lose weight and my hair is slowly coming back in.  Still experiencing sleep problems though.  Would definitely recommend Armour.	-

I had muscle and joint pain, carpel tunel, tendinitis, fatigue, hair loss, and brain fog. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia too. All these symptom are gone since starting Armour.

armour-thyroid	Hashimoto's disease - Hypothyroidism	2008-06-10 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	3.0	4.5	Armour thyroid works great, however what I find most difficult is taking it twice a day. I can take it in the morning an hour before I eat but there seems to be no other time in the afternoon that I can take it when I don't have food in my system. This timing is my only problem with Armour, otherwise it is a complete thyroid treatment and has helped me crawl out of a pit I was thrown into about 2 years ago when my immune system started attacking my thyroid. As of now I take 3 grains, 2 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57954

I don't see my Endocrinologist anymore but I will have my regular doctor do my blood work yearly including my TSH,T3 and T4 so far so good.

armour-thyroid	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2007-12-20 00:00:00		3.0	2.0	3.5	2.0	Somewhat effective for fibromyalgia pain.  Dosing is difficult to determine.  It takes several weeks to determine if a dose is effective yet not taking too much.  Causes anxiety and insomnia.  May be helpful to some with fibromyalgia.

armour-thyroid	Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; CFIDS; M.E.)	2006-11-09 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I love Armour I am taking 3 grains of armour per day and I will never take anything else. It has helped with my cholesterol levels and my hair, skin and nails look much better. My dr wants to test my Free T3 &amp; Free T4 levels to see where I am at with this dose. He said we may have to raise it a bit since I am still having low body temps when I wake up in the morning. I may have to add in another 30 mgs to my bedtime dose. Even tho my waking temp is a bit low, my temps for the rest of the day stay around 98.6. This is great since they used to always hover around 97.6! If your body temp is low, you can't lose the excess weight that you might be carrying. Once you find the correct dose of armour, the weight should fall off, unless you have some other hormone issues going on such as estrogen, progesterone or testosterone.I have also had knee pain and that's gone, too. If anyone would like some thyroid or other hormone help, go to these groups. http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/thyroid/www.stopthethyroidmadness.comHere's the Armour thyroid web site.

The serious side effects were one thing, but it did notgive my body all the thyroid hormones it requires to function and survive. I became obese, bald, crippled, and looked like a very old hag. After starting Armour (with adrenal support), and dosing Armour by symptoms, I became healthier and healthier, and today I am nearly back to the picture of health I was before my thyroid was destroyed. I have had no side effects from Armour other than getting healthy. One seriouly important thing I learned is that Armour works fantastically if it is dosed by symptoms and not by blood tests. Symptoms seem to be the way my body tells me what it needs.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52188

Well, Iwent to a Doctor who only does natural supplements. He prescribed the armour thyroid. He had to change it only once. The only problem was that he was so far away that I could not keep going. So I went into my family Doctor and talked to him about it. We all know that that each different Doctors does not hold high standing for each other. This doctor cuts the supplements down and the other one cuts down the doctor who gives drugs. I wonder which one is really right. Any way I decided to take a blood test, well when the results came back and the reading was perfect, my family doctor said he would keep me on the armour thyroid. It took a lot to convince him to keep me on the natural supplement. You still have to get a prescription for it, but it is one less drug in my body that doesnt carry all the side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/50888

It seemed to help for periods of time, then it didn't.  I changed to Armour 7-1-05.  The first day, it was like a fog was lifted from my brain.  I was so fatigued, weak, and with multiple symptoms by the time I switched, other than the clearer thinking things didn't improve very fast.  I've also taken .25 Xanax plus up to twice that a day for the last 3-4 yrs.  I've recently found out that that class of drugs interfers with Co Q 10 production and was supplementing with Co Q 10 , L-creatine, and Ribose for the last 5 weeks, before knowing about the benzodiazepine/co q 10 problem.  I feel better than I have in several years, and am trying to get off the Xanax, now.  My heart hasn't raced in some time, and palpitations are nearly gone.  Same with chest pain, twitches, tight throat, etc.  I  can't rate on side effects (I've been cut back to 1/2 grain, as my TSH got very low), and can't comment on long term use.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/27761

armour-thyroid	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2005-07-01 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	3.5	4.5	Armour can be a life saver! It is absolutely crucial that you have a doctor that will treat you by SYMPTOMS and not by LABS. When you go to the doctor with a sinus infection, you are sent home with antibiotics. The doc examines you and from observations decides your symptoms are indicative of a bacterial sinus infection. So why is it then that your thyroid doc does not treat your hypothyroidism by your symptoms? I don't know how many times I have heard  someone claim that Armour never worked for them. Well, generally speaking, most docs stick you on a dosage and don't tweak it much, thus leaving you undertreated and still hypo. Also, if just beginning thyroid meds, it is very common for you to feel MORE hypo after commencing meds. It's like your thyroid is saying &quot;Thank goodness someone else is taking over now&quot;, and further slows down the thyroid hormone production; therefore, leaving you feeling more hypo. You MUST, let me reiterate, MUST increase your dosage until symptoms resolve. If you are having troubles doing so from hyper symptoms (yet you are still feeling hypo as well), then you need to look at the state of your adrenals. Many thyroid patients suffer from fatigued adrenals and therefore adrenal support is also crutial. Most people will improve adrenal function as your dosage increases and you get closer to optimal. It's not always an easy haul to optimal (just as it was a long decline to hypo-hell), so be patient and you will achieve optimal health.DeniseTold that I was optimal on 50mcg of levoxyl and a TSH of 1.72. Dumped endo and found a GOOD doc and I am now on 3 grains of armour and 100 mcg of levoxyl with an almost suppressed TSH. Tsh was 6.63 at time of diagnosis.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24432
armour-thyroid	Bipolar II disorder	2005-06-06 00:00:00		4.0	2.5	5.0	4.0	Euthyral - thyrolar equivalent I took Euthyral (like thyrolar, a synthetic combined T3/T4 thyroid hormone). I felt great; lost weight, my hair grew again and I did really well on this treatment. My mood was really stable, and I was totally functional for the first time sice getting my thyroid problem diagnosed. However, I had to really press my Doctor to let me try it - here in France this is not considered like an appropriate treatment. HTe given wisdom is that  alone is enough. I did start to get some palpitations and so My Doc whipped me off it immediately, and put me back onto T4 alone. I still have the palpitations but everthing else is worse than ever. All I can say is that if I had the choice I would go back onto this treatment today. I really need that little kick of T3 to avoid the depression and mood swings.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23411

Hmm... I wonder now about being so allegic all the time (I'm on something for that too!)

I was on synthyroid .05mg for years.I have fibromylgia and cfids. Then a doctor put me on armour thyroid 2grs. It corrected so much of the fibromylgia and cfids symptoms. He believes in treating the symptoms and not just the tsh test. He also tests for free t4 and free t3. Later I took hydrocortisone 20mg a day for a month then 15mg for a month and 10mg for a month and 5mg for a month. I felt like a new person.

For anyone that is not feeling good after being diagnosed with hypothyroidism and medicated with T4 alone, I recommend finding a holistic or progressive doctor who will try synthetic T3 or Armour. And for people with CFS who haven't had their thyroids tested, do the same and get it properly tested (and that includes a good clinical exam - lab levels can be normal but you might still have hypothyroidism).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11893

Getting proper treatment for the thyroid with synthetic T4 and T3 (separately, to better adjust dosages) cured the anxiety almost completely (adrenal support was the other thing that cured it completely).So if you have anxiety, read a bit on hypothyroidism. If there are other symptoms, demand to be tested.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11891

My thyroid was still producing enough thyroid so that I did not show up as abnormal on the usual T3/T4 test.  However, my T4 was high compared to T3.  I have been trying different dosages of Armour Thyroid for more than a year.  It is only when I went to same total amount but split in half that I noticed any different.  There is more of a sense of well-being and a slight increase in feeling competent.  My thyroid antibodies finally went down (by 30%) since changing the dosing schedule.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6949

I believe most fibro pts. &amp; some CFS pts. will see similar results.Tried Armour &amp; went toxic twice.  This happens to a sub-set of hypothyroid pts. with Hashimoto's (autoimmune) disease.Meds that work for me are Unithroid &amp; compounded time-release T3, not regular T3 called Cytomel.Many docs will test your TSH &amp; say you are &quot;within range&quot;.  The test is a farce, &amp; docs don't know a normal range should not exceed 2.0 (new standard set by Endocrine Society in 1999).Only by testing Free T3 &amp; Free T4 can your thyroid hormones be accurately measured.  Endos may understand diabetes but are ignorant when it comes to the butterfly gland!  Getting a T4 med RXed is easy.  Unfortunately, many patients feel worse when it is the only drug administered.Seek out a good holistic MD or internist who does not rely on drug salespersons for a textbook.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3200

arthrotec	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2004-05-06 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	Arthrotec 75 I've been taking Arthortec 75 for several weeks. It's helped me a lot. I had a problem with nausea the first few days, and you have to make sure you take it with food. I'm not pain free but I can at least start to get on with life. Using the pain scale I would say I went from daily 7-8 down to a 3-4. It's also helped with the fatigue. I've had to stop taking it for a week because I'm having an operation on my shoulder and it can thin the blood. So the last few days I've seen how much it has worked and the improvement it's made in my life.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12465

My doctor prescribed Arthotec after I had no relief from neck &amp; hip pain when taking Celebrex, within a couple days I was feeling much better and after 18 months am still impressed with Arthotec.  Side effects are minimal - perhaps a little tiredness, but nothing that can't be dealt with, I still work a 40 hour week and take night classes.   No stomach upset, however I always take it with some food or milk.  I experience the most pain in cold wet weather, winter is the worst, especially when a winter storm is coming.  I can predict snow within 48 hours!!!  In hot, dry weather I am almost pain free, without medication.  I take one 75mg pill once per day, usually in the morning, it is effective for about 24 hours.

I took all the other drugs, entocourt, prednisone, methotrexate, all with no noticable difference. But with Asacol it definatly makes a difference. Not enough of a difference for me to be able to eat normally, I can eat about once a day, but live on ensure. Without it if I were to try to eat I would have horrible pain, nasuea, fever and of course the big D almost right away. I have had no side effects at all with Asacol. Im not sure I would still be alive without it as I would not be able to eat anything.

My doctor says I'll be on some dose of it for life, so I'd better get used to the idea. Asacol caused me to lose more hair at first but that has leveled off.

I still have the same symptoms (loose bloody bms everytime I eat or drink anything), except maybe a little less inflamation in the rectum.  I did take this medication while pregnant though and it had very little side effects.  The only side effect I have ever experienced is a bad headache the first day or two I start taking it.  I read a few research articles on Cannabis and IBD, so I tried that and this last flare-up was gone in days.

asacol	Ulcerative Colitis	2006-09-03 00:00:00		2.5	4.5	2.5	3.0	It might work for you, but... When I was first diagnosed I was on Salofalk. Even while I was on it, i flared every six months or so. Getting on SCD stopped the flares, and I was able to stop taking Salofalk. After pregnancy, I went back on the Salofalk and it didn't work.  Not at all.  I am now taking it in conjunction with azathioprine and the two seem to work fine together.  I have a friend who has been on Asacol for 20 years without a flare. I think for 5-ASA type medication it is dependent on the severity of the UC. If find that it is one of the more expensive meds I have to take. Partly because of the high dosage. Also, there doesn't seem to be a generic. I haven't had any noticable side effects. I think. The reason I say I think is that I have idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia and apparently aha is a rare side effect of Salofalk. So if I  did get that side effect I couldn't tell you, since I already have it!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48706

But, what I did notice is that the pills would not break down in my track properly and came out slicing my butt up.  I can only imagin what wonderful slash marks the Freddy Kruger pill (Asacol) made on my already sensitive insides.  Seems to me that Asacol creates ulcerations instead of preventing them.  Should have named the drug Asakiller. If the formula has changed since 2001 then maybe it could have gotten better, if so then good for you.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/43543

asacol	Ulcerative Colitis	2006-05-17 00:00:00		3.0	4.5	4.5	3.5	Asacol... the judge is still out for me. I find Asacol to help,  but almost more as a suplimentative treatment to SCD, and probiotics.   Its almost as though the medicine alone, with out the major diet shift (specifically SCD),  was just not enough to keep up.   as soon as I made changes in my diet,  and started probiotics, digestive enzymes and oxygen suppliment Ive made significant improvement.   pain is rare,  bleeding has stopped all together.   Asacol alone isnt doing it,  But if you're taking asacol, and experiencing only very limited success,  try hitting this from multiple angles!   I dont think I will keep on asacol,  or at least on the dosage I am on now for a long time...  if things keep steady i am going to slowly reduce how many pills i take, I just don't like taking medication like Asacol because I dont know what kind of side effects it will have in the long run.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/42839

I have been battling a flare-up for about 2 months now, and I Asacol combined with other therapies, glucocorticosteroids, has seemed to bring about small improvements, though Asacol has done little to nothing for the pain and the bleeding. I was in remission for 8 years, and I woke up one morning with cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, and it turns out that I once again have a flare up. I had been taking Asacol while I was asymptomatic, though currently it doesn't seem very effective by itself for the pain related to UC. I will say that the bleeding has stopped within the last week, which is a good sign. Anyhow, I think that from my experience this drug may or may not work. I took it religiously to avoid another flare-up, though I still had one, and probably the worst one I have ever had in my life.     Bottom line, it works when it works, but man when it doesn't it sure doesn't.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41489

asacol	Crohn's Disease -- Maintenance	2006-04-17 00:00:00		1.5	1.5	4.5	2.0	unsuccessful Relative to the other medications I've tried to treat crohn's, Asacol is one of the better ones, as it did have SOME, albeit little effect on my symptoms.  I was put on a high dose for about a month and noticed a small improvement in my condition, then all of a sudden woke up in the middle of the night with the most terrible neck and head pain I've ever felt.  The pain from a shoulder seperation or breaking my thumb couldn't compare to the intensity of the pain I went through for the next 12 hours or so.  Needless to say, I stopped taking Asacol immediately.Reluctantly, a few months later after my symptoms had subsided somewhat on their own, I agreed to try a low dose as maintenance, and about a month later started to experience gradually increasing head and neck pain again (though I stopped taking it before it got to the intensity of the first experience).  I haven't taken it since.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41148

It gives me severe headaches and a hand tremor sometimes and it hasn't been very effective for treating my UC (along with prednisolone).UPDATE: I was hospitalised in October 2005 after a severe flare up of ulcerative colitis. At the time I was on Prednisolone and Asacol, neither of which helped my UC to get it under control. The doctor at the hospital put me onto Pentasa instead of the Asacol, and it helped me so much.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7835

It didn't significantly reduce BMs. Instead, it gave me heartburn bad enough I thought my stomach was eating itself or worse.I stopped taking it the next day, and my symptoms improved. In fact, I'm back in remission.What helped? Cannabis. I've never once had a flare up while using it.

Anyway, within a day of taking it he got a headache, few days later stomach pains.  Headache continued til next appt (4 weeks), told him to tell doc i think it is the asacol, doc said have you had a bang on the head? Yeah, right.  Also he has been really tired, sleeping 10 -14 hours.  Last two weeks getting chills and sweats, went back to doc, ah, you have a virus, drink plenty of water and paracetamol.... great, finally friday night i had to take him to emergency, his color was yellowish and his ears and fingertips bluish, vomiting, shaking, breathing difficulties.  Near death situation.  Acute pancreaitis caused by asacol.  He had no major stomach pain but was sensive to touch on his belly.  In my opinion this drug is crap.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29308

It caused osteoarthritis.I had to go on Prednisone for nearly 10 months inJan. 2004. I now have cataracts coming on both eyes. Prednisone is a wonderful drug, but it doescause side effects!The thing with UC is it was caused by Turner's Syndrome that I was born with. Then UC causedosteoarthritis, over 1/3 hearing loss (both Ears),and Umbical Hernia.My rating of Asacol for Ulcerative Colitiswould be a 10! I kidd and say I have a love affair with Asacol.  I only take nine a day.Before it came out I was on Pentasa. I took sixteen a day, plus other medicine. I also have a love affair with a little purple pill called Nexium.Asacol has enabled me to so far not to have reconstruction surgery. I was diagnosed withUC in May 1994. I am 63 years old and still driveeven though I have been told Turner's Syndromemakes me age advanced.I have done so much research on all the subjects above that if you have a question regardingthem, just ask me.The MAIN thing is find a good gastrologist andFOLLOW his orders.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29029

asacol	Crohn's Disease -- Maintenance	2005-09-07 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Asacol is Good For Me... EFFECTIVENESS:I have been taking Asacol for about 10 years now.  Over the years, I have fluctuated the 400mg pills between 6 &amp; 9 per day.  In this time, I have experienced 3 flare-ups.  On all 3 occasions, there have been specific causes for my flares.  One situation was my physician's refusal to refill my Rx when I was pregnant~~ that is, pregnant with my second child.  He continued me on the Asacol durring my 1st pregnancy?? Hmm?? As a result of discontinuing, I flared.  So, discounting these types of situations, the Asacol has been extremely effective in maintinaing my remissions.LACK OF SIDE EFFECTS:I hesitate to aver my opinion regarding the 'possible' side effects of Asacol.  My concern with commenting on ANY side effects of ANY aspect of Crohn's Disease is simple; Nobody really knows the origin, cause or magnitude of CD!  There is such a wide array of symptoms [common and unusual] that can effect an individual with CD. I find myself always posing the same question, &quot;Is this a coincidence or is this a side effect?&quot;  I can't say that I have any side effects &quot;directly&quot; related to Asacol.  I have experienced some suspicious hair loss [on my head]and I have had bouts of anxiety and mood swings ~~ this could be representative of Asacol side effects ~~ or it could be a long-term effect of CD, prednisone, or even the hormonal changes in my body from birthing and nursing 2 children?!  Who knows?!EASE OF USE:Can you swallow pills? EFFECTIVE AFTER LONG TERM USE:After 10 years, I continue to rely on Asacol to maintain my remissions. I am working more closely with my physicians [new ones] to coordinate my treatment and avoid future flares.  I am pleased with my overall experiences with Asacol.COST EFFECTIVENESS:Even with insurance coverage, Asacol is considered a designer drug and falls in the highest co-pay category.  If I had to pay out of pocket, I would be in trouble!ADDITIONALLY:I also incorporate other treatme	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26950

It does not eliminate flare-ups but controls symptoms for extended periods of time. Currently taking 4 pills 3x a day with minimal side effects. Also take nexium to control stomach distress,combination seems to work well to control symptoms. Major flareups have been treated with Flagyl. It works but side effects are difficult to deal with. I have noticed increased joint pain since I have been on it, but could be arthritic crohns symptoms. My sex drive is also down since I have been on higher dosage, my Doctor has never heard of that side effect, but I noticed it almost immediately. Any one with similar experiences please post.

asacol	Crohn's Disease -- Maintenance	2005-06-03 00:00:00		2.5	4.5	3.0	3.0	So-so Started on Asacol and had great results after about 4 weeks and a week of severe cramping. After the cramping episode, however, I felt better than I had for nearly 10 years. That was until my first flare-up, which happened a mere 2 months after starting on Asacol.The great thing about Asacol, assuming it works well, is that there are virtually no dietary restrictions and/or adverse side effects. It is, essentially, a topical anti-inflammatory that is chemically very similar to aspirin. It doesn't tamper with you on a genetic level as is the case with such drugs as purinethol, prednisone and remicade. It requires little follow-up (e.g., blood tests).Biggest problem is that it is very expensive and it is not available in generic form. Although there are many 5-ASA drugs that are generic, the patented coating of Asacol makes it available only as a name brand drug (the coating times the release so that it works once it reaches your cecum or large intestine). The other problem is that this medication is usually given in high doses (for example, I'm on 6 tabs, twice daily... Indefinitely!). That's 360 tabs per month and that isn't cheap.As of now, I'm also on Prednisone and Purinethol and feeling fine. Although those are a mere $9 co-pay, I'm wondering if the Asacol is even doing anything to help right now... Guess that's another question for the doctor.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23344

I haven't experienced any flare ups.  I guess the goal of this med is to keep me flare-up free for  as long as possible.  If all goes well I will only need to see my doctor once a year unless something comes up.  Good Luck to all!!1/7/05  I was diagnosed with ulcerative proctitis a few months ago.  My doctor prescribed me Rowasa enemas for one month along with asacol 4 times a day.  The Rowasa really helped things to improve but the high dose of asacol was making me worse.  I went off the Asacol until I finished the Rowasa and then started up again with 2 pills twice a day and it has kept me in &quot;remission&quot;.  I felt so depressed having this condition at the age of 25 but am hopeful that a minimal amount of medication keeps it in control.  So far so good.  I'd love to hear from others with this condition.  It is so new to me I'm trying to learn more about it and find out what helps to keep it in control.  Good luck to all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17955
asacol	Ulcerative Colitis	2005-03-06 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	4.0	4.0	Quick Remission Asacol proved to be quite effective in relieving the intestinal symptoms of ulcerative colitis. By the time I agreed to have a sigmoidoscopy (I think was the name of the procedure) of the entire large intestine, with multiple biopsy, I was having involuntary bowel movements several times weekly. As far back high school, I remember dealing with pain and urgent trips to the bathroom. During the most severe periods of active colitis, the only medication that would stop the pain, and constant emptying of the bowels was Paragoric, which contained tincture of opium as the active ingredient. Needless to say, my expectations for Asacol were extremely low. My doctor gave me a 9 week supply of Asacol, working up to a total daily dose of 3200mg. At first I did not notice any side effects, though later in the course of treatment I was a bit light headed and had some ringing in my ears, though neither problem was serious. A side effect that did really bother be was rapid loss of hair. By the end of 9 weeks, Asacol had given me a feeling of constant bloating and vague burning sensations that were not constant and occurred in various areas of abdominal region. These side effects, with the exception of hair loss, were easily ignored, as bowel movements became controllable, regular and free of pain.  My first thoughts were that Asacol was not responsible for the relief. After 9 weeks though, I had to attribute the remission to Asacol. I had not had more than 2 or 3 consecutive weeks that were free of lower GI problems in nearly 20 years. I was to continue Asacol at a lower dose, after the initial 9 week, high dose treatment period. Because of hair loss, bloating and minor pain that developed in GI regions that I had never experienced pain in before, I chose not to fill my prescription, after my free supply ran out. About three years have passed, and I have experienced only minor problems related to ulcerative colitis. Of all things, I never expected r	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19690

I didn't get any of the stomach pain, bleeding, etc. that are listed as side effects. I DID, however, begin to hear a high-pitched sound in my ear that can be a side-effect of high doses of Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs...and it's serious if you don't reduce the medication. It is basically a hardening of the ear follicles that can lead to eventual hearing loss.

Then when I was placed on it again several years later, it caused me severe diarrhea and was no longer effective.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6537
asacol	Crohn's Disease -- Maintenance	2003-05-01 00:00:00		2.0	3.5	2.0	2.5	Asacol I've been on Asacol for 8 years.  I have had one bad flare up while taking it.  I don't really know that it helps all that much, have never really been off of it.  I get better results from Purinethol.  I know it works.  It's kind of inconvenient to take so many pills at different times of day too.  I'm in remission, and that could be part of it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5925

I notice the same frequency of flare ups on it that I do off of it, except that if I am taking it regularly the flare up may not last as long but it certainly has never put me in remission.  I am not sure why I keep taking it.  Have asked my dr to try something new and he won't.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5848

astelin	Allergic Rhinitis	2009-01-31 00:00:00		3.5	1.5	3.0	2.5	Astelin does work for the symptoms, especially stops my insane nose itching and running.  After about a week however, my mom developed a deep sore in her nose and I developed on in the top of my throat where the medicine drips after spraying.  We stopped the astelin and these cleared.   Sometimes, spraying it send me into a sneezing spell.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59146
astelin	Allergic Rhinitis	2008-10-18 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	5.0	So far, so good. Very expensive without coverage!!! About $90 for me with no insurance. I don't know what everyone is talking about with the 'nasty taste in the back of the throat' - I've used it as directed - tiltilg your head forward and then gently breathing in the spray, with no issues, so I am wondering if some people are using it incorrectly (like with other nasal sprays - head upwards and inhaling the spray more forecefully).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58501
astelin	Allergic Rhinitis	2008-04-28 00:00:00		4.0	0.5	4.5	2.0	Very effective but beware.  The drainage down my throat caused my acid reflux to flare up and I had to discontinue the medicine.  Considering ingestion can cause poisoning I think this medicine is a bad idea since there is significant drainage into the throat.Also, I started having really bizarre nightmares resulting in insomnia shortly after starting the Astelin.  It may or may not have been the Astelin causing the nightmares but it was the only change in medications this year.  I've been off the Astelin for 2 weeks but the nightmares are still persisting.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57752
astelin	Allergic Rhinitis	2007-12-11 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	Great nasal spray for reducing allergy symptoms. Works better than oral antihistamines for me. I also take this with Nasonex and together all of my symptoms are gone. The only bad part of taking this is the nasty taste in your throat when it drips down.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56988
astelin	Allergic Rhinitis	2007-10-20 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	3.0	5.0	This nasal spray could be the answer to your most desperate prayers. The drug starts working within minutes and relief last for hours.  I have suffered from allergies and asthma my whole life and nothing is more effective than Astelin in terms of relieving allergy symptoms, period. Of course there are side effects.  This drug will make you a little tired.  For this reason I try to only use it at night because it makes me sleep like a baby. Also, if you inhale the solution to strong up your nose you will taste the horrible bleach taste. This drug is better than Allegra, Zyrtec, Claritan and ANY other anti-histamine.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56773
astelin	Allergic Rhinitis	2007-09-18 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	5.0	I have chronic sinusitis and switched to this from Nasonex because I was having bad nosebleeds. It works well and fast. The downside is that I have to use it at night before bed because it makes me *very* drowsy and also makes music sound very weird (hard to describe). However, if I use it at bedtime when I wake up I am uncongested through the day with no side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56617
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2006-12-08 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Good stuff I inherited chronic sinus problems from my mother and have always taken different drugs, prescription and OTC, for allergies and congestion. Sudafed usually works pretty well when I'm congested, and Benadryl does the trick for the allergies, but of course with drowsiness as a side effect (I have used it quite a bit as a sleeping pill).As for day-to-day, though, I've never really found something that helps a lot. Most recently before Astelin, I was using a steroid nose spray called Nasacort. I used it every day for several months, but it didn't help much. My doctor gave me Astelin a few weeks ago and the first time I used it I could feel the effects immediately. On the Astelin web site, it claims to be the only spray approved to treat &quot;irritants&quot; which are a big problem for me. Things like cleaners, perfumes, and smoke. Astelin is also an anti-histamine rather than a steroid. I'm guessing those things are why this works for me when the others didn't. The only side effect I've noticed is the bitter taste if/when it gets in your mouth, something that doesn't bother me that much. Cost-wise, it's better than a lot of the steroid sprays, but still expensive. I paid $60 cash for a month's supply.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53661

astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2006-06-05 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	4.5	4.0	Pretty good I used this after reading about it on this site and in the midst of a severe allergy attack to grassses in the mid-atlantic region. I asked the doctor for this and singulair. I must say that together they worked, but alone I think this still is good. i did not have the same difficulty that some wrote about it going into the throat and tasting bad. I tilt my head slightly forward and spray and than pinch my nose once. Than I breath in harder . If I do taste it, it is slight and the bitterness doesnt bother me. It does make my heart race a bit so I try not to take it to close to bed time. More like 6 or 7 at night.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44049

I was sent to an allergist and he prescribed Astelin. Well, I thought nothing of it but I got a headache and I gave it a try. Poof!!! The headache was gone within let's say 10 min. tops!!! It's my miracle except for the nasty taste. Headaches gone everytime I use it!!! doc	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/43213

astelin	General food allergies	2006-03-21 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Works for Allergies &amp; Migraines Whether I'm having an allergy attack or an oncoming migraine, at the first sign, I use Astelin nose spray. This spray can be effective in adverting both sometimes 100% without the combination of an additional pharmaceutical. I have never had a reaction to this drug, and it works very quickly. It is non-steroidal, and for whatever reason the doctors seem to prefer giving steroidal treatments for the nose. This baffles me. Why take such a far reaching and damaging drug like a steroidal, when you can take Astelin ?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39769
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2006-03-16 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	4.5	Wonderful Stuff Old class of antihistamines were the only thing that worked for me until Astelin. Not yet available in Canada, but I managed to find it at an online pharmacy after getting my doctor to write me out a prescription.Pretty magical stuff, with no side effects. I've yet to determine cost effectivenss, as I have no idea how long a 5ml generic bottle will last. Only other factor will be long term effectiveness. It is an antihistamine, and condidering it is administered directly to the affected region I believe it will continue to work.A small piece of heaven, in a little bottle.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39451
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2005-12-17 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.5	4.0	It works! (And it's not a steroid) I've been using Astelin for just over one month and I've had a good deal of success with it. I've used many of the other Rx antihistamines and Flonase without much success. If I had to take one allergy med to a desert island (hah), this would be it.One of the biggest complaints about this drug is the taste as the drug runs down the back of your throat. It DOES taste awful. By following the directions carefully (sit down, or lean against a counter, tilt your head forward, and sniff gently) you'll reduce the amount of the spray that finds its way to your taste buds.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/34470
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2005-10-22 00:00:00		2.5	4.5	3.0	3.0	Ok, but not as effective as first 6 months I've been on Astelin for about a year and a half now and it isn't working as well as it did the first six months. Still need Flonase, and have also added Claritin too. Too bad.UPDATE:  Ok, now we're in the peak allergy season and a few sneezes have made their way through. Still, I'd say that for me Astelin seems to be equally as effective as the combination of Clarinex and Flonase together. So I've saved my body one med, that's got to be good.I've been using Astelin for a couple of months now and have to say I am quite impressed. Sure, it's winter still and not exactly the peak pollen season, but here in Southern California the acacia trees are flowering all over and tree pollen levels are &quot;high&quot;.  Normally a few sneezes would be making their way through, but Astelin must be working well because I have had no allergy symptoms.Another plus is that I stopped taking Flonase when I started Astelin (my doctor suggested seeing how the one nasal spray worked on its own.) Even though I know that Flonase is a safe corticosteroid it still feels nice not having to take it.Astelin takes a while to get used to - especially if you are used to taking a single pill once a day. There is something of an art to spraying it correctly and avoiding the intense bitter taste running down the back of your throat.  What you have to do is lean over and look down at your feet, then spray into your nostril aiming in the direction of the inside corner of your eye.  And you just breathe in slightly as you spray.  Certainly more tricky than just taking a casual whiff of Flonase, but once you have it down its not a big deal.Some sedation was noticeable the first week or so, but nothing that the morning cup of coffee didn't over-ride.  Now I don't notice any sedation at all.  I will update come spring / summer!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10483

astelin	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-09-14 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	ASTELIN : This gem you have to ask for So many times I find there are these perfect medicines that multi task for you. This is one of them. Astelin will stop an allergy attack in progress as soon as you are getting one, and its only a simple nose spray with NO STEROIDS. For some reason and I don't know why doctors have always loved giving out steroids ! No wonder some people don't know they are on them. they are literally in everything. Regardless, maybe the makers Med Pointe Pharmaceuticals don't give the doctors enough magnets and pens , I don't know, but this stuff is amazing ! Let's say I feel a migraine coming on, and I  get the BASILAR ARTERY MIGRAINES which are migraines with stroke symptoms, I'm talking debilitating you can't formulate words migraines, sometimes, if I take this nose spray within enough time during the aura of the migraine, I can ward it off ! And just recently I did just that and I didn't have any trouble with my asthma for the next 48 hours. My honey came yesterday and said, &quot;How come you didn't put the air conditioning on? It's 90 degrees ! Aren't you uncomfortable ? Are you breathing all right ? And I said I'm fine really. It took me a little while to figure out what I had done differently and then I realized yes, I used my Astelin the night before. I only use it once in a blue moon if I have an allergy attack or feel a migraine coming on, but now I know it helps my asthma too, and they say the air quality is particularly bad in New York today. Funny thing is, I feel fine !	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/27275
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2005-08-31 00:00:00		3.0	3.0	3.0	3.0	Mixed results. I've used both Astelin and Rhinocort Aqua.  The problem is that once you start a bottle you have to keep going with it.  I tend to have heavy periodic allergies, so I can use these sprays during allergy season when I need an entire bottle, but not regularly during the year.  They can be effective, but there are side-effects.  It does go down my throat and cause yeast build-up, so I try to rinse my mouth after I spray.  Also, the bottle tips become dirty fast, so you have to be careful how you store and use them. I once had a nasal infection from a dirty, older bottle tip.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26737

astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2005-02-12 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	4.5	5.0	Astelin really works! When I first started using Astelin, I simply could not believe how well it worked! My nasal allergies were gone and I felt way better. I have tried Rhinocort Aqua in the past, but it never seemed to do much. Astelin, on the other hand, is very effective. The only side effect that I noticed was the sligthtly bad taste that it produced, and honestly that doesn't bother me at all. The bad taste lasts only for a couple of minutes anyways. The benefits of Astelin are so fantastic that having a bad taste isn't even a consideration.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18745
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2005-01-10 00:00:00		4.5	1.0	4.5	3.5	Astelin The doctor prescribed this for what he called Chronic Rhinitis. It appeared to work very fast as far as calming things down, even the horrible coughing. The taste however is very bad and if it has gone down your throat, everything you drink or eat tastes like it for a while.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17964
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2004-11-27 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	4.0	5.0	Astelin for Allergic and Non-Allergic Rhinitis I was diagnosed 2.5 months ago with allergies to dust mites and a 3 weed mix (previously diagnosed with allergies to dust and 4 mold spores). My doctor put me on Rhinocort AQ, Singulair, and Patanol (the last 2 primarily for the dust mite problem). When I continued to have occasional symptoms, he placed me on Astelin. It has been wonderful! I usually take 2 sprays per nostril in the morning and 1 spray per nostril before bed. Yes, it does have an unpleasant aftertaste if some of it goes down the back of your throat, but that goes away quickly for me. I also seem to have either an angling problem with application or an obstruction of some kind because the dose will occasionally squirt back at me and drain out of my nose and down my lip (my doctor will perform a sinus endoscopy next month to evaluate it). I have also had problems in the past with non-allergic rhinitis - tobacco smoke, certain perfumes and cleaning products, and temperature and barometric changes. I have noticed that I am able to tolerate them better now on Astelin. This is especially good since I cannot always move away from a smoker or someone with an offending perfume. I strongly recommend that people try it!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17299
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2004-11-19 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	4.0	4.5	Pretty Darn Effective - Tastes terrible I was taking Nasonex from my GP, but an ENT put me on Astelin and it really works well. It's difficut not to get it in the back of the throat and it has a terrible taste, but that goes away quickly enough and man, is my nose clear in minutes and it stays that way almost all day! I don't expereince any side effects and all in all it's a great remedy.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17126

astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2004-08-22 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	Fast results I've had a near-constant post-nasal drip for the last 10 years. I was diagnosed with allergies in 1997 and put on Claritin. It caused my eyes to become so dry I had to go off, bounced around a bit and landed at Zyrtec, which I also recommend. However, the Zyrtec never seemed to get me completely clear. I just saw an ENT and she thought an anti-histamine spray would work for me; all the steroids caused nosebleeds. This stuff works great. I had to go down to 1 spray twice a day because I felt like I was drowning with two sprays, but once I get used to it I'll go back to two. One does work well, so maybe I'll use two sprays in bad conditions--high pollen days. The taste is bad, but I found if I lean forward long enough I won't get the taste. Besides, it's a great excuse to have a chocolate a couple of times a day :)! I highly recommend this for anyone who's tried everything.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14882
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2004-08-16 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	3.5	4.0	when i can stand it, it's great i have a love-hate relationship with astelin. it works fast and beautifully -- no longer do i spend an entire morning drenching tissues as my body produces enough mucus to float a battleship. generally, the runny nose is gone within ten minutes and the relief lasts a good long time. it works better than nearly anything i've found (i like allegra, but if i haven't remembered to take it astelin is a life-saver).but i only use it when i absolutely have to. the first time i tried it, the taste was so bad i was nearly retching (and i'd been forewarned by reading the reviews here). no matter how much care i take with applying it, i always end up with a nasty bitter taste in the back of my throat. i once accidentally tasted the bitter apple i use to keep my cats from chewing things, and this stuff is worse.i intend to keep getting it, but strictly as a backup.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14729
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2004-08-08 00:00:00		3.5	4.0	3.5	3.5	I prefer a systemic antihistamine... Basically this worked fine for me, but I have eczema and systemic antihistamines help with that (Allegra, Zyrtec, etc.) but this doesn't. Side-effects included nose bleeding and weird dreams, particularly if I used it right before going to bed.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14584
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2004-05-27 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.5	4.0	Back to Astelin I have tried numerous nasal sprays, including Flonase, Rhinocort Aqua, Nasacort AQ, and Astelin, to name but a few.Astelin has a terrible after-taste, but does seem to be effective right now, during allergy-season.I read an article that suggested dissolving 500 mg to 1000 mg of Benadryl in 1 oz. of sodium chloride and using that as a nasal spray.  I might give it a try.I've had on-going sinus problems, and it has recently gotten so bad that I totally lost my sense of smell.  Since being on Astelin (in combination with Zyrtec) it has somewhat recovered.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12855
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2004-04-29 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	4.5	4.0	Help with Side Effects Drug works well but need good technique and about a week or two of practice with the spray.  Keep your head down looking at your toes, spray each nostril once and let the excess run out into a tissue and wait one to two minutes before repeating with the second spray.  DO NOT SNORT THIS TO THE BACK OF YOUR NOSE.  It will fall down the back of your throat and you will then taste it.  If this happens, try drinking some cola, eat a piece of chocolate, or rinse with mouthwash.  ALSO, Try to use the product about one hour before bed time to let it dry before laying down.  Hope that helps.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12329
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2004-04-27 00:00:00		4.0	0.5	4.0	3.0	Had to give up! Tried it for about a month. It worked well but made me very, very tired. I reduced dosage to one spray per nostril - still tired. Finally gave it up and I have my energy back. For me, it just wasn't worth it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11718

Unlike Flonase which caused bleeding, Astelin worked for me without that problem.  The only thing I did not like was the cost, since I don't have insurance.  I have been telling people to try it for years!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10654
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2004-01-13 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	4.0	4.5	You've Gotta Try It! I was taking nasal steroid every day, allergy shots (for years) and Zyrtec-D.  Had to get off of the Zyrtec-D for blood pressure reasons &amp; it made me jittery.  My doc told me to try Astelin with my nasal steroid--wow!!She said there might be some taste but it goes away.  I never tasted it (I guess I was using it right).  I felt better within minutes!  It took care of my runny, itchy, drippy nose AND congestion, and it doesn't have the pseudophedrine decongestant that raises blood pressure and causes insomnia.Plus, it costs alot less than my Zyrtec did!  It is a 2nd tier (lower) copay on my insurance, and the Zyrtec was 3rd tier (higher).I've been using it with my nasal steroid, and have even been able to stop my shots (although I had been taking them for several years.)What I say is-Give It A Try!  Ask you doc for a sample and a prescription.  Be aware that the correct technique is important so it gets to where it needs to be instead of down the back of your throat where it could be tasted.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9967
astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2004-01-13 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	4.5	4.0	Updated Astelin information After reading some of the posts about Astelin, I think it would be helpful to visit www.Astelin.com.  There you might find some helpful information about the product.  Here are some answers to some of the questions I saw.  The taste does occur in some patients.  This can be alleviated by keeping the head forward when spraying Astelin into the nose and leaving it forward for about 10 seconds while sniffing GENTLY - don't snort!  You can pinch the nose together if it begins to drip out.  What this does is help the medication not drip down the throat which causes you to taste it.  Regarding sedation, some have told me that if Astelin makes them sleepy they will take it at only 1 spray per nostril as opposed to the recommended 2 sprays and still find it to be effective.  I also want to point out that Astelin is indicated not only for seasonal allergies but also for a condition called nonallergic vasomotor rhintis.  I take Astelin specifically for this.  This condition mimics allergy but actually is NOT an allergic reaction.  It is caused by triggers like perfumes, cigarettes, alcohol, temperature changes, etc.  Astelin works wonders for this!  I saw an article last year that mentioned that over half of the population might have this.  Allegra, Zyrtec and Clarinex aren't indicated for nonallergic rhinitis so probably won't help much.  Also, Astelin works on congestion.  It's amazing that a pure antihistamine can do this without being a steroid!  Plus, you don't have to worry about rebound congestion after using long term like you do with Afrin.  It's a beautiful thing.I also love how fast it works.  I notice that Astelin works on my congestion in as soon as 20 minutes!  I'm not sure of Astelin's coverage in other areas but here in MD I immediately noticed the lower copay for Astelin compared to the other pills I had tried, big difference!  Very cost effective.  I highly recommend this product for those who have tried an oral antihistam	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9948

Because it is a nasal spray (rather than a pill), it seems to address my symptoms immediately. My symptoms are generally itchy eyes, ears, throat (roof of my mouth) and ears.

astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2003-07-29 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	Astelin After having a cold 3 months ago, I've had constant post-nasal drainage and a nagging cough that nothing the doctor tried seemed to help.  The only thing that alleviated the cough was narcotic cough syrup (I'm allergic to the over-the-counter DM), but all this did was suppress it until I ran out, and then the cough was right back.  Our primary physician referred me to an EN&amp;T specialist, who prescribed Astelin.  I have been taking it for 5 days, and the drainage has been diminishing since, along with significant reduction in coughing.  I think it will stop completely within the next few days.  The relief has been dramatic.  Minor side effect of drowsiness the first couple of days, but less so now.  I would definitely recommend Astelin.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7314

astelin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2003-01-22 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	3.0	4.0	Most managable anti-histamine for me I've tried all major oral anti-histamines and many that are no longer on the market. I'm an perennial allergy/vasomotor rhinitus type of sinus suffer. Nasal steriods have been completely ineffective. Oral anti-histamines work to varying degrees but the side effects relegated me to only a very occasional, minimum dose Allegra. No different with Astelin - any more than one spritz a day per nostril and side effects become a bit too noticable. I've also notice that low doses keep it from dripping down the throat which seems to help reduce grogginess - certainly helps keep the horrible taste of this stuff from getting in your mouth. In  general I'm much clearer headed and have a higher energy level then any of the other anti-histamines, especially given the effectiveness. I am getting a general drying out of mucus membranes (on top of a very dry climate and thick mucus to start with) resulting in more discharge in the morning. So it will also get relegated to an as needed basis for my symptoms.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4286

In the whacky world of Benzos different Benzos do different things to different people at different times, because I have felt Lorazepam work before. But it is not consistent. The only consistent Benzo I know of is Alprazolam (Xanax), it works always on almost everyone. Mind you it is 2x as strong as Loraz so if you take 2mg of it, then take 1mg of Alprazolam... They make them as small as 0.125mg (extremely rare), one of the only Benzos to have such a low dose. Alprazolam comes in 0.125(very rare), 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg's. The 2mg is tri scored to so you can break it into 4 0.5mg. That may save you money as there is little difference in price between the dosages, Also; it is generic (I'm sure in the US it's gone generic too).

I know the difference between anxiety and real symptoms and the benefits of Ativan turned out to be its effect on the CNS...which is where my symptoms come from. Ativan is supposed to calm you CNS and that is perfect, because I think a calmer CNS produces less CNS based symptoms. Generally, when I am experiencing MS symptoms, I take an Ativan and with in an hour feel a reduction in those symtoms. It will also help you fall asleep easier. I take small doses, just enough to improve my symptoms. I had taken it regularly for over a year and suffered withdrawals when I was taken off it...and those can be a nightmare for a few days. The best way to avoid becoming dependent is to take only when needed...it really does help and is well worth trying.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61584

ativan	Anxiety	2009-10-07 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I was prescribed Ativan last year.  I was diagnosed with GAD and mild depression.  I've been going through a lot of worry with my runaway/drug addicted teen, and my other child with a disability.  It got to a point I couldn't fuction due to the excessive worry.   I was prescribed Ativan  I take it on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis 0.5 ml.  I take it on average of once a month possibly less, just when things are causing me too much anxiety knowing the pills are here and they DO help with NO side effects.. I can't say enough good things about Ativan, and thank the doctor who understands this helps me (another doctor won't prescribe it due to it being addictive).   I got 20 pills prescribed to me Sept 2008, I have 7 left (it's October 2009) - matter of fact I had to have my doctor call me in a new prescription today.  I am a big fan of Ativan.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61228
ativan	Anxiety	2009-08-28 00:00:00		2.0	2.5	5.0	1.0	This medication was effective for stopping panic attacks from getting worse. It is not at all effective for treating anxiety as a whole, as it is easy to just pop a pill and not use other strategies to deal with the anxiety. This all blows up in your face when you have to quit taking the Ativan, because it quits working after a while. The withdrawal from Ativan causes many of the symptoms that it is prescribed to treat. Withdrawal is hell. If you are thinking of getting on this drug to treat anxiety on a daily basis, be aware that it is extraordinarily addictive and that you will have to face getting off of it at some point. Also, it does terrible things to your memory.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60913
ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2009-07-28 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	I have been taking lorazepam since February 2009 for severe anxiety. I tried taking Effexor and it wasn't efficient enough so I took the lorazepam to supplement. Because I have not found a solid treatment for my GAD/Panic Disorder, I take lorazepam 0.5 mg once or twice daily. It takes about 30 minutes to kick in and once it does you will know. It really helps me when I feel really anxious and helps me relax. Also, when taken near bed time it can help you fall asleep a lot easier. One of the downsides is that this drug tends to be addictive for certain people. Also, it can make you pretty drowsy but it is worth it for me so that I can function without the anxiety. I have experienced no side effects with it, just get a tad sleepy. Overall, it is great.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60666

I am not sure why doctors are so reluctant to prescribe this drug. It's true it can be addictive, but in my case it was a life saver and even after 20 years of frequent (but moderate) use I could not find something that works as well. The side effects at low doses are very minor, but during a period when I took 2 mg /day I did feel more tired during the day.  Using it judiciously and  trying to eliminate aggravating factors can make a huge difference in quality of life.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60168
ativan	Irritable bowel syndrome - Diarrhea (IBS-D)	2009-04-15 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I was having IBS-D with pain, profuse sweating, itchy hands and feet, nausea/vomiting, prolonged blood pressure drop and fainting. In short, my vaso-vagal nerve was getting into the act and making my life pure he**. Ativan helps with the panic you feel when your gut starts to twist itself in knots. Normally, the panic feeds the pain which feeds the panic and so on. Ativan seems to stop this horrible feedback loop in its tracks. I was using the .5 mg sublingual tablets so didn't need to be able to keep anything in my stomach for them to work. Usually I only need one, and it works in 10 minutes. The most I ever took for one attack was 3 (1.5 mg total dose). These weren't the entire answer, but they sure did help. I was careful not to take them on a daily basis, because I'm told they're addictive.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59794
ativan	Insomnia	2009-04-02 00:00:00		3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	Ativan has been working for me for the past couple of months for sleep and anxiety.  Taking (3 mgs) an hour before bed (started with 2 mgs but did not work as long and the Dr. said I could go up to 4 at night) gets me to sleep every time and no hangover the next day after a few headaches the first week. I do awake at times about 2 and have a tea but then get to sleep for a couple of hours for a total of 6.5 or so which is not bad.  The constipation also went away with some fiber foods.  I then take 2 mgs in the morning for anxiety during the day.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59675
ativan	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2009-03-21 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	This drug was one of the biggest miracles in my life.  Unfortunately my doctor is so hesitant to prescribe it for me, I have gone without it.       I can not say enough about this drug.  I am extremely angry that I had to figure out all my medical problems myself, and then request this drug to my doctor.  He said no, until I would not leave without it.  I was right.       I suffered from 1.severe generalized anxiety, 2.depression, 3.severe muscle pain, 4.irritable bowel syndrome, 5.athritis, and 6.my penis was always shrunken like I had just gotten out of a pool of ice water.  2mg of ativan:  NO anxiety! NO depression! NO muscle pain!  NO stomach pain, perfect bowels every time!  NO athritis!    My penis and testicles hang low, comfortably, and long.  If there are side effects, I don't know what they are.       Dozens of specialists, x-rays, psychologists, psychiatrists, and years of my life later, I had to ask for ativan.  For me, ativan is a miracle drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59580
ativan	Insomnia	2009-03-02 00:00:00		3.5	4.0	4.0	3.5	Only been on this med for about a month but the advantage is that I get right to sleep with an hour lead time on taking, and have no side effects upon waking. Not sure if that will change.  I am only getting 6 hours.  Been taking 3 mgs which seems to be more than what other bloggers take.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59386
ativan	Borderline Personality Disorder	2009-01-30 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	0.5	0.5	Benzos should never be given to a person diagnosed with BPD. We are reactive and impulsive, especially when we are alone and fearful, are easily addicted and very likely to over-medicate with whatever we are given, and if that drug reduces impulsivity control and makes us feel good n' stoned, we may just eat the whole bottle and try to suicide, which I did not pull off, thankfully. Smoking pot can give you the same feeling without the worry of OD intentionally or accidentally, but you'd never catch a doc telling you to smoke a joint when you feel anxious. Though Ativan also inhibits mental function, slows reactivity, and makes you act like an ass, they seem all to ready to give you access to pills that you can easily OD on and end up drooling in a corner. No one seems to understand how dangerous it is to give to someone with mental illness, especially BPD, this kind of drug, and someone without mental illness shouldn't need it, so why the hell is it ever prescribed?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59136

ativan	Anxiety	2008-08-19 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	3.5	I took Ativan during chemotherapy.  It helped with the crushing anxiety, disabling sadness, insomnia, and, as an added plus, was good for nausea.  I took 1mg each night at bedtime, slept great, and felt much calmer the entire next day.Downside, of course, is that you have to get off the stuff.  Took me about six weeks to get down to nothing.  Now I take it on days when I have pet scans.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58244
ativan	Anxiety	2008-07-10 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	3.5	4.0	I use ativan when needed for anxiety disorder---it works really well for me, and I only need about 1mg...it shuts off the horrible thoughts, and calms me down.  I have used it off and on for years with no addiction.  Sometimes I dont need it, for mths and mths.......recently have had a relapse of panick and have been diagnosed with post traumatic stress.........which makes sense to me.........I think it has it's place, at least for me it does.  Here is Vancouver, Dr's prefer to prescribe things like anti-depressants, which for me work badly and make me like a zombie or go into severe anger......	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58059

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2008-02-12 00:00:00		1.5	2.0	2.0	2.0	What is this drug that I have just taken??? It surely doesn't help with anxiety, but puts me into a psychedelic haze with a feeling of confusion and amnesia instead. It's like pot (which now gives me EXTREME panic attacks), except no euphoria and no giggly feelings...just a drugged feeling. This detached feeling helps a little, because I feel disconnected from everything, but the apprehension is still there. Also, words on the screen appear to be shifting and jumping off of the screen. Very, very weird stuff. However, don't let my experience deter you from trying this medication; my body is a freak of nature and reacts strangely to lots of drugs, food, etc. God Bless.P.S. - Out-of-pocket cost is not the exact account; I don't remember exactly because it was filled a year ago.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57336
ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2008-01-28 00:00:00		3.5	3.5	5.0	5.0	Overall great medication.  The key is to follow an on/off day schedule.  I can go two weeks without taking it, with no withdrawal effects.  My only side effect was short term memory loss.  The reason I only gave it 7 for effectiveness, is because unless you take it all the time, which isn't feasible, you will still have anxiety if you have GAD.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57248
ativan	Asperger's Syndrome	2008-01-24 00:00:00		3.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	I use ativan as needed for anxiety and/or meltdowns. I try to take it when I feel myself losing control in the hopes that it will help prevent one of my ever so frequent catastrophic meltdowns and help me feel better, and my kids not have to deal with so much. I have no side effects. I am prescribed .5 mg but I find that 1 mg is much more effective.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57226

ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2007-08-20 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	4.5	Have been taking lorazepam 2.5mg for anxiety problems on an as needed basis for about 2 years now. It really calms me down during times of stress. The only thing I dislike about it  is that it causes me to be so sleepy, even a day or so after my last dose. Been thinking of switching to a med with a shorter half-life, because it is really starting to be a problem.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56481
ativan	Anxiety	2007-07-18 00:00:00		4.0	4.5	4.5	4.5	I have been taking Ativan for anxiety for over 4 years.  I take .5mg 3 times a day.  It has worked very well without any side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56300
ativan	Anxiety	2007-06-29 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I was prescribed Ativan (I got the generic Lorazepam) (1 mg ) to treat Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).I took it 1 hr before bedtime. This was to help me sleep through the night. It worked very well, I slept through the night with no side effects. It is not for long term use so I only used it for a month for this purpose.Two years later it was prescribed again for me to treat the extreme anxiety I was having while caring for my chronically ill mother in the hospital. I felt that I experianced a panic attack so the doctor gave me  30 tablets (1 mg) and said to take 1 in morning and one at night. This really helped me . I only used them as needed. A few days ago when I felt a panic coming on I took one and it ended the severity of the feeling. I think it works great to ease anxiety however it is only for short term relief.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55117
ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2007-06-29 00:00:00		4.5	0.5	0.5	4.5	In my experience ativan works quickly and effectively with little side effect.taken in low doses.  The only downside is if the panic attacks are very severe that they come in waves.Ativan only lasts 4 hours, thus at 3-4 hours another attack may ensue right away as the drug wears off, so a longer acting drug may be better in some cases.  Most of the time ativan is sufficient, however and shorter acting drugs are better for daytime because you can take it at work and still drive home later.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55114
ativan	Insomnia	2007-06-09 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	I have RR Multiple Sclerosis and take Low Dose Naltrexone at bedtime.  The LDN kicks in between 2 - 4 a.m. and invariably would wake me up with bizarre and vivid dreams after which I was unable to resume sleep.  Have been using 0.5 mg Lorazepam (generic) at bedtime for two years and this not only helps me fall asleep by relaxing me but helps me stay asleep, or go back to sleep after waking up to use the restroom or stop a crazed dream sequence.  I have deliberately skipped a nightime dose on occasion to see if I had become dependent for sleep.  Made no difference, except that I woke up around 3 a.m. from vivid and bizarre dreams and could not go back to sleep.  This was happening without the Ativan anyway, so I do not attribute that to dependence.  Have also used it for anxiety (1 mg every 4 hours) with no withdrawals upon stopping.  I guess it depends on the individual.  It works well for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54999
ativan	Bipolar I disorder	2007-02-15 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	4.5	4.5	Keeps Me Asleep Wonderfully I don't have a problem FALLING asleep, but I've always [since childhood] had a problem STAYING asleep for more than a few hours...I'm sure the bipolar doesn't help. :-PI need something that will stay in my body longer, and this stuff keeps me sleeping for about 7-8 hours.  I think it's wonderful.  I take it a few nights a week [since it's highly addictive and I don't want to grow a tolerance, either!], but it's great.It's also been very beneficial for my panic attacks when they get too bad.  I don't take it when I feel one coming on, but if I or my husband thinks of it during a bad one, half a milligram can really help bring me back down.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/43730
ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2007-01-25 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	Very happy Lorazepam has worked great for me, especially with my sleep anxieties. Helps me get to bed, and has also helped during days when my anxiety was getting the best of me. IMHO, personally a better solution than an everyday anti-depressant... as I really didn't think I needed that.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54129

All I needed was one experience with it to know that I didn't want to ever see it again.  I was given Ativan in the hospital for a panic attack.  15 minutes later I passed out.  End of story.  I didn't wake up until the next day.So yeah, it worked.  Stopped my panic attack cold.  No side effects...except that it put me into a short coma.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53778

I felt a lot more calm and tired enough to sleep through most of the flight down (usually it is literally impossible for me to sleep during a flight). the side effects (which I feel sometimes even when I'm off the medicine now) are dizziness, drowsiness, disorientation, and nausea.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53078
ativan	Herniated discs	2006-12-08 00:00:00		5.0	1.5	5.0	4.0	It is great for relaxing muscles. I find this great for relaxing muscles and have used it for years.  Keep in mind it is quite addictive, I had a hard time quitting once, I did for a year and found it really wasn't worth quitting. I was better off on it, hooked or not.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53724
ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2006-12-08 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	works 99.9% of the time I've been taking ativan for over 4 years now. I had initially started using it every 6 hours on top of my Rx for lexapro. After a few months I weened off of it and only use it now as needed. Recently I had a setback and my anxiety has increased in intensity and I've switched back to taking the ativan every 6 hours instead of as needed as the one a day as needed takes about 15minutes - 1 hour to kick in now and doesn't seem to have the same soothing effect that overcame me when it did take affect. The only side effects I experienced were when I had weened back on dosage and I did have withdrawal symptoms and a slight increase in anxiety, but it was manageable at the time thanks to the Lexapro. I'm still on both and an increased dosage of Lexapro to try to even things out. My personal opinion is to not become dependent on Ativan. As much as it helps I've also had the instance where I have to determine if I'm going out of town for a trip how much to take with me etc. and try to figure out, predetermine, my panic attacks, which in turn caused them because I had to think about them, then I'd worry, have to use the medicine then and decide to take the whole bottle on vacation. It definitely works, but expect anticipated panic attacks.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53712

ativan	Bipolar I disorder	2006-12-05 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Best thing I've Tried Yet! I am Bipolar I and I suffer from insomnia and anxiety quite often. My doctor has prescribed me Ambien and Lunesta for insomnia, both helped me sleep but with many side effects. Ativan has been much better than either, by far. It has also been fantastic for anxiety, and when taken as prescribed does not get me high. The only side effect I have noticed is, when I take 2mg's at one time I fall asleep instantly and have amnesia, but I need 2mg's to sleep. It is kind of a catch 22! I overcome my dellima by taking them in a split dose.Follow up:My doctor switched me to Clonopin for a month at my request, and I found that Ativan is still the best sleep aid and anxiety reducer I know of. The Clonopin made me groggy in the morning, took too long to kick in, and did not reduce my anxiety or the paranoia I experience when I am having a manic episode the way Ativan does. I have been take 2mg of Ativan every night for six months and I still find it very effective.Follow Follow up:Still working!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41909

The sertraline has been used rarely to reduce sleep eating disorder and has been very effective for me.

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2006-10-25 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	4.0	4.0	Ativan, The Good &amp; The Bad Ativan works efficently when you need it too. In a low dose form its peak of 20 minutes after taking is very effective for relieving physical symptoms of anxiety. However, if not accompanied by another medication for chonic sufferers the drug can be highly addictive. Even though the drug is not time released and its half life is short and it is excreted the same the drug taken in length can cause problems. Originally, I was on it 3-4 times daily when taken alone. After a few months another medication was added and I was able to only use it as needed. With the insomnia I suffered due to anxiety I was using another drug to sleep and it was very hard to function with it. Dr. Rx was ativan once at bedtime. A great answer to ease into sleep and not wake up in a haze however. I am not addicted to it. Trying to taper down is even more difficult. Anxiety symptoms are very hard to deal with and fighting without the ativan is not easy but manageable. In an attemp to stop taking it all together, Withdrawl symptoms after 10 days were unbearable and it was recommended to start taking it again. So, for now I am still taking it. It is a great drug however addictive.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51669

My doctor recommened Lorazepam, dosage .5mg up to 3x daily as needed.  I'm taking this more often than I used the Xanax, but I'm having a lot more physical pain this year (chronic headache [occipital neuralgia], fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome, interstitial cystitis, shingles, sinus infection, and just this past month, two surgeries).  I had just about weened meself off these, and recently needed them, so have been taking one or two a day for the past two weeks.  I'm not needing them right now, but they sure have worked well for me.  They don't make me terribly tired (although sometimes they can), but they really do take the &quot;edge&quot; off.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29495
ativan	Insomnia	2006-09-18 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	4.0	5.0	It works when used carefully Ativan has been a wonder drug for me. I took 1.5-2.0 mgs/day 10 years ago for 3 months and had no trouble stopping when the issues were dealt with and the prescription ran out. This year I took 1-1.5 mgs/day during a difficult period. I became concerned about withdrawal after reading some of the horror stories on the Internet and tapered over a 3 month period, reducing the dosage by 1/2 until I was down to .25 for sleep. I stopped with no side effects. I would recommend taking the lowest dose possible only when needed for anxiety or insomnia, tapering, and dealing with the underlying issues via therapy or other means. Ativan really works when used judiciously, alleviating the anxiety symptoms with no &quot;drugged&quot; feeling.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49576

ativan	Insomnia	2006-09-13 00:00:00		5.0	0.0	2.5	3.5	It works great--then it''s torture I was on Ativan for sleep and loved it, until I tried to get off. Then it was torture. The drug manufacturers put it in a tiny pill that can't be divided, so when you try to get off of it, you can't decrease the amount gradually.  Instead, you get this powerful anxiety that's far worse than the insomnia or anxiety you used the drug to treat in the first place. The seductiveness of this drug is unbelieveable because the effects are quite subtle. You take the pill, you feel wonderfully relaxed, you go to sleep.  Great.  Fine.  Wonderful.  No hangover, no drugged feeling.  But as soon as you stop taking it, or attempt to decrease the amount, your body goes crazy. I had heart palpitations, terrible anxiety, deepening depression, and obsessive thoughts that I'd never get off the stuff. Eventually, I convinced my doctor to let me have a pharmacist at the University compound the stuff into a liquid taper, so I could get off it more slowly. That worked GREAT and eventually, over a long slow tapering period, I got off it.  If you use this stuff--or any benzodiazapine--do not take it for more than a few days.  It is highly addictive and cause memory loss, confusion, and anxiety.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49322

ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2006-09-03 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Major help in controlling Anxiety I have GAD, and Social Anxiety, or Phobia. Ativan taken as needed, works very well for me. I take 1-2 Mg's, twice daily as needed. It doesn't make me drowsy, and I not had any negative side effects. I have been on this drug for 6 years. I take this in addition to 40 Mg's of Paxil, and 0.5 Clonazepam for sleep, if needed. I know Ativan is supposed to be addicting. I have been able to control the possibility of chemical addiction by taking a drug holiday from it, once a month. I take it for about 3 weeks, then gradually ween off, for a drug holiday of 7 Ativan free days, while doing the juice fasting thing too. The aim is to clear out my system. This way, when I start up again, the same dosage works as if Id never taken it, and Ive never had to increase the dosage over the years. It can be a little uncomfortable going without it, like feeling a little over heated and a slight increase in anxiety, but I just keep in mind the purpose and I'm use to it by now.I found it really helped with the side effects, such as increased anxiety and a spaced-out feeling from Paxil, which Ive been on for 4 weeks. It sure took my shyness or social fear away, so far. Have to see, its only been a month.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48718

I took ativan for about 3 months or so because i was having really bad anxiety attacks and becamse agoraphobic so i would take it as needed...well at first it was ok but made me feel spaced out but it never really took the anxiety away like xanax..if you have anxiety attacks that arent very intense then ativan would be a good choice but if you get the heart palps, racing heart, numbness, tunnel vision, i wouldnt recommend ativan...i also got pretty dependant on it because in my mind i figured it would always work but reality was that it didnt....try something like klonopin or xanax and for those people that have anxiety all of the time try xanax xr its less habit forming because the half-life is 24 hours and it works better.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48708
ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2006-09-02 00:00:00		0.0	5.0	5.0	2.0	Activan 100% ineffective Activan effectiveness was used for mild anxiety as my GAD progressed and and then fully diagnosed as GAD, Tranxene became the only effective med for GAD and as in studies documented in the UK in 1997 as the only effective med for GAD and despite the USA's belief it is not addictive and appears to dropped out of site(in the USA) for the use for GAD for reasons I cannot understand. I have found no other med effective for GAD which supports the studies in the UK in 1997.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48663
ativan	Anorexia	2006-09-01 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	The best medecation I ever took for 3 reasons Worked wonderfully. I was getting terrible reactions to food like dizziness and partial seizures, panick attacks after eating which the doctors found no medical reason for so they gave me Ativan 1 mg in hospital before meals then I was able to eat and sit still and the dizziness and headache and seizure feelings went away. It helped me relax and accept treatment. Also helped with the anorexic thoughts in that I could see reality, I wasn't fat, I needed to get healthy and heathy wasn't something bad. I know it's addictive but for the beginning of treatment when everything seems too overwhelming Ativan really helps. I could sleep finially too, it was great!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48627
ativan	Interstitial cystitis	2006-08-28 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	5.0	1.0	Agitated For me, all of the meds like Ativan have a tendency to make me very agitated since diagnoses of IC.  I'm not sure why it is but I become very jumpy when on these meds and I don't sleep well (which makes the Fibro worse) and have very strange dreams when I do sleep.I try to stay away from any of the what I call &quot;mood-altering&quot; drugs if I can help it. The side effects for me are just too nasty.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48451

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2006-08-24 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Great - Works fast for Anxiety I suffered from panic attacks and severe anxiety after I was diagnosed with 2 Pulmonary embolisms in my left lung. I think a lot of it had to do with the way they were diagnosed. I went to see my rheumatologist and she was dismissive  I thought I was having anxiety attacks then because I was hyperventilating but she said no my blood pressure was fine and there were no signs of anxiety other than the fact that I was having SEVERE chest pain upon inhaling and exhaling. I suffered two MISERABLE nights before calling my primary care dr and he sent me to the ER immediately and had them check for PEs. I then developed pleurisy and have a small pleural effusion in my lower left lung. Both of which are painful but dont require me to take the ativan very often. I rarely suffer from anxiety anymore but its because I know whats going on now, but the first few months were nothing nice. I understand that you can get addicted to it but just like pain killers I dont take ANY meds unless I absolutely have to. I never leave home without them but have not used them but maybe 4 times in the past year.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48210

I began using 0.5 mg in 1996 and over just the past two years, increased my dose to 1.0 mg per night for effectiveness.I'll get a solid 5-6 hours sleep (depending on my noisy neighbor) with no drowsy side effects the next day.There are two other side effects:  once in awhile I'll get a ringing my my ears that does go away.....I've also noticed that I do not have the short term memory I had 10 years ago, but I turned 60 this year, so I'm not sure if that's one of the reasons as well.

I took my normal morning dose, then took 1 more pill when I arrived at the airport, and 1 more just before boarding.  It helped me tremendously!  I wasn't thinking the plane was going to crash every minute, or think the plane was going to flip over with turbulence.

This usually means when I am performing.  I have taken Ativan before going on stage and after getting comfortable with a format or show I stop taking it.  The same with Auditions Sometimes I take it and sometimes I feel comfortable and not nervous.  Of course I only audition for commercials if I ever auditioned for a movie I would definately take it.To repeat myself the worst part is when it makes me feel sleepy instead of relaxed.But it works well as a way to calm down at bed time and then allows the Trazodone to work,I find it cost effective as I am on a drug plan and pay 2 dollars per perscription no matter what the amount of pills.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44783

Having both a long-term and fast-acting med has made all the difference in the frequency and severity of my anxiety attacks.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44573
ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2006-06-13 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Great sleep medication I use this as one of my two sleep medications (the other is Seroquel).  This is fantastic for calming the anxiety so that I can fall asleep.  I've had chronic insomnia for at least a decade, probably my whole life really.  This has helped so much!  It doesn't keep me asleep (that's what the Seroquel is for) but it really helps me get to sleep.  Thank God!!  I actually use this for sleep and Xanax during the day for anxiety because the Xanax doesn't cause drowsiness, it just calms me down enough to be able to function.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44555

ativan	Insomnia	2006-06-12 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	Ativan is by far the best sleep aid available! I've been taking 1mg Ativan every night for the past 2 and a half years to sleep.  I get a decent night's sleep and only feel slightly crappy when waking up. I'll tell you what makes me feel more crappy:  Going several weeks with zero sleep (and I do mean zero!), which I've done while trying every sleeping pill on the market as well as the holistic sleeping aids. Nothing works for me but Ativan. I recently tried to decrease my dosage to .5 mg thinking that I could probably fall asleep with a lower dosage, but nope!  Doesn't work.  I require the full 1 mg.  Otherwise, I'm up all night tossing and turning and unable to shut my mind off, just like with all the other stuff I've tried.  I'm almost 38 now and life is just way too short to spend tired and miserable. Those who suffer from chronic insomnia will probably agree that once you've found something that actually works, you stick with it because going weeks without sleep is far worse than having to rely on a daily dose of medication. Ativan has helped me. I'm sticking with my 1mg dose as long as I'm able to get it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44525

ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2006-06-10 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	4.5	4.5	So far, so good I take this on an as-needed basis.So I have been taking 0.5mg almost every evening to lessen my anxiety enough to where I am not completely non-functional and obsessively worrying about things.  When I get really deep into my obsessive-compulsive behavior (which is a halmark of my anxiety), I have taken 1mg.Usually the 0.5 mg calms me in about half an hour and I am able to function.  When I take the 1mg, I get really sleepy and pretty out of it.  But when I really need to be calmer (and not destructive to myself or others), it works well.I have noticed that my stomach gets upset after I use the 1mg (still worth it).  But other than that minor side-effect, it seems to be effective so far.It is actually quite useful and has little side-effects compared to other drugs.  There are virtually no long-term effects for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/42510
ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2006-06-09 00:00:00		3.5	5.0	5.0	4.0	Not as effective as diazepam I tried this for a year, after going off diazepam for a year. At the end of the year, my doctor told me I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown and asked me if I wanted to go back on diazepam (knowing I'd be &quot;addicted&quot; again) or try something else, risking having a nervous breakdown if the other drug didn't work. I opted for diazepam as I'd also tried Serax and had poor results. I didn't notice any side effects from this medication. It just wasn't effective in relaxing me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44362

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2006-05-17 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	Ativan Kicks Panic Attacks Butt(updated5/06) I've been on Ativan for five years and it STILL works wonders for my Panic Attacks. I usually take 2mg before bedtime to stop the obsessive thinking and allow me to relax and sleep but 1 under the tongue when the Panic Attacks come one and within 30 minutes I can still feel the anxiety and panic dissapear. I got addicted and was up to 10mg a day but had to wean myself back down to 3mg and am happy with that amount today. As long as I control it and don't let it control me (and it CAN do that VERY easily) I'm a -okay with Ativan.I am still using Ativan(lorazipam) for my anxiety &amp; panic attacks. It still works well although sometimes 1mg doesn't seem to do the trick as well as it used to. I imagine you build a tolerance to Benzos....also have used them for so long, I upped my dose years ago, weaned back down and several times tried to stop. One day and I was fine. @ days without caused anxiety &amp; panic attacks 10 fold along with muscle twitching and general ill feeling. Easy to get addicted to - tough to get off but they work wonders for my problems so I will probably use till I've passed on. Quick working  under the tongue method I still use. Hoping Dr will soon up me to 4mg a day as ^ years on 3mg /day has reached it's effectivness.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24769

When that happens I quit using it for a while and when I start again I find it works well again.  I don't remember if I had side effects to start with, and I started with 1 mg. not 2.  I have no side effects now and I find it helps settle my tummy when using other drugs that would make me vomit. After using Ativan for 14 years I quit for approx. 3 and I restarted when my anxiety began to go up again due to other illnesses.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/42635

I would hate to be on Ativan on any kind of regular basis, as it's addictive and makes me feel pretty spacy and tired. But it has kept my anxiety from escalating into panic, and helped end panic attacks. And I'm so glad to have something as back-up for when my anxiety gets too intense to be able to function in my daily life.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/42430
ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2006-05-08 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	my security blanket I used this medication whenever I first started to have panic attacks.  I would not leave my house except to go to school, and I had to have a pill on me because I was so nervous that I would have a panic attack.  At lunchtime I would go to the nurse and she would dispense my one pill (meanwhile I had one in my pocket for my own security reasons).  I also took it at night because I had those freaky nocturnal panic attacks.  Eventually my social worker and I worked on self help techniques so that I would &quot;need&quot; the medication less and less.  I would still carry a pill or the bottle with me, but I wouldn't take one.  I remember the first time I went into a public place and did not take one.  It was an indoor soccer game, and I didn't have a panic attack.  I felt invincible :o)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/42313

My doctor has prescribed me Ambien and Lunesta for insomnia, both helped me sleep but with many side effects. Ativan has been much better than either, by far. It has also been fantastic for anxiety, and when taken as prescribed does not get me high. The only side effect I have noticed is, when I take 2mg's at one time I fall asleep instantly and have amnesia, but I need 2mg's to sleep. It is kind of a catch 22! I overcome my dellima by taking them in a split dose.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41907

Once you've been on it for longer than the recommeded time frame (a month or two) it takes more and more to make this drug effective.  I highly suggest no one take benzo's for their panic.

I don't use it very often but I feel much better knowing I have it there in case I need it.    I also take .5 mg at night with Seroquel for sleep.    As far as side effects go, for me it depends on how much I take and also has seemed to be affected by what other meds I'm on. I used to take 1 mg -sometimes even 2, but when on lithium, wellbutrin, and seroquel... if I took a whole mg I felt very out of it and not in a good way, so I would cut my dose in half. I think it must have had to do with the Lithium though because I don't have that feeling anymore (off Lithium.) I have no side effects when the dose is right other than a faint strange taste/feeling in my throat.    What I don't like about it is that the dr.s are reluctant to give scripts for it and I'm always worried that my access to it might be blocked someday. I certainly don't abuse it (and honestly don't understand how anybody does) and I have not developed a tolerance. I've never had any sort of withdrawal side effects if I skip doses.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/8306
ativan	Insomnia	2006-03-24 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	4.5	3.0	Makes me depressed Lorazapam (Ativan) works great as a sleep-inducer and anti-anxiety med and doesn't leave you feeling drugged or groggy the next morning. HOWEVER, I have noticed that it makes my depression worse. I always feel slightly or moderately depressed the day after taking this drug to help with sleep. It takes a few days for the feelings of depression to subside. For that reason, I am not taking it anymore. If you have problems with depression, please be careful with this drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40033

I take one before a plane trip even though I don't think I'm going to have a panic attack. Since it makes me tired, I go right to sleep  and feel much more relaxed through the entire trip.I think this kind of drug is better for the phobic aspect of anxiety disorders on an as needed basis. My panic was daily and unpredictable so I'd suffer if one came on and I had to wait for the Ativan to kick in. I can't recommend any tranquilizer to be used daily on a long term basis.

It is very effective for this.However, started with 1 mg and sometimes had to take 6 mg.  Had to stop for several days about every 5 weeks for it to be effective again.  Of course, when not taking it I did't sleep at all.After reading about ativan here and being told that it was not a good drug, decided to try to get off it.  With the help of trazodone, I slowly weaned myself off over 3 months.  However, to do so had to increase trazodone to 200 mg/night.Am glad not to be on ativan now.

ativan	Depression	2006-03-05 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	5.0	1.0	Lorazepam / Depression Lorazepam was used to relax me, and it did.  It sedated me to the point of almost taking my own life.  I told my doctor's numse the day before (incidence to be discussed in a minute) that I don't think I can take this med. anymore because it makes me feel more depressed. My doctor was out of the office at the time and she said she was going to talk to him when he comes in tomorrow.  Why I kept taking it, I'll never know.  I took it again the next day, gave my youngest daughter her ring just in case something should happen to me (did not know that I did this either) This ring is hers when she turns 16.  Everyone left and I was sedated and kind of out of it and took more pills of other kinds and drove my vehicle in the garage and my oldest daughter found me just in the nick of time, got help from the neighbor(a paramedic, and his wife, a 911 operator).  So I guess my experience with Lorazepam is not good.  It can help others in a better way, but stop taking it at the first thought of suicide.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/36169

It works pretty well if you have mild symptoms and doesn't knock you out like some of the other ones, it also seems to act faster than the other benzo's ( although effects aren't sustained as long). If you don't have panic attacks/ or severe parinioa this might just be the ticket. I found it to be much more tolerable than it's big brothers like xanax ( the drug from hell). Withdrawl symptoms are pretty minor and it's a good starter drug to see if tolerate this family of meds. Like I said, my anxiety is assoiated w/ parinoid schitzophrenia so it's a little bit more than this guy can do for me, but if it's just a case of GAD, this is a sure shot.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/38453

I have been on it for almost 4 years now and my dose keeps going up because I am developing a tolerance to it.  I am currently on 3 tablets and 1 as needed and usually the 4th is needed.  It has been very effective with dealing with anxiety though.  For a while I was not able to leave my house to get the mail or to take a walk or go shopping.  I would wait until night time to do these things because everyone else would be in or sleeping.  After being on Ativan for 6 months I was able to do normal things again and it felt really good.  One year after starting I decided that I needed to go to college and get an education.  I ended up getting a 2 year degree in Computer Science, something that I thought that I would never be able to do.  Some days are harder than others but overall I am able to do things just like everyone else.

ativan	Bipolar II disorder	2006-01-26 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	4.0	3.0	Fine for a while, but ... I found ativan extremely helpful in controlling major panic/anxiety attacks when I first began taking it after an episode of PTSD after a serious physical illness in 1999. However, after a few years I began to rely on it on a daily basis, and it began to actually instigate panic attacks - that is, if I went more than 24 hours without it, I had near-constant panic attacks, and also had mild hallucinations due to the R.E.M. rebound effect. The main feature of this effect is that you can't dream during sleep, so you end up basically dreamwalking when awake. Not fun. I began stepping back the dose about three years ago, feeling that it made me &quot;not myself.&quot; I would find that after taking it, I did feel less panicky but also didn't really care that much about things that I otherwise would have, including paying my bills and doing well at work.The other disadvantage, for me, was that it masked the symptoms of Bipolar II (mostly depression, a little mania) that I suffered from but wasn't aware of, since like many people I originally went to a psychiatrist due to major depressive episodes. Eventually I ended up taking very large amounts of antidepressants (prozac and serzone) to combat the depression, and ativan to control the panic/manic episodes brought on by the other meds and my own body chemistry. I finally decided to stop taking Ativan last December. Unwisely, I decided to &quot;just stop&quot; not realizing how serious the R.E.M. rebound effect could be after taking it regularly for over six years. I had near constant panic attacks for several weeks and my first full-blown manic episode came with them. I am now ativan-free, and have been for almost two months. I would never willingly go back, since for me the combination of small doses of antidepressant during the day, and small doses of a mood stabilizer (seroquel, an atypical anti-psychotic) work better.I haven't had a true panic attack in about a month, and haven't touched a sin	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/37244

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2006-01-11 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	Ativan has helped me 1-11-06 UPDATEI stopped taking Ativan a little over a month ago, after someone told me it gave her heart palps.  I found this very odd, because I thought (and my doctors all said) that is was supposed to have the opposite effect.  But I have to say that the heart palps have subsided dramatically.  I feel more energized, and that the Lexapro is working better- to it's full potential.  This was a great drug for me for almost 4 years, but I am glad I don't take it anymore.  I only took 1 mg a day, I weaned off of it in about 2 weeks without any major side effects.  Original RatingI began taking Ativan about 4 years ago for panic attacks.  At first I was a little sleepy.  That is the only side effect I have experienced.  I have taken it for a while, but kept my dose at or under 1 mg/ daily.  I used to be fearful of becoming addicted to it.  But it allows me to live my life.  I can go days without it, and the dosage has always been equally effective.  There will be a time in my life when I don't take it anymore, but for now I do.  If this drug helps you, please don't feel guilty or scared about taking it. Nothing is permanent.  Keep your dosage under control, see your dr regularly.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29716

ativan	Irritable bowel syndrome - Constipation (IBS-C)	2006-01-04 00:00:00		3.0	4.5	4.5	3.5	Best Px med Generic lorazepam has been the best prescription med I have taken for IBS-C and anxiety, largely because it is the only one that doesn't have significant side effects for me and also is more effective for me than the other Px's I've tried (like the SSRI's and Zelnorm). It was especially effective the first few times I tried it, but (as with most remedies I've tried) it became less effective after that and becomes less effective the more I use it, so I try to use it as little as possible.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35597

I use this for a fast comedown or for panic attacks...which I haven't had a panic attack for years now thanks to klonopin.  I also use this for a sleep aid occasionaly.  Very easy withdrawl.  Non addictive for ME.  Again as I mentioned about klonopin....it hurts your short term memory somewhat and it does like all the Pams, it impairs driving.  Use wisely.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35576
ativan	Bipolar II disorder	2006-01-01 00:00:00		3.5	3.0	5.0	3.5	It works for awhile, but then stops working. I have been on Ativan (Lorazapam) for awhile now, and I have known that the effectiveness (sp) is wearing off.  I know that I have build up a tolerance to this medication.  My body builds up a tolerance real quick to opiods, benzodiazipines, and anti-depressant's.  Don't ask me why, it is just the way my brain works.  I have to change meds very frequently in order to have some relief.  Just a note that if you smoke and take Ativan, the nicotine will decrease the effects of the Ativan.  That is proven fact.  So, you people that smoke, like me at night before bed, wait about an 1 1/2 to take the med.  It will not work that well, if you take it right after you smoke a cigarette. This is just a for-warning.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31858

Relaxed, cool under pressure and nice to live with!I have not experienced ANY side effects so far. I have NO COMPLAINTS about Ativan.  If you suffer at all with anxiety- give it a try.  One pill and you will notice the difference.Good Luck	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22696

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2005-12-25 00:00:00		3.5	5.0	4.5	4.0	Early morning nightmares The two times panic disorder has really rolled into town Big Time and made me an emotional mess, one of the symptoms was early morning nightmares.  Starting the day off scared isn't very useful.  I found that taking 0.5 mg Ativan at bedtime really helped after a few days.  As far as Ativan compared to Xanax, there is no comparision-Ativan seems very mild compared to Xanax when it comes to suppressing panic.  So as an anti-panic drug-it didn't work for me.  But maybe because of its longer half-life than Xanax, it works for the morning nightmares.  If you have morning nightmares-do something!  They just make panic disorder more stressing.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35031

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2005-12-22 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	3.5	ativan works very effectively for immediate relief from panic. However, it made me feel drunk, and eventually had no effect at the given dose by the doctor. He explained that it is very easy to build a tolerance to it because it has a short half life in the blood. This means that it wears off quickly, and can leave you with rebound anxiety. this is what happened, and to get relief, I upped my dose on my own. I got relief, but was dizzy and staggering around with loss of coordination, breaking my best dishes, and ending up with bruises all over my body from falling down. I even had trouble talking. I had built up this tolerance and then I could not function without it and developed an addiction. I do not recommend this drug for long term relief, but it is a miracle drug and a god-send in an emergency situation. therefore, this drug should only be used under close medical supervision.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/34950
ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2005-12-21 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	4.5	Benzo tolerance. Hi-After many years of using this drug legally and not. I found this particular drug to be my hero and almost my cause of death.My first use of this drug was my first experience with any drugs of this class (Benzodiazepines.The initial course of tx was with a considerably smaller dose and ordered by a physician.....and I thought that my panics were gone for good. Well after a few months I noticed break through attacks. I took more than prescribed and after this cycle went on for many years.....my tolerance had built up to the pooint of not only didn't it work anymore ...? But I was taking a dose that was very dangerous ( 80-120 mg per day).I was also drinking on top of this large dose of medication. Very bad combo...!!! Can kill at much lower does with alcohol or other depressant usage with this drug.I had many blackouts of which I could have gone into complete respiratory failure and then coma and death........Story of mine is true and has a pretty good ending. I still have panic attacks. Much less frequent, I am off the Ativan and on a low dose of xanax ( 1mg TID )3 x per day and SerZone 600 mg per day.As a former nurse...I was lucky to live....fotunate that noboby under my care during my severe addiction days were harmed and I discovered something after all of this mess.....sometimes the tx can be worse than the disorder. Sometimes it's ok to feel the symptoms of panic (everyone does at some point) but for people with anxiety or panic disorder( Or both )?It seems unbearable........well I tell you this...for me? I have learned that learning to stop fighting the disorder and embracing it can be an amazing solution. Have you died yet? You have already probably had the worst attack you can have. Your stress hormones can only course through your body in certain amounts and for only so long. Everytime....you don't die and it leaves you feeling exhausted.Get off the coaster.......this is a great place to read about drug effectiveness a	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/34866

I'm able to drive, to focus on tasks, and it calms the shaking.  When taken at the start of a panic attack, it seems to go into effect quickly (about fifteen minutes) and calms the feeling of not being able to breathe.The doctor wants me to take it twice a day, but it doesn't seem to be quite as effective when taken that way.  I prefer to keep the pills in a keychain pill holder and take them as needed.  Otherwise, I've noticed that I have muted panic attacks - breathing problems that aren't so bad that I think I'm dieing, but enough that I have to focus in order to keep calm.I've taken this for weeks straight, then skipped a week, and it doesn't seem to cause any withdrawl effects for me.  After taking a break, it seems to be more effective.I have taken 2mgs at night for insomnia, but that doesn't help at all. I have noticed that taking 1mg along with 10-15mg of Ambien is effective... but, as I've said, this med doesn't work as well if you take it too often.

I was presented with a list of the prescription meds I had and refused to sign the papers before demanding the removal of haldol from the list-- even scratched it out myself. (You can find my rants on anti-psychotics, if you're interested.)The good thing is, that this med actually *does* work to bring depressive rage episodes (what someone might mistakenly misconstrue as &quot;psychotic  episodes&quot;) under control. Unfortunately, it doesn't work instantly, or even exceptionally quickly, so one needs to be in control of one's self at least to the point where they can quietly grumble, pace, talk, or otherwise distract themself until it kicks in. Also, lorazepam is one of the benzodiazepenes which can potentially agrravate depression.

ativan	Insomnia	2005-10-29 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	I LIKE THIS STUFF Even after trying Ambien, Melatonin, Trazodone, seeing a psych and going on Lexapro, not drinking for 6 hours before bedtime, etc my sleep problems were worse than ever. My dr prescribed Ativan on an as needed basis. I found it made me too sleepy to function but worked almost perfectly as a sleep aid. I wake up a couple of times a night still, but go back to sleep right away. I have also found I haven't developed a dependency, which is easy to do, simply by not taking it on weekends, when I can sleep later. So far, I am happy with it and feel no side effects besides sleepiness, which is useful. The anti-anxiety part of it also diminishes the anxiety I get when I wake up during the night.. It does, however, give me really vivid, sometimes disturbing dreams. This I can deal with. I just wish it had a longer half life, so I can sleep throughout the night without interruption...	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29698

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2005-10-21 00:00:00		3.5	5.0	5.0	4.0	Ativan for Panic Attacks A psychiatrist prescribed Ativan for me to use to combat my panic attacks while I waited for the SSRI (Lexapro) he put me on to take effect.  He told me to take a half tablet, twice a day as needed.  He said I could take more if really necessary, but I never had to.  The first time I ever took it was at the emergency room where I had gone because I wasn't able to calm myself down after a really bad panic attack.  The panic kept coming in waves and I was getting really exhausted.  The doctors gave me a half tablet, then waited an hour before giving me the other half.  It helped tremendously at that time.However, I'm not really sure how I feel about this drug for everyday use.  While it doesn't give me any side effects, it sometimes makes me feel a little loopy and/or more anxious for 10-20 minutes before it starts working.  It doesn't always have that effect, but just the thought that it might makes me a little wary of taking it.  I haven't had to take any in a few weeks, but I still like having it with me in case of a really bad attack.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29201
ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2005-10-21 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Lorazepam - 9 years I am weaning off of Lorazepam after nine years.  I initally started taking it at a higher dose  because of insomnia.  It works for a while then you need more.  I asked Dr. to put me on lowest dose possible.  That seemed to be okay for panic attacks (along with antidepressants) and for the insomnia.  However, this past year it quit helping altogether. So I finally am taking myself off of it slowly and have changed Dr's since he wouldn't let me wean off . Why take somethng if it isn't working. In the beginning, he had me on such a high dose that my pharmacist asked me if I drove becaue he wouldn't want to be with me on the highway.  That was a wakeup call.  That's when I asked to be on a maintenance dose.  I don't understand why Dr's won't release a patient. I guess that's another subject.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29186

It greatly reduced mental acuity and memory. Also, the withdrawl symptoms I got were not only physical but it stoked extreme paranoia and anxiety to the point of decompensation. The altered consciousness for me from its cessation was a horryifing experience. Once tapered off of it MYSELF after 15 years, life was much better. It was like waking from a fog.

We started out at 1mg x 2 daily and then went to 1 mg x 3 daily, and still had strong spells of anxiety for long periods inbetween.Finally switched over to Xanax XR (1 mg x 2 daily) and found that took care of about 80 - 90% of anxiety thru the day. Anxiety still seems to be there in the background, and still have occasionally spikes of higher anxiety - but don't want to increase to dosage of the Xanax XR.P.S.

ativan	Epilepsy	2005-10-04 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	For seizures and sleep I have been on this drug off and on for about two years. Many doctors fear to prescribe a class four drug, which has to be difficult. You have to have trust between yourself and your doctor. I was on Lamictal which NEVER allowed me to sleep. It took us time to figure that out, as for I had a lot going on in my life, coming off of Phenobarbital, divorcing a wife beater (two months after my first brain surgery), seizures etc. But every time we played with any mediciaction dosage, Lamictal just made it worse. I'd be up ALL NIGHT. No matter how tired I was. And sleep deprivation leads to seizures. I was placed on Ativan, lower dose to start to help sleep. Lamictal also made my heart pound. We all wrote it off perhaps as anxiety for me. So I took it in the morning too. It was wonderful to be a bit more tired for a change. But it still required a higher dose, which was just weird. After my second brain surgery, and noticing Lamictal was the culprit of me still having seizures, I came off of it and placed on another drug Topamax which finally made me tired! First time in my life since 2003 to be tired without 3mg of Ativan. I do still take .5 in the am and .5 in the pm for seizures while we see where Topamax takes me. I have never taken one drug that has taken care of my seizures except for Phenobarbital. We are trying every other route first, Phenobarbital being last. Even a surgical procedure not FDA approved yet, RNS. But I am praying this combo will continue to work.  122 days seizure free today, longest in over two years.I now have cut back to .5 at night and if I get any aura's, to take a .5 then to keep it from ever having potential from spreading. It has only happened about four times, but we don't want to increase medication dose too high if I don't need it other than two days or so out of the months. This is where Ativan can come in handy.Sincerely,Heather J Coburn	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26038

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2005-09-07 00:00:00		3.5	5.0	5.0	4.0	Ativan for acute attacks &amp; maintenance I first took Ativan in an emergency room, where I'd gone after 8 hours of what turned out to have been an anxiety attack.  They gave me 1 mg., then another when I felt no better after 45 minutes, and another after the same interval.  Within 20 minutes of the third dose, I was able to sit still, impossible earlier, and no longer feared I was losing my mind.  Subsequently, I was prescribed 1 mg. 3x/day and have taken it for five months.  At first I took it religiously, and the few times that I felt an attack coming on, I'd take one, then another in 45 min. if needed, and each time, that was enough.  Concerned about another doctor's warning about it addictive potential, and about its losing its effectiveness over time, I now take one when I get up, then as needed; when I have needed it, one pill has been enough, and I haven't had a &quot;full&quot; anxiety attack in three months.  I should add that I started Paxil for anxiety and depression, 10 mg. 1x/day, about a month after starting the Ativan, and I'm sure that has contributed to the lack of attacks and an overall decrease in my general anxiety level.  Still, I'd rate the Ativan highly for acute attacks, both for stopping them in the early months and for heading them off now when I feel rising anxiety.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26967

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2005-08-28 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.5	4.0	Ativan Ativan is great for lowering anxiety or stopping a panic attack in it's tracks. There are few side effects and it has a short half life so you can take it in the evening and wake up without that &quot;hang-over&quot; effect.  It's very mild but does it job well. Since it doesn't hang around in your system however, it's really only good for periodic use and doesn't really do anything to resolve a panic or depression problem. It's sort of a band aid fix, but it's a good one!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26516

I started getting really anxious, and I remember how much I hated the feeling.  My heart raced so fast, and it felt like my chest could explode at anytime.  There were times I actually had to pull off the road, when I would be driving, and wait until it passed.  My doctor put me on the Ativan for a short period, reduced my Prozac to 30mgs., and within a short time was back to feeling much better.  I guess you could say my anxiety was medication induced at that time.  It did make me a bit sleepy I remember, so I only took it when I knew I could lay down and nap, or at least close my eyes, or before going to bed.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26160

It did zilch for my bipolar and was nothing more than a sleeping pill that i was ADDICTED to. SO addicted in fact I could not sleep on it and I am pretty sure I was on a much higher dose than is listed here. After withdrawal, which was years ago so I dont remember much, I managed to get off of it. It never did squat for my bilpolar, depression, mood swings. It just helped me escape life and reality and sleep and become addicted.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25579

ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2005-08-21 00:00:00		3.5	2.5	5.0	3.5	Loses effectiveness I found that ativan/lorazepam helped immensely for the anxiety induced insomnia I've suffered from. However, over time, I needed higher and higher doses. It still helps me to sleep somewhat better, but it doesn't work as well as I'd wish it would. I can now take 4mg at once and not fall asleep, whereas I could take 1mg when I very first started taking the medication and be asleep in half an hour! I still take it, and try to keep it to only those nights when I really feel I need it. I also sometimes take a smaller dose during the day (1mg or 2mg) to try and stave off panic attacks if I am feeling extremely anxious. It does help take the edge off, a bit.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26028

ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2005-06-29 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	5.0	1.0	Ativan Nightmare! Oh-my-goodness!!!  Ativan was prescribed for me 26 years ago... a year and a half before I was diagnosed with GAD.  I had been short of breath for weeks and had an audible wheeze.  One day my breathing became so difficult that I thought I would literally die.  A friend rushed me up to my doctor who told me my lungs were fine and that I was hyperventilating.  Ativan was the newest &quot;feel good&quot; drug on the market.  It was &quot;all in my head&quot;... he sent me home with the drug. At first Ativan did nothing but make a zombie of me... I still had trouble breathing.  After several more visits to the doctor, I was finally convinced that he was right... wheeze or not.  I continued taking Ativan and I continued increasing the dose.  The doctor never once questioned me about the frequency of my refills... not once!!  I was hopelessly addicted and feeling like a burden to my family and society in general.  If I recall, I was taking about 10 mg daily before my husband made an appointment with an asthma/allergy specialist, against my will.  The specialist made a speedy diagnosis of severe status asthma and immediately hospitalized me.  After several months of getting the asthma stabilized, I was hospitalized for detox.  It was, my doctor said, as bad as any heroin withdrawal he had ever seen. It almost killed me.  Quite awhile after that it was determined that I suffered from severe panic attacks in addition to asthma.  I've always wondered if it was the Ativan that caused my GAD... or if the onset of both ailments came at the same time, but for years I could not distinguish between an asthma attack and a panic attack. Thank God that is behind me. (apologies for the lack of brevity)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24342
ativan	Insomnia	2005-06-23 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	Ativan I have always, well at least since about the age of 19, had periodic problems getting to sleep.  Once I reached my 40's, sleep maintenance became a periodic problem. For some reason at the age of 51 I developed chronic insomnia.  After 2 weeks, I went to see my PCP and she prescibed this low dose of Ativan (1 mg. at bedtime) and it has worked well for the past 2 years in getting me to sleep, keeping me asleep and even making it easy for me to get back to sleep when I have to give up to go to the bathroom.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24119
ativan	Antidepressant dependence / withdrawal	2005-06-23 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	Ativan This drug is very dangerous if used more than just a few days.  I was prescribed this drug and stayed on it for about three months and at the lowest dose possible.  I then found myself in a world of hurt as I came off the drug.  If you want to know about the affects of this drug, just do a search for ativan addiction on google.  You will not only walk but run fast from this one. My ratings show all zero, because in the long run you could possibly suffer extremely bad consequences.  Do your own research.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24110
ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2005-06-23 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	Immediate relief  and no sedation Started in Ativan in 1992 when dignosed with GAD. So many people are worried about getting addicted to it which if taken as prescribed will not happen. After years of taking it daily it got to the point where I'd only take it as needed which was on my way to work or if I anticipated a confrontation. There would be days I'd need two doses but they were few and far between. The only downsides i've found are that I noticed that I was becoming more forgetful(but this is a s/e of long term use of any anti-anxiety drug). Originally tied Buspar which did absolutely nothing to help the GAD. I keep a supply on hand always! Thought I'd try to see how xanax compares so am trying a trial. So far both work the same but with the xanax can actually feel a slight buzz which never had with the Ativan. Be careful with the xanax as they are the most addictive and abused of the benzodiazepines(valium, ativan, klonopin and transxene)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24097

My anorexia and bulimia was out of control at this point and this drug did help me to eat like a regular person. However, I stopped taking it before meals because I was gaining weight, so I began taking it at bedtime instead. It really helped me destress about the assignments and tests I had due and sleep through the night despite some of my manic tendencies. I recommend Ativan for any anxiety situations, but caution that it is addictive.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24087

While I was in the hospital each time (twice) for pulmonary embolism, I was given Ativan intravenously to calm down, as my blood pressure and heart rate would skyrocket due to my fear of death and hypochondria.  Then, as the PTSD set in, I was given a prescription, as well as given doses while inpatient at the psychiatric ward.  I tried Xanax, but it really didn't do anything for me.  I liked Lorazepam, but my new pyschiatrist doesn't prescribe it.  That's okay, I'm hoping my need for it will decrease or go away with the Topamax.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23857

I started the Lexapro almost 3 weeks ago for anxiety and I was also prescribed Ativan for it too by my OBGYN. I find that the insomnia that I had is different from what I have now. Before I had a hard time getting to sleep, but since I've taken the Lexapro the problem is staying asleep. Something I've never had before. The Ativan has helped in staying asleep. I hope this side effect goes away soon, since most of my anxiety was from the ( then )  short term insomnia.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23534

I was on it for about 5 weeks and it didn't have any negative side effects.  I was able to drive a car and do all my normal activities with no problems.  I suggest for newbies to the medicine to take it at night if you are taking a 1x/day dose because it can help with sleeping.  No side effects and a calmer mood.

Side effects were dry mouth, extreme tiredness and just a general feeling of weirdness. Anyway, this is powerful stuff and calms me down within 15-20 minutes. I just love it. I have had panic and anxiety all of my life and no other doctors would touch me with the ativan. Obviously it was what I needed as I feel great now. The only problem I see is that you have to take more of it because your body starts getting used to it after a while.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23027
ativan	Bipolar I disorder	2005-05-05 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	I sleep like a baby, but addictive I use this med for sleeping problems, prescribed during a hospital stay for bipolar disorder.  It works like a charm:  one pill before bed, and I generally sleep all night, sometimes without waking at all, wake up feeling refreshed and without hangover effects.  Big change from my light sleeping, insomniatic days.  THe problem is, I do build up a tolerance for it, so I need to take higher and higher doses, and I also feel like I can't sleep without it.  Actually, I can't sleep without it.  I have to taper off very slowly, like 1/8-1/16th of a pill reduction every few days.  Otherwise I panic and can't sleep at all.  After I taper off completely, I'm fine (mildy insomniatic, which is usual for me).  But as soon as I start taking it at all again, I sleep so well that I use it again the next night, and again the next...and I'm hooked again.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39071

ativan	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	2005-04-28 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.0	4.5	Extremely effective I have taken Ativan at two times in my life: the 1mg dose, and 0.5mg sublingual tablet. It's always been very friendly to me (if such a thing can be said about a pill) whenever I go nuts with anxiety. It quickly and effectively handles both the physical and mental symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks. I notice a very clear reduction in obsessive thinking and general negativity 15 minutes after taking it, and an overall feeling of calmness and peace in my body. It does wonders for my mood too, but this isn't surprising since in my case, the two things are inextricably linked.I can't say too much about tolerance build-up, as I've only taken the minimum doses for a few days at a time. I wouldn't want this drug to quit working for me, so I save it for when things are really bad.I've experienced virtually no side effects from this drug, asides from transient drowsiness.Highly recommended, but I doubt this is a long term solution to any problem.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22132

Try any of these instead: GABA, Taurine, B-complex with C, Zinc, Magnesium, B-6, Scullcap, Passionflower, Catnip, Chamomile, Hops, Valerian (habit-forming), Rescue Remedy, Yoga, Meditation, Reflexology, etc.  If you have been taking Ativan for more than a month and want to stop, please work with a healthcare provider and taper off SLOWLY.  The above remedies are helping me with the withdrawal symptoms and my insomnia/anxiety, and could help you too.  Good luck!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22023

ativan	Insomnia	2005-04-25 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	Ativan for insomnia I have been using ativan for about a year now and I have noticed that taking 3mg at night barely touches me.  I am able to get about 5 hours of sleep each night.  I know that my body has become tolerant to the medication, but I am not about to increase the dosage to get the same effect I had when I first started the drug.  I think that long term use of benzo's is okay if you take the right dosage and not increase the amount.  It might be wise to talk to your Dr. to see if a another medicine or combination of the two might work better.  I have found that taking Celexa and Ativan together work wonders.  I take Celexa in the morning and at night and they work well together.  If you are on Celexa and take it twice a day, try and take the second dose around bedtime with your sleeper and see if that helps you.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21879

It begins to work within an hour and wears off within two hours - so it is easy to keep a working level of the stuff in my bloodstream.I have had many psycho-active drugs thrown at me over the years; most I do not tolerate well.  Lorazepam I tolerate very well - no wierd side effects, no jumps, jitters, grogginess, shakes, hallucinations, etc.  It just does what it is supposed to do.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21872

EVIL DRUG (try this instead) I am trying to get off the Ativan after 2 years of bedtime use for insomnia and anxiety.  It is extremely addictive and the withdrawal symptoms are as bad as heroin.  It stops working after a few weeks and then you need higher and higher doses.  After a while, you start feeling worse than before you started taking it, but that is NOT a message to take more!  There are some long-term side-effects (anxiety, sleeplessness, irritability, depression, etc.), and the message is SLOWLY CUT BACK.  It is going to take several months of tapering to get off the Ativan, but I am glad to get that junk out of my system.Here are some helpful things for Ativan (and other Benzodiazipine) withdrawal symptoms, safe for most Bipolars, and helpful for anxiety and insomnia INSTEAD of the Benzos:  GABA, Taurine, Rescue Remedy, Chamomile, Melatonin, 5HTP, Calcium/Magnesium with extra Magnesium, Zinc, B-6 with B-complex, Yoga, Meditation, Acupuncture, Reflexology, Hops, Scullcap, Passionflower, Valerian (may be habit-forming).

It worked for the first couple months and then did not help me at all. Instead it caused depression and anxiety as I was addicted to it after a couple months. It helped me sleep a little, but the side effects were not worth it. Ativan really caused more problems than it helped, and it really only helped me sleep for the first few months of use. As this drug is very addictive I would not recommend Ativan to anyone.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21619
ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2005-04-16 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	2.5	4.5	My Review (what a catchy title ;) I took Ativan for a little over 2 years. I started at 1 mg. a day and ended at 6 mg. a day for GAD. I experienced a lot less side effects than I do now with Klonopin but my doctor said Ativan was more dangerous and it wasn't working at that time. I was requesting it be upped a couple more milligrams a day and thats when he took me off it and put me on Klonopin.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5868
ativan	Bipolar I disorder	2005-04-15 00:00:00		0.0	5.0	5.0	2.0	Not all it's cracked up to be I stopped taking this because when I am manic, it's just like taking NOTHING at all. It might as well be sugar pills. How do people get addicted to this? It does NOTHING.  I need heavier drugs. IT's like using an ice pick when you really needed a sledgehammer.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30215
ativan	Bipolar I disorder	2005-04-15 00:00:00		3.0	1.0	3.5	2.5	Great but not real This stuff sure takes the anxiety down but, being a benzo, it can't be trusted on a regular basis and there is the concern about addiction.  I noticed that it seemed to increase my anxiety after it had worn off too.  But it is powerful and great for once in a while if you're experiencing run-away anxiety.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30325
ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2005-04-12 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	lorazepam I have taken 1mg of this as needed for the last year to help offset anxiety attacks. It isn't something I take everyday, but has definitely helped curb some of the really bad anxiety episodes. Side effects haven't really been an issue or, at least, I haven't noticed any due to not taking on a regular basis. However, I should note that I have felt a little &quot;funny&quot; after taking it for a few days and then stopping for a while.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21160

ativan	Social phobia (Social anxiety disorder)	2005-03-28 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	I like it... Ativan works well for me.  I was out of school for awhile because of my Anorexia and depression.  I was so anxious about going back.  I would take Ativan every morning until I got used to being back in school.  Without Ativan, I don't think I could have made it to school.  I still take Ativan at night occationally for sleeping or if I am having a panic attack.  It is great.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/20504

I was told it could be addictive, so I try to avoid taking it unless it's extremely necessary.  I was prescribed the medication for anxiety and panic attacks.  It seems to work (calms me down in crowded arenas--now I can Christmas shop...!).  My confusion is, however, that it works so quickly and smoothly that I sometimes wonder if I'd get the same results taking a placebo!  (Is it my mind playing tricks on me or is it my mind playing tricks with me?!)  At any rate, all things being equal, it seems to help me pretty well.  No side effects--no sleepiness.  I suppose my only complaint is that the pills are so darn small, it's easy to drop them!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/20178

ativan	Insomnia	2005-03-17 00:00:00		1.5	3.0	3.5	2.0	Good for Intermittent Anxiety, Not for Insomnia Lorazepam has been useful in calming my anxiety, but it doesn't do anything for my insomnia. I wouldn't even try it for insomnia because it's not promoting the deeper levels (Stage 3/Stage 4) of sleep that we need, it just makes the nervous feeling go away or makes you so drowsy that you go to sleep!!Ambien is the only real solution I've found for my insomnia--I take 15mg a night. I still don't sleep through the entire night, but I'm finally sleeping!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19983

ativan	Insomnia	2005-03-07 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	Love it! I originally started taking it for anxiety. But now I only need to use it occasionally for sleep.  If I find that I need extra help, I slip one under my tongue.  Works very effectively, 9 times out of 10.  No side effects that I can tell.  And it contines to work even after 3+ years.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19708
ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2005-03-02 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Yay! It not only helped with my terrible anxiety, but also with my sleep.  I would recommend it 100%.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19565
ativan	Insomnia	2005-03-02 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	4.5	Worked for awhile. In the beginning, it helped with both anxiety AND insomnia, but after awhile it only worked on my anxiety.

ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2005-02-28 00:00:00		3.5	2.5	4.0	3.5	It's working so far but... I've been taking Ativan (lorazepam) for a little over three weeks.  It definitely helps with anxiety but already I feel dependent on it to make it thru the day.  My tolerance for ativan has already built up so I have to double the dose for it to be effective.  I try to only take it when I need it and some days I haven't taken it at all.  But almost everyday something comes up that makes me feel the need for a dose.I've just recently started taking wellbutrin for depression and ativan for anxiety.  I'm also taking ambien to help me sleep.  I can't tell if I'm getting better or if i'm getting worse.  I'm hoping I'll see the light soon.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19399

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2005-02-22 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	Ativan for prevention of panic I have used generic Ativan (Lorazepam) to help prevent panic when I am in overstimulating situations. Due to my Fibromyalgia, I cannot tolerate crowds and noise. It can be chewed so it acts fast, and it does not make me sleepy. I do not use it as a sleep aid, because it supresses stage 4 (deep) sleep,which is counter-productive.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18878
ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2005-02-15 00:00:00		3.5	4.0	3.0	3.5	Used it for a long, long time. Loses it affectiveness after awhile and addictive, too. I am slowly tapering off.

My dr. told me that if I felt stressed or over excited I could take one to calm me down. They help me a lot when I travel by plane. I have all of my seizures at night when I sleep so that is when I take 2 of them to help me rest. I find that it has gotten rid of my 3AM seizure until my body has gotten used to that amount then it doesn't work anymore. But it does help me fall back to sleep after a spell. These are only 1mg pills and my Dr. says to take 1-2 3 x daily.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18529

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2005-01-17 00:00:00		5.0	0.0	5.0	3.5	HIGHLY ADDICTIVE I have been prescribed ATIVAN on numerous occasions for panic attacks. The problem is that this drug is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE, and I have a predisposition to chemical dependence. ATIVAN works great, but I cannot control my desire for more, more, more. I cannot safely use this drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18078
ativan	Insomnia	2005-01-14 00:00:00		2.5	2.5	2.5	2.5	Lorazepam is not useful for long term insomniacs In my experience, Lorazepam and Xanax are not as effective as Ambien for chronic sleep problems. It sometimes almost feels too 'gentle' and I find myself only minimally drowsy after taking it. Then that anxiety ridden internal pressure begins- 'should I take another one or not?' and then I am really wide awake! After 2 weeks of approx. 3-4X a week usage, I REALLY saw a dramatic drop in how effective it was for inducing sleep. It's much better for relaxing on long airplane rides. Long term insomniacs will find only temporarily relief with this medication. Ambien took almost 2 years of 3-4 times a week usage to lose it's effectiveness for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18049
ativan	Social phobia (Social anxiety disorder)	2005-01-07 00:00:00		3.5	5.0	5.0	4.0	Made Anxiety Worsen I was on ativan for anxiety attacks. It worked good at first then started to wear off. It actually caused my heart palps to worsen after about a year. Then when I quit taking it the anxiety attacks got worse. Switched to Klonopin and that was the ticket. Now I am on Cymbalta and backing it up with Xanax as needed. ishy78@charter.net	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17933
ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2004-12-17 00:00:00		3.5	2.5	2.5	3.5	Ativan- good and bad points I use Ativan as needed for panic attacks, occasional sleep issues, and as part of the cocktail for the severe anxiety associated with my mixed episodes.  I like Ativan for it's calming effects but refuse to take it on a daily basis because I want it to remain effective at a small dose and also, I do not want to become addicted to it.  Usually my usage averages about 2 times a week.  Ativan is good because it calms you gently. That is great when you are very anxious.  On the downside, there can be a rebound effect of anxiety.  Not fun.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17664

Plus, the medication I take for MS helps cause anxiety, so on certain days where I'm very anxious, Ativan has been a lifesaver. I take it about 1x every other week. It does not knock me out but settles my nerves &amp; I am able to function while on it.  I do not have any side effects from it &amp; it really has been a huge help for me at times. Highly recommend it for severe anxiety issues.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17579

ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2004-11-29 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	4.0	4.5	Long-term user for Severe Anxiety Disorder I've had a severe anxiety disorder for half my life now, 15 years, and was introduced to Ativan approximately 9 years ago. At first, I experienced typical side effects of excessive sleepiness, moodiness, irritability, but these went away after about 6 months of regular use. I've been on this medication for 9 years now, and yes this is a long time for anyone to be on this type of medication. No other treatments, therapy, medications, etc worked for me except Ativan or similar drugs. I take 2mg 4-5 times daily as a preventive medication...not waiting for a severe attack to come on, rather prevent any to interfere with my life. Before I knew my diagnosis for severe anxiety disorder (panic attacks), I was having up to 20 attacks per day, often having to crawl around, was terrified, would not leave home, would not drive, feared I was dying, abnormal heart palpitations...so much more...I even dropped out in my Junior year of high school because I could not function and no one knew what was wrong at the time. Job-wise I could keep one until my attacks got the worst of me and I had to quit. I won't type my entire story here, but will say in some ways, I feel this medication has saved my life. I now experience maybe a couple mini attacks every few month, and 1 full blown per year. I do not recommend anyone taking Ativan for long term as I do, without consulting with your MD and another to make sure this is what works, because Ativan is highly addictive, as bad as street drugs, and withdrawing suddenly can cause many horrible things. You can build up a tolerance to this medication even if very careful. take only as prescribed or PRN, as needed, and keep in contact with your physician.I'd consider myself a life-long user of this medication, as my anxiety attacks are still there and not going anywhere. If you are not covered by insurance, this medication can be a bit costly. Seek lower priced alternatives if you can, buy	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21846

It's an as-needed prescription and seems to do what I need it to do. I find, as my treatment progresses, I need it less and less often, which is why I marked N/A for long term use. Obviously it's not the only medication I take. Also on 300 mg Wellbutrin XR (or SR), 225 Effexor XR, and 750 Depakote split 250 a.m. and 500 p.m. (Plus levoxyl for underactive thyroid.)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16432

ativan	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2004-09-03 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.5	4.0	Ativan has been been a life saver, but.. I have been taking Ativan for about 3 yrs for anxiety and severe muscle spasms due to Fibromyalgia. I was only taking 1mg up until January of this year when I had a major flare of my fibromyalgia casing extreme pain, fatigue and muscles spasms that were so bad that my whole body would shake uncontrollably. My doctor told me to start taking 1mg in the am and another 1mg in the evening. This has help but not completely. I still have muscle spasms and I am finding that the Ativan is only effective for about 8 hrs at the most. I am trying not to take more then 2mg a day since it is VERY additive. My anxiety is somewhat better but there are days that I still have panic attacks.The one thing that I really do like about Ativan is that it does not make me sleepy or tired.I can drive and get thru the day if I have to.I would advise anyone that is told to take Ativan to think long and hard before they do because once you start taking it you can not stop it without going thru major withdrawal symptoms.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/15214

However, and I don't even remember how this happened, I worked my way up to using 4-1 mg. doses per day, everyday!  I would say that took approximately 3 years to occur.  That is addiction and tolerance...scary stuff!  Also scary was the fact that instead of feeling more in control because my anxiety was reduced, I was becoming out of control.

ativan	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2004-08-27 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	2.5	4.5	GREAT for short term, acute panic or nightmares I started having severe panic attacks out of the blue.  It took five emergency room visits to get a doctor to convince me to try Ativan (I'm terrified of pills and have lots of side effects with everything).  I had *no* side effects with Ativan.  I was taking it three times a day 0.5 mg to get the panic under control.  I maintained that dosage for about three months, then dropped to two a day for a few months.  I've been at one a day, bedtime, for four years.  It does absolutely nothing for my anxiety now, but it does stop be from having nightmares.  I suffered with that all my life.  As soon as I stop taking Ativan, nightmares immediately return.  I'm currently considering a SSRI medication for the general anxiety, though the panic has come under control.  I think I'd have gone nuts without Ativan, but I don't recommend it for long term use.  You really need to work on the roots of the problem while taking the medication, or it's just a band-aid.  Definitely works for acute panic attacks...halts them in their tracks.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/15016

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2004-08-03 00:00:00		4.5	1.5	5.0	4.0	Atavan works for me. I've been taking it for about a week now. The anxiety was so bad that I thought I would break at just about any moment. My heart felt like it was about to beat right out of my chest. I'd break out in sweat, my fingers and hands would tingle, I felt weak and I couldn't eat... a truly rare experience for me. The sight of food made me nauseous.Although the month that I suffered with the anxiety attacks resulted in a 15 pound weight loss, (and I can spare a few more pounds) the Ativan has helped with all of the above mentioned symptoms and once I get my pill down in the morning, I can wait for a few minutes and eat a relatively normal meal. If I take my Ativan too early in the evening, I'm likely to awaken early, obsessing over the perceived problems of the day, but other than that, I have no complaints with Ativan. I just hope my doctor will continue the dosage since he only gave me a 60 tablet trial. I need to get past this project and believe that everything will return to normal... but what if it doesn't?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14480

I started having very bad panic attacks, I would have to go to the hospital all the time they were so bad. They put me on 1mg four times a day to get it under control. Every time they tried to take me off it, the panic attacks would get worse and nothing else worked. I've been on it for at least 14 years. The dr has tried to put me on something else and wean me off, but so far it hasn't happened. He told me some people just have to stay on it, and I guess I'm one of them. I don't notice any side effects, I've gotten used to the dosage over the years, and I don't have a need to take more. Sometimes I try to take less and then I have an attack. It's cheap and it works so I stay on it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14284

ativan	Social phobia (Social anxiety disorder)	2004-07-21 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	3.0	4.5	Wears off Quickly I used it for 4 days. Liked it but felt like an addict while taking it. I craved it after about 4-6 hours and wanted to take more. I decided then to either go back to klonopin which I have been taking for 10 years or try something else like valium.I liked the klonopin but just wanted to try something different to see how it works...So currently I am on day 1 of valium. It has a much longer half-life than klonopin so hopefully it will help me withdraw easier from the benzo's. Don't get me wrong. Ativan worked but didn't like the quick and strong withdrawals and the craving for more. I think it gets such high ratings because of the rating system this site uses. It is effective, has limited side effects, ease of use, and is cost effective but for me I didn't like how quick it wore off and the craving for more. Only gave it 4 days though.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14165
ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2004-07-20 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Miracle Pill!! I have taken Ativan 1mg every other day for 3 months for panic attacks and anxiety. They have worked great! I would take one every day, but I am afraid of becoming addicted, after everything I have read. I am able to face situations I normally would have been really anxious about, like going away on trips, and driving on highways. When I am on the ativan I never even worry about the chance of having a panic attack, like I usually do. I have not experienced any side effects at all. My doctor had given me a prescription to Zoloft about a month ago. I tried it for 2 days with horrible side effects! The ativan really works for me, so I really don't want to try anything else, especially SSRI's. The only thing that I am worried about is that my doctor may stop prescribing it to me because of the dependency issue. It doesn't make sense to me that they could stop prescribing something that has been really effective for my panic attacks. I never take more than one pill every other day. All in all, ativan has been a miracle and has definitely improved my life.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14125
ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2004-07-11 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Not Good Long Term I was taking Ativan .5mg 3x per day for 5 months.  Initially, it worked fabulously, especially for sleep.  Over time, however, your body gets use to the dosage and its no longer effective.  Seems you need to keep increasing the dosage to get the same effect.  While I still take Ativan occasionally when I feel especially keyed up, I rely solely on Lexapro (SSRI) now.  Overall, I really liked Ativan, its extremely effective, but its definitely not something you want to take every day for longer than a 1-2 months.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3626

I don't use it very often but I feel much better knowing I have it there in case I need it.    As far as side effects go, for me it depends on how much I take and also has seemed to be affected by what other meds I'm on. I used to take 1 mg -sometimes even 2, but now (on lithium, wellbutrin, and seroquel) if I take a whole mg I feel very out of it and not in a good way, so I've cut my dose in half. I have no side effects when the dose is right other than a faint strange taste/feeling in my throat.    What I don't like about it is that the dr.s are reluctant to give scripts for it and I'm always worried that my access to it might be blocked someday. I certainly don't abuse it (and honestly don't understand how anybody does) and I have not developed a tolerance.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/20230

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2004-04-28 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	4.5	4.0	Exceptional! I suffer with agoraphobia, I had been housebound for years until it was time to sell up and move to Kent, which was an hours drive away on the motorway. Just going round the block sent me into the most awful panic attacks where I had trouble swallowing, palpitations, hyperventilating etc, I could not even imagine this journey when 5 minutes from the house was enough! Lorazepam did literally save my life as I was in a terrible state, on the morning we left I took 1 mg, and along with the TFT technique it was great. I have been taking 0.5 mg when I am facing a situation I feel overwhelmed by, I don't take it all the time as I know I need to be able to deal with it myself, but having that if I need it is fantastic. The drawback is it makes me incredibly tired, I am all right when out but when I get home I feel zapped. I have also had really awful nightmares, something I did not suffer with before. At the moment I am trying Propranolol to see what effect this has as I can't stand the nightmares any longer, any one else had this problem? I would recommend them for emergencies only.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12242
ativan	Post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)	2004-04-16 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	5.0	4.5	Instant peace of mind for the troubled Ativan is a powerful, addictive tranqulizer that should be used in moderation, to prevent dependence. If the reason you cannot get to sleep is because you are hearing voices that aren't there, lost a loved one, have post traumatic stress disorder, have an inner dialogue you can't shut off, or something along those lines, this could be a very effective treatment. The trouble is, once you take it, you might feel better than you have ever felt in your life. If you have heard of pill popper addicts but thought that could never happen to you, well, try Ativan and see if you can resist the temptation. Countless doctors are secretly addicted to this medication, and it's not for no reason: Ativan can completely eliminate your stress and anxiety. It's likely once you take it, you will feel so good you no longer want to go to sleep, you just want to stay up and bask in its glow. If you want to sleep though, you will. This medication gives you a lot of control over your thoughts.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/28677

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2004-04-13 00:00:00		3.0	1.0	5.0	2.5	Holy Crap! About two months ago I was having severe chest pains and anxiety attacks. I couldn't breathe. I swear I was having a heart attack and I am 24. Is this possible I thought. The medical facility I was going to referred me to the ER because the doctor was out. I'm in the Coast Guard so it's hard for an HS to see you if the Doc is not in. I went to the ER and they hooked me up to a EKG. The P.A. was like your heart looks fine and I was like nope, I think that It is broken. I missed my family a lot and the weather in Alaska didn't help any. So he prescribed Ativan. O.K. this stuff will put you in a coma (not literally) but it will make you hella tired. It was so hard to perform my duties. It really impaired my judgment and my memory seemed fried. I was still having problems though. I would cry ALL the time. I remember telling my XO that I just couldn't get happy. I was so distraught. I had a lot of hallucinations too.$&amp;!@ crawln' up my walls and scary vivid dreams. I'd wake up and be like-was that real? Not good for the job I do. So I was taken off the Ativan and put on the Lexapro for Anxiety and Depression.

ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2004-03-29 00:00:00		1.5	0.0	3.5	1.5	Ativan-Demon drug Ativan...the very name sends shivers down my spine. I took ativan for my frequent panic attacks which started when I was 17 years old. Ativan was prescribed to me in my 30's (I'm 50 now) and it worked...for a while. Then I had to have more and more to keep the panic attacks at bay. I was going to 2 different doctors to get enough pills and I eventually was up to ten 2 mg pills a day. Ativan grabbed me so hard that I felt as if I would have to be exorcised by a priest to  discontinue using it. Finally I said, &quot;No more.&quot; I told my doctor what I had done and he switched me to a low dosage of Klonopin. The withdrawals from Ativan were agonizing but the Klonopin helped tremendously. I have been taking 3 mg of Klonopin a day for 15 years and it is the most amazing medicine for panic disorder I have ever used. It does not give one the highs and lows of the 'pam' meds. Used properly one can totally keep panic attacks at bay for years at a time. It works for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11439
ativan	Insomnia	2004-03-14 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Works better than anything I know . . . I am probably addicted already; I have been taking 1 mg. tablet @ bedtime for about 2 months - at one point I got scared when I read about the potential for addiction so I stopped taking it; well, there were nights over a 3 week period where I literally didn't sleep - maybe I would fall asleep at 3:00 a.m. and get up @ 6:00.  It was a pure, living hell.  I have had sleep problems for many years; I have tried practically everything, and I guess if this does the trick, &quot;addiction&quot; is better than not sleeping.  Works quickly, some very minor increased tolerance, no hangover.  If you have been hard to treat, this is worth a try . . . Good luck!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11262

ativan	Social phobia (Social anxiety disorder)	2004-02-21 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	Good Benzo - Compare to Xanax and Klonopin Here's my 2-cents worth on Ativan:  It's a great drug with few side-effects.  The only problem IMHO is that there are better benzos out there IF you can get you doc to prescribe them, such as Xanax and Clonazepam.  Ativan works, don't get me wrong, and I liked the effects of it.  It just didn't seem as clean and as smooth to me as Xanax, for example. Both drugs have fairly short half-lives, meaning they don't stay in the body too long.  Klonopin, on the other hand (clonazepam) has a half-life of something like 36 hours, so it's a very long acting drug for anxiety disorders, as you probably know.On a scale of 1-10 I'd give Ativan a 7 or an 8, whereas Xanax I give a 9, and Klonopin probably an 8 or a 9 also.  They all have minor side-effects that usually go away after a week or so.Hang in there... there is hope for chronic anxiety problems, and Ativan is a good drug, though not my personal favorite.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10704
ativan	Insomnia	2004-02-17 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	Ativan for GAD / Insomnia Ativan (Lorazepam) has been very good for me.Generally speaking it's probably not the smartestthing to be using it for insomnia.  Many people find that it can lose it's effectiveness when used to often.  However, I personally like using it for both General Anxiety Disorder and Insomnia.I almost always use the same daily dose.  A 2mg tab around bedtime.  Due to constant use it has lost SOME of it's effectiveness at that dosage.HOWEVER...I'm quick to point out that it still does the job.  It is important to note that I also take PAXIL for MAJOR DEPRESSION.  (unipolar)(1) 20mg tab per night.  The combination of these two medications is excellent for me.  I should probably be taking something else for the insomnia, so I can use Ativan (lorazepam) strictly for anxiety.  But I really hate to taketoo many medications.  By just sticking with PAXIL and Ativan I get good results for depression, anxiety, and insomnia all at once.I only take these things at night.  I hate havingto take something 2 or 3 X daily.  That's enough to drive anybody nutty.  I must admit, the lorazepam tends to wear off during the day.By the time I'm ready to take the next doseI tend to be suffering a little bit from theanxiety, which is beginning to return.  So I take the normal dose of each medication.  Then I wait about 1 hour for them to kick in.  By the way Ativan can kick in within about 10 minutes if your not used to it.  It's very friendly stuff.A word of caution....Ativan can be addictive!Being addicted to something that helps you a lotis not always a bad thing.  However having aserious or &quot;out of control&quot; addiction can be a real problem.  My advice....don't be raising the dose just to keep the effect at full power.That's a sure fire way to get addicted if you justkeep doing it all the time.  The more sensible method is to only raise the dose for brief periods of time.  Like one or two nights.  Then return to the normal dose for a	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10488

I have been taking Ativan(Lorazepam) on an as needed basis, sometimes every day, sometimes only twice a week for years. I think that because I don't use them everyday continuously, they have remained effective and reliable over time. On some occasions I have taken 4 or 5 in a day, on others I have only taken 0.5mg to take the edge off my anxiety. I also take paxil at 40mg a day, which helps tremeandously, but for me Ativan is the only drug which can annihilate a panic attack as it happens. Im currently feeling the beautiful calming effects of this tranquilizer as I write this today. I probably won't feel the need to take anymore for maybe a few days or even a week. Onset of action for me is around 15 minutes, fully active after 30 minutes, and tapering off after an hour, lasting around 6 hours. I find that it doesn't help me sleep though, I take Zopiclone for that.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9169

Granted, Ativan does not have the quick onset and &quot;buzz&quot; of Xanax, but (under low dose) I am able to drive my car without being overwhelmed by fear, can spend time in the presence of my ex-partner without bursting into tears and was able to tell my money-hungry mother and her redneck husband to take a hike without flinching. For me, this pharmaceutical has been a life-saver!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6578

ativan	Social phobia (Social anxiety disorder)	2003-04-07 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	4.0	Lorazepam - A Godsend for Those 'Panicky Days' I used to take lorazepam 4mg daily for several months. I found it to be the fastest-acting benzodiazepine that I've tried and very effective in dissolving the panic and apprehension of social anxiety. I stopped taking it daily, as it is very sedating and caused some amnesia after a large dose. However, I still believe that lorazepam would be useful as a top-up on bad days when there is a threatening situation, e.g. presentation &amp; public speaking. I stopped taking it 'Cold Turkey' without a tapering period. Only a few headaches as a result. I've found clonazepam to be more effective at controlling social anxiety on a daily basis, and does not cause me any drowsiness or amnesia, but it is slow-acting and I sometimes wish I could have some lorazepam on standby for immediate relief.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5495
ativan	Insomnia	2003-04-03 00:00:00		3.5	2.5	5.0	3.5	WARNING, read this. I am writing this review about my difficult experience with Ativan.  I guess you could call it a love/hate relationship.  For the past 6 months I have been prescribed benzodiazepines for anxiety/insomnia starting with Xanax, then moving on to Klonopin, and last Ativan.  Ativan has proved to be the best anti-anxiety sleep aid out of all those listed above, but I have experienced some difficult side effects one should know about before deciding whether or not to take this medication.   I will tell you some good points about it first.  In my experience, Ativan feels like it creeps up on you slowly, different from what I felt from Klonopin or Xanax - making it easy to drift off into a peaceful sleep.  Also, it helped with anxiety a lot.  The biggest downside to this drug tho is that I have experienced the biggest memory loss ever.  Sometimes I feel as though I have Alzheimer's disease.  Old and new memories die...but, not to worry seeing how after you discontinue usage most of your memory comes back.  During the 3 months I have taken Ativan, I cannot remember small details of my life.  You can remember stuff, but the small details just aren't there. :(  A good side to this medication is that the withdrawal symptoms aren't nearly as bad as Xanax or Klonopin.  Klonopin was just awful, I actually experienced full blown hallucinations with Klonopin.  Even at such a high dosage with Ativan (currently I am prescribed 150 pills of 1 mg Ativan per month-note: Ativan comes in .5, 1, and 2 mg dosages).  Even after coming off of as much as 8 mg a day, 2mg in the morning, 2 mg in the afternoon, and 4 mg at night, the withdrawal isn't nearly as bad as Klonopin.  I am not saying there isn't withdrawal (I experience headaches, muscle aches, ear aches, and insomnia) just that it is much much much more manageable than Klonopin was.  Klonopin was h***.  I would stay on Ativan but I don't like not knowing what is going on, and benzodiazepines do that to me. &lt;p	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/5449

ativan	Social phobia (Social anxiety disorder)	2002-11-29 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	4.5	5.0	Long term use of lorazepam taken as needed I have been taking 1 mg lorazepam (Ativan) as needed for about 3 years.  Originally I started off at .5 mg which I used for situational anxiety.  I take 1mg twice a day about 3 days a week, not everyday.  It works better if you skip a day or two between doses.  I take other meds, so I don't rely on Ativan exclusively.  Over the long-term, I have noticed that I had to increase my dose from .5mg to 1mg. Today, I have become somewhat tolerant to the 1 mg dose, but even after a year 1mg still provides relief from anxiety, but 2mg taken a half hour to an hour before a social event seems to be just the right dosage.  I have become tolerant to the hypnotic effects of Ativan, which means that I don't have memory lapses (amnesia) of a social event and when I first started taking Ativan it seemed to produce a dramatic relief of symptoms within a half hour, and I was very relaxed at the 1 mg. dose.  Also, it made me extremely sociable and talkative.  Now, at 2mg before an event, I have relief of anxiety, but it doesn't feel as dramatic and I don't feel extremely sociable, but rather more comfortable in my own skin.  Also I can remember every detail of a social event.  In the past 3 years I have had my dosage adjusted slightly, so it seems to work fine for long term use for anxiety, however, I do not use it everyday, so I could not tell you if I would have to make additional dosage adjustments. I try not to use it more than two days in a row.  I rely on my other meds to get me through my better days. Lorazepam will probably work better for you if you only need it for certain social events, maybe once or twice a week.  Further, you will not become as psychologically dependent on this medication if you're only using it once in a while.  My biggest suggestion is use it infrequently and rely more on other meds such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, Provigil, to get you through most of your days.  If you have to use Ativan more frequentl	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3158
ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2002-11-20 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	A Lifesaver! I have been taking lorazepam (.5 mg as needed) to treat panic attacks. I take one when I feel an attack coming on. Usually one a day; in the evening. This was the first drug I was prescribed and I was VERY hesitant to take it. (some of the negative reviews here did not help) Thank God I did. I was scared of feeling &quot;drugged&quot; and of possible side effects. I can honestly say I do not feel sedated or groggy, I just feel more calm. It makes the feeling of panic go away and helps me feel sane again. I have not experienced any negative side effects but I do worry some about tolerance buildup and addiction. All in all Lorazepam has changed my life and set me on track to living a normal life. I would encourage anyone who is nervous about taking it to: just do it!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3029

ativan	Insomnia	2002-11-03 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	The best so far Recommended by a chinese doctor while travelling, who called it &quot;the best&quot;, I have personally found it very effective. This in comparison to Vallium and some other sleep tablets.However, I have found that the Ativan brand is manufactured by several companies, some of these leave a nasty after taste. The one to use is manufactured by Wyat, totally clean.I understand that Ativan is basically anti-anxiety, thus it does not directly introduce the chemical reponsible for causing sleep, but rather, does away with the &quot;anxiety&quot; that disturbs sleep. To clarify, anxiety is not just physcological disturbance, but also physical anxiety, such as injury (in my case an irritated intestine).Ofcouse there are some very strong warnings on the internet about Ativan's side effects (do a search on google for &quot;Ativan side effects&quot;), so use your own judgement in using it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2642

Over the course of a year, I had worked up to the maximum recommended doseage of 2mg 3 times/day to achieve the same effect as the original doseage.  Ativan did not give me a &quot;high&quot; or anything of that nature, just helped to control my anxiety.  I still suffered from anxiety, but the symptoms were much improved.  I was then switched to Xanax.  I will continue my review there.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2616

It works fine without making me sleep, I am still able to think and do things after taking this drug.  It has been a God send for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2501

I like Ativan a lot.  Didn't have any side effects with this drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2379
ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2002-10-01 00:00:00		4.5	0.5	5.0	3.5	caution caution! Ativan worked wonders for my anxiety attacks.  The downside is the I felt the need to gradually increase my doseage in order for it to continue to remain effective.  Also, at one time I felt I could stop using it daily, so I just stopped.  Well.......no problem day 1, no problem day 2, no problem day 3, evening of day 3 I had the most terrifying and totally realistic nightmares I've ever had (and I never really had nightmares).  It was a horror film I could not wake from.  The next day I almost had to get hospitalized for depersonalization and derealization.  It was truly hell - full blown withdrawl effects - and that is only from 1-2 mg per day for 6 months.  This is one of the most addictive benzos.  Also, i didn't know at the time that you can die from withdrawl seizures from ativan.  Use with caution and only withdraw under strict medical supervision, and only consider an exxxxtttrrrreeeemmmmllllyyyyyy slllllloooooowwww taper at that.  It works great against anxiety, but is massively addictive.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2113
ativan	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2002-09-20 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	Great For Anxiety/Panic Attacks I suffered Anxiety/Panic Attacks &amp; this did not let me sleep! When I took Ativan it worked within 20 minutes at most &amp; alleviated all my symptoms &amp; I became very sleepy &amp; most of all it calmed my nerves so that I could sleep without any anxiousness which would turn to an Anxiety/Panic Attack! I was able to function without fear &amp; because I slept more &amp; ate better I looked more healthy! Now for the side affects: I had two kind of side affects. If I were driving, physically active like shopping or walking around I would just feel very calm again as if I never had an anxiety/panic attack! But if I were working, sitting at my desk or just sitting, watching TV or having a conversation I would feel very sleepy even to the point of feeling somehow drugged up! This is when I would have to take a nap/sleep. In the mornings I would wake up feeling groggy &amp; still with some of the drugged up effects. But after an hour or so I would feel alert again. So to sum it all up, if I were physically active at the time I took a dosage I would just feel the calming affects, but if I were just sitting around I would get very sleepy, groggy as if I were drugged up. As for getting off of them (after a month &amp; 1 week or so of taking them once in the morning &amp; once in the evening .5 mg) I had absolutely no side affects, whatsoever. Let's say my Doctor was very surprised at that. I was told that you had to wean off of them. I just stopped cold turkey! I didn't really suffer insomnia but I could see how it would help induce sleep effectively! Then again my insomnia was due to anxiety/panic attacks!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1993
ativan	Insomnia	2002-09-19 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	I get a good night's sleep I had been unable to get more than a few hours sleep before waking up. This situation got worse over several months until I started taking the Lorazepam. Now I can sleep for 7 or 8 hours. I don't really think it's a great idea to take a pill to sleep every night but it certainly beats being tired, cranky and run down. At my age , 53, if I have to take this pill for the rest of my life it is worth it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1963

I do feel &quot;groggy&quot; the next day and it still does not relax me enough to sleep through the nite. Maybe it is a mixture of all the medications i take throughout the day.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1188

ativan	Insomnia	2002-06-16 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	So Far So Good Using only one week but am sleeping from 9pm through till 7am!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/984
ativan	Insomnia	2002-06-12 00:00:00		4.0	1.5	3.5	3.0	Lorazepam for sleep I find this medication very effective as a sedative when needed to induce sleep, however the morning-after side effects at the rated dose of 0.5mg are uncomfortable.  A dose reduction to 0.25mg reduces the side effects considerably and does not change the efficacy.  The medication was used for a brief period during an intensive summereducation program.  The course was so difficult and worrisome that mysleep patters were completely thrown off.  I was getting only one or twohours a night for several weeks before finally seeking help.  The medication was immediately effective.  The only side effect was asluggish feeling in the morning which wore off by mid-day.  Of course,this was not conducive to focused study, but sleep was more important atthat stage.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/958

ativan	Insomnia	2001-10-28 00:00:00		5.0	2.0	5.0	4.0	Ativan It works great- but is QUITE difficult to come off of.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/584
ativan	Insomnia	2001-03-10 00:00:00		3.0	2.0	5.0	3.0	not a good choice Ativan is more for anxiety than for a sleep disorder.  There are several choices to choose from for sleep disorders - this drug is better left for those who suffer from anxiety.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/162
ativan	Insomnia	2001-01-27 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	This really helped me. I took this over a period of years for my sleep problems and it always worked.  I never gained a tolerance for it, never had any side effects, and because it was covered under my insurance it was inexpensive.  I also had no side effects when I had to stop taking it due to the loss of my doctor.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/68
augmentin	Sinusitis	2012-05-16 00:00:00		4.0	1.5	1.5	1.5	I did experience daily diarrhea with this medication and occasional nausea but I think it did the trick for my 6-day old sinus infection.  I was taking the 875mg/125mg so that may have been the reason for the side effects.	-
augmentin	Otitis Media	2007-08-01 00:00:00		4.5	1.5	2.5	3.0	When my twins were babies, the occasional bout with otitis media, happened here and there.  We were always prescribed Augmentin.  It worked wonders, but always gave the babies diarrhea.  Be certain to follow the BRAT diet throughout the entire course of therapy, and if it's for a young one still in diapers PREVENTION of diaper rash (load up on Balmex/Desitin or A&amp;D), is imperative.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56387
augmentin	Lyme Disease	2006-11-03 00:00:00		2.5	4.5	2.5	3.0	Stomach, at ease. Vagina, ON FIRE! After a miserable experience with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea with Doxycycline, I was more than glad to be put on Amoxycillin. Although I am not a fan of antibiotics, I knew I need them to combat the Lyme's bacteria. Being vegan I don't exactly get a chance to replace beneficial bacteria in my body through the foods I eat, so I upped my dose of L. Acidophilus: Six capsules a day in stead of two. Unfortunately this was not enough to ward off the dreaded yeast infections associated with prolonged antibiotic use. I ended up treating the infection topically until my Amoxycillin ran out, got a prescription for Diflucan to finish it off, and followed up with four L.Acidophilus pills a day until I felt I was in the clear.I have yet to be tested again to see if more antibiotic treatment is necessary, but if it is I will most likely use Amoxycillin if not a more natural approach.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52166
augmentin	Interstitial cystitis	2006-10-01 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	4.5	4.5	only thing that worked My first major flare-up was triggered by sex after a UTI.  I probably went to the doctor 5-6 times getting different antibiotics for the infection b/c it felt like it wasn't going away, it was only getting worse.  The last couple of times they weren't able to detect a UTI, so they referred me to a urologist and she confirmed that it was IC, not a lingering infection.  She wanted to do a cystoscopy to rule out cancer, but I hadn't heard anything positive about the procedure in the forums so I was disinclined to shell out the $1500 for the proper diagnosis.  At this time my symptoms were pretty severe.  It was on my mind all the time.  Sitting for long periods made it worse, but nothing seemed to make it better.  Sex was out of the question and I often worried that I'd never have sex again.  All in all, a pretty miserable experience which went on for about 3 months.  After seeing the urologist and realizing that she couldn't really help me, I turned to the antibiotics b/c at least some people were getting help from them.  I had noticed that my IC symptoms would get better after the UTI antibiotic treatments but then would get worse a couple days after stopping them.  If I took the proper antibiotics for a longer period of time it seemed like it would work or at least offer some measure of relief when taking them.  I ordered augmentin from an online pharmacy that I found at drugbuyers.com, probably clickdrugs or medsmex.  I didn't bother asking the doctors for a prescription as this wasn't the standard course of treatment.  I think the urologist was more apt to put me on pain pills indefinitely than give me weeks worth of antibiotics.  I can't remember what the dosage was, but I remember taking them for 3 weeks to a month.  The side effects do start to catch up with you (disorientation/depression), but my symptoms had cleared up pretty well when I stopped.  I remember my symptoms improving after a few days and then gradually over a few weeks.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39523

augmentin	Interstitial cystitis	2006-07-21 00:00:00		2.5	2.5	2.5	2.5	so far its hopeful! I had strep d show up on UML broth culture after nothing showing up for years (due to use of elmiron) I started augmentum and amox rotated one in teh morning the other at night and its working for the flare up.  Although I also have Lyme, its nice to know that the bacertia that is commonly found with IC patients finally showed up and now I can kill it all off with the right meds.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/45796

augmentin	Irritable bowel syndrome - Diarrhea (IBS-D)	2005-09-26 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Antibiotic therapy for IBS I took the antibiotic, Augmentin for one week, and although my symptoms of brochitis did not get better while on the medication, my symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome did get noticably better. I was also taking probiotics with the antibiotics to help keep the good bacteria alive, however, when I have taken probiotics alone, there has been no change in symptoms at all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6603
augmentin	Lyme Disease	2005-08-26 00:00:00		4.0	4.5	5.0	4.0	great for the first 5 years Actually got the lyme to go dormant for 8 to 10 months out of the year. but when it came back it was worse than the year before.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26422
augmentin	Interstitial cystitis	2005-06-22 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	Antibiotic treatment So far, this has been the only regimen that has made a significant diferrence for me. Nothing else helped me.  Not Elmiron, bladder instillations, anti-depressants, or gram-negative antibiotics like macrobid, cipro, bactrim, etc...	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23986
augmentin	Lyme Disease	2004-11-28 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	4.5	4.5	Augmentin is good Good to add to Amoxicillin to boost blood levels.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17334
augmentin	Interstitial cystitis	2004-11-15 00:00:00		1.0	3.5	4.5	2.0	I no longer use this treatment Since IC doesn't involve an infection I don't understand why they scribe it. Unless you are &quot;fortunate&quot; (yeah right) enough to have a bladder infection WITH IC... (I wanted to shoot myself). Long term use of antibiotics is damaging to you because you are so resistant to them when you actually do have an infection. Also, in women it causes yeast infections. I do not recommend (from my own personal experience) that you use this treatment.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17047
augmentin	Interstitial cystitis	2004-11-01 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	bladder infections I use this antibiotic after intercourse to prevent a resulting bladder infection.  Large doses will cause unimaginable pain in my bladder.  I only take one pill after sex.  I can tolerate a low dosage.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16537
augmentin	Interstitial cystitis	2004-09-03 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	4.5	0.5	Augmentin Several months on this drug left me worse off than before I started it	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/15180

augmentin	Interstitial cystitis	2004-07-08 00:00:00		2.5	1.0	3.0	2.0	Antibiotics Somewhat helpful....side effects very high and troublesome.  Long term problems but not long term improvement that didn't come right a way.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/13943
augmentin	Interstitial cystitis	2004-07-01 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	4.5	Augmentin for Interstitial Cystitis Augmentin was very effective for IC. However, after 2 months it caused symptoms from buildup in the tissues and I had to reduce the dosage.  Later I switched Amoxicillin which is just as effective and easier to tolerate.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/13771
augmentin	Interstitial cystitis	2004-06-29 00:00:00		5.0	1.5	3.5	3.5	Augmentin really helped cure my IC Followed protocol set forth by Cystitis Research Center, pursuaded my doctor to give me the augmentin, and he finally gave in.  I was completely cured, and so was a friend I recommended to the program.  Augmentin really worked for both of us and about 10 others that I know.  However, we all had issues with candida and side effects, but the IC was cured in all our cases.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/13738

avinza	Severe Pain	2008-10-09 00:00:00		4.0	1.5	5.0	4.5	As a chronic pain patient of nealy 26 years, I have been on various medications. Avinza treats most of my pain. I do have to use Oxycontin for breakthrough pain. The medication does cause constipation and I have a reduced appetite. It is costly. A month's supply cost my insurance company $416.95. Overall, it is very effective.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58458

avinza	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2008-06-13 00:00:00		3.0	2.5	3.5	4.0	I was on 60mg of Avinza for 3 or 4 months for severe fibromyalgia pain. The dosage was not high enough for me, but it was giving me more constipation and a drowsy feeling than I wanted. I have taken morphine lots over the last five years and it's never been the most effective painkiller for me, so that's ultimately why I wanted to try something else without trying a higher dose of the Avinza first. But I would recommend it for chronic pain. It certainly doesn't take it all away (maybe about 65% of it for me), but it took the edge off. Worth a shot. Extremely expensive though.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57965
avinza	Degenerative disc disease	2008-01-13 00:00:00		2.5	1.5	4.0	1.5	Constipation is severe, which can be expected with morphine.  The time release mechanism maintains a steady blood serum level, which leads to quick dependance.  Even though my pain is 24/7, I prefer shorter time release medication to avoid dependance/withdrawal and maintain effectiveness.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57137

avinza	Herniated discs	2006-10-11 00:00:00		3.5	3.0	5.0	3.0	Avinza improved my quality of life My pain specialist (chronic back pain) convinced me to try this time released morphine sulfate medication in order to &quot;improve my quality of life&quot;. I had to titrate my dosage up from 30 mg 2/day to 60 mg 2/d and finally 90 mg 2/day and it did indeed improve my quality of life, most notably getting a full night of restful sleep.  I was forced to switch to another specialist in his practice due to his departure to another position out of state.  Now that I've been on this med for 2 years it is less effective and the current specialist will not increase my dose.  I can't blame her but unless they determine how to fix my spine, I will have difficulty discontinuing this medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51070

avinza	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2006-07-17 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	4.0	So far so good I was under the care of a pain clinic for over 4 years and we ran the list of meds from Oxycontin to the Duragisic Patch to Avinza in November 05 I began having trouble with urination no matter how much I thought I had to pee I could not do but a dribble I kept telling my Dr. and because I was unable to give a urnie sample in January ( I tried for 2 days ) he thought I was hiding something at that time I was on 240 mg Avinza a day I am 5'4 and about 110 pds other dr's freaked when they found out how much he had me on and would not take over my pain mgt. During this time I was also diganosed with MS and found out that if the morphine was not causing my kidney's to fail it could be the MS. So with my hubby's support,my family dr's help and the good Lord giving me strenth I reduced my dose to 90 mg a day (30 mg every 8 hrs) but my family doc still wanted me in a pain clinic and I could not find one that would accept me as a patient until recently. I found a local Dr's office that agreed to take over as long as I tried to reduce to 30 mg twice a day (so far I can go about 3 days before I have to have a 3rd dose) and guess what the problem with my kidney function has stopped. The key with this medicine is not only finding a level that works with your body and not against it but also finding a Dr that will listen and believe you that's the hardest part for me	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/45725

I've done the Gaba's &amp; Neurontin (made me sick), Cymbalta (headaches &amp; feeling out of it), Lyrica (I gained about 20 pds. in 1 mo. on this &amp; only got minimal pain relief), Zoloft (didn't have any noticable changes),Wellbutrin (was great for &quot;almost&quot; getting me to stop smoking... but had to go off of it when I started Lamictal), the Benzo's (effect me in a really bad way..nodding off while driving.. and smoking..&quot;REALLY SCARY&quot;.. also increased paranoia, will not take them anymore... &quot;EVER&quot;!!), Oxycontin (very bad experience with it, constant iching, scratching, headaches &amp; nausea), Ultram (didn't do anything), Vicodin 750's (they don't work as well as they used to) &amp; Zanaflex (which also doesn't work as well as it used to). I can't remember the rest of them.. but.. so far (2 days into this dosage), the Avinza 120 mg. is working.. pretty well, with no adverse effects. I still supplement this time released dosage of Avinza, with my Vicodin 750's (probably 6 per day, for these last 2 days, instead of 12) and my Zanaflex (probably 8 per day as opposed to double that). So.. &quot;knock on wood&quot;, this will work for me.. at least for a little while..I forgot Lunesta.. it worked &quot;GREAT&quot;!! for the first 2 wks. now I'm back to an average of about 4 to 5 hrs. of sleep per night.. wish it came in a higher dosage or the Ins. companies would pay for a double dose (like my Doc. prescribed).. but.. I'd recommend it, no adverse effects on me (which is a miracle).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44254

It was only then that I was presctibed morphine. It works well and covers about 80% of pain with breakthrough pain only occurring with activity. I am on a slow release, have no highs, a little nausea if away fro food and a little maliase. Concern over dependance is real but only approx 1% having addictive issues.

But the pain that I have lived with from complicated migraines and other problems was keeping me in bed.  I had to try something to get my life back.  I started at the lowest possible dose until I found the right one for me.  The best thing about this medication opposed to brake through drugs like vicodin, or the like, is that you don't get a rush or feel like you are not yourself.  Being a Mom and wife, having a house to run and many other things...this was important.

avinza	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2006-03-23 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	MSContin is a Godsend, I wouldn't be here w/o it. I switched to MSContin from taking 180 Oxycodone-5MG's a month. No matter how many oxycodones I had, they were limited by mostly being used to react to the pain. Even if I took it continually, it was a hassle, and you have to sleep! I would wake up from the pain when they wore off, and they were losing effectiveness.  The first month I switched to 90mg, I had no pain, I was a little sleepy, and I had a minor bit of constipation, but no pain!  2nd month I had some pain, but nothing I couldn't live with. This continued on for another year at this level. Then gradually it crept up to where I became tolerant of it. I'm still better off than what I was without it, and way better off than I ever was on the Oxycodone, but its time to increase it again. Unfortunately I have a doctor that is fixed on numbers rather than results, that is one of the pitfalls of using COAT(Continious opioid analgesic therapy) with MSContin. And of couse, if you ever have to replace your doctor, it may be difficult to find another one to continue the therapy. You may also run into the &quot;Don't give opioids with Fibro&quot; mantra, that we all know comes from people who have never experienced Fibro.  I do like that it preempts, and prevents the pain rather than trying to react to it later with a med like percocet. I do still take MSIR for breakthrough, but up until very recent I rarely needed to use it.  Though it didn't knock out all of my pain, it is the best I have done on any medicine, with the least side effects, and I've tried a lot of things. To help the constipation - eat a handful of dried apricots every day, and a few almonds every day, and drink extra water. Just plain water, not tea or soda or coffee.  It will absorb the water, and help to keep things moving.  If you are willing to do this, you can probably avoid taking senokot or another laxative, though its still a good idea to have them around as occasionally you may need them.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39961

I may be forced to increase before long.(bad side effect is constipation).UPDATE 5-16-05 - still on 60mg 1x24hr capsule has been much better than any other pain med for my ruptured discs and though I may have to take vicodin on some days if Ive done something to make the nerve pain much much worse and just laying down and stopping what Im doing doesnt help its still  been better over the long term than Oxy at 40 2x day was for me.  Down side Morphine is natural in the body and after long term use may have a problem /w body not responding to going off med. 1 reason I have tried not to increase 60mg is the least I can stand pain wise daily !!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17216
avinza	Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis	2005-04-25 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	MS Contin and Back Pain I have been taking MS Contin now for about 6 months and have found it to work well for thoracic back pain.  I have had 2 thoracic surgeries and everyone knows that after back surgery you are probably going to have chronic pain the rest of your life.  MS Contin works well for people with chronic back pain.  The good thing about MS Contin is that you only take it every 12 hours, and it works for about 10 of those hours.  There are times that I have to take Lorcet 10/650 for breakthrough pain, but not that often.  I have found that taking the MS contin in the morning and taking the Lorcet around 3pm works well.  By the time the Lorcet wears off, it is time to take the MS contin again.  The only side effect I have expierenced with the MS Contin is constipation.  You have to be careful where this is concerned.  Make sure you are sticking to a high fiber diet in order to stay regular.  Also, a good stool softner will do the trick too.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21880

So, she gave me Avinza, telling me that it had both immediate release and sustained release pieces inside the capsule. She told me to take two of them at 5 PM since,for some reason, I lot of my pain seems to start between 6 and 11 PM.  It worked initially, but after a couple weeks, I no longer felt it working in the evening at all, in fact, it doesn't help at ALL in the evening. I think maybe it helps me a bit in the morning and early afternoon, it's hard to tell.  I still end up taking all of my break-through meds every single day. Lori	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19556

avinza	Migraine	2004-09-15 00:00:00		3.0	3.5	5.0	3.5	Not Good for Migraines I am taking this preventatively, as a pain management strategy for bone pain actually.  As a frequent migraine sufferer, I was hoping initially that it would prevent or cancel my  migraines.  Here's what I've found:  The incidence of smaller, or day-to-day headaches, has decreased overall, and when I do get a mild-moderate headache, I can usually get by with a mild over the counter medicine. I believe the morphine has helped reduce the small headaches.   I used to have to take a strong prescription or narcotic several times a week for this.  However, if I have &quot;monthly&quot; or weather-driven migraines, the Avinza doesn't help at all, and the head pain is as intense as ever.  Though I have a constant dose of morphine, it just doesn't cut it for migraines.  However, for skeletal pain, it has been a miracle.  My advice: don't count on this for headaches... I think one may still need an emergency / breakthrough method on hand to use judiciously on the bad days.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/15673

avinza	Lupus	2004-03-06 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	MS contin with Breakthrough MSIR Using narcotics for pain management is a last step plan in my opinion.Everything else should be ruled out as having been tried and failed prior to going the route of addictive analgesics.However, having said that, and finding myself taking them I have to say that I have never felt less pain and continuous relief, rarely needing or using breakthrough instant release morphine sulphate. The cost may be prohibitive to some but IMO it is worth it for the relief in day to day living without the ups and downs other narcotics can give you... you have no highs or lows with 'contin' MS just constant and steady pain relief. IMO.... this gets an 8 for pain relief and long term relief!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3710
avinza	Migraine	2004-03-06 00:00:00		3.0	2.0	3.5	3.0	Same old narcotics problems MS Contin isn't really any better (or worse) than OxyContin or morphine; it has the same advantages (some decrease in pain intensity) and disadvantages (addiction, side effects, withdrawal, etc.) I am not currently taking any long-acting narcotics - they just don't do the job well. On the other hand, I haven't found anything that works better as a prophylactic migraine med, so there you go. Still, I feel that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1644
avinza	Osteoarthritis	2004-03-06 00:00:00		4.0	2.0	4.5	3.5	Best Treatment So Far After countless doctor visits (most in vain) I was referred to a doctor who started me out at 30mg. The drug provided relief right away but wasn't strong enough. I went on 60mg for a few months before settling at 100mg twice daily.  I still suffer from chronic pain but I also take Lortab (7.5mg) twice daily as well.  The pain is still present but I would hate to think what it would be without the medicine. Most other doctors are so afraid to prescribe narcotics that millions suffer needlessly.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2374
avinza	Scoliosis	2004-03-06 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	5.0	4.0	Very effective for my severe Flatback Syndrome I've been taking MS Contin for several years for severe Flatback Syndrome pain (pre- pain management, avg. 7 on a  pain scale of 10, post- pain management, it's an average of 3, as long as I'm not fool enough to spend too much time upright or trying to lay flat). I would not recommend it for garden-variety low back pain. MS Contin really isn't for mild to moderate pain, or short-term pain, or pain with a decent prospect of being controlled some other way. It's too slow to become fully effective (perhaps 2-3 weeks) to make sense for short-term pain. And there are very real neurological side-effects caused by the buildup of toxic metabolites with long-term use. Some of these side-effects can almost make one yearn for the days of uncontrolled back pain. You'd want to be very sure the &quot;disease&quot; is bad enough to be worth this sort of &quot;cure&quot; before opting for long-term opioid therapy. At its worst for me, I was trapped in my own apartment for months, unable even to open the door to the hallway, because even the briefest exposure to fluorescent lighting provoked severe migraines and sometimes partial seizures. I had to significantly reduce my dosage of the drug for almost a year and add two additional medications in order to get those long-term side-effects under control-- for now.Also, I've found, MS Contin alone isn't sufficient for relieving neuropathic pain (pain caused by damaged nerves). For that, I take Neurontin-- but I guess that'd be a whole 'nother rating :-)MS Contin is a day-in, day-out, must-take drug, assuming it is prescribed properly -- &quot;as needed&quot; shouldn't *ever* appear in a script. I currently take 30 mg 2X day, every day, no &quot;as needed&quot;. If I missed even one dosage without tapering off slowly, I'd go into opiate withdrawal just like any other patient in long-term pain management who takes MS Contin.  This is, by the way, dependency, not addiction. Many medications cause dependency -- Prozac	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10903

I have headaches, confusion, itch all over, and the pain does not go away completely. I do not like the side effects. I would rather have Oxy-contin 60mg or percocet 10-350mg.

avinza	Migraine	2003-06-08 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	4.0	Avinza -Ins covers cost Since my headaches are triggered by other pain Avinza is great for me.  Only very drowsy.  I think sometimes it releases more mg than others. Avinza works well for my milder pain and overall joint an muscle pain.  Drowsiness is the only side effect. I didn't realize how much I would appreciate NOT feeling like I was walking on sharp gravel first thing in the morning.  Since I began this med a week ago I have had less hand, foot, wrist, and knee pain.  I agree though that we should not have to fight doctors for pain medicine.  Addiction or dependence should be treated just like any other side effect of a medication, not a disease in itself.  I still have break-through pain and take Percocet for that.  Major side effects, it makes me drowsy and saps my motivation.  However it does enable me to type here with much less pain.  Trade off.  I tried literally dozens if not hundreds of other medications/herbs/ etc with no results, only side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6458

avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Primary progessive (PPMS)	2009-06-30 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	4.0	3.0	I just started taking Avonex 2 months ago. I have few to no side effects. By reading other reviews I gather it affects everyone differently. I don't yet know how it is helping slow the progression of the MS. My left hand and arm are numb and tingly and nothing has changed there since I started the shot.  I take my shot on Thursday about 3 pm with benadryl and asprin. Around 9 pm I become really tired (from the benadryl) and have a slight headache. When I wake up at 530 am I feel fine. I thought injecting myself would be hard, but the needle is very thin and does not hurt very much.  The needle is long, but you do not have to stick the entire needle in.  Not sure if insurance is helpful because I am a military member and it is covered by the government.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60447

The side effects are the same for me, pretty awful; chills, fever, horrible aches, sick all over feeling.   Once a week flu is much easier to deal with that 3 times a week (Rebif).  Also with Rebif I developed Raynaud's syndrome, had problems nearly daily with white fingers.  Has not happened once since I switched to Avonex.  I do wish they would prescribe something to made the rotten side effects easier to deal with.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59831

avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Relapsing-remitting (RRMS)	2007-10-07 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	0.5	2.0	I have been on Avonex for approximately 18 months.  I have had one MRI since the initial base-line and there was no further disease activity noted.  They also mentioned that some of the lesions may have been less noticeable.  I do have side effect from the injection on pretty much a regular basis.  They vary in degree.  Mainly they are mild flu like symptoms such as fever, chills, and body aches.  But there are times when they tend to be fairly severe.  I have not made a connection with anything that could cause the severity to increase.  I do drink a lot of water on the day and evening of my injection (and all of the time).  And I take the doctor recommended dosage of ibuprofen and Tylenol every time without fail.  My spouse administers my injections and that takes away a little of the difficulty, but I still do have pain with the injections about 50% of the time.

Ease of use, no pain, early day, pretty mild side effects that completely disappear after the first month, a manufacturer that goes out of their WAY to make sure you are ok with every single aspect (Biogen Idec has been absolutely incredible since my 03-07 diagnosis...right down to making sure I get the tiny needles, as opposed to the larger ones! Would you have expected a pharm company would care about that??? I didn't. All the phenomenal materials they send are uplifting, useful, and wonderful). Essentially....and I know this will sound crazy...but life is ok with this. I am not freaking out. A fine company that cares is making the best MS therapy out there and I am so grateful to have the opportunity to be on it. It is absolutely going to stop the progression of anything in me!

It's a drug that has NO side effects and has helped ease my dealing with this disease. It should be the first drug administered.

When I first took the prefilled syringes, I had suicidal dreams and terrible flu like symtoms for 3 days a week. I went off for about a month then the doctor restarted me on a tapered dose with  the type I had to mix myself.  I started slowly tapering up the dose for 11 weeks. On the 11th week, 3 days after I took the full 30mcg dose, I suffered a heart attack at work. I was rushed to the Emergency Hospital and they did an emergency Heart Catherization and found damage to my Left anterior descending artery in my heart. They said I had no plague in my arteries. My Cholesterol count is a low 145.  The cardiologist check me for every other disease and said it was the avonex that caused inflammation to the artery and then it scared up causing a blockage. I am doing well now and I am not taking any medication for my MS. I am scared to death to try anything else. I am waiting for a miracle drug that will be a cure. I don't want to fill my body with poison that they can only give you a possible 30% chance of slowing this disease down. I don't want to risk liver failure, kidney failure or Heart failure for such poor odds.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53370
avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Relapsing-remitting (RRMS)	2006-11-29 00:00:00		2.0	0.5	0.5	1.5	fair Avonex did allow me to sleep better at night by eliminating my burning legs, but the weekly injections and 24 - 36 hours of flu like symptoms were difficult.  After over 4 years and 200+ self inflicted injections I thank God Tysabri is available, I have had 4 Tysabri infusions so far with no leg burning, improved balance and twice the slowdown of my disease progression (according to the published reports).  For me the ZERO (to date) cases of PML in MS patients taking Tysabri alone convinced me to take the risk of being the first PML case rather than the virtual certainty of more rapid disease progression on Avonex (or any of the other CRAB drugs).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53351
avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Relapsing-remitting (RRMS)	2006-11-22 00:00:00		2.0	1.0	2.5	1.5	Flu problems each week? bah! My MS progressed, I had flu symptoms each week, and I had 3 relapses within 15 months...not the medication for me!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53085
avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Relapsing-remitting (RRMS)	2006-11-18 00:00:00		3.0	2.5	2.0	2.5	difficult getting used to injections I had 2 exacebations in the first year I was on the medication.  Some symptoms have subsided but still have residual aspects of every symptom I had. (leg pain, vision loss, fatique, cognitive issues, right side weekness, numbness and tingling).  Side effects of medication occurred during the next 24 hours and included headache, muscle aches and fatigue.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52811
avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Progressive relapsing (PRMS)	2006-11-13 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	Good overall, I learned after I stopped for a whil After nine years, I was experiencing fatigue the day or two after the shot. I mainly have symptoms in my legs/bladder. In Aug/Sept 1, I decided to stop for a while to see if I felt better. The PT that I was working with noted that the intention tremor on my right side was getting worse and overall, my legs feel weaker which scares the bejesus out of me. I am also on a number of other meds for other conditions, so life is a juggling act, as most of you know. So, I am waiting to see if my phys. wants to do solumedrol or go back on the Avonex - personally, I prefer to go back on, and then I will be able to track it. It helps to have an objective person observe you - such as the PT person that I have. So overall, I have found it much worthwhile.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52568
avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Secondary progressive (SPMS)	2006-11-09 00:00:00		2.5	0.0	1.5	1.5	hmmm...just not sure Took Avonex for close to 10 years.  Had 'flu-like' symptoms for 7-8 years although pre-medicating w/ motrin helped.As far as I am concerned, the intra-muscular shot hurt!  It did help letting it come to room temperature.I stared LDN 10/20/2006 and stopped injections at that time.  My hubby gave them to me---no way was I going yo inject myself!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52332
avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Secondary progressive (SPMS)	2006-11-07 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	3.0	4.5	Very helpful Avonex helped me to maintain my status and improve for about 4 years.  I hated intermuscular shots.  My husband gave them to me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52336
avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Relapsing-remitting (RRMS)	2006-11-07 00:00:00		2.5	2.0	5.0	2.5	It could be worse I took Avonex a couple yrs ago, i was sick 5 days out of 7.  I stopped and went on copaxone for a yr, eventually I had terrible reaction and had to call an ambulance 2 diff times,  I took nothing for a yr and am now back on avonex, I am sickish the day i get the injection but ok the following day. Totally diff reaction from the first time I took it.  I have had an exacerbation going on now for about 6 weeks, I am hopefull it will end soon.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/46748

avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Relapsing-remitting (RRMS)	2006-11-05 00:00:00		4.0	1.5	1.0	3.0	overall beneficial After 12 years...I can still do (at least get by) what I need to (i.e. work, recreation, etc.).Become limited though rather quickly. I can attribute this to God and, I  guess, Avonex.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52237
avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Relapsing-remitting (RRMS)	2006-11-01 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	4.5	3.5	New User- Tips for No Side-Effects and Pain-Free.. New User- Tips for No Side-Effects and Pain-Free Injections!!!I just started with Avonex today. I would like to post a journal of sorts for anyone who is seeking answers to their questions. This is a &quot;layman&quot; point of view. I apologize for the length in advanced.FIRST INJECTION: Anxious, Injection (by Doctor)stung a little, felt a little weird/funny (vague sick sensation)and nauseous 1/2-1 hour after injection. 4 hours after I started to feel slightly achy. 6 hours after I felt like I had the flu: slight fever, muscle aches, chills, irritability.* *Took 2 Tylenol** 9 hours after I started to feel better. 12 hours after I felt completely fine.***I think a POSITIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE is key to dealing w/MS and the side effects of treatment. Try not to focus on the side effects, keep telling yourself you might feel like garbage for a little while but you WILL NOT succumb to them. I could not face giving the injections to myself and did not feel comfortable with anyone but a professional giving them to me so I opted to make weekly appointments with my Doctor. Once I get used to the feelings of the needle and get over my anxiety I will train in the self-injection procedure. Our fear may lead to apprehension and overwhelming feelings. We didn't choose this life altering condition and now we have a million of decisions to make regarding our health. Some people may find that talking to a therapist will help them keep a postitive outlook. If that is not feasible, a support group could also help. Just make sure it's not a pity party. Remember, keep POSITIVE and choose a treatment plan that makes YOU feel the most comfortable!!!One way to look at it; a few years ago, there was NO treatment whatsoever!!!! We are lucky that there are treatments available now! They ARE NOT a cure but they CAN help improve our quality of like. Currently there is research being done to find a CURE for MS. I KNOW THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN W	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23077
avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Relapsing-remitting (RRMS)	2006-11-01 00:00:00		1.5	0.5	0.5	1.5	A nightmare! I was informed of the side effects and told if I should experience any of the side effects to take a Tylenol before the injection. TYLENOL............it was a terrible experience, as if you had the worst FLU imaginable. The drug itself made me feel disabled. I think the dose should be started in small amounts and gradually increased as your body is able to adjust to the drug. I wasn't able to function, for at least two or three days and by the time I felt myself again, it was time for the next injection.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52046
avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Relapsing-remitting (RRMS)	2006-10-31 00:00:00		2.5	2.0	2.5	2.0	did nothing I was on avonex for about a year and a half. The shots did not bother me and the price was mostly covered by my insurance. I had flu-like side effects after every shot, but they only lasted for a day or so. My biggest complaint is that I feel like it did nothing for me. I did not have any relapses, but I progressively got worse, more numbness, more dizziness and balance problems. ms hug at times and l'hermittes sign also.  I wanted to switch to LDN after reading about it on this site, but MS doctor said no. I went to another Ms doctor and she also said no. I went to my pcp and he said why not give it a try. Well I am glad I did.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/50575
avonex	Multiple sclerosis - Relapsing-remitting (RRMS)	2006-10-06 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	Quit Avonex - Best Decision I've Made I took Avonex for about a 1 1/2 years and recently quit 5 months ago.  I chose to quit after once again being forced to stay in bed the entire day after the injection.  The injections were hard b/c of the large needle &amp; intra-muscular shot - it always hurt me.  I had tried Rebif before Avonex &amp; could not tolerate the horrendous side effects &amp; the injections were incredibly painful with the stinging the Rebif caused.  As far as Avonex, the flu-like symptoms were severe after every shot, sometimes alot worse than other times, you never knew how bad it would be.  I did the prescription Naproxen &amp; all of the other advice that is given to help with the side effects but they only slightly helped.  I had severe headaches, nausea, aches, fever, &amp; literally had to stay in bed for at least the day after the shot.  I had a severe relapse while taking Avonex &amp; my MS symptoms were worse while taking Avonex.  I decided that my quality of life today was important &amp; the statistics for Avonex were not good enough for me to stay on it.  I have felt better the last 5 months since being off of any CRABS than I have since diagnosed almost 3 years ago.  I had wanted to try LDN but my specialist refused.  I am not taking anything right now.  I exercise, eat better, rest, meditate &amp; have a positive attitude &amp; feel better than I have in years.  I am reminded everyday that I have MS by the symptoms that I have but at least I don't have to deal with the side effects on top of that from the CRAB drugs.  For me, quitting Avonex &amp; all CRAB drugs was one of the best decisions I have made.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21679
