abilify	Agitated State	2012-10-15 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I see the negative comments here, but I have to say that this drug at 2mg saved my life. I was going out of my mind for months with high anxiety (and no apparent cause). I was under a psychiatrist's care but really felt no hope. I was taking 22.5 mg Remeron and that didn't do it, but then he sdded just 2mg Abilify and the drug relieved the anxiety in a day ... one day. I can't say enough good things about this drug, simply wonderful. It is now a year later and I am still taking 2mg Abilify along with 22.5mg of Remeron and feel GOOD, and those of you that can relate to that high angst know what I mean when I say GOOD (normal).	-

abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2012-09-27 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I suffered from extreamly loud voices and wild dellusions before taking Abilify.  At 30mg once a day, I am now symptom FREE, and have been for 3+ years.  I know my case is a rare one in that it was so effective with no percievable side effects.  But I believe this drug is a step in the right dirrection for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoeffective dissorder...	-
abilify	Agitation	2012-08-23 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	0.5	0.5	I was given 2mg of Abilify along with 10mg of lexapro. I was instructed to take them at night before bed, the following is my expierences: the first thing I noticed was that no matter what I could not sit/lay still I was constantly kicking my legs and thrashing around. The constant movement coupled with racing thoughts would not allow me to fall asleep. I have never had racing thoughts until I took the drug!! Luckily they were not depressing or violent, but more goofy in nature. Eventually I went to get out of bed and things rapidly went downhill. Immediately I was nauseus and as I attempted to make it to the bathroom I became incredibly dizzy at that point an intense ringing began in my ears and I fainted hitting my head on a door frame. I then attempted to steady myself and go back to bed i failed 3 more times each time tunnel vision and ringing in my ears. These symptoms continued into the next day, I will not take this again.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2012-08-09 00:00:00		2.5	2.0	4.0	1.0	Helps with the upswings, but seems to leave only depression. So bad that I have spent the last week pretty much in bed, I am so uniterested in life right now its ridiculous. When I first started I fainted 2 times, so I had to cut the dose in half. I am still on half the dose for the past month and a half and am unsure if its the abilify causing this depression or something else, but I haven't felt this bad in years.	-
abilify	Agitated State	2012-07-23 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	5.0	2.0	This drug is HORRIBLE. I am a 19 yr old girl standing at 5'6&quot;. I was at size 5, 120 lbs. (Underweight) I took this for 4 months and got to size 13, 170 lbs. 8 months later, I have the metabolism of a 39 year old at 150 lbs, size 9. The weight gain intensified my mental instability, ruining my self image and happiness.	-
abilify	Schizophrenia	2012-07-03 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	0.5	Although this drug relieved the symptoms, I developed compulsive gambling as a result of taking this medication.  If you have also experienced this side effect, please  contact me me ASAP:gambilify@gmail.com	-
abilify	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	2012-06-24 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	I have severe obsessive compulsive disorder. I had been on Lexapro, AND I was doing well after 2 years I went off it. I was doing well for a few months, and then my OCD spiraled out of control. I started taking Lexapro again 3 weeks ago. Last week I was still doing horribly. My Psychiatrist put me on 2 MG of Abilify and it seemed to kick in for me the next day. I'm not perfect, but my OCD thoughts are much less. I'm not ruminating. I don't have rituals, just obsessive thoughts. They're practically gone in one week. This medicine seems to have done the trick for me thus far. I have just started CBT therapy too. My appetite has increased. I don't know if it's actually from the Abilify.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2012-03-28 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	I at first was eager to try this new med about 3 years ago.  I started to realize over time that I was losing interest in what I enjoyed most.  I stopped reading, listening to music as it became all noise in my head. I gained over 40 pounds and became even more depressed.  When I brought this concern up to my doctor he increased the medication which brought on worsened symtoms like paranoia and difficulty sleeping.  I started slowly weaning off and experienced restless leg syndrome and more paranoia.  They need to take this med off the market!!  Plus the co-pay is expensive,\.	-
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2012-02-12 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	5.0	0.5	what a nightmare!!! and from only 5mgs!!! made me weak, clumsydid not help with Panic/anxiety/agoraphobia disorders, I was on 2mg's for a month, didn't notice anything, until the jump to 5mg's. I feel poisoned now, and afraid to continue using this drug....should be named Disabilify, it crippled me literally	-
abilify	Post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)	2011-10-20 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	5.0	I have been on Abilify from 20 to 30 mg/daily for over 4 years and have had no inpatient hospitalizations.  I have not needed any lithium for over 4 years as well.  All I need is anxiety medication upon occasion.  Vision blurry and weight gain are main side effects.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2011-07-31 00:00:00		3.0	1.0	5.0	2.5	Caused blurry vision. I had to stop driving at night. I quit the meds and my vision cleared up. Took it with Lamictal and it worked well	-
abilify	Autism	2011-07-31 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	4.5	4.0	Seemed to help a lot with OCD symptoms associated with autism..also my son seemed to no longer be in a fog like he has been for many years, much clearer thinking	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2011-05-16 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I finally got a diagnosis after years of being considered depressed.  Tried 60 to 80 mg of Prozac, which made my legs restless.  (AWFUL feeling!).  So we backed down to 40 mgs of prozac and added 10 mg of Abilify.  WoW! What a difference!  I had lost interest in everything until I started on it.  I'd like to increase to 15mg, to see if it would help with my being tired in the a.m...Still would like to be a bit more active and interested in doing things that I should be doing.  Still have a dislike of people in general, though.  I don't work and I am afraid to go &quot;out there&quot; again...	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2011-05-16 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	5.0	4.0	I was on Abilify for about 5 to 6 months. I did saved my life. My manic depression was under control for the first time. I have Abilify +200mg Zoloft. I barely remember what happened before Abilify. That was how effective it was. The only side effect I have was weight gain. Huge. I gained 20 lbs the first 10 weeks. I did not bother me much as I was slightly underweight at the start (bmi 18). After 6 months, I was totally overweight (bmi 25), gained in total close to 40 lbs. Needles to say, I asked my doctor to stop this treatment.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2011-01-31 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	Abilify took away my mania symptoms and left me feeling safe from those high mood swings. I would recommend it to anyone who has bipolar disorder.	-
abilify	Depression	2010-12-27 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	5.0	It was with deepest regret that I had to stop taking Abilify. Along with my main depression medication I took 5 mg a day and it put me over that hump to where I finally felt like myself again after two years of struggling to find the right mix of drugs. I had always been a fairly cheerful person and this allowed me to truly enjoy my life again and not just try to enjoy it. However, after several months, 3 or 4, I began to move my jaw from side to side throughout the day. At first I didn't think too much of it, but then it became more exaggerated and more constant. It never occurred to me that this was a drug side effect, but it was embarrassing and annoying. My close friend finally asked me about it and then said I should tell my doctor. He immediately stopped my Abilify and although it took about 6-8 weeks to stop it did finally go away. I was fortunate as with this drug it could have been permanent. This was the ONLY side effect I had. It broke my heart to stop taking this drug.	-
abilify	Depression	2010-12-27 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	2.5	0.5	OMG! I used this medication in addition to Lexapro, because besides Depression, I have PTSD. And I must say that I repent 100 times that it was added. I slowly but surely started to have vivid nightmares and crying bouts constantly. I felt hopeless and worthless. I started getting ideas of killing people around me(which I NEVER, EVER had or even thought of doing EVER! I felt I never could go out without anyone going with me. Even driving made me quiver!I finally called my mom one day and she told me to go to the E.R. and there Mental Health Crisis Center helped me wean off this terrible drug. See, Lexapro, wasn't helping me, so my Dr. thought it was safe to add Abilify. But, Thank God today I am on another medication and I have no thoughts of Suicide or Killing anybody and I would not recommend this to ANYONE! Please be aware if you are looking into this, so, that this doesn't happen to you too.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2010-10-23 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	5.0	Before taking Abilify I spent years looking for the right medication. In this time I was often deeply depressed &amp; went back &amp; forth between not caring whether I lived or died, and being VERY suicidal. I often felt &quot;crazy&quot;, and had periods of depersonalization or derealization, during which I had no energy or motivation and isolated myself. Other times I had lots of energy &amp; would have fits of rage or sadness, involving screaming, crying, &amp; violence towards both myself &amp; others. Other times yet, I was very happy, extremely confident, and very promiscuous.Irritability was a constant, as was impulsiveness (which led to much regret).Since taking Abilify (7.5mg daily), I have still felt a wide range of emotions, but none of them have been extreme, or uncalled for, and negative feelings haven't lasted long. It's what I imagine being &quot;normal&quot; feels like.I behave like an average, respectable person &amp; make good decisions.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2010-07-18 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	I have been on this drug for 5 years. I have taken between 10-15 mg a day. I first started taking Abilify while in a manic episode. I have never had severe depression or mania while taking Abilify. The only side effect I have encountered is a slight twitch in my foot. The benefits out weight the side effect for me. I have never taken any other bi-polar meds.	-
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2010-05-23 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I love Abilify.  I have taken this drug for 2 years.  I take 30 mg. each morning and 15 mg. in the afternoon.  I do not have any side effects.  Without Abilify I am excessfully anxious and have continuous panic attacks.  With Abilify, I can deal with everyday problems. My only problem is the cost of this drug.  I am on Social Security disability for having Bipolar.  I do have Medicare Part D.  Right now I have fallen in the donout hole.  My Abilify for a 90 day supply was $1,750 at CVS.  I like to have fell over.  I started crying at the drug store.  The only alternative was to order the generic Abilify over the internet on a strange website.  I wish Abilify price would come down so I can afford it. I also take Lamictal 200 x 2 a day, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Xanaz and Ambien. I really need help. I have applied to drug company and was denied assistance since I have Part D Medicare. Any ideas?	-
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2010-05-02 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	5.0	I am 40 and have been taking Abilify for over two years now and for me it has been a life saver. It has made my life tolerable to extremely livable depending on the day. I have had no major side effects other than a bit of weight gain. I work out regularly at a moderate rate to counter this. The crazy thoughts and swings have subsided because of this medication. I am working and my family has noticed a significant difference in my ability to function under stress because of this medication. I can not say enough good about it.	-

abilify	Autism	2009-12-21 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	My son was placed on Abilify after being diagnosed at 5 with autistic tendencies, Adhd, and bipolar.. I feel like I got my little boy back after putting him on this medicine. Less repetitive behaviors, less anger outbursts, ability to focus increased, better communication skills and less insomnia. I feel that Abilify is wonderful for treating the conditions that my son has been diagnosed with.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61845
abilify	Depression	2009-12-21 00:00:00		4.0	1.5	4.5	2.5	Added as supplement to prozac.  Found immediate increase in energy.   However, using just 5mg per day, I found myself with moderate restlessness, inability to relax and intermittent sleep at night.  I had high hopes because of it's early effectiveness but this is too much.  I halved the dosage and will give that a week or so but if there is no improvement, I will ask the Dr. to recommened something else.  Any suggestions for a supplemental aid to prozac?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61843
abilify	Depression	2009-12-16 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	3.0	well it is only my first day taking abilify.  i currently take paxil 30 mg as well.  today i took abilify 10mg.  the effects i have noticed so far are after taking it i felt extreme fatigue, but not sleepy.  definitely less anxious... my body temp feels higher than norm.  it completely killed my appetite.  do feel sort of restless now after 5 hrs from taking it	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61813
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-12-11 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	4.0	5.0	I was so disappointed I had to stop taking this due to horrible muscular side effects (crippling neck pain and tightness). It worked wonders for me. It stopped my mixed episodes, made me happy without being manic, made me rational and organized and able to think! It turned me into myself for the first time in years. All I could do was sit back and be amazed. My friends were amazed, too, at how much more myself I was. It was brilliant! So I say it is definitely worth a try, it might be brilliant for someone else as well.Regrettably I had to go off it due to the side effects. I had horrible neck pain, it felt like my head was being squeezed in a vice, and I felt like I was going to throw up, the pain was so bad. It was dreadful. And a shame, because the med worked so well for the BPII. I would recommend it still.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61790
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2009-11-20 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	3.0	I started taking 2mg Abilify 3 weeks ago. I am already on 30mg Cymbalta and 100mg Lamotrigine twice daily but was still feeling down and crying easily so the doc put me on Abilify. I felt great until a week ago.  I have had shortness of breath which is giving me anxiety attacks and the beginning of a panic attacks. Needless to say, as of this morning I've decided to stop taking it. I read last night that this is a serious side effect and you should go to emergency. My doctor isn't in on Fridays (today) and won't be in until Monday at 1:00. Frustrated! On the positive side, I did NOT gain weight. I have actually been losing it. I feel so much better but this side effect has ruined it for me. I hope there is another drug that will make me feel so good mentally. I would tell people to give it a try. If you don't like it don't take it....in the end it's up to you.  Thanks for listening.  I just had to put my opinion and experience with this drug out there.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61629
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-11-04 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Have only been on Abilify for about 7 days.  So far so good, but don't want to be misleading to others.  So far am tolerating ok, but having symptoms that may have been there prior to beginning treatment, but can't remember as I sometimes suffer from placebo effects and if a side effect is mentioned I often think it is related to the new treatment rather than being able to differentiating from prior symptoms.  Keeping my fingers crossed	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61495
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2009-10-21 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	3.0	I am on my 5th day of Abilify (2 mg in the morning). I started on a Saturday because I was so worried about the side effects and didn't want to deal with those when I had to go to work. I am also on Lamictal 350 mg/day and Wellbutrin. So far, I am in a better mood during the day and have energy. I have had a headache since I started, some days worse than others. My stomach is a little upset and I don't have much of an appetite....nothing sounds good. I am still on Geodon at night, but am weaning off that within the next week or so. I don't have any problem sleeping at night...in fact, I am very tired. But not during the day, which is what's important. Hopefully the 2 mgs will work...it sounds like the higher the dose the more side effects you experience. Good luck to everyone!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61360
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2009-10-13 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	Within a month of taking it I gained 15 pounds, despite that I worked out 5 days a week.  It made me insanely hungry nothing felt like enough. Mouth watered, these were the reasons why I stopped, the hunger felt like a constant obsession, while it stops the obsessive thoughts, it gave me obsessive hunger. wtf. Tradeoff not worth it. Better since I stopped, I stop eating after I have a meal, now it registers in my mind that I am not hungry anymore. Never had this problem before this med.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61297
abilify	Depression	2009-10-02 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	So far I've been on 2.5mg dose Abilify for a week as an add on to Wellbutrin. So far its working good. This is the first med that has worked effectively for me. Wellbutrin alone dosent do much. I've been a lot less depressed and irritable, calmer. The only side effect is sleepyness. I need 8 hours of sleep not too feel tired throughout the day. Without it, I can normally go with 6.5 or 7hours.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61193
abilify	Depression	2009-09-25 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Have had atypical depression &amp; anxiety for 20+ years. Recently began Pristiq after Cymbalta pooped out. After 3 mo. it helped &quot;some&quot; but FATIGUE was at an ALL TIME LOW. Thought I might have to quit work &amp; go on disability. Cried all the time, couldn't socialize, go anywhere, or do anything. 2 wks. ago I asked  Dr. to add Abilify. Very 1st day I had more energy!  Has been 2 wks. &amp; has been a MIRACLE drug for me. Went from suicidal thoughts to enjoying life again! I take a 2 mg tablet 7:30. AM. Have had NO side effects but trouble falling asleep at night. Also take Klonopin for anxiety &amp; sleep. Started taking calcium/magnesium at night too. Tried adding Tylenol PM but had trouble waking up next day. Recently added Estroven PM  &amp; I'm falling asleep much easier &amp; less tossing &amp; turning from hot flashes. Also take 1/2 vicodin 3-4 X's day for back pain &amp; 72mg Concerta ER in AM.  Concerta was SUPPOSED to help fatigue but I was still basically unable to function until I started the Abilify.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61149
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-09-20 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I was just diagnosed w/Bipolar II after being treated for depression &amp; anxiety.I’m on Cymbalta &amp; when my Dr. decreased my dosage to 30 mg from 90 &amp; added 2.5mg of Abilify, I stabilized. Then he changed diagnosis from depression to Bipolar II. It's like an evil spirit was excorcised from my soul (metaphor to describe futility of struggling with something that felt out of my control.) I've been wildly productive for a month &amp; feel great. I don't sweat the small stuff now, most of which would become huge &amp; suck me down into a pit of depression. Now it's like 'everyone get out of my way, I have art to make.'I hope this lasts. I never felt this good before &amp; I'm 39, so I have a lot to catch up on.Don’t give up. If meds don't feel right, tell your psychiatrist.Research everything you're prescribed. Read the info that comes w/them.Too high a dosage can cause negative side effects but just the right one may not.I wish more people find success with their meds &amp; treatment.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/61094

Only side affects:  severe constipation (take a laxative or 6); restlessness (hey, better than  what I felt before!); difficulty falling to sleep (up the trazadone).  Otherwise, it's a great med.  Why didn't I try it sooner!!!!!!?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60999
abilify	Schizophrenia	2009-08-18 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	3.5	0.5	Experienced loss of appetite within the first few days of taking Abilify, became extremely fatigued, some abdominal pain. Found out a few days ago that Abilify was giving hepetotoxicity. Made my skin yellow, urine very dark. I feel miserable, stopped taking the meds a few days ago but still can't eat very well and want to sleep all the time. Haha the noises I was hearing stopped, but It pretty much made everything else 10 times worse.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60833
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-08-14 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	4.0	5.0	I have been diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder for about 10 years, and have been on every medication on the market.  My disorder favors the depressive side, and I am taking Lamical 200mg, Wellbutrin 200 mg, and Trazadone to sleep.  I am usually well controlled, but I still have an average of two intense episodes of depression a year. The last episode of depression, I actually considered suicide.  My psychiatrist prescribed Abilify 10 mg as an adjunct therapy and my symptoms improved dramatically!  This is the best that I have felt in years!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60802
abilify	Depression	2009-07-29 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	I had some pretty adverse side effects to this medication. I was using it in adjunction with Depakote for my depression. Immediately I was in a state of constant fatigue, irritability and vomiting. I was throwing up everywhere. Not fun. It may work well for others but for me, being a sleepy, vomiting mess was not my idea of alleviating depression. I would also like to note that I was only taking 2.5 mg a day, half of the smallest recommended dose. I can't even imagine what the full 5 would have done.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60688
abilify	Depression	2009-07-24 00:00:00		1.5	1.5	5.0	1.5	I was on lexapro for two months without seeing any results so my doctor put me on abilify also. I am only on 5 mg and the side effects are aweful. I am so restless i cant sit still and my anxiety has gotten worse. I have head aches almost everyday and i get so dizzy and tired after i take it. It hasnt even done anything for my depression so i am going to talk to my doctor about stopping it next week	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60635
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-07-23 00:00:00		3.5	3.0	4.0	4.5	I just recently have resumed taking abilify.  I stopped taking it first time due to strange side effects. I have since tried numerous drugs similar to abilify. Im my opinion, Abilify's benefits far outweigh the negatives.In the beginning I experienced slight drowsiness at first, and also began gagging.  I am experiencing the same side effects the second time around as well.  The gagging is apparently a pretty rare side effect.  I ended feeling better than ever after getting adjusted and finding the right dosage (about 6 weeks).I am being treating for Bipolar II, ADHD, depression, and PTSD.  I know that abilify isn't for everyone, but I have had wonderful results with it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60630
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2009-07-13 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	Problem with this med is the Doctors over-prescribe. I take 2.5 mg (5mg pills cut in half to save  money). It is extremely effective and I have no side effects. Comparing to the reported side effects, I have opposite effects. It actually stabilized my sugar levels and I'm not as hungry, I feel an increase in libido, I can sleep, and all other stress / anxiety symptoms have disappeared. I have tried several meds and this is the only one that made me normal again. Lamictal made me feel like I was dying. I'm bipolar, was mostly manic, every day. I also take atenolol for my heart rhythm / rate.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60544
abilify	Asperger's Syndrome	2009-07-10 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	My husband is taking 5mg. of Abilify a day for his Asperger's, and he is back to the man I fell in love with years ago! His symptoms seem to get worse the older he gets, just like his dad's did, and an anti-deppresant helped some but he needed something more. One day last week he missed his pill and by noon the next day told me he could barely string together a coherant thought. He said his head felt like it was stuffed full of &quot;oily cotton&quot; and it was too much of an effort to think, much less to think rationally. He said this is how he'd been feeling for the past few years, which explains a lot of the horrible decisions he'd been making. It had gotten so bad that I had one foot out the door before he started Abilify, but in the past couple of months things have made a 180. We're about to celebrate our 15-year anniversary, and for the first time in years I'm actually looking forward to 15 more!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60523

abilify	Depression	2009-06-14 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I've had no side effects from Abilify and it brought me out of a deep depression within two weeks with 10 mg a day along with me already taking Cymbalta 60 mg per day.  I highly recommend this prescription drug in combination with another antidepressent.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60308
abilify	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	2009-06-03 00:00:00		3.5	1.0	5.0	2.5	When I first tried 10mg of Abilify in the afternoon I became very sleepy, probably due to its antihistamine effects. That night I woke up after about 5 hours of sleep and couldn't sit still for the rest of the night. I simply felt I couldn't get into a comfortable position. The next day I was tired and slightly confused, and almost completely unmotivated and slept several times throughout the day.A few days later I tried half the dose, with about half the side effects. I tried this for a few days and did notice some relief from OCD in the morning, but the side effects were still intolerable.It works, likely due to its 5-HT2a antagonism, but only if you can tolerate the dopamine and histamine antagonism.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60214
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-05-21 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	4.0	0.5	I asked for this drug because a friend with Bipolar I took it and suggested it when I didn't tolerate Geodon very well. Within a week of starting this medication I developed severe akathisia... very agitated, crawiling out of my skin all the time, couldn't sit still and was overwhelmed with panic on the edge of complete terror, especially being out of the house ... had a lot of uncontrollable anxiety attacks, crying fits, etc.It did not help me with depression at all, I can't speak for hypomania or mood stabilization because I wasn't on it long and the side effects were far too severe to gauge any benefits.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60109
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-05-11 00:00:00		2.5	4.0	5.0	4.0	I started taking Abilify after a few months I was diagnosed bipolar and  before that  I was on risperdal..:(  and the Abilify was a major change which was much better.. I started on 15 mg. I was also given lexapro,cogentin for sides and ativan.Then later after a few weeks I was getting depressed  I was also a compulsive eater and manic so I gained 80- 90 lbs in 3 years... and then switched to geodon,prozac and cogenton but it made no difference in sides and weight gain, it added sleepyness tofor about 2 years on this med...Then I went back on Abilify 10 mg..a couple months ago and I feel ok just need to go up on dosage, but I dont know what to expect when the Abilify takes full affect yet.I am also on trileptol 900mg once a day and 1 mg of cogentin a day..I think this med has a different affect on everyone not all but most..	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/60008
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2009-05-02 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	3.5	3.0	I have had sever weight gain, insomnia, trembling and now I am having sick thoughts of wanting to be with young girls. I have never had any thoughts like this in my life and I am terrified!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59932
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-05-02 00:00:00		4.5	1.0	5.0	2.5	When my Zoloft 100mg stopped working, my pdoc prescribed Ability 5mg.  I tried for 1 month.  I could not sleep (wide awake every 1 to 2 hours), I was acting impulsively (eating and shopping and speaking sometimes) and that my mind was three sentences in front of my mouth (which made me sound like my brain was a bit on the fried side).  I dropped down to 2mg and nearly immediately had a return of the depressive symptoms/suicidality.  Bumped back up to 4-4.5 and returned to the aforementioned side effects.  I also gained 15lbs.  While I understand this medication works for some and it did work on the depression, the side effects were intolerable for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59928
abilify	Depression	2009-04-11 00:00:00		3.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	Four days ago, I started taking 2.5 mg of Abilify as an addition to the prozac I'm already on.   So far, so good, for the most part.  The only side effect so far is insomnia.   It used to be impossible for me to get up in the morning, and I could fall back asleep easily when awakened.  Now, if something wakes me up at night, which it frequently does, I lie in bed for hours, trying to get back to sleep. The odd thing, is, the insomnia at least makes it easy to wake up and stay awake during the day.  I have more energy, more motivation to get things done, and have even found myself smiling once in awhile.  Its the closest I've come to feeling &quot;almost normal&quot; in so long.   So far, with abilify, I've actually smiled a few times without having to force it, or even think about trying to appear &quot;happy&quot;.  I guess I can try to live without sleep.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59746
abilify	Borderline Personality Disorder	2009-03-24 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	3.0	Worked miracles for me as far as treating paranoia and delusions! It would have been the perfect med if not for the side effects. I would get muscle jerks and feel on edge- like drinking 20 cups of coffee, and extremely agitated and jittery. It got to the point where I couldn't tolerate the side effects unfortunately.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59613
abilify	Schizophrenia	2009-03-22 00:00:00		1.5	4.5	5.0	3.5	Well, I feel a little ambiguous about this med. It didn't give me any side effects, I have lost 6 kilos over six months while on it, but it simply wasn't effective for my symptoms. A higher dose just increased side effects, but did nothing to help my condition.This is a really good med to try if you suffer from schizophrenia med-induced weight gain, but as I said, watch out, cause the symptoms may come back.Hope it will work for you. :)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59593
abilify	Agitated State	2009-03-05 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	4.0	0.5	I was prescribed 5mg abilify tablets, nightly at bedtime, for anxious mood.  I have concerns about the diabetes side effect; however, I'm more worried about my restless legs!  I feel like I can't sit still and have to pace, yet my legs feel like they weight 200 lb. each!  Attention span is lacking as well.  Only benefit I personally feel is that it's easier for me to fall asleep after taking this.........basically restless and lethargic most of the time during the day..........wouldn't recommend this medicine for anyone.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59415
abilify	Asperger's Syndrome	2009-02-10 00:00:00		4.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	have a 4 year old son that started taking 1mg of abilify in april08. the medication seemed to be the answers to our prayers for about 3 months. then he returned to sleepless nights and self harm. at about six months, his doctor uped his dosage to 2mg a day. no positive changes occured! it has been 10 mos. since my son started abilify and i am noticing that he is starting to chew his tongue and his tantrums are getting more intense. the most positive effect of this drug has been his ability to be more social and accepting of outsiders. at this time i am struggling with the decision to continue this drug for treatment!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59218
abilify	Borderline Personality Disorder	2009-01-26 00:00:00		4.0	4.5	4.5	4.5	Before taking Abilify I was Harming myself frequently and was lucky to still be alive.  I would zone out and not even feel the pain.  After taking Abilify I couldn't even understand how I could have begun to get this serious urge to harm myself.  I took this medication for a few years and when I stopped after slowly lowering the 15mg dose to none, I was extremly sucidal and had effects like I was on some kind of meth.  Several other meds were tried over a period over about 5 weeks and the only thing that helped was to start back on Abilify.  It is a great med while you are on it but can a person ever get off of it?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/59098
abilify	Depression	2009-01-10 00:00:00		3.5	3.0	5.0	3.5	After literally years of trying different meds for dysthymia (which led to excessive sleeping and inactivity), Abilify seems to be helping.  I am awake when I'm supposed to be awake and i'm actually motivated to do things other than just fulfilling the minimum obligations in my life.  Side effects include considerable nausea and restlessness.  Also, I am on the verge of crying a lot but not because I'm sad... TV commercials, songs, well-wishing friends, etc. make me choke up from joy or sentimentality.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58963
abilify	Depression	2008-12-31 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	Abilify is the most horrible drug on the market; It worsens depression and anxiety. Other side effects include suicidal thoughts, uncontrolled saliva production, trembling, night mares, blurred vision.This product should be taken off the market, it does harm and has no benefits whatsoever.I used Abilify for 4 months and almost died from it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58877
abilify	Depression	2008-12-20 00:00:00		1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0	Cognitive-behavioral therapy is the best adjunct to treatment for major depression.The abilify depression commercial now on TV is misleading. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and medications are equally effective at treating depression, and CBT will reduce the likelihood of a relapse for depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy is effective at helping you re-interpret your depressogenic (or depression causing) thoughts in a different way. How you interpret the world is going to have a strong impact on your depression. But they don't mention CBT on commercials for abilify, and your psychiatrist, not being trained in psychotherapy, may not know CBT. Be sure to use all non-medication options first before using an antipsychotic for off - label applications given the potential for side effects for this drug. Abilify is an antipsychotic - don't believe the hype, this was not intended as an anti-depressant and the drug companies are simply trying to make more money.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58763
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-11-05 00:00:00		2.0	1.0	3.0	3.0	I'm a dental hygienist and found that this med made my hands tremor, so much so that I am need of going off it so that my hands don't shake. It is quite annoying and I just didn't get relief from my anxiety. Still having to take xanax to quell my nerves and am as paranoid as ever.... Anyone else get hand shakes/tremors?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58569
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-10-21 00:00:00		3.5	2.5	4.0	2.5	I began taking Abilify about three weeks ago, and although my moods seem to have stabilized, I am experiencing restlessness and at times a rapid heartbeat and palpitations. These side effects have not become reason enough to stop taking this medicine, but because my doctor started me off on a very low dose (2.5 mg) and I'm slowly increasing, I'm wondering if the side effects are more likely to get worse or if it's still possible for them to subside after taking the drug for a certain period of time, as maybe your body gets used to it? Does anyone have any thoughts on this?I also take Effexor XR 75 mg and Adderal 5 mg daily.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58506
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-10-16 00:00:00		2.5	4.0	3.0	2.0	Worked great for about a year for BPII. I was only on 5mg, so I didn't get tired, but I didn't notice a huge help, I would still have light mania and depression here and there. Then I started getting head ticks, and had to stop taking immediately.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58481
abilify	Cyclothymic disorder	2008-09-23 00:00:00		2.0	1.0	4.0	1.0	I was on this for 1 month. I really couldn't tell if it stabilized my mood because of all the negative side effects. I had EXTREME restlessness and insomnia. When I didn't have that, I was so tired that I could barely function.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58396
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-09-21 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	3.0	1.0	My Son Was put on abilify 10mg in the morning and 10 mg at night he is 7 years old he starting taking abilify, then 4 days after attacked me and my husband was put in a mental hospital for violence and 2 er visit before we finally figured out what was wrong with him so after 6 violent attacks on us and 3 hospital visits we finally figured it out we took him off and the next he was instantly better so just be careful	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58387
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2008-09-12 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	I have GAD and Major Depression. The abilify really helps manage the depression aspect of it. It's easy to take and haven't noticed any side-effects other than it makes me feel restless, but otherwise that's it. If you are on it, DON'T DRINK!!! As with any medication its a bad idea, but on abilify it will actually make you MORE depressed. I had to have my dosage increased because of that. Works very quickly, got me back up and running in a couple of days. You still have episodic bouts of depression for about the first 3 weeks, but far and few. After a month it's great.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58355
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2008-09-03 00:00:00		2.5	1.5	2.0	2.0	I have been on Abilify for a while now and at first it worked fine.  Later on, I experienced more and more side effects such as weight gain.  I could not lose weight even with eating right and exercise.  Overall, the medication is alright, but not for me.  I am getting it changed soon.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58319
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-08-28 00:00:00		4.0	0.5	4.0	2.0	My pdoc prescribed Abilify in conjunction with Depakote. The plan was to use Abilify while I titrated down from Depakote and then up with Lamictal (since Depakote and Lamictal can't be taken at the same time i.e. the Stevens-Johnson rash increase). For the first time in six years, I was not depressed. I am also on Celexa. But this was a pure happy feeling and it made me realize that other people must feel this way too. I was not used to such joy. It took four weeks to reach 50 mg. I became more agitated with each 10 mg. increase. By the time I did reach 50 mg, I felt EXTREME akathisia. I immediately began titrating off the med and within a week the main symptoms stopped. It took 25 days for it to fully leave my body. The depression reappeared.Akathisia is the the main side effect. Be aware.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58296

abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-08-09 00:00:00		1.5	3.5	4.0	2.5	Didn't help me a bit with the mania part of Bipolar Disorder, I was up to 10-15 mgs per day, allthough it was easy to take, gained a lot of weight while on it.  Might work for other people perhaps combined with other meds, but as we know, that is very hard to find sometimes.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58215
abilify	Borderline Personality Disorder	2008-07-25 00:00:00		2.5	2.0	3.5	3.0	My daughter is on this med after being hospitalized for 5 months.  I would probably have rated the med better but while in the hospital I felt they had her on much too high of a dose.  She was on 30mg daily plus Prozac 60 mg daily.  (If you read the literature that is double the max daily dose).  She was very &quot;blunted&quot;.  She is now on 20mg Abilify.  I am noticing side effects.  I also do not feel the doctors and counselors were listening to her.  Now that she is home I really like her counselor and doctor and we are slowly decreasing the med.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58156
abilify	Depression	2008-07-07 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	4.0	5.0	I have been taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder for 26 years.  Both of my parents died within the last year and after my mom died this May I started to descend into what I call the &quot;hole&quot;.  I could not concentrate or focus on anything even at work.  I was extremely anxious and even though I could not seem to be still I never accomplished anything.  I was constantly obsessing about things.I finally told my Dr. what was going on and he prescribed Abilify in addition to my other meds.  I take 5 mg twice daily and to me it is a miracle.I feel so much better and all the problems I was having have definitely improved even after less than 2  weeks.  Side effects are tolerable so far.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58049
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-07-02 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	I have bipolar II and am on 5mg of Abilify.  It has helped with the mania (hyperactivity) that I use to get. The bad thing is that I gained 7 pounds. I will be trying only 2.5mg to see if I get more energy and lose the weight. This helped me to be able to drop some Effexor that I was on - now I take 150mg instead of 225mg :-)  I feel kind of tired on this and lack motivation  and energy to do things but am very happy to not have the mania.  Caffeine helps bring my energy up so 3 cups of coffee a day works pretty well.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58022
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-06-24 00:00:00		2.0	1.0	3.5	1.5	I had most of all the bad side efffects	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57995
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-06-20 00:00:00		1.5	4.5	4.5	0.5	Soon after I started taking this, I started gaining weight. By the time I stopped I had gone from 155 to 192. No problem with the medication except that there was too little change in my feelings or behavior to warrant unlimited weight gain. Dr. said I had metabolic syndrome and now I am seeing a dietician and on a strict dietary program. Don't know if I'll ever get back to my normal habits. Now on Cymbalta nd quite happy with it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57982
abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2008-06-19 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	I was started on this medication after being stabilized after a major manic episode that required 2 months of hospitalization with Depakote.  The Depakote had some nasty side effects (major weight gain), so I was switched to Abilify,1 15mg tablet a day.  When on this medication, I had no episodes and few symptoms of mania for 18 months.  It wasn't until I went off of it (due to not being able to afford it, it's about $350-400 a month without insurance) that the symptoms returned.  It wasn't quite as effective for the depression, but I could function at least.  The pharmacutical company that manufactures Abilify rejected me for their patient assistance program, despite my low (read: none) income and history of hospitalization,  so seeing as it's about $13 a pill, it's not feasible for me to be on this medication via any legal means, so international online pharmacies, here I come. &gt;&lt;	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57979
abilify	Depression	2008-04-14 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	This medicine is great!  For such a tiny amount in a tiny pill it has really done the trick combined with the other medicine I am taking!  Hope it keeps working!  I am starting to lose weight, I can stay awake all day now, I get lots of chores done all day, I can organize better now, I am not as irritable as i used to be toward everyone and everything.  I am much happier now.  I am using only a 2 mg. tablet every day!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57680
abilify	Depression	2008-04-06 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Although it is not enough to treat my depression on its own, this medication is an important component of my medication cocktail. It is great at reducing my intrusive negative thoughts. Without it I become delusional and unable to function. The only side effect I have noticed is a tendency to gain weight. I have to really watch my diet while I take this medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57634
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-04-03 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Abilify saved my 8 year old son.  Not to mention me and his sister.  The constant  mood swings and violent outbursts were unbearable and getting worse with time.  He was wonderful at school (usually) and at his Dad's but an absolute monster with us.  We knew from the first week on Abilify that our sweet little boy was back and I didn't dread picking him up from school.  If I did not have insurance to cover this medication I would take a second or third job just to cover the cost - it has made such a complete difference in our lives.  I only wish I had seen the symptoms and admitted something was wrong years earlier.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57612
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-01-24 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	This medication has been AMAZING for my 9 year old son!  Have tried Geodon (side effects) and Zyprexa (gained 13 lbs. in 3 wks, didn't work).    Couldn't reach doctor during holidays, stopped Zyprexa, arrived on office doorstep on Jan 2, with son fully manic.  Doc said, &quot;We must stabilize before school starts!&quot;  Gave 5 mg. Abilify right there in the office.  Within 24 hours my son seemed absolutely NORMAL, just like he was before DX with BP!  I was in shock--the good kind!  Almost one month later the change in our family life is just unbelievable.  I have my great little guy back.  Oh, he also takes Adderall XR 25 mg and Strattera 25 mg twice a day.  Doing GREAT in school too!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57223
abilify	Borderline Personality Disorder	2008-01-15 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	I have struggled with BPD for 15 + years.  I have tried numerous meds with little to no success.   I was gaining weight and had no energy on seroquel, so my DR. switched me to Abilify (10mg)  It has been a miracle for me!!!  I am also on Zoloft (200mg)  in the am, i take Valium (30mg) throughout the day, and Trazadone (300mg) @ night.  I LOVE Abilify.  It has given me motivation and focus.  I actually feel happy ( so rare...)  I have not cut, purged, or drank since the switch.  Only thing I would mention is stiffness of my muscles.  ( nothing advil can't fix)  However, I would suggest and BPD's considering Abilify to get on an anti-anxirty med and some form of sleeping pill because it was the only way I could deal with the restlessness and insomnia.  As for me, I believe I found the perfect cocktail.   Hope this helps.   :)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57154
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2007-12-19 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	5.0	0.5	I was very happy while taking this drug. Unfortunately I was manic the entire tiime.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57020
abilify	Schizophrenia	2007-12-04 00:00:00		3.5	5.0	5.0	3.0	Abilify helped me become more motivated and gave me more energy but that was on the minimum dose. After raising the dose I became agiatated out of my skin, couldn't move, couldn't talk, couldn't do anything. Overall it didn't give me exactly what I wanted but it could definately work wonders for other people. Worth a try	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56952
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-10-16 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	5.0	0.5	Abilify is the WORST med I've ever tried! I was put on Paxil, Wellbutrin, and Lexapro before I was even diagnosed as Bi-Polar II. First I was told that I had Generalized Anxiety and Depression, then Hypomania, then GAD with Depression again. It was when I finally landed in the hospital that I was diagnosed as Bipolar II. When I left the hospital, I was on Lexapro and Abilify, with Vistaril for occasional panic attacks or sleeplessness. Abilify made me restless, about to jump out of my skin, ADD (I've always had a long attention span), and finally after about two weeks, I had one of the worst panic attacks I have EVER had. I literally felt like I was on a bad LSD trip. I kept hugging my mom and my two-year old niece because I was so freaked out. Abilify made me feel HORRIBLE. Fortunately, it was stopped right away, and now I'm on Lexapro and Trileptal instead, which is thus far working much, much better for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56755
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-10-11 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	5.0	This medicine pretty much saved me. I was so close to going back to my old days of self-injury; at the time I switched I was on Risperdal and Lexapro. Now I take Lexapro and Abilify. I can't believe what a difference there is. I had little or no side effects, and it has been working ever since! The only thing is that I may need to up my dosage (I'm only on 2 mg daily) because I occasionally feel a little bit of a mood swing (I have rapid cycling).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56733
abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2007-09-28 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	3.0	2.5	I felt less anxious on abilify, but I gained a lot of weight.  This was partly because taking the drug had a very negative effect on my ability to exercise.  I didn't have the energy or motivation;  Since exercise is very important to me, I had to stop the drug.  After a few weeks, I had lost the weight and was exercising nornmally.  I was disappointed since I had been told that abilify did not have these side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56662
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-09-28 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	1.0	0.5	This was the first medication that was prescribed after my diagnosis. I can't believe they would put anyone who is hypomanic on this drug. After 2 days, I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin. I was jittery, continued to not be able to sleep, and my thoughts raced even more! I wasn't really nauseated, but I lost my appetite. This medicine obviously didn't work with my brain chemistry.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56659
abilify	Agitation	2007-09-08 00:00:00		3.0	1.0	3.5	3.5	I noticed a big change in responses toward my anger and hostility.  I definitely recommend, everyone realizing that they need a little help and get it!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56565
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-08-23 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	I suffer from a mixed state and Abilify has not only stabilized me, but it's also made my thinking a lot clearer and rational. I am better able to apply cognitive restructuring and distress tolerance techniques. The only side effects from taking this drugs are: 11 pound weight loss (titrating off Pamelor concurrently), severe constipation, little to no appetite and I can't sleep more than 6-7 hours before springing out of bed, wide awake. I now have lots of energy and motivation to get my work done. Which is a good thing. I am back in the gym and feeling good about myself. Problems while titrating up in dosage, which are transient in nature include: increased hr, sweating, restlessness and anxiety. These side effects do go away over time. Titrating slowly is highly recommended. I started at 1mg and slowly worked my way up.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56497
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2007-07-26 00:00:00		0.5	1.5	2.5	1.0	This medicine did absolutely NOTHING to help me.  I got so fidgety from it I had to take Congentin, a Parkenson's drug, to get me to be still and even then I was fidgety.  My stability did not improve whatsoever from this and after a month my doctor took me off it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56356

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-07-14 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Abilify is the best antipsychotic on the market. There are no long-term side effects that I have had to deal with. The only short-term side effects were restlessness, insomnia and a zombie effect that went away after a few weeks on it. There is weight stabilization too. Abilify is a good drug to try. I am on 10 mg once daily. Take it in the morning. It helps.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55169
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-07-11 00:00:00		4.5	1.5	4.0	4.5	I Have Bi-Polar II and had been taking Trileptal with much Success! Unfortunately, my company switched Insurance and the insurance would no longer cover it, except Abilify. A weeks worth of samples of 10 mg as well as a Script for a 30 day supply, 15mg. Talk about catatonic! Within an hour I was so dizzy and sleepy that I would almost crawl to bed. Morning I was a walking Zombie. I &quot;pill-cut&quot; the 15mg and just took half. Finally am now taking 3-4mgs a night. GOOD NEWS! Like Goldi Locks, I had to find the right dosage. I know believe that Abilify is far superior to Trileptal! My mood swings are alll but gone and after my morning cup of coffee I am happy as a Duck in Water. My advice...Dont give up on the stuff. Do Find the Right Dosage for you. 10-15MG's was Over-Kill. 7mgs was good, but still too much. The medicine does what it is suppossed to do. Stop the mood swings. I have gained a little weight, but now that I know it is happening I am increasing my activity.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55158
abilify	Depression	2007-06-27 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	5.0	3.5	As a patient in a lengthy (16 months) depression and a history of severe mood swings (sudden feelings of despair), a low dose (5mg/day) of this drug greatly increased my mood stability. (I have also tried: Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Ativan, Cymbalta, Lamictal and Geodon without any success. While I was also on Abilify, I was simultaneously taking low does of Lexapro and Klonopin, which had elicited partial responses, though more by improving my baseline mood rather than doing much for my instability.) Unfortunately though, as soon as I started Abilify, I began gaining weight quite rapidly. This was the only negative side effect I experienced, but it was severe enough that I discontinued the drug. I'm disappointed though, because what it did in terms of improving my mood stability and general resilence were far, far better than anything else I'd tried, and it didn't make me feel dulled, tired, or any other similar complaints that often crop up with these kinds of meds.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55101
abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2007-06-10 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Before Abilify, the voices and &quot;hearing&quot; other things was pretty bad.  Now, I hardly ever hear them.  This drug does make you drowsy though, so I take it at bedtime.  I'm up to 20 mg a night.  It also helps with other problems like anxiety and panic attacks - at least for me.  It seems to have a calming effect on me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55009
abilify	Autism	2007-06-07 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	When our son was 17, he had been weaned from all medication to erradicate obsessive compulsive behaviors. We had started drug therapy when he was 12.He had been without meds for about 3 years.A parent recommended Abilify, describing that it 'took the edge off' and 'got rid of the weird stuff'. Given that those assessments were interesting, yet hardly tangible, we waited a year and tried it for ourselves.It has made a difference. The highs and lows related to anxiety are definitely tempered. He does not perseverate or obsess as much. He does seem more calm.He has been taking Abilify for almost 2 years now, and we did question a sign of 'drooping' of his tongue. We took him to a neurologist and he assessed that it was not a tartive dyskinesia.When I draw it to my son's attention, he pulls his tongue back. He can control it.So far, we are staying with Abilify.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54989
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-05-07 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	1.5	0.5	I wanted to keel over! I saw my pdoc for a switch from Zyprexa; I have BP-2 disorder, along with depression, OCD, and panic disorder. I take several other medications and was gaining weight like crazy after a month and a half on Zyprexa. My pdoc told me of Abilify, which I had never heard of, and I thought I'd heard of most of the new atypical antipsychotics. When I got home and took my first dose, I was dizzy within 15 minutes. Within an hour, I had a fever and was vomiting and close to fainting. I felt like this for roughly 28 hours. It was horrid. I notified him right away, and he switched me to Geodon, so we'll see how that goes. It's been a long time since a drug has made me this sick. When I looked into the side effects of Abilify, every single side effect I experienced was listed. Scary.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54840

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2007-03-14 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	4.0	3.0	Ok for School I guess if you needed to finish school or do well at work this med could work.  There are some side effects that you have to live with:  balance, problems swallowing, sensitive to the sun.  But it does help out in the concentration department.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54475
abilify	Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder combined	2007-02-16 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Abilify This medication works great for my 11 year old son.  Although taking it twice a day seems to help him the most.  He has a better morning when taking a small dose of 2.5 mg at night and 5 mg in the am.  It has made him much more coherent and mature acting.  It helps greatly with rages and argumentiveness.  He is much more reasonable.  His focus/organization could be better, but he can not take stims due to the tics it causes.  His social life improved greatly when starting this med.  It does seem to cause constipation though.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54329
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2007-01-10 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	3.5	0.5	Horrible drug They gave me this after detoxing from benzos. I was already in bad shape, but this just made me worse. I couldn't sit down and had to pace endlessly.  I couldn't think straight and I had no attention span.  It took a long time to wear off too.  I wouldn't suggest anybody ever take this stuff.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53984
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-12-10 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	5.0	0.5	Terrible! Don't know if it would have worked or not. Only took it for 4 days and felt just so sick in genenral. Very, very dizzy....shot my blood pressure straight up. I do have hypertension, but it has been mostly under control. The Abilify made it shoot straight up from day 1.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53842
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-12-08 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	too soon to tell I've been taking amblify for 7 days and the best things i notice are a slight increase in energy and motivation. I am less depressed even though I have been taking lamictal for a year. The lamictal alone wasn't cutting the depression entirely and the amblify seems to be a nice add on. I'm looking forward to having some trileptal added also for irritability and anxiety. Matbe the amblify will take care of these issues as well!I have noticed that I am only sleeping about 4 or 5 hours and  the dreams are not as nice as I would like but fortunely i forget them as soon as i get out of bed. thank God because as I am laying there i'm thinking what the hell was that all about shit!! that part of the drug is not good so I'm not looking forward to tonight and I might leave the lights on. lolno more strange dreams more calm and feeling better every day. it's unbelievable. I can't believe it's only 2 weeks. it's been over 1 month and we've gone up to 20mg. I am super productive and slightly restless. Some nights I sleep very welland other nights I don't sleep many hours but the quality of sleep is excellent. I do take 2 tylenol pm and a calcium magnesium at bedtime for my painfull degenerative neck. This is very annoying. With the bipolar and the neck I am easily aggravated. The addition of trileptal  will hopefully help me and smooth out any rough edges of the abilify. I do love abilify!!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52642
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-12-08 00:00:00		0.5	3.0	5.0	1.5	Abilify? Are you serious? It made me ABLE to lose my freaking mind! This was the first antipsychotic I was on after I was diagnosed.  I didn't know what to expect and needless to say, I was scared.  The first day, no side effects.  This continued for the first week.  Somewhere between week 2 and week 4, I lost all ability to concentrate on any one thing.  I became so restless at times that I felt like I wanted to jump out of my skin.  I was on this med as a combination with Paxil.  Between the two of them, I gained 45 lbs in 5 months.  It didn't help with any of my mood swings...depression or hypomania.  I actually started experiencing my first mixed episodes.  Hearing about them scared me.  Living them was a nightmare!Then the really weird side effects started.  I started having strange visual disturbances.  When driving at night, all the tail lights of the cars ahead of me would blend together.  I couldn't tell one car from another.  I also started having leg stiffness.  It would feel like my legs weighed a ton and when I got up to walk, I felt like a 90 year old woman.  I was only 26!I can write a book on all the crappy things this med did to me, from anxiety to hostility and terrible nightmares.  About the only GOOD thing about this med was that it allowed me to sleep...when I wasn't having nightmares, that is.Almost forgot to add: get your blood work done regularly.  I have blood work done on a regular basis and in the short time I was on this stuff, my cholesterol and triglycerides went up and I developed metabolic syndrome (the set of symptoms you get before developing diabetes).  Believe the warnings from the American Diabetes Association.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53670

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-12-02 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	5.0	1.0	weight gain! I'm Bipolar I, but mostly depressive.  Have only had one manic episode in 2 years.  Most of the time I am in a depressive state.I started on Abilify 5 mg. a day in May, and have gained about 30 lbs. since then.  I have been gaining about 5 lbs. a month since I started on it.It has done nothing to ease my depression, except make memore depressed due to weight gain.  However, Abilify did help with my &quot;voices&quot;  - a sort of murmuring and mumbling as if I were listening to a distant radio, after I went up to 15 mg. a day.I am going to ask my doctor to take me off this medication, because I feel slightly uncomfortable when out in public (I feel like &quot;the fat girl&quot;).There was only one other person on RemedyFind that mentioned weight gain, so this may be a side effect very infrequently experienced.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53403

abilify	Schizophrenia	2006-11-16 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Abilify - Helps Me Write  I started Abilify by itself, when in the hospital in July. It made me extremely agitated and irritable. My pdoc added 160mg of Geodon and immediately I calmed down. The voices and delusions were still a problem though, so she added 15mg of Haldol to the mix as well. On this combo, things rapidly improved. I can however, attribute one major benefit to the Abilify alone, since I'd been on the other two drugs before: a drive and ability to write and write -- my one talent and ability -- like never before. I write pages and pages a day in my notebook, and usually a poem each day and a blog entry of several paragraphs and e-mails galore. Sometimes I write all day long, right up until the instant I fall asleep at night, and it's great. THe delusions are under control, as are the voices. My mood is balanced, neither up nor down, and the irritability has completely vanished. In fact, I can wait and wait and wait without the least impatience. So I'd say that Abilify has a role to play in my illness, even if I can't tolerate it by itself, and it is not effective completely on its own. I would not want to stop taking it!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52728

abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2006-11-01 00:00:00		3.0	5.0	4.5	3.5	Great at the beginning. Not sure now. At the beginning I had very satisfactory results. I have taken the drug for two months, I have experienced no unpleasant side effects at all. The first two weeks I had more energy, was sleeping great at night, (My insomnia gives me a hard time),I felt like exercising, I cooked, etc. I thought this was definitively the medicine.But two months after start taking the medicine, things have changed. I am having trouble sleeping, I have a terrible lack of energy, I am afraid my depression is coming back (even though I am taking antidepressants). I guess this is happening because I am Bipolar II, and my understanding is that Abilify is FDA approved for Bipolars I.I am taking Lithium and the idea was to replace the Lithium with Abilify , but as soon as I got a smaller dosage of Lithium I felt terrible, so now I am back with Lithium and at the same time with Abilify, giving some time to see if Abilify works. I am taking also Stablon (not approved in the US).I really want to try again with Lamictal, because I have read it is the best for Bipolars II, but I tried 2 years ago and I had terrible itching, not a rash thank God, but my doctor preferred not to continue with Lamictal. I will keep you posted, in case Abilify works.

Before taking ability I had simple racing thoughts and maybe a few other things but I liked and enjoyed who I was.  Now when trying to go without the medication I feel terrible, I had my dose lowered because I felt like I couldn't sit patiently, like I couldn't get comfortable, squirmy.  I feel caught between a rock and a hard place.  I wish I wouldn't have been forced to take this medicine without more accute symptoms for peace of mind that it was helping instead of causing the symptoms I now experience.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51887

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-10-24 00:00:00		0.0	1.0	5.0	1.0	Just for one day I took Abilify for only one day because the side effects I got made it not worth the trouble. Took it around 8pm one evening, then didn't sleep a wink all night. When I woke, I was sensitive to all light and sound, and then vomited just for good measure. A friend told me that these side effects are likely to ease after a few months, but I didn't see the point in taking something which was giving me the symptoms it was supposed to treat, i.e. the insomnia and overacuteness of the senses of a manic episode.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51546
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-10-23 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	4.5	4.0	This worked great for me I have run the gambet on anti depresents. This one finally has been a dream. I am not sleepy on this at all. I take it with my ADD meds, and they have not caused any real problems for me. A bit of weight gain, just a bit. But all in all this a good drug for me. Very smooth as far as the way I feel. Helps take the edge off adderall. Glad to here others have it work well for them as well. Remember all drugs are not going to work the same for everyone. Try and keep trying till you find the one that makes you say YES. Feel free to e mail if you have any questions.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51427

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-10-19 00:00:00		3.5	3.0	5.0	3.5	It has just stated. Well it has been about 12 days and I can honestly say that I am feeling more positive effects within this time than with 8 months of taking Seroquel.  I am really kind of timid to say that it really is working, but so far things are looking up. I have been dealing with a bit of insomnia, but I have medication for that problem.  Please keep your fingers crossed for me and I will keep you posted.......Still taking Ambilify.  It makes me feel different than Seroquel in a positive way except for figity problems and problems sleeping. I am taking meds for the sleeping problem.  After about five weeks of taking Ambilify, I am not sure where I really stand.  So I will keep on trying with this med.  Hopefully next time I will have better news.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/50220

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-10-11 00:00:00		3.0	2.5	4.5	3.0	Not for me, but I''ve seen it help another This medication made me incredibly restless. I tend to be like that anyway, but it made the sensation unbearable. I felt like climbing out of my skin. It did seem to help level me out and I probably would have remained on it longer if not for that side effect.My friend takes this and it works remarkably well for her. There is a very clear difference between when she takes it and when she does not. She had one odd side effect though. Apparently, it caused her breasts to swell almost uncomfortably. The doctor told her that is a possible side effect, something about it can trigger lactation or something along those lines. I think it's a rare thing to happen. It, unfortunately, didn't happen to me! :-)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51068

I have always been sensitive to meds - so my fatigue may be more related to my body chemistry than anything else.  On the positive side I was experiencing severe bipolar (and somewhat psychotic) episodes where I thought I saw and heard things (more like conversations in other rooms and people calling me than commands to take actions).Once I started taking Abilify I almost immediately was relieved of these truly disturbing symptoms of my illness.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/50950

I am currently in the more depressed side of my mixed states and have been given several medications new to me, most of which do not seem to be working against my anxiety.  I'm shaking a lot and was told by my doctor that it may be the Abilify.  I will probably not stay on Abilify for very much longer.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30234

abilify	Depression	2006-09-21 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Relief This was prescribed for Depression/PTSD/DESnos ( Disorders of extreme stress - not otherwise specified ) from childhood.I suffered from refractory depression, debilating fatigue, anxiety, severe sleep disorders, chronic diffuse pain (fibromyalgia), and ADD-like symptoms.Tried without adequate response (4+ weeks each): Zoloft, Paxil, Lexapro, Amitryptaline, Wellbutrin, Lamictal, Effexor(helped some) and Cymbalta.The first 4 days were really tough to get through but worth the effort.  I was extremely sleepy, felt like my limbs were made of lead and really struggled to perform cognitive tasks of any kind regardless of what time I took the dose. The &quot;zombie&quot; like effects were severe enough that I almost quit taking it on each of those first 4 days.  After the 5th day on Abilify, there was a fairly abrupt shift for the better that has persisted.  I feel much calmer, relaxed and have noticed an enormous difference in my ability to handle stress or unexpected events.  Also, instead of feeling constantly uncentered and awkward around people I don't know well, social situations are now much more comfortable and even pleasant for me. Abilify has also helped with the depression and significantly reduced the ADD-like symptoms that had only been exacerbated by SSRI's or SNRI's. Finally, I feel like living life again instead of being trapped dwelling on the past and hiding my wounds from the world.  No weight gain to date and perhaps a small amount of weight loss.I am also taking desipramine(100-150mg/day for past 6 mos) which has helped enormously with the pain, fatigue and mood.Only side effect so far has been a slight increase in the anticholinergic effects of the desipramine, which for me is only a mild heart rate increase and urinary hesitency.  Those side effects are nothing compared to what this med has fixed.  Based on my experiences so far I would recommend starting at a low dose first and try to start it when you have no serious obligations	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49817

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-09-19 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	3.5	4.5	Abilify is OK This medication was given to me first in the slightest dosage and then in very small increments upped.  That was a total pain.  If I was given too much of an increase I would shake.  However, once stabilized I seem to have no problem with this med.  It also seems to be doing it's job as far as stabilizing my mood.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35979
abilify	Depression	2006-09-19 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	made a huge difference I have Fibromyalgia and Major Depression.  I had been in a Fibro relapse with a subsequent depressive episode that had been weighing on me like a stone for months.  I had no energy and couldn't focus.  I was taking Wellbutrin XL and had tried a couple different anti-depressants in addition to the Wellbutrin but nothing worked.  Then my doctor suggested Abilify.  I take a fairly low dose.  The doc wanted to raise it but I said &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;.  Abilify doesn't impact my Fibro symptoms, but it sure did help lift my severe depression.  Don't let the fact that it was initally approved as an anti-psychotic scare you off.  The new anti-psychotics simply modulate the same neurotransmitters that anti-depressants do--but with a different &quot;flavor&quot;. The are being use for lots of psychiatric complaints now.  I highly recommend Abilify for depression.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49632
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-09-17 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	4.0	0.5	Felt Like I Was Fading Away When I first started using it for my Bipolar I it seemed to help almost immediately with my nighttime anxiety. I was taking it with Wellbutrin,which was stopped because the doc believed it may have been contributing to the anxiety.So I was on the Abilify alone. Thats when all hell broke loose! I couldn't eat, food repulsed me ( I wanted to lose weight but not like that.)I had NO energy, no motivation, couldn't sleep and the WORST anxiety I ever had 24 hours a day. It was a feeling of utter panic and dread from head to toe and I paced the floor for hours! It was the first time since I was diagnosed that I really felt &quot;crazy&quot; for lack of a better word.Worst of all, my doc made it seem like my reaction was rare and unusual, but reading what i have here shows that it was not.I took the semester off from college because I couldn't function. I ended up being taken off of it and was given Xanax( 1 or two 0.25mg 3 times a day) which cleared the anxiety literally in a matter of hour or two after taking the first dose. I also take a very small dose of Seroquel(25 mg), and so far, so good.God bless the people it helps because it made my life a living hell for the time I had taken it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49534
abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2006-09-09 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	4.0	Abilify giveth, and taketh away Update.  As I read other reviews ofthis medication I am struck by similarity of experience.  I, like some others, have felt a loss of affect. My illness is quite well controlled, but I have lost my passion (a friend said this to me). Never very happy or very sad.  Life is comfortable but without a great deal of color.  I am on a heavy regimen of medications so I will not point the finger solely at Abilify (for the good or the bad).  I just feel this is important information.Abilify was added to me regime almost four years ago. I was already on Geodon and and anti-depressant (forget which one). I was in a state of depression, paranoia, and low energy. This drug did not fix everything but it did give my energy level a boost. I find I tolerate it well and it is easy to take. I have had a tremor for some time. I think it's from the Geodon, can't be sure though.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41893

The only effective treatment from my personal experience with Panic Disorder is Xanax(benzo) and research shows that as well. The overuse of anti-psychotic is getting on my nerves.  Abilify did nothing for my panic disorder symptoms for obvious reasons since it is not designed for it.

abilify	Schizophrenia	2006-08-16 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	Following up on my earlier review. I've been on Abilify a few years now, therefore I'm in a good position to tell you how it's helped me.  It has totally wiped out my hallucinations/delusions and, along with Seroquel, has controlled my manic phases.  The only real side effect I have is a totally flat affect.  I don't feel any intense emotions about anything.  Happiness, sadness, fear, stress etc. have all been limited to moderate.  I feel nothing much more than numb most of the time.  I didn't like not having any feelings, so, along with my Pdoc, I weaned off of the Abilify only to be sent into a deep depression.  Severe enough to cost me my job and very likely, my career.  Anyway, I'm back on it and feeling much better.  Still numb, but much better than depressed and manicky.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47651
abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2006-08-16 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	Following up on my earlier review. I've been on Abilify a few years now, therefore I'm in a good position to tell you how it's helped me.  It has totally wiped out my hallucinations/delusions and, along with Seroquel, has controlled my manic phases.  The only real side effect I have is a totally flat affect.  I don't feel any intense emotions about anything.  Happiness, sadness, fear, stress etc. have all been limited to moderate.  I feel nothing much more than numb most of the time.  I didn't like not having any feelings, so, along with my Pdoc, I weaned off of the Abilify only to be sent into a deep depression.  Severe enough to cost me my job and very likely, my career.

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-08-15 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	good on abilify for me The only side effects I have had are a rash on my leg and I cant sleep too good and my doc has me now on something else to help me sleep because I did not want to give it up. All and all I think it has helped me alot. Nothings gonna make you perfect.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47490

abilify	Post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)	2006-08-14 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	very good I have been diagnosed with PTSD.  Treatment with SSRIs caused unacceptable side effects.  My symptoms did not respond to Lamictal.  I do experience somnalence but hopefully with time this will resolve.  So far no weight gain.  I did initially have an increased heart rate but this has resolved.  My primary symptom is anxiety and insomnia.  Even though I have day time somnalence....the insomnia, or frequent wakening still occurs.  My overall appoval of this drug is good at considerably less than a therapeutic dose.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47461
abilify	Asperger's Syndrome	2006-08-11 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	Excellent My son with Asperger's has been on this and I notice a huge difference in his repetitive behaviors and the obsessive thinking.  He has also lost just about all his violent behavior due to sensory overloading.  He maintains a healthy weight and sleeps well.  He was on Risperdal for awhile and he gained almost 10 pounds in a short time and was still aggresssive on it.  This has been much better.  We did try a little higher of a dose once and it produced a sedating effect.  At the 5 mg dose, he is 8 and weighs 71 pounds, he has had no ill effects.  I like this medicine and would strongly recommend it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47367

They are my sunshine pills for they bring sunshine to the dark ravages BPD can wreck.  Unfortunately, oh how unfortunate, I cannot tolerate them for more than 2-3 months.

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-08-02 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Excellent I have used Abilify only for break-through mania which happens once or twice a year, along with upping my Depakote dosage. The combination ends the mania in under 24 hours. Most of the time the Depakote alone keeps my mania at bay.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/46577
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-08-02 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	A life-saver for our son At 17, our adopted son has several serious behavior problems* (stemming from fetal alcohol exposure) which has led to a series of out of home placements in schools, hospitals, residential treatment, and group homes.  After he was thrown out of his last group home, his doctor added Abilify to his meds. (Depakote, Concerta, Zoloft).  We saw an almost immediate good response which has continued for 3 months. This is a long time for him, as many prvious meds. lead to improvement for about a month when we saw the benefits taper off to a much more modest level.  He responded fairly well to Zyprexa and Risperdal, but had massive, debilitating weight gain which he has avoided with this. He did develop oculogyric crisis on this, but it has been easily controlled with Benadryl.  I think he would be in jail without Abilify.  In his own assessment, he noted that he feels &quot;less angry&quot;.

abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2006-08-02 00:00:00		3.0	2.0	5.0	3.0	Does cause weight gain Unlike what the pharma community has lauded about Abilify and it's impact on weight, my 10 year old son has put on significant weight since taking this drug for two years.  However, compared to Risperdal, Abilify seems to be more effective in the long run and most likely less a cause of weight gain.  Just wish the medical community could come up with an antipsychotic that did not trigger an appetite response!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/46535

I REALLY, REALLY hope this lasts.  The Dr. told me this med is his first line treatment for obsessive thinking - pretty common in Aspies, but it has also lifted my depression.

abilify	Depression	2006-07-07 00:00:00		2.5	1.5	3.5	2.5	So Tired..... I started on the 10 mg once a day at night.  It made me feel drowsy all day, like I was sedated.  I could barely function.  But when I tried to take a nap, I felt anxious and uneasy.  I went down to 5 mg, which helps with the drowsiness (still drowsy, but not as much), but at about 4pm, I would get suddenly very anxious.I was still really tired with the 5mg, so I'm down to 2.5 and although I am tired, I am able to function.I am not hungry, but have kept my weight pretty constant.  No other major side effects.I can't tell if the meds are working or if I am just in a state of sedation, but I do feel like I am not as rocky emotionally throughout the day.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44461

Why they let these guys prescribe this stuff, I don't know!) I decided to continue on it and the swelling diminished to almost nothing.  I am not sure about the blurring yet but I am planning a trip to my eoye doc soon.  In combination with Lexapro it does seem to work better than what I was on prior to recent hospitalization, which was Chorimipramine (it has a more common name but I can't remember it.

I'm probably in the minority, and I wanted it to work b/c of the side effect profile, but it became clear quickly that this drug does not agree with me. I hope it works for others. As for atypicals, Zyprexa and Seroquel are the only two that have worked for me, and Seroquel more than Zyprexa. (Risperdal did nothing and Geodon kept me up at night and wouldn't let me wake up in the morning, w/questionable effect.)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44946
abilify	Depression	2006-06-20 00:00:00		3.5	4.5	4.5	4.0	Good with other medications  I tried just the abilify and it helped with anxiety but did not help with my depression. I take Abilify, provigil and wellbutrin. The combination has done wonders for me. I have tried being on each of these drugs by themselves, but they did not seem to work as well.

My manic episodes have now elevated to a point where I am miserable and I have an appointment today with the psychiatrist for a med checkup, and I am going to tell her that she HAS to take me off the Abilify. I can't sleep or eat and I am physically and mentally exhausted. I am teetering on the edge it feels like and I just want to sleep. I've been on this for a little over a month and it has just been winding me up more and more as time has gone by. Besides Bipolar I, I also have OCD and Acute Social Phobia so it's been a real hard time. I have lost 17 pounds in this time as well and have felt like I've been in a deep freezer. Constantly cold and wearing a coat in the house. This is crazy. Sorry to ramble....	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/42828

abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2006-05-12 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Excellent for my depression and anxiety and mood. I take it in the morning and lexapro (ssri antidepressant at night).I tried the other drugs and they just made me zonked out. This worked for me well! Love it! also I take a few fish oil tabs a day for omega 3.This combination works so so so well. Love it.I wanted to die before this (even with an SSRI) and this has helped me get out and do so much.It has all kicked in and i feel great.Dont be afraid to try a few diff ones if one doesnt work. Dont give up. Most didnt work for me but this did.Try it and if not try another.Chop	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/42589

abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2006-05-06 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	Abilify has restored my life - There is hope ! After taking abilify for only a few days, I felt myself again. My old self, (silly, funny, loving, with energy, creativity, motivation) I had not felt this way since 1990's. I have taken so many medications over the years. None have compared to Abilify.  I am also taking a regimen of other medications, as many of you are.  I want to give hope to everyone that there is hope.  Also, try not to focus on your mental illness, it is only a condition that we must deal with.  It does not define who we are.  We are NOT bipolars....we are Mary or Bob, or Lamar, or whomever.

abilify	Post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)	2006-05-05 00:00:00		0.5	0.0	5.0	1.0	not a good fit This med was prescribed for me after telling my psychiatrist that I had been feeling like I want to jump out of my skin.  The side-effects I experienced were not worth my taking it as it seemed to be counterproductive.  Instead of making me feel better about myself, I felt worse because I became constipated, had a voracious appetite and gained a lot of weight.  I was not happy at all with this med.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/42172

abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2006-05-01 00:00:00		3.5	4.5	4.5	4.0	Good with other medications  I tried just the abilify and it helped with anxiety but did not help with my depression. I take Abilify and wellbutrin. The combination has done wonders for me. I have tried being on each of these drugs by themselves, but they did not seem to work as well. The side effects with abilify have been mild--I just wanted to eat carbs or chocolate for the first few weeks.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41435

I was already on Geodon and and anti-depressant (forget which one). I was in a state of depression, paranoia, and low energy. This drug did not fix everything but it did give my energy level a boost. I find I tolerate it well and it is easy to take. I have had a tremor for some time. I think it's from the Geodon, can't be sure though.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41904

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-04-27 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	5.0	4.5	too sedative at first, great for anxiety i was diagnosed bipolar 2 after 12 years of being misdiagnosed with depression and terrible results with lexapro. they started me on 2.5mg of abilify, and i felt drugged for the 1st week,with an &quot; i don't care&quot; feeling,  tired, trouble thinking, being social and carrying a conversation. then i went up to 5 mg.  i finally was able to have a more objective look on life, step back and evaluate instead of reacting, and anxiety stopped. the heavier side effects were gone by the 3rd week. then added lamictal to the mix, starting @ 25 mg to move up to 200mg. (i'm @ 50 now) so far the results are great, i feel &quot;normal&quot;. i only have a little trouble remembering things, the occasional headache and too enthusiastic at night, which changed once i switched to taking meds in the morning. finally, don't get discouraged by the &quot;antipsychotic&quot; word.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41701
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-04-23 00:00:00		3.0	1.5	5.0	3.0	awesome if there were no side effects after 14 different medication, not to mention combinations of medications already tried after a period of 2 years I was so happy that for the first few day Abilify was increasing my focus and concentration.  My mood was &quot;normal&quot;, not over inflated and didn't fluctuate like it has been.  The only problem was after a couple of days I started to have insomnia which I couldn't handle and a nervousness inside I couldn't quite get a handle on.  I also had a heavy heartbeat, like I shouldn't have been feeling my heartbeat like that when I was laying down.  It did make me drowsy but I can handle drowsy, can't handle insomnia though which I have now.  It did give me bad thoughts that scared me after about 5 days but i dismissed them hoping they were just part of the bipolar illness.  Good med, sorry to say, couldn't handle the side effects.  That hurts!I wanted to add to the writer that said that Abilify was expensive.  Ask your pdoc for samples.  Mine gives me samples of Abilify, Seroquel, Lamictal, Zoloft, almost everything I've tried.  When he didn't have samples of even Ambien and Trileptal when I tried those he had some &quot;voucher&quot; sticker affixed to the back of the script so when I took the script to the pharmacist it was free.  Its embarrassing to be poor but its better to be well and have some money in your pocket!!  Just a tip, don't be afraid to ask for samples, they got tons, trust me, they've told me!Also, on a briter note, i'm back on Abilify at 2.5 mg with propanolol to keep my heart rate steady to try to ease up on the inner restlessness and heart palpitations I guess and i'm taking Ambien for the insomnia.  The dose isn't high enough and i'm a bit irritable but slowly but surely hopefully i'll be back to the normal dose.the Ambien didn't work and I'm sad to say had to discontinue the only med so far that was working for me due to the insomnia side effect.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40495

I started at 10mg and am on 30mg, dose set when hospitalized in January.  I developed EPS, my jaw spasmed, so the doc put me on Cogentin.  That has helped a lot.

Just on edge all the time; couldn't calm down, but not in a good way.  I have a good friend who is on it, however (also Lithium) and she appears to be doing ok.

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-04-13 00:00:00		0.0	1.0	5.0	1.0	Caused Horrible Side Effects I was prescribed this for bipolar 2 with quasi-delusional thinking, and anxiety. I used it for 6 days before stumbling back to my pdoc to get me off asap.I was super tired and groggy constantly, and I felt like it slowed my thought process. But when I tried to sleep I couldn't due to a pounding heart, trouble breathing, and a general inability to relax. It also made me very agitated, but not in a productive way. More like I was constantly on edge, feeling on the verge of a panic attack, and absolutely could not calm down. I couldn't get comfortable sitting, standing, or laying down, because of the agitation. It did absolutely nothing for my mood. If anything, my mood was worse because of the extreme agitation.I also had constipation and severely decreased appetite.To sum up my experience, this was the worst drug I have ever been on--and I've tried many of them. I couldn't even stand it long enough to let possible 'start-up' symptoms go away. I do have a low tolerance for many medications, but nothing should ever make anyone feel like this one made me feel.Now on 25mg Lamictal/day and feeling better already. :)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40994

I discontinued the med due this side effect. It wasn't essential for me to take it I just wanted see what alternatives were out there.

abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2006-04-04 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	Abilify ~ A diamond in the rough for me Abilify is the first drug that I have tried with satisfactory results for bipolar disorder. Although I have only taken the drug for two weeks, I have experienced no unpleasant side effects at all. To the contrary, I have experienced more energy (not a manic disphoric type of energy but what I believe might be normal for most people), elimination of paranoia, better sleep at night (I take my dose at bedtime), no racing thoughts, my speech and behavior have become less pressured, and my athletic performance has returned to normal as a result of having found a drug that does not make me drousy, dizzy or &quot;slowed down&quot;. I also take 1mg of Clonazepam at bedtime to aid in maintaining a normal sleep pattern. Previously, I have tried Lamictal (resulted in itching and an acne like rash on chest), Trileptal (worked great but with side effect of dizziness and a feeling of slowed response time that affected my performance as an athlete), Seroquel (caused me to feel nervous and grind my teeth) and every antidepressant out there (all of which caused me to become manic).  So far Abilify earns a gold star with me.  Of course everyone is affected differently by any given drug as a result of our unique brain chemistry, but I would suggest to give this one a try if you are not 100% satisfied with your current medication(s).  I never thought I would find a drug that was so transparent to use. Good luck to all in the search for the right coctail.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40488

Although my 16 year-old son has only been taking Abilify for a short period of time, it appears to be a miracle drug.  He is taking it for Bipolar Disorder.  His outrageous aggressive behavior and sudden fits of rage seemed to be under control yesterday for the first time in years. Recently, he was court ordered to get residential treatment because he started getting into trouble with the law and refused to take medication; all I could see was him in prison off and on for the rest of his life. However, when I went to visit yesterday I could not beleive what I was seeing and hearing. For the first time in about 8 years I actually felt comfortable around him. I don't know how it will be later for him but I pray that he continues to experience the same results years from now.

abilify	Depression	2006-03-15 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	4.5	Abilify for intrusive thoughts Some people with depression have problems with intrusive thoughts and memories that are distressing.  Abilify helps me shake these off.  It also gives me more mental energy for sustained concentration at work.

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-03-15 00:00:00		3.0	0.5	5.0	2.5	Too many side-effects for me My theory on why this was effective for me as an anti-psychotic (anti-manic, really) is that basically it made me feel like I had the flu.  And on top of the flu, restless leg syndrome.  So, I didn't want to do anything (the anti-manic effect), but basically because I felt horribly sick, and yet I had to get up and pace because of the restless legs. Basically it was driving me crazy.  I was climbing out of my skin and could not concentrate whatsoever, so I had to stop.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39350
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-03-13 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.0	The switch turned on! I am bipolar 1 with mixed states, which is what Abilify is FDA approved for (mixed states).  Whether it's the histamine or the dopamine that Abilify targets (or both) all I can say is WOW where have you been all my life?  I was preparing for ECT when I decided to tritate off Seroquel and use Abilify hoping it would hold me over until shock treatments could begin. After the Seroquel was completely out of my system, literally almost overnight I felt so good, I held off on ECT and so far so good. I should note that I'm allergic to all anti-convulsants so my only recourse is the newer atypicals or ECT and I was at the end of my rope!Of course this is in addition to the other meds I take, Adderall, Buspar and Xanax, but those were on board before Abilify.  Since it's not recommended for any other type but mixed states I assume there's a good reason why?  It may have to do with the Seretonin factor since Abilify doesn't mess with it. If you're a mixed state, I'd gladly be the poster child for this drug and you just may too!  The only drawback is the cost.  A 3 month supply retails for over $1000.00 and as far as side effects, a slight headache and occasional muscle cramps are the worst of it for me. It beats the hell that is bipolar depression.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39142

I kept taking it and they got worse. After being on it for a month. I stopped taking it. The panic attacks stopped. I waited one week. This seemed IMPOSSIBLE to me. So to prove myself wrong I started taking it again. The massive panic attacks started AGAIN. I took it for another full month and had to endure the worst panic attacks I have ever had. I then stopped taking it. The panic attacks again STOPPED. I have NO idea why this drug did the OPPOSITE of what it was supposed to do,but did. I assume I am the only person out there who had this reaction to it. If there is anyone else out there, I'd love to know about it. In a funny way, having those massively intense panic attacks from the Abilify helped me overall. Now when I have a panic attack-compared to the ones I experienced then, they are NOTHING. lol Hope I am able to help someone out there with this blog.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/38710

I wasn't able to do that before. I still get manic, but not to the extreme I was before. In the combination of the 2 drugs I seem to be holding off the hallucinations and the voices pretty good. Overall I am extremley happy that after a year of doctoring with my new Pysch, we have finally found the best meds for me for the 1st time in 14 years.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/38605

abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2006-02-03 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	Works great, but worried about the weight. I recently switched from Risperdal 2mg to Abilify 10mg. My pdoc had me cross-taper the two medications over a two week period, and I have been on Abilify 10mg and completely off the Risperdal for a week now. So far, Abilify seems to be working very well in controlling the psychotic symptoms. The only real problem I am having so far is that Abilify doesn't seem to be as effective as the Risperdal in controlling my moods. I get upset/worked up more easily now, although not nearly as bad or as often as when I wasn't on any medication at all. With Risperdal, nothing could make me mad or upset. Everything was easy breezy, although I felt a little bit like a zombie (not emotions at all). The only reason I got off the Risperdal was because I had gained 62 pounds in a year on it. I went from 110 pounds to 172 pounds. I have read that abilify does not cause as much weight gain, so I am hoping to lose weight. However I have read all of the above responses and I see that one person did gain weight on it, so I am a little worried. Can anyone else offer their experience with weight gain/weight loss after taking Abilify?Update: I have been off of Risperdal and on just Abilify for almost three weeks now. So far I have lost 6 pounds. I hope I keep losing! I am also finding that it's starting to work better for my moods than it was in the beginning. I guess it takes awhile to really get going.Update: I have been on abilify for almost five weeks now, and have lost seven pounds. I had hoped that I would lose weight faster based on what I had lost in the first couple of weeks, but I guess seven pounds in one month isn't too bad. I forgot to mention before that although I had trouble sleeping in the beginning, that has pretty much gone away.Upadate: It has been about eight weeks since I have been off of Risperdal and on just Abilify, and I have lost ten pounds so far. That is without really exercising (I'm not working ye	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/33399

Speech and language improved drastically. He initiated conversations, used eye contact, self-stim dropped way down - he wasn't constantly talking out loud to himself. His aggression level dropped to near normal. His reading skills improved. It was almost like having a typical child. The rare side-effect that hit was loss of vision. There was short periods of partial and total vision loss, which he did not let us know about until he completely lost his vision. His vision did return in several days after stopping the medication. He did still have occasional loss of vision (could see shadows) for several months before it stopped completely. He was 14 years old so he was in the middle of puberty which changes everything anyway.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35984

Side effects were hard to handle in the beginning, particularly the nausea and drowsiness, but those go away after a week or so. One note-- ABILIFY AND EGGS DO NOT GET ALONG!!! For some reason, the drug interacts badly with eggs in my system, brining on rampant nausea and almost flu-like symptoms. Maybe not for others, but my husband and I are both on it for bipolar, and we both have the same reaction.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35818

However, I did not like it while I was on it, and had a feeling that it wasn't going to get much better.  I definitely felt more anxiety while taking it, and felt kind of weird...hard to explain, but just a little off somehow.  I also felt kind of dumb on it, slightly spaced out.   Could not think of words to say, which only added to my anxiety in social situations.  I didn't feel any positive mood stabilizing effect either for depression or hypomania, and like I said, made anxiety worse.  Granted, it may have gotten better over time...but I had a sense/feeling that it wasn't going to.

Plus I had trouble sleeping at night, I was restless. Not alert at all. Glad to be off it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/33716

I agree w/ the person who said to stop using antipsychotics on people who are not psychotic.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/33683

abilify	Depression	2005-11-25 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Excellent for My Depression I was on Zyprexa for 8 years and I slept all the time. I called in sick just so I could sleep. Saturdays and Sundays, I slept 20 hours each day. I had a ravenous appetite. I gained 20 pounds. My doctor took me off Zyrpexa and put me on Abilify 3 weeks ago and I feel great! No side effects whatsoever. I have my energy back. I feel so good, I stay up late everynight. Last weekend I went out Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I felt like I had been brought up by wolves in the wilderness. I am not used to being with people. It's wild! I take Abilify before I go to bed. I sleep great and wake up refreshed. I also am on Impramine (for 19 years) and Provigil. I am just thrilled with this drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/32505
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2005-11-24 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	3.5	0.5	welcome to Hell Abilify is by far the worst medication I have EVER been on...  It put me in a comatose state.  I could barely hold myself up.  I felt detached from my body in the most miserable way.  It also made my anxiety worse and is ridiculously expensive even with insurance!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/32461
abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2005-11-23 00:00:00		0.0	5.0	0.0	1.5	Just Awful!!!! This med was perscribed because I was unhappy about weight gain with Seroquel-well- it made me so edgy I couldn't sit still and all my mind blanked out-all thoughts and sense of humor. Way awful!! I have been off the stuff for about a year and don't ever intend of trying it again!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/32458

My personal experience may be different than others and by all means try what you can so you can get through this.  It makes me a little tired, a little unmotivated but I have to say the feeling of extreme anxiety and fear is gone.  I can't explain enough how this can help 'some' people.  I also take Wellbutrin and Lexapro with this so, all of them together make a huge impact.  :-)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31346
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2005-11-14 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	2.5	0.5	Worst med ever! This pill landed me in the hospital. I was fine (actually great) on it for about 3 months. Then I was stricken with the worst anxiety of my life - I was basically in a panic attack 24 hours a day non-stop. I also had severe tremors. I wound up in the hospital and the ER doctor told me that he saw the same thing happen to about 1/3 of all Bipolars on Abilify. He said it would take about 3 months to clear up and put me on a daily dose of Ativan to control the anxiety and Artane for the tremors. It was actually about 5 months before I was back to normal. Abilify wrecked my life and nearly cost me my job as a college instructor as well because I had such a hard time coping. Be VERY careful when taking this and go to the hospital immediately for any problems!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31245
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2005-11-14 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	Worked in 3 days I had been very reluctant to try an atypical antipsychotic for bipolar 2 disorder (mainly depressive episodes for me).  This med worked for me with more energy and motivation than I have had in years.  The only side effects I have noticed are tremor and increase jittery and anxiety (but I have always had anxiety problems).  To those reluctant as me to try an antipsychotic, I say try it!  It might be the miracle med that it's been for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31246

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2005-11-12 00:00:00		3.0	2.5	5.0	3.0	Abilify better than Seroquel I am Bipolar I, and was prescribed Abilify when it first came out to help control my outbursts of anger.  I had previously been on Seroquel, which you all may know will make you sleep your life away if you let it.  I don't believe Abilify works as well as Seroquel, but I cannot go any higher on the dose- I currently take 20 mg. 1 a day.  I was taking 30 mg but the muscles in my face began to lock up so we had to back down.  Not a pleasant thing to have happen.  But at least you don't gain weight and sleep all the time on Abilify like you do on other anti-psychotic medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31180

abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2005-11-09 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.0	My experience w/ Abilify &amp; BPD I have been BP w/ mixed symptoms (rapid cycling &amp; depressive states) for many,many years and have been on practically every antidepressant out there.I guess I fall into the category of BPNOS. I do become manic easily when all is good in my life,but if there are ANY little problems I suddenly turn and become depressed and can't handle any crisis or problems. Last Nov. 2004, I was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts during a depressive phase when the Dr's there changed my med's &amp; put me on Abilify. The drug changed my life, or should I say, saved my life. I no longer have those thoughts and am stable in my illness @ the moment. Although the medication is expensive, in my opinion it is worth every penny. I know it doesn't help everyone, but it has helped me w/ no side effects. No weight gain,no tremors,nothing. Even my 9y/o son is on it for his BP. w/ no side effects. I recommend the drug w/ Dr's approval of course as it has helped me tremendously.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35234
abilify	Depression	2005-11-05 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	2.5	0.5	Abilify made me manic I took Abilify at 5 mg. without any positive effects so my doctor raised my dose to 10 mg.  That made me get insomnia which caused me to repeat myself constantly--for some reason it effected my memory, and get manic.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29966
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2005-11-04 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	Working for me! So far so good after a few months taking it. My boyfriend and family have really noticed the difference in how normal I have been with out being sluggish or stupid like other drugs. Gives bit of anxiety but nothing over the top for me.     Have to always take it first thing in the morning to avoid insomnia while on it. In fact after this last month finally sleeping like a normal person again, around 8 hours a night and wake up feeling good.Thought I would mention that at one point was in a mixed episode, upped the dose from 5mg to 10mg and it ended. Never felt so much like myself.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30254

The only reason that I am no longer taking  it is due to my insurance company stopped covering the drug and it made it impossible to afford. ( on social security disability )This drug not only helped on my major mood swings but also felt less depressed when on it.I highly recommend Abilify to those who suffer from BP !!!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29809

Before the Abilify, I was taking Risperdol with the rest of the cocktail and was still getting swings. Now, on 15 mg Abilify BID, I feel even-keeled for the first time EVER. The only side effects are a slight hand tremor that comes and goes and some minor weight gain, nothing too annoying.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23897

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2005-10-26 00:00:00		2.5	5.0	5.0	3.5	Not for me. Abilify was added to my treatment as an add on. I didn't really notice much difference after I stopped it and went to a higher dosage of lamictal. I stopped it because it was so expensive! My co-pay was much higher than any other prescription I've had. My doctor told me that I could use it occasionally if I felt I was having a bad day and might need it, I haven't used it at all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30294

Depakote worked for me for 9 years, but the dose had to be increased over time and I gained weight with each increase.  Abilify is nice that it is once a day.  Most people take it in the AM because it can be energizing, but I found out I had to take it at bedtime.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29189
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2005-10-20 00:00:00		2.0	1.0	3.0	2.0	Abilify did the opposite of what it's supposed to My doc prescribed abilify 5 mg once a day, and it gave me Extrapyramidial Syndrome, mainly restless legs and MORE anxiety than before. So I wouldn't recommend it for anxiety, but it could be a good drug for those with bipolar disorder. I just can't understand why a doc would try an atypical antipsychotic for anxiety. I think they get in trouble if they try a benzo as a first line of treatment, so they try everything else first, without a thought to the patient's well-being.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29119

I could not hardly move, I could not leave my house, felt like the walls were closing in and was afraid of everything. I have had panic attacks but this was way above and beyond a panic attack. These have never been symptoms of mine. This med put me very close to a psychosis being on them for just a week. I understand that everyone reacts differently but be very careful and observant with this one. I also, could not eat at all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29006
abilify	Depression	2005-10-13 00:00:00		5.0	0.0	5.0	3.0	Weight Gain!!!!!!!!!!!!! This drug did indeed &quot;Abilify&quot; me, but I started eating like a pig the day I started taking it. I have just lost 40lbs, and having serious back problems, I cannot afford to be carrying around extra weight. Otherwise I found it to be a great drug. I took it in the evening, and it helped me to sleep well, and woke up refreshed, and ready to go! But I was shoving food in my mouth constantly. Sorry I had to stop. Cymbalta is my drug now. It helps with weight loss. I'm not quite as active, but, it works best for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/28551

Unfortunately, it didn't help me a bit.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30680

I have tried this more than once just to be a &quot;good and compliant patient&quot;.  Everytime it's the same-----I am going 100mph in a comatose body.  I can't move, but the panic and anxiety feel like they will kill me and nobody will know.  Like being buried alive!!!!!  IF the prescribing Docs would have to try this medicine before writing the scipt---it would be taken off the market for sure.  This pill is pure torture.Politically, they are trying to make this their little darling, but the truth will come out.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/28065

This is an off-label use that is being tested for but for me it has made a lot of difference versus an anti-depressant alone.  I'd recommend at least talking to your doctor about it!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/27868

After a month or so, others noticed that the old &quot;me&quot; was back, that I was like I used to be.  On Zyprexa I was sedated, but not so with Abilify.  I truly feel normal and have for months.  I have some insomnia, but I'm not sure that it is related to Abilify. Otherwise no side effects for me. UPDATE:  After several months, Abilify was not working any longer.  I eventually stopped taking it, which even at 5mg was painful for about a week, hypomanic and jittery, but it all subsided.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19897

We put her on Abilify after a few years of Seroquel had caused her to gain too much weight.  Unfortunately, although her psydoc said many of his patients do well on Abilify, she was not one of them.  It seemed to be completely ineffectual.  She spent several months in a hypomanic state and wound up in the hospital this summer, where they took her off Abilify and started Geodon.  Since then we've seen her become amazingly focused and stable!  I only hope this continues.  Good luck to all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26812

I am taking (well took, to be precise, since I never want to take another dose again) 5mg aripiprazole in the morning as a mood stabilizer adjunctive to lamotrigine to prevent 'breakthrough' mood swings.Aripiprazole makes me feel weak, but restless. I feel a need to 'do something' but cannot concentrate on any task when I try to releive the urge. I feel a constant urge to sleep all the time, but have to get up and 'do something' whenever I attempt to get some rest. There is also a horrible sense of fatigue and of being 'drugged'.This, for me, has been a truly awful medicine. I think anyone giving this even to a dog should be prosecuted for cruelty!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25925

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2005-08-12 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.0	Abilify got me out of a bind and helped motivation 8/12/05:Abilify has continued to work well for my depression. It seems to synergize well with the Luvox (and maybe Lamictal) that I'm already taking. However, the dose was increased to 5mg/day since I was still having some residual feelings of guilt, self-conciousness, and anxiety. Another good thing is that I still have bunches of samples of Abilify left from a previous trial, so that makes it much more cost effective and economical.ORIGINAL:--------Several weeks ago, I was in a really severe depression (or mixed state). I was suicidal, had emotional pain, paralyzing fear, and my mind kept on getting 'stuck' on bad thoughts. I had to miss several days of work due to this. He prescribed some Seroquel (25mg tabs) in addition to my other meds, but it didn't seem to help me. On Friday that week, I got verbally abusive over the phone with a company for something when I was in the mixed state depression. That day, I thought about driving myself to the emergency room to get help as I was about to go crazy, but I happened to have leftover samples of Abilify from a previous trial. So, instead, I decided to take 1/2 of a 5mg tablet. A few hours later, my mind began to clear. Then overnight, the depression was better. I ended up going to work later the next morning! It was a miracle!!! I continued to take 2.5mg/day afterward. A little over a week later, I had a doctor's appointment, and my doctor officially put me on Abilify at 2.5mg/day in the morning (may possibly go to 5mg/day if ever needed). He also had prescribed Luvox for OCD along (currently at 100mg of that), and Lamictal dose was increased too. I'm now on Abilify 2.5mg, Lamictal 300mg, and Luvox 100mg for bipolar. I took Abilify another time last year with Depakote. But. dose was too high, and I had akathisia, insomnia, and many other side effects. I was taking 10mg/day. Now, at 2.5mg/day, I don't have the problems and side effects are minimal.

I spent the entire 6 months in a very nasty mixed state caused by the med (had been manic, um, thanks a lot).  Had lots of breakthrough psychosis (including command hallucinations).  It really disturbed my sleep and gave me nightmares.  And as if all that wasn't bad enough, it gave me flat out horrid akathisia - I looked like a stimulant fiend (couldn't even type or sit still).  Gotta be worst drug on the market.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30266

Neither of these had been symptoms I had ever had before. This drug scared me to death and I would never take it again. I currently take Geodon and it works well for me. Zyprexa made me fat and Lamictal made me sleepy.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25163

It's like restless leg symdrome but all over my body.  I stayed on it 5 weeks to see if the side effects would lessen and they didn't.  My psychiatrist took me off it and gave me Geodon instead which works much better and has few side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30253

Quit due to moving out of state and couldn't get it through local mental health, I acutally PAID 17.00 per pill on a ssdi income of 600.00 per month, so I must've thought it was pretty good. just tried symbyax and didn't manage the spacy tiredness too well.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24809

Abilify seemed to be working pretty well, but then I went to Johns Hopkins for yet another opinion and the psychiatrist there warned me about long term side effects - I think he mentioned tardive dyskinesia (spelling?).  He mentioned Lithobid again, but finally I went on Lamictal and I am happy with it ... finally some relief.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24647

I switched to Abilify after the negative effects of Geodon (see my review) were too much for me to handle any longer. I had taken one pill before I was up all night long hallucinating - posters on the wall were moving, talking to me, etc. I also experienced severe diarrhea and vomiting. I called my pyschiatrist the next morning and she told me to take it again. I ended up in the Emergency Room of my local hospital that night to make sure I was not dehydrated. I was given a shot to stop the nausea and some medication for the diarrhea. I am no longer taking Abilify.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24089

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2005-06-21 00:00:00		0.0	1.0	5.0	0.5	abilify This was Rx for my school aged child. It simply did not work. We started at 1.25 mg/d and side effects were large. He could not get through the day, very lethargic, laid his head on the table at lunch  he was so tired. Next he was an insomniac on it.  We tried it both AM and the PM-side effects either way. Also, he was always hot. Clearly this messed up parasympathetic control (BP, body temp). Besides intolerable side effects at a ridiculously low dose, Abilify worsened all the sx we were hoping to treat:  Volatility, behavioral rigidity, rage reactions all got worse.  Caution: 5-HTP supplement appears to amplify this medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23906

He would have night terrors and he would have loose stools from it but it worked. Meaning it settled him down from the being Manic.So we backed off to only 10mg in morning and added another in the same family and it seems to not have the night terrors anymore.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23878

I couldn't stop eating and although I watch what I eat the weight gain was tremendous. I also began smoking more which seems to happen to me with meds that affect dopamine. I didn't sleep and drove my house guests crazy by roaming the house all night. I did get a lot of artwork done. I was taking my 150mg Effexor XR for depression and my 20mg Topomax for migraines at this time too.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23504

Dr. cut me to 1/4 of a tab still side effects than i went to 1/4 of a tab every 3rd day and was working up to a 1/4 tab (1.25mg.) every day over several wk. period.  Agitation increased and i deceided this med. was too. strong for me-i quit it.Was also concerned about the diabetes risk as i am borderline diabetic-although i thought if this med. worked i would risk the diabetes connection.VERY STRONG MEDICINE-would start out on minimal dose.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22992
abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2005-05-16 00:00:00		1.0	1.0	5.0	1.5	Weight Gain and Mania I experienced about the same amount of weight gain on Abilify as Zyprexa. Also, it induced mania and mild hallucinations. I have Bipolar 4: Depression with drug-induced mania (rare/unheard of), and am very drug-sensitive, so my results are not typical, but bipolars should be aware. Definitely not the worst drug I have ever taken, but no great effect on my stabilization.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30097

Risperdal was nice for a little while, but caused me to have intolerable muscle cramps which naturally made me feel irritable and more depressed.  Abilify also caused me physical pain so I discontinued it after just a few weeks.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/21152
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2005-04-11 00:00:00		1.0	0.0	0.0	0.5	Abilify made me Manic Very manic.  I should have been hospitalized, but my wife helped me through it.  I was on a very stable run for 2 months when I started Abilify to stop recurrent thoughts, which it did.  After about 2 or 3 weeks, I started to go really manic and after 1 month it was getting serious.  I was in an all out rage all day along with being angry and agitated.  I was not nice to be around.  After my pdoc stopped this medication, I came down off the mania in about 2 weeks.  We started Risperdal instead, which seems to be working so far.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31035
abilify	Anorexia	2005-04-05 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	4.0	Positive but has a few not-so-fun side effects I've been prescribed abilify after having more than a lot of trouble with other anti-psychotics and I must say that it really, truly does help with my anxiety and obsessive thoughts related to my eating disorder so I definitely would recommend it to others who have also had trouble finding a steady, stable, actually helpful drug in this major class of medications before, but I must warn you that it has a few side effects that aren't the greatest and don't make me so well...for example, occasionally I find myself dealing with rebound anxiety from the Abilify, a massive headache that sometimes becomes so awful that I have to take major painkillers to treat it, an upset stomach that gurgles and makes lots of unsettling noises and leads me to constipation and pretty bad vomiting, but other than all of those effects which incidentally don't occur THAT often, this medication seems to work pretty well and if you can handle the side effects, I'd strongly recommend it for the treatment of your anxiety, depression, and obsessiveness related to your eating disorder if you feel it'd work for you. I mean, I'd at least give it a try. Plus, it has less of a side effect of causing really bad weight gain unlike the rest of the anti-psychotics and I am perfectly well aware that is a MAJOR issue for those of us suffering from our diseases. So good luck to you all and I hope this information has helped you at least somewhat. Best wishes!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/20875

Prior to that he was using Zyprexa, which had numerous side effects and dulled his personality and creativity a lot.

I began to see improvement within 2 weeks- I was so excited to feel so &quot;normal&quot; and not groggy. Then, after about 2 months on it I began to have horrible anxiety. I usually have some anxiety anyway, but this was totally disabling. I was afraid to leave my house and when I had to I was convinced I was going to die!  It does say on the information sheet that the most common side effect is anxiety- happening with 25% of people who take it. It does work wonders for some people but it definitly wasn't for me!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30579
abilify	Depression	2005-01-23 00:00:00		4.0	2.5	5.0	3.5	Wonderdrug! I have been taking 1/2 of a 15 mg tablet of Abilify for about 2 weeks, and the change is amazing.  I feel better than I have for 3 years.  I also take Effexor, Desipramine, and Lamictal--but all of those together did nothing compared to the Abilify.  UPDATE: I was increased to 30 mg/day--and I could not concentrate at work, and seemed more irritable.  Am now adding Trileptal in response to this, and am back down to 5 mg every other day of Abilify (still taking Desipramine, Effexor and Lamictal--but am hoping to stop the 1st two.).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17456

My brain is on fire, but my body is...just here.

When I tried Abilify, the Dr. I had at the time (who dx me with every symptom but never said BP) only gave me 2.5mg at night. When I would take it my mind would race even more but my body felt paralyzed my husband actually had to carry me to bed a couple of times!! The Trileptal I tried did the same thing when I was only on 75mg it did almost the same thing.  My new Dr. said it was way too low.  I'm on 600mg now and doing better but need to be bumped up again.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17873
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2005-01-01 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	*WAS* a great med for me! I was on 40mg at bedtime, although I needed Cogentin with it to sleep.  That aside, I found Abilify to be an awesome med for me! I was on it for Bipolar. I did get shaky a lot, however Cogentin controlled it. It turned out to be worth taking an extra med(Cogentin). It controlled my BPD quite well, my mood was almost rock stable on it. I was on it from Nov. to Sept., and once off of it, everything went downhill from there. Unfortunately, in Sept., I developed what is called Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome...a RARE, near fatal reaction to neuroleptics - which are anti-psychotics. Obviously, it wasn't fatal for me! But, you can't go back on the med you were on when it happened. And they don't know why it happens. They also have to be really careful if you want to try any neuroleptics in the future. I've tried 2, and so far OK. But all I can say is that I &quot;mourn&quot; Abilify!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17806
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2004-12-24 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	I Had to Rate Abilify for Depression/Anxiety... Despite rating this drug under bipolar depression (a while ago), I simply had to toss in a review for Abilify and depression/anxiety.  This drug, in combination with others, has changed me dramatically, just recently!  And I notice a couple of distinct observations about the med.First, it would seem that Abilify works quickly (or else not at all) in cases where little else has worked, speaking of depression and/or anxiety.  It would also seems that those of us for whom it works suffer from multiple disorders.Secondly, it seems to work where and when the SSRI's fail - hey, maybe when everything else fails.  Why?  I don't know except that it has something to do with dopamine and serotonin balancing.  All I can tell you is that it's made a significant change in my life and my personality when taken in combination with other meds, specifically for the depressive component of major psychological disorders.  Just now I find myself confronted with the holidays.  And as many of you know, this is the most stressful and depressing time of year for us.  It takes all our strength, it makes us feel helpless and hopeless around family, and it's just not the great experience that most folks enjoy.  Well, I can say with some degree of confidence that this is the first time in a long time I've felt capable of dealing with holiday stress!  The only thing to which I can attribute it is Abilify.I have been taking a small dose of this med in combination with my other cocktail for about a month now, and have reserved judgment until now.  The results from my personal experience are great.  In fact, it worked so quickly that I was astounded (about 3 days).  I tapered and discontinued my SSRI, I reduced the amount of other medication I take by at least 1/2, and I feel really blessed to have this miracle drug available, despite the very expensive cost.As far as side-effects, well I have noticed more energy, as in it is simul	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/37052
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2004-12-15 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	cured my impulsive speech I am so grateful that I was prescribed this drug. After several weeks of researching it, I finally convinced the doc to let me try it. I am dx'd BPI and have had trouble in the past with blurting out all sorts of things. Also, my racing thoughts did not help matters, either. Enter Abilify and I feel I've been &quot;cured.&quot; Also, I can actually cut the 5mg's in half and get results.At first it was difficult to time the dosage. For example, if I took it too early in the evening, I woke up ready to go at 3am. It was like the drug only allowed a 5-6 hour sleep. But, after two weeks of having this sleep issue it seemed to even out. Now I take it at 9pm and wake up ready to go at 6. Abilify allows me a full, productive day with no sleepiness---no napping, which is amazing since before I began treatment I took 3 hour naps every day.Since beginning treatment, my impulsive speech is gone completely. My racing thoughts are gone. And as an added benefit so are my migraines. This last benefit I have not heard from any other users.Cost is an issue with this med. I am fortunate to have insurance. I would recommend for anyone having difficulty affording this med to ask their physician how to get on a pharmaceutical program to obtain it free or at a reduced cost. Abilify is definitely worth a try.Sybilla	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30588

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2004-11-29 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	5.0	4.0	Abilify is worth a try Abilify has virtually cured my Bipolar 1.  Like Geodon, I think it has some of its own mood stabilizing and anti-depressant qualities in addition to its effectiveness in treating acute mania, paranoia, hallucinations, etc.  If Geodon has been working well for you, but want to try something different, I suggest abilify. The main, and really only, side effect that I have with it is very strange sleep disturbances.  But they do get better with time (2&gt; months).  I have learned that every single person reacts drastically different to antipsychotics.  Zyprexa turned me into an absolute zombie.  For other people Zyprexa is the miracle drug. Abilify is my miracle drug, but maybe, abililfy will turn you into a zombie.  But I think it's worth a shot if your current cocktail isn't doing the trick.  Like any drug, don't immediately discard it because of its side effects.  They all have side effects.  You have to brave through them for a while if you really want to find an effective treatment for your disorder.  UPDATE:  Maybe it's just me, but careful taking zyban/wellbutrin on this stuff.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30897

I read all about the partial dopamine agonism, thinking my dopamine receptors needed to be partially agonized.  I really couldn't stand more than 3 weeks on this drug, and I pride myself in thinking I'm a trooper with side effects.  I felt really energized and great within the first three days.  After that, I experienced profound anxiety.  It felt like someone had walked up behind me and said--&quot;BOO!&quot;--only ALL OF THE TIME.  I couldn't sit still, couldn't listen, type, etc.  I described it to my doctor as mania, although he doesn't believe it to be so.  So I've decided to go back to good ol' Risperdal, which has worked very well for me in conjunction with 750mg Depakote.  It has abated about 85% of my bipolar II symptoms, and allows me to sleep and eat.  (I tried Abilify in the hopes of getting rid of the 15% left).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/15508

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2004-08-09 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	5.0	3.0	Fantastic!!!...at first. I started Abilify in Sept/03, during a particularly severe depressive episode. I was simply amazed at how fast in knocked out my most major symptoms like the constant crying, s*icidal thoughts, aud/viz hallucinations, hopelessness, inability to get out of bed and so on. I literally felt better within days. Unfortunately, as the weeks/months went on I started sleeping less and less, experienced a dramatic increase in anxiety, and became very agitated and constantly hungry. For me it had a very zoomy, stimulating rather than the typical sedating effects of the other antipsychotics. I have since learned that insomnia, anxiety and agitation are the most common adverse reactions to Abilify.On another negative note, although it is said to be weight neutral, I have gained 25# since being on this drug. Although all of our systems differ, my advice if you want to give it a whirl...start at the lowest dosage (5mg) titrate up very slowly, and always take it in the a.m. to lessen the likelihood of insomnia.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14596

I was very afraid to stop Lamictal cold turkey and suspected that I would have the same side-effect with Abilify than with Seroquel (which worked very well too) : oro-facial dyskinesia and strong dystonia. But after two weeks, I'm feeling very happy with this medicine: it has quite the same properties than the both mentioned above; I feel even more stimulated (it made me pace the first days). It cuts down my up and lows, my anger/impulsivity and makes me very &quot;awake&quot;. The only side-effects I have and that tend to subside are: cramps in the legs and sweating.My cocktail is now the following:         Aurorix 1200 mg/d (moclobemide)         Keppra 3000 mg/d (levetiracetam)         Permax 0.75 mg/d (pergolide)         Abilify 10 mg/d (aripiprazole)         Omegabrite 4 caps/d (omega3)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30310

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2004-07-03 00:00:00		3.5	2.5	5.0	3.0	Could be better I found Abilify to be almost a miracle drug at first -- it brought me out of a mixed episode almost overnight.  However, the weight gain issue has been just as bad for me as it was with Zyprexa.  My doctor continues to insist that Abilify does not cause weight gain, but I am proof that it can.  When I am not taking atypicals, my metabolism is naturally very high.  I continue to balloon up.  My other concern is that I don't quite feel the effectiveness that I felt when I first began taking Abilify.  It initially had a very energizing effect and controlled my moods (definitely take it in the morning) but have since suffered with severe anxiety.  I have just been given Neurontin in addition to try to take care of this.This drug definitely has benefits, but I don't think it's for me anymore.  I hope to be free of it soon.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30214

Abilify has been wonderful with the 'negative symptoms' of bipolar, such as not wanting to be social, not wanting to clean up, take care of personal hygiene, etc.  My thinking is clearer and I'm making better decisions.  I have had some trouble with sleepiness but am currently adjusting the dose to decrease that.  I am so glad that there is a medication that works and does not cause havoc with my blodd chemistry like Respirdal did (i had inccreased blood sugar and trigylerides which subsided after switching meds).

abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2004-06-30 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	A Year Later Just started yesterday, very hopeful, supposed to be different, we'll see......My Dr. seems convinced it will take the place of Geodon and Paxil in my case (Schizo Affective/Bipolar) Tried everything else.....It has  been a week, and I have noticed a big change, although I was just upped from 15mgs/day to 30 mgs/day yesterday, to counteract an intense manic episode. I was simultaneously taken off Paxil which seems to have been contributing to the mania, so I can't be sure if I'm calm because of the Abilify or because I'm off the Paxil..I have noticed though, that I seem to have 'grown a smile'--my sense of humor has greatly improved and I am thinking clearly--nice change!.....It's been a  month and the metamorphosis continues...Amazingly, I am not even slightly manic, as  a matter of fact I am extremely calm and collected. I'm not thinking &quot;unreality&quot; thoughts(halleluia!) and don't seem to be self-castigating or self-recriminating, which is a big difference. I haven't noticed ANY negative side effects, and would recommend this to those who have tried everything, as well as those who don't want to go through trying everything. The doctor has put me on Lamictal for the residual depression. [It seems silly to consider this a symptom, but] I hadn't had the inclination to clean my place in eons, and depression has been ever-present most of my adult (and teenage) years, so we thought it was important to short-circuit any leanings in that oh-so-familiar direction. Btw, I am incrementally dosing up on the Lamictal to avoid that pesky  life-threatening rash, thanks to what I've read on this valuable site. 6/30/04...Well.......Now it's been a year and because of a combination of factors I can confidently say I'm in recovery! Abilify, especially, has been a big factor in my recovery--and I luckily have No Side Effects and have continued to lose weight--after all the bloating meds I've been on over the years, THAT is a welcome plus!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31307

Within an hour, I had a fever and was vomiting and close to fainting. I felt like this for roughly 28 hours. It was horrid. I notified him right away, and he switched me to Geodon, so we'll see how that goes. It's been a long time since a drug has made me this sick.

Increased it to a whole 10mgs Abilify and went back to giving it at bedtime since she complained of being tired all day long when taking it in the morning. She refuses to eat breakfast, skimps on lunch at school but seems to want to eat all afternoon and evening once she gets home from school. This has become a problem since she gained 30# while taking seroquel and risperdal. She's not lost one ounce of the excess weight from those trials and she is tired overall and won't exercise, either. Taking naps for a couple hours after school. Her mood is somewhat fuzzy and she has little motivation to study schoolwork. She describes herself as &quot;lazy&quot;. That is a change from being so &quot;hyperactive&quot; as she was before but she is not any less irritated by life in general. Not sure if we will continue much longer on Abilify OR depakote.

I have been diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features, social anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder. On the Seroquel alone at 800mg I felt so spacey, not myself, but when they cut it to 400mg and added the 10mg Abilify, I started feeling more like myself the first day, and I had a little bit more energy.  I am not sleeping as much, even though I get up 2-4 times a night.  I feel sort of tired during the day, but I'm hoping that after tomorrow, when I cut the Seroquel out for good, I will feel more alert.  Hopefully it won't turn into akithasia.  I've read that a lot of people get that with the abilify.  I'll come back and update in a few days when I'm off the Seroquel.  Also, I'd like to add that when I took the Abilify in the AM, I felt sleepy, although that might have been from the Seroquel, I'll try it again when my Seroquel is discontinued tomorrow.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12018

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2003-11-04 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	Abilify after a week Mainly I've felt tired but couldn't sleep well.  It's weird.  Plus I've been dizzy.  And my appetite is way down.  But it seems to control my irritability and paranoia.  Maybe with time the sleep problem and dizziness will subside.  I've only been on it a week.  I gave up Zyprexa for this stuff because I had gained lots of weight.  I've already lost some weight, either 4 or 6 pounds, I forgot which it was.  So I can be happy that my unhealthy weight is going down.  (And Zyprexa gave me a bad triglyceride count, so I hope that'll go down too)  So far Abilify is doing what Zyprexa did except for helping me sleep...I hope that changes.  In time I'll update this to fill you in on how things are going.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9260
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2003-10-04 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Abilify For years before taking Abilify I had trouble with noises: people talking, radios, tv's and voices.  The problem was that they did not have any ownership.  It was not a big enough problem to interrupt my actions or day but it often got my attention and disturbed me.  None of this has taken place since taking Abilify.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31846
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2003-10-04 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	4.0	Parent review for Abilify I suggested Abilify to my son's PCP after researching for a medication to help him with his bipolar disorder and his inability to remember to take too many pills a day.  He is also not good with having bloodwork.  Abilify was difficult for him at first - he was very thin (117lbs 5'8&quot;)and lost more than 12 lbs.  He was shakey and had sort of fainting spells (his description - he does not live at home). After a few weeks of his depression getting worse he had Paxil(20mg)added.  Still he was not much better.  We actually cut his Abilify from 10mg to 5mg (with Psychiatrist recomendation) and he is more stable.  Not great but also not depressed and was not self abusive any more.  So Abilify with Paxil is working for now.  He had been on MANY different medications over several years - antidepressants, mood stabilizers, etc.  He was doing fairly well until he went away to college and decided he was cured - plus he could not remember when to take what medication.  1 year without treatment showed him differently.  So for now he seems better - yes even he thinks so.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/8587
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2003-09-18 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	1.0	2.0	MAOI interaction I had an MAOI interaction with abilify (I take parnate). This is NOT a recognized problem (yet) and my doctor reported it to the drug company. That was pretty scary for me. Also, I had to have this compounded into 1 mg capsules by my pharmacist, which greatly added to the cost of this already expensive medication.Because it made me sick, I never had a chance to evaluate its effectiveness. It's difficult for me to sort the side effects from the MAOI interaction, but I think it made me hyper, took away my appetite, gave me akathesia from time to time, and made it hard for me to concentrate. Only antipsychotic other than risperdal that didn't make me somnolent, though, so I was able to take it during the day rather than just at night.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/30644
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2003-09-14 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Very Encouraged I have taken Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Geodon in that order, since 1992. My symptoms have included depression, low energy, anxiety, dread of almost any event, and to some extent aggressive feelings. I stopped taking Celexa in Dec.2002, because of weight gain. I began Geodon in June 2003, with good results. Then after approx. 1 month on Geodon, I began having heart palpitations. I reduced the Geodon until August, when I ceased taking it. The heart palpitations are gone. I began taking Abilify one week ago. I take 5 mg daily. I have had no side effects. There has been a &quot;lifting of my mood&quot;. I am encouraged by the benefits to my sense of well being. I will update this review in about a month.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/8287
abilify	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	2003-09-09 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	2.5	3.5	Works for me so far....      I had been on Seroquel to help me with OCD and generalized Anxiety but could not tolerate the sedation, so my doctor switched me to Abilify.  This drug seems to work very well overall.  The biggest side effect is a feeling of being extremely wired, which gradually melts away after a few weeks ( in the mean time, it might be a good time to build that deck you've been planning:) ).  I gave it a low ease of use score because I find myself having to splt a tiny pill into 4 pieces in order to get the dosage right (in otherwards, splitting a 10 mg pill into 4 roughly 2.5 mg pills).  My pharmacist says that 5 Mg pills are now availible, however.    Since switching I have been having trouble sleeping at night, but I have had problems with insomnia all my life and I think they were just being &quot;quelled&quot; by the Seroquel.  We are now trying Ambien for the insomnia (another story!)     Overall, I think this is probably the best drug I have tried yet for my OCD and generalized anxiety, although I have only been on it a few weeks...	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/29838

It had a totally opposite effect. I literally felt as if I weredragging lead weights. I couldn't even drive because my arms were too weak.

I have battled the buldge with Zyprexa for quite a while, and Abilify was supposed to be the end all solution.  I was so disappointed when it made me violently ill.

I started on abilify b/c my psych. thought this might be a good med. to help me with my anxiety, agitation and irritability along with my other meds, which are lamictal and topomax. Oh well, this just wasn't meant to be. After the first night I took abilify, the next morning I woke up nauseous. The nausea subsided but then the restlessness (akathesia: I think that's what it's called)set it. I could not sit down, I was constantly pacing around my house. I sat in a swivel chair spinning around until my sister thought I would unscrew it. Yet, another disappointing medication experience. Although, I do know people who have had a great experience with it. You just never know...	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/34788

Abilify is supposed to be relatively side effect free, but boy did I hit the jackpot on all of the possible ones!  While taking Abilify, I was extremely restless.  I could not sit still for a minute, I had to get up and jump up and down!  I could not sleep, partially due to the restlessness, and it just seemed to give me insomnia.  For the first several days of taking it, I was vomiting and feeling nauseated.  This pill was terrible for me, I could not wait to get off it.  It helped my paranoia though, but unfortunately the side effects were too much to bear.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/31698

I have more energy and feel more alert. Other than the headaches and nausea the first few days, I really haven't noticed any other side effects!

accutane	Acne	2007-10-09 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	4.0	I was on Accutane 15 years ago.  The side-effects were horrible - every part of my body was incredibly dry and cracked.  I was very depressed but I thought it was due to the acne (I would call in sick because I didn't want anyone to be repulsed by my face) and the dryness I experienced with the medication.  Within a few months, nothing mattered other than that my skin was clearing up.  I was on the Accutane for six months and, since then, I have had less than five flare-ups (meaning a pimple that is gone the next day).  My advice - make sure your dermatologist refers to the iPledge Program and follows the instructions to the letter.  If you are unsure about anything or have any questions/concerns, talk to your doctor before taking the medication!  Depression can be a major complication - and the defects to a fetus can be horrendous and devastating.  With that said, I would take Accutane in a heartbeat if it became necessary again...	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/56724
accutane	Acne	2007-02-08 00:00:00		4.0	2.0	4.0	3.5	Treat yourself I've had acne since I was 25 and was able able to control it with oral antibiotics and differn.  It improvd a lttle as I got older, but never went away.  I finally found a sympatheic Derm who agreed to put me out of my misery and prescibe Sotret.  He calls it a miracle drug and I just hope he's right.  So far things have been good w/ just small, surface pimples that go away quickly and don't scar.  Don't be afraid!!  I had post-partum depression after my second pregnancy, and went through a short period of treatment w/ Paxil.  I felt no signs of depression during Sotret therapy.  My hair looked awesome and my body felt great (I work out a lot).  Just be aware of the worsening.  It was crazy and painful, but it only lasted about 6 weeks.  Just go to your Derm a lot for injections.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54258
accutane	Acne	2006-11-17 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	4.5	4.0	good while it lasted I took this drug for a few months, and it pretty much cleared up ALL my acne.  I had tried every cream and treatment before accutane.  I had acne pretty bad, on my chest, face, and back.  The only bad part was having to do blood tests once a week (I think?).  Of course this drug is known to cause bad birth defects so don't take it if you're planning on getting pregnant!  I was going to continue taking this medication but my triglycerides went up a bit too far and so my doctor took me off of it.  So now it's 2 years later and my acne has partially come back...so I think that's because I got off too early.  Also I'm still 18 so I'm still acne prone.  I recommend this medication but be careful with it and don't go off too early if you can avoid that.Also I wanted to mention that this medication made me gain weight (or that weight gain might've been from the birth control I had to take while on the medication).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/52771
accutane	Acne	2006-09-23 00:00:00		4.0	2.0	3.5	3.5	The long journey with Accutane I started using Accutane my Sophomore year of high school (2001).  Back then, I do not think there was a 6-month limit on dosing.  I have used it on and off, and am now on the last month of my current dosing.  I have probably taken the stuff cumulatively for 3 years.My acne had never reponded to traditional treatments: salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, differin, antibiotics.  Retin-A was somewhat effective.  Each time I took accutane, my face would get worse the first 2 weeks, then gradually get better.  Every time I stopped taking it, 1 month later my acne was back in full swingSide effects were usually noticeable the first week.  The worst of them initally was the CHAPPED LIPS.  I always carry Carmex with me, now.  After stopping treatment my lips stay chapped for a few months, but gradually get better.One day during Freshman year of college (2003-2004) I decided I wanted to increase to 80mg/day.  The doctor said OK.  Within 2 weeks I had blood on the stool.  I immediatley stopped!Currently I am taking 40mg and 80mg, alternating every day.  The risk of rectal bleeding is still there (it happened a few times) but as long as I drink a lot of water and take some milk of magnesia once in a while, it's not usually a problem.  My face, right now, is as clear as it has ever been in my life since I've had facial acne.  My back has cleared up by about 50% (which is a major improvement).  I rarely have breakouts.  However I am about to complete this 6-month period, and wonder what lies in the future.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49982
accutane	Acne	2006-09-03 00:00:00		4.0	0.0	5.0	3.0	acne free for 5 years Well Accutane had its side effects.. And like many others have said the cracked lips - bloody noses were probably the worst.  I had a very strange incident with the accutane that I have about an inch and a half long pocket of puss along my cheek area just below the top layer of skin.. it looked absolutely horrific.. My skin was good for about 5 years.  and then it all came back.. They tried to get me to take it again and I refused.  My mother insisted it ruined my skin because of the scarring that was left after the acne.  The cost without insurance is extremely high.  But easy to take twice a day and in the packet as it unfolds lists about 20 side effects and warnings.  This is a very serious drug.  and pregancy is out of the question.  and would consider waiting a long time after treatment to think about having a child.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48745
accutane	Acne	2006-08-24 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	Worked well, no problems No side effects noticed at all.  It wasn't quite magic in its effectiveness, but did make a big improvement.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48246
accutane	Acne	2006-06-29 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Expensive but worth every penny The most annoying side effect of accutane was the dry lips.  My lips would chap and split very easily, and I was dilligent about using chapstick.  It helped to dry out my oily skin, and my cystic acne was gone.  The best thing is that it was gone for at least over a year after I took it.  After about a year after stopping, I started getting acne again but nowhere near as severe as I originally had.  I did not experience any depression or suicidal thoughts while on accutane.  I have not had any long term side effects that I have noticed.  I haven't tried to have kids yet, and I don't think it should be a problem, especially since it was so long ago now.  If cystic acne is ruining your life and you've taken antibiotics and tried every cream in the pharmacy, this is the right drug for you.  Unrelated to myself, a girl I went to high school with had such bad acne, her acne had acne.  She tried everything under the sun, and the only thing that worked was a combo of topical treatment plus accutane.  I'd be willing to bet that accutane saved her life, because she was extremely depressed because of her skin condition.  The only thing that stinks about accutane is that it is very expensive, and some insurances won't cover it because they do not consider it medically necessary.  Until a generic comes out, cost is going to be an issue for people trying to choose an acne medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/45338
accutane	Acne	2006-05-09 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	Severe Acne treated I had lost hope that I would ever find that medicine that would help me get rid of my acne. I was diagnosed with acne vulgaris, and took three types of antibiotics, and some hormonal pills in hope that the acne would disappear. My doctor finally put me on Accutane, and it has done wonders. Everyone has been shocked at how my face looks now, after only 6 month of being on the drug. Of course I have to deal with the side effects such as continuous dryness of mucous tissue, and being really careful not to get pregnant. However I have not had any new pimples in more than 3 months.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/27973
accutane	Acne	2006-04-08 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	Accutane RUINED my life!!!!! What a MISTAKE I made taking accutane! A few months into treatment I started developing food allergies/wheezing and frequent urination! My doctor kept telling me that there was no way Accutane was causing this! WELL....years after taking it I am still plagued with several food allergies/sensitivities and I have been diagnosed with a very painful disease called interstitial cystitis. The accutane DESTROYED the lining of my bladder and now I live in pain!!! It feels like battery acid was poured on my bladder when I eat basically anything...with a few exceptions. I now am a chronic pain patient with a rare disease that developed during accutane treatment. OH...and I still have acne. Accutane is NOT worth the risks. I have met several people that developed bladder diseases and bladder bleeding while on Accutane.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40735
accutane	Acne	2006-03-19 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	3.0	4.5	amazing results This is what cured me of my cystic acne.  It was the last resort, but I have amazing skin now.  I had to stay on it a bit longer than the recommended time, but it worked and I have been acne free for a couple years now.  The only downside was it really dried my skin out as well as my lips.  I was constantly putting on lotion and chapstick.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/39673
accutane	Acne	2005-10-07 00:00:00		4.0	2.5	3.5	3.5	Accutane also for hydradenittis supportiva Accutane is a very effective medication in spite of all the side effects.  I understand the need for the strict packaging but for an adult with arthritis in my hands, just opening those packages was very difficul and sometimes very frustrating.  My doctor is now refusing to use Accutane due to increased reports of possible liver damage - now she plans to use Cleomyacin instead (a wide spectrum powerful antibiotic) before she prescribed the cleomyacin with the acutane - I am praying that I do not have another attack of hydradenittis supportiva	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/28306
accutane	Acne	2005-08-11 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	4.5	3.5	Accutane-best last resort I'd always had mild acne,  but nothing that was not controlled with over the counter products.  My face progressively got worse through college until my face exploded into severe cystic acne (we're talking cysts on top of cysts here) after I turned 20. I tried various treatments with little to no success--birth control, retin-a, topical and oral antibiotics, etc.  People I didn't even know remarked on how painful my face looked.  It was very inflamed and red and just ick.  Eventually my dermatologist put me on Accutane and it was a miracle.  People were remarking on how clear my face was,  I was in heaven.  I know accutane is very controversial but I never really experienced any severe side effects.  I wasn't depressed,  actually I'd never been happier.  With a good moisturizer and proper skin care regime my face was not too dry.  One drawback to Accutane,  it is very pricey.  Mid-way through my treatment I went off my parents insurance due to age and we paid out of pocket.  It was over $600 for one month of accutane so we ended up ordering it from Canada.  There is a program for low-income people to get accutane,  but I didn't qualify.  3 years later though my face is starting to break out here and there... but I think that is more related to diet and lack of exercise than anything.  If you've tried everything under the sun with no results,  Accutane may be a good option.  Despite its controversial nature,  I would do it again in a heartbeat. For people really disheartened by their acne it can be life changing.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25238
accutane	Acne	2005-08-03 00:00:00		5.0	2.0	5.0	4.5	Worked wonders! I had SEVERE acne as a teen, and accutane was a miracle for me. Over a year and a half, my acne problems disapeared. I'm still left with scars from the severe acne on my back, but no longer have the zit problem!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25101
accutane	Acne	2005-06-26 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	3.5	4.5	Highly Recommended I started on accutane when I was 16-17 years old.  At the time I was severely depressed by my acne.  I'd have to say that getting on the medicine was the single best thing I had ever done.  In retrospect, I remember that it caused severe dry skin but on the same note, it was this dry skin that allowed me to see that my acne was going away.  For months after I finished the three month treatment, my skin kept getting better and better.  I am now 22 years old and I have a small breakout here and there, but the important thing is that it is always controllable by regular means (before Accutane I dreamed of being one of the lucky ones for whom Stridex and Oxy actually worked.  I'd weight the risks and benefits with a doctor.  If your acne is not that bad, then I would not recommend treatment with accutane.  I tried it again when I was 18 for a breakout, and immediately quit taking it.  I realized that it wasn't bad enough and therefore the side effects were not worth it.  Effective remedies tend to have cons that one must deal with, accutane is no different.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24253
accutane	Acne	2005-06-24 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	Accutane works, on your face I took accutane 20 years ago and it cleared up the acne on my face almost totally. It had no effect on my back, however.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24183
accutane	Acne	2005-06-24 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	2.5	3.0	Worked pretty darn well I took Accutane (amnesteem) for 9 months. I started on 30mg 1x a day, then increased to 2x a day. It really cleared up my skin a lot, and I have barely had even one pimple, blackhead, or whitehead since going off of it. My skin is much less oily as well. The negative side of this was the side effects, and they were TERRIBLE. My lips, eyes, face, and inside of my nose were dry for the entire course of the treatment. I had to constantly put vaseline in my nose or eyedrops in my eyes. I also got severely depressed, but then again I have always been depressed so its hard to say which it was. And towards the end of the treatment I started to get a ringing in my ears, which went away once I stopped taking it. All in all it was worth the side effects.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24147
accutane	Acne	2005-06-05 00:00:00		3.5	0.0	1.0	2.0	Accutane Should never be used for hearing impaired acne sufferers. Hearing loss is a real issue.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23366
accutane	Acne	2005-05-18 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	4.0	Very effective shame about the side effects. I'm on my second course of roaccutane, having had some spots return 12 months after my first course.  The first month can be tough side effects wise, not just because it can be uncomfortable, sore skin and lips, itchy eyes, but mainly because of the effects on your appearance - very red lips, peeling and flaky skin, red raw areas that are hard to cover with make-up.  But it gets better - after a month the side effects become less severe and with good products you'll be able to disguise the side-effects pretty effectively (see below).The only other major bind is that it increases the toxicity of alcohol by over-working your liver, which means a serious reduction in alcohol tolerance, horrendous hangovers, combined with the stress your giving your liver you need to really restrict your alcohol or cut down altogether.The upside is it works, although spots can come back, they will not be as severe and you can have multiple courses until they disappear for good.To minimize side effects I recommend a good lip balm such as nivea with sunscreen, or lancome juicy tubes for the ladies. Some good quality moisturizer (I recommend decleor aromessence angelique oil followed by their nutri-delice moisturizor), or if you're in the sun Elemis essential day cream has sunscreen in it.  You also need to exfoliate regularly to remove the dead skin, but most bead based exfoliants are too harsh for your hyper-sensitized skin.  I recommend using a muslin cloth to remove your cleanser.  Both Eve Lom, and Liz Earle cleansers are excellent products designed for use with and supplied with muslin cloths.To cover up Prescriptives foundations are the best, as is their Camouflage cream.Isotretinoin is available on the NHS, don't know the cost privately.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22901

acetaminophen-codeine	Migraine	2004-12-11 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Eeehhh...  It's okay. I have used Tylenol III for years as a supplement when I have had little nagging migraines that just wont go away.  Normally the Zonegran takes care of them but occasionally one will leak through.I have had much better luck with Panlor.  It is far and away better that Tylenol III.  It is more expensive since there is no generic. There is some slight chemical difference in the two mostly the Panlor has a bit of caffeine in it.  The codeine is a bit different in some way  hey  Im not a chemist.  I just know its much more effective.  Strange thing is it has less codeine in it.The usual codeine side effects apply to both.  We all know how they feel.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17555

acetaminophen-codeine	Endometriosis	2004-11-06 00:00:00		3.0	3.0	5.0	3.0	Tylenol with Codeine Before I switched to Lortab, I tried Tylenol #4 (and previously, Tylenol #3 from a few different doctors).  The pain relief was minimal, although it did make me a bit goofy (which helped me feel better, even if I still hurt).  Unfortunately, codeine seems to make me *quite* nauseous, so I wind up having to lie down... so it doesn't help me to function much.I did find it was somewhat less constipating than Lortab/Vicodin, which is a bonus.  However, the effectiveness seems to wear off VERY quickly with this particular drug -- after 2-3 days, it's not working at all anymore.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16651

This particular medication helps but enough to only take the pain down from a 8 to a 7. Moderate to severe pain is supposed to be relieved? Each person is different, that's true. The only problem with having surgeries as a kid and taking pain meds since then is now a high tolerance to most commonly prescribed medications.  This Norco 7.5/325 just doesnt cut it.	-

acetaminophen-hydrocodone	Pain	2011-09-26 00:00:00		4.0	0.5	1.0	0.5	I had horrific pain for weeks from a anal fissure and the doctor did a sphincterotomy on me.  Even though the surgery helped me a lot, my pain went from horrific down to terrible.  She prescribed hydrocodon-Acetaminophen 5-325 for which I was to take 1 to 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed.This is a nasty drug.  After taking the first tablet, I develope a headache, pressure in my ears, sounds amplified, nausea and awful light-headedness...but my surgical pain went away.  The half tablet was just as bad.  I learned if I cut the tablet into thirds, I can sort of tolerate a third of it.I don't normally take any drugs, and so this drug is very hard on me.  I will continue taking it for another day or two until then stop taking it.After reading other people's reviews, it looks like I'm the only one who has been affected so adversely by the awful drug.	-

I had shingles and I was taking 8-12 per day for almost a year it was getting harder to get them the doctors were getting begining not to believe I was in such pain. A pharmisist pointed out to me that I was probably addicted and my reply was that I am in so much pain.  She said the drug may be enhancing the pain so you will take more of it.  She suggested that I should detox and see if the pain is less and I did It was horrible but after about 3 days I realized that a lot of the pain I was feeling was much less.  It took awhile for me to recover and that was 6 months ago.  I still have chronic pain and I take 2 to 3 per day now but no more than that and it really helps.	-

Plus it made me sick as a dog! I had all the less severe side effects! Plus after reading the hospital was not suppose to give this to me anyways b/c ppl who has has gallbladder problems are not suppose to take this. I didnt know this until after I looked this up.

Do the research.Recommendation is now to take it for 14 days in a row, and no more.Apparently it does such a effective job, that, with the lack of acid in the stomach, the calcium and minerals do not get broken-down to be delivered to the bones.If you have taken this for more than three months and find that you have back pain or some type of bone pain, be aware and concerned.

My gastrointerologist gave me several different &quot;PPI's&quot; to try. When they all failed he gave me some samples of Aciphex and I haven't had reflux since. LOVE this little pill!!!   My insurance considers it an &quot;Out-of-network&quot; medication and my co-pay is about $70 when I have to use my insurance, I a lucky enough to have a PCP with a in office pharmacy and as long as one of the doctor's there writes the Rx I only have to pay $15 (drastic price difference.

I was on it for a year because it's the only ppi my insurance would pay for, but my condition really deteriorated during that time and I had to go back to taking Prevacid, which works the best for me. It's costing me a fortune, but it's better than the horrible symptoms I was exxperiencing. My doc says there all the same, but I disagree with that.

Aciphex prescribed, 8 weeks later erosive Esophagitis fully resolved. Follow up Endosopy and biopsy a year later, Barrett's Esophagus fully resolved.  Another Upper GI Endoscopy 2 years ago confirmed.  Because Aciphex is high tier drug, my insurance copay started to go up 4 years ago so tried other lower tier, lower cost PPIs.  Did not get same results.  Went back to Aciphex despite the higher cost.  Continue daily dose; as long as I do not forget to take and do not overeat, I have no symptoms of heartburn or acid reflux.  Also take a multi-vitamin and a Vitamin B supplement due to potential side effect of reduced vitamin absorbtion.  Aciphex had been exceptionally effective for me, just wish the manufacturer's cost would come down, my health insurance would cover more of the cost, or a generic version of the drug would become available.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57324

I didn't notice the change in the medication on the label and continued to take it as I had the Aciphex.

aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2006-01-05 00:00:00		0.5	1.0	3.5	1.0	Aciphex &amp; Depression/Eye problems I have been using aciphex for about 2 years. I also started on Zocor (for cholesterol) at about the same time. Since then, I just haven't felt like myself. I assumed it was from the Zocor. I would have eye muscle pain. Several weeks ago I started having severe anxiety attacks. My GERD got a lot worse so the DR then increased my dose of aciphex 2x daily. About a month later, I sunk into a pretty bad depressive state. I was always sad and felt like crying - in addition to anxiety attacks. Well, I stopped taking the aciphex 2 days ago and I do not have the eye pain anymore and I don't seem to be as depressed. Both are side effects of Aciphex. It's amazing how a little pill can cause so much change in your life! Update Jan 2006: Discontinued using Aciphex back in Dec. 2004. My Dr. tried prescribing additional Proton Pump Inhibitors and I had the same side effects. I completely came off all acid medication and a few weeks later had blood work done. My liver function tests were now normal(prior to that, my LFTs were all elevated about twice the normal limit). My Dr. then seemed to take me more seriously about my reaction to Aciphex and my side effects. It was determined that I am allergic to all Proton Pump Inhibitor medications. I now take Zantac as needed and it works like a charm for me. I actually have less Reflux now that I don't take aciphex! According the the Aciphex website, there ARE short and long term studies that document adverse reactions in a few people. However rare, they do happen.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17788

aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2005-03-04 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	4.5	2.0	Rabeprazole and joint pain. Prior to taking the proton pump inhibitor Rabeprazole (Pariet) for my GORD I had previously tried H2 antagonists (Ranitidine, Cimetidine, etc) and the ppi Omeprazole (Losec), but had encountered problems with all. As well as losing their effectiveness quite rapidly I found that the H2 antagonists tended to make me depressed, and produce some minor joint pain. I tried these on and off for some time, and with each trial the joint pain returned, but passed away within a short time of discontinuing the H2 antagonist in question. I then moved on to Omeprazole. These were far more effective in suppressing acid production, but again there was depression, and more significantly, a lot more joint pain which took a lot longer to pass away when I discontinued the Omeprazole. I tried this on a number of ocassions, and on each occasion the joint pain was more severe. Finally I tried Rabeprozale, one 20mg tablet per day. (I had asked my GP for the lower dose of 10mg, but was mistakenly prescribed the higher one.) I have been suffering from worsening arthritic pain in the joints ever since. One theory is that the suppression of acid in the gut puts the balance of the intestinal flora out of whack, and that some of the more insidious of these may then migrate to the joints if there is a leaky gut. Anyone else have this kind of a problem?	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19637

aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2005-01-18 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	4.5	Aciphex didn't stay effective for me. I started taking Aciphex over four years ago. At first it worked great. 20mg in the morning was all I needed. Gradually, the hearburn started creeping back and I started having trouble swallowing. They bumped me up to 20mg twice a day and that worked for a couple more years. My insurance recently removed this drug from the list of &quot;approved&quot; medications so it's cost effectiveness rating is way down.I ended up with some complications from a respiratory infection and coughing which caused a large hiatal hernia and I no longer had any sphincter left. I went in for a Nissen fundoplication on November and had submitted a report on that procedure on this forum. I'm no longer on the Aciphex and seem to be on the mends. My thought is that if you can postpone a surgical repair, you should, and Aciphex may allow you to do that.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18091

However, I have been battling insomnia within the past couple of weeks, and wonder if Aciphex is the culprit.  Insomnia is listed as a side effect.  I lie awake, not fretting over anything, but I just can't sleep.  Just as I am about to nod off, I will experience a slight twitch or jerk.  It's not restless legs syndrome, for the jerks are minor and occur all over my body.  I'd rather suffer from GERD.

I have been having serious problems with depression and I think alot of it has been caused by the Aciphex since the deperession and suicidal thoughts have worsened since I have been on the Aciphex.    When hosipitalized for depression I was put on Protonix which also seemed to work about as well the Prevacid however about $2 a pill for Protonic's to be on it outside the hospital and that is after what insurance will pay for.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17218

Prevacid, the first one I was prescribed, produced intense bloating, nausuea, gas and diahrrea.  I was then prescribed Prilosec and it offered some relief, but Aciphex worked better.  I tried Protonix for about 9 months to see if the reflux symptoms could be further reduced after taking Aciphex for a year, but it wasn't any more effective, and was more expensive, so I returned to Aciphex. Recently, I was changed to 40 mg. of Nexxium twice a day, so I'll see if the little purple pill can do the trick.I had no discernible side effects with Protonix Aciphex.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11067

aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2004-02-11 00:00:00		3.5	0.0	3.5	2.5	PPI's can have dangerous side effects I took aciphex for about 7 months initially on a daily basis. It worked fine during the initial onset of the acid-reflux problem. 6 months later, I started to feel weird in the head, was not able to focus or think clearly, started to suffer from severe anxiety and confusion, started to experience tingling sensations in the left side of the head, couldn't sleep well at night, and eventually sank into a depression. At first, I didn't know what was going on, but later I suspected it had something to do with Aciphex and so stopped taking it. Things then started to become better. However, recovery has been very slow. The depression has for the most part gone away. However, the anxiety and nervousness have still to go away. I sleep much better. I reported this to my doctor, but he only pooh-poohed the whole thing saying millions take Aciphex. I don't understand the doctor's philosophy. I have nearly lost a year out of my life, and here the doctor still thinks Aciphex is a wonder drug. I am also very surprised that the literature that came with Aciphex at the pharmacy said that it had no reported potential side effects. I also believe that not many doctors know anything about its dangerous side effects. As to how I cope with acid reflux, I would certainly recommend changing your diet and lifestyle. I stopped eating spicy food, started to chew my food very well so that the esophagul sphincter did not get strained when letting food into my stomach, and lastly I sip a glass of milk through each day. Also, try not to stress yourself. Watch out for those moments when you tighten your stomach muscles unknowingly while sitting erect in front of computer or at a desk, so that you can relax those muscles. All these things are great because they work and you are not dependent on any drugs any more. Not only has the esophagus healed, I think the sphicter has healed too. What's really important to know is that our body is divine and ha	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10394
aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2003-11-27 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	purple what??? I would rate Aciphex as slightly less effective than Protonix but still very good. Protonix cured my GERD, Aciphex is maintaining me after a year. I avoid things that disturb my stomach such as onions, cinnamon, pizza sauce, pepperoni. That's a small price to pay for relief from the extreme pain I was suffering, enough to be hospitalized. Nexium did not touch my GERD. I was taking Vicodin or Hydrocodone to ease my stomach pain which I would rate as severe. After no relief from Nexium my internist prescribed Protonix. For me it was a minor miracle. With one dose my pain subsided. I had relief and it has not come back. I was given samples for 6 - 8 months and then the VA put me on Aciphex (Rabeprazole). I was worried about the switch but it's doing the trick too. I understand they are all very expensive. My HMO prescribed Prilosec to replace the Protonix/Aciphex regimen but I'm not switching just because of cost. The pain was too severe for me to ever go back to something else. In my case Protonix and Aciphex were superior to Nexium and Prilosec both in initial relief and as a maintenance medication in the relief of severe GERD.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9465

It worked well for my GERD at first, but then its effectiveness seemed to diminish.  I started getting pains in my thighs while sleeping and also some pains in my hands and occasionally head or neck pains.  I went to a neurologist for tests before it occurred to me that it might be the Aciphex.  When I stopped taking Aciphex, all my pains disappeared.  Protonix works much better for me. I've been on Protonix for a couple of months now, and so far so good, but I'm concerned about the safety of using PPIs for the rest of my life.  I tried Nexium once and that gave me a serious headache.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/8544

aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2003-08-06 00:00:00		5.0	0.0	5.0	3.5	Scary side effects I took Aciphex for 2 years and developed nerve problems including anxiety, paresthesia (tingling in legs and feet) and peripheral neropathy. (All are listed in the small print as side effects). After lots of testing including neurologists, mri's and blood tests with no results, I stopped the Aciphex and got back all the acid problems. I then took a natural approach with the help of a holistic MD. A change of diet (no meat, alcohol, caffiene, diet or decaf drinks; lots of pasta, rice and vegetables, watermellon, cantelope and bananas and lots of water, including eating very slowly and chewing a lot has taken almost all symptoms away within a month. Slowly, the nerves are healing. Proton pump inhibitors are new and should be used with caution long term.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/7449

aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2003-01-17 00:00:00		5.0	0.0	5.0	3.5	Beware of Potentially Lethal Side Effects After starting to take Aciphex I became depressed and suicidal. I was also paranoid and nervous and started having black out periods where I couldn't remember who I was--amnesia. These are ALL rarely published or talked about side effects of Aciphex. After a year of psychiatry and physician's bills I had to stop taking Aciphex because I couldn't afford to take it anymore. Three days after stopping the medication all of my suicidal, and other psychological symptoms disappeared. The voices in my head literally stopped as quickly as they had begun. This medication is dangerous because not many doctors know about or bother to look up these side effects and may not diagnose the problem in time. Stopping this medication saved my life. I have since had surgery for my GERD and am happier than I ever have been. I highly recommend the relatively painless laproscopic fundoplication procedure over this dangerous and insidious drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4171

actiq	Severe Pain	2008-10-03 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I find it appauling that the government has stepped in to stop the prescribing of the medication for severe chronic pain patients,  It's proven itself and is now in a generic form.  It's been my saving grace and CT is crazy to allow legislators determine this most important issue.it's a drug that helps many severe conditions and should be used in more applications for relief of debilitating pain.  I pray Ohio never steps in and makes changes that don't allow me this medication as it's worked miricles with me.  i'm still working with a very serious broken neck condition due to this medication.  I take it for breakthrough pain but can't imagine not having this medication to help me.  I'd be on SSI without it.  Legislators should think about that for awhile....keep pain patients working or bedridden???

When nothing else helps my intense, cervical spine injury (broken neck due to car accident)....I can put an ACTIQ LOLLIPOP in my cheek, lay down and feel better within 15 minutes.  It relieves my break through pain (very severe) as well as the worst of the migraines that I get due to my condition.  I also am on a slow release morphine Kadian to shield me from daily chronic pain but the ACTIQ has changed my life in the sense that I have so much more control over my bad pain days that used to keep me in bed. It has also come out in a GENERIC form so that it's affordable, it works and I'm so blessed to have a Pain Mgt. Dr. who knows what to prescribe and isn't afraid to use these amazing new tools to help people like me who, without it, wouldn't be functioning and able to work,  REMEMBER the hope I have now,  Relief is BLISS and Actiq relieves severe pain quickly (with mininal side effects) LASTS ABOUT 3 - 4 HRS.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57970

actiq	Headache - Cluster	2007-07-16 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Actiq with Fioricet Actiq used in conjunction with Fioricet can stop a cluster headache cold.  You have to work up to it, and you have to be on a base medication like oxycontin.  I have chronic pain care due to reactive arthritis which leads to cluster headaches.  I have controlled them, along with widspread pain throughout my spine and body in the following way.  I take 80 mcg of oxycontin twice a day as a base.  I take one Fioricet in the morning when I wake up, and one or two in the evening when I go to bed or with the second oxycontin. When a headache flares up, I immediately take two Fioricet and one or two Actiq.  The Actiq is for breakthrough pain and stops the immediate panic caused by the onset of the pain.  Actiq takes fifteen minutes to get fully down, rubbing as fast as you can on your gums.  You have to work the dosage.  I started out with 400's, but as my body became used to it, or my pain got worse--I don't know which--I found that I had to move to 800's.  This is a powerful medication, so start out taking one, and see if that works.  It is immediate and obvious.  If you still have the pain, take the second, at whichever dose your doctor has given you.  The nice thing about Actiq is that you can adjust the dose simply by stopping the sucking on it.  If you feel yourself getting dizzy or if the pain has subsided, take it out of your mouth and wait a few minutes, or suck on it more slowly.  Do this only under a doctor's supervision as this is powerful medicine.  The down side here is that Actiq is hugely expensive if you do not have insurance.  There is no generic.  The main ingredient here is Fioricet, which is the all-time greatest headache drug.  It combines tylenol, with a mild barbituate and caffiene as a catalyst.  My body is used to heavy medication from years of chronic pain, so many people cannot take these doses.  Play around with them carefully.  Some people are knocked flat with only one Fioricet.  I have found that two are safe	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55712
actiq	Herniated discs	2006-10-11 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	3.5	Best medication for breakthrough pain Actiq works very quickly 5-8 minutes and for me lasts 4-6 hours.  However once you're on it for long term maintenance of (in my case) back pain, sudden withdrawal can be very stressful.  A change in health insurance coverage requiring prior authorization could force you to be without it for a week. Or it may be removed from coverage in a health plan. The cost for 40 lozenges has gone from $550/mo. to $1100/mo. my co-pay is $100 but I'm sure that our health insurance will eventually decide not to cover this medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/51069

This is very common in Lyme patients.  I was given a baseline drug (this is something like methadone or long-acting morphine) and Actiq for breakthrough.  It was far and away the most effective drug I had. You could use a half of one if that met your pain needs.  It only lasts about 4 hours.  Problems:  frequently hard to get, very expensive, and it is sugar-based, so it's inappropriate for diabetics.  Also, all that sugar sitting in your mouth will ruin your teeth.  It is almost impossible to be discreet about it's use, since it takes 15-30 minutes to complete a lollipop.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49610

It is truly worth the money, and I will continue to use it as long as my Dr. will prescribe it.

I also had the Actiq pain pop which was great for break though pain.  Now the Drs. will not give me anything for my pain other than a huge increase of neurontin 800 mgs 3 X a day.  Also Relafen 500 mg tabs. 3 X a day.  I am in so much pain I wilt or can not function.  Lupus is controling my blood pressure, lungs and stomach or digestion.  I also have RSDS/CRPS which is also very painful.  When I was taken off the opiods I had to call 911 at least once a week or more.  I could not breath, and my heart felt like it was going to come out of my mouth.  Also the pain in my stomach can be unreal.  With RSDS, Reflex Sympatic Dystrophy Syndrome (www.rsdhope.org) my arms up to about the middle of the upper arm and my hands burn.  Also my feet up to my knees burn. I feels just like you fell into a fire.  It also has many other complications.Now that I have nothing to help I am so limited as to what I can do.

actiq	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2005-12-15 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	4.5	5.0	Actiq for Breakthrough Pain I was hesitant to take this when my pain Dr. suggested it, but now it is really a major part of my regime.  I take Oxycontin twice a day as my base, but that is a steady background drug.  If I want to play ball with the kids, or do something just a little past what I should, I get breakthrough pain which can lead to much worse pain, spasms, etc.  These things look like lollipops.  You have to keep them far away from kids and lock them up.  They taste good too.  You can only take them if you are already taking a fair level of opiates, or they will make you sick.  You suck on one at a time, placing it between your gum and lip, and finish it in 15 minutes.  It gives you immediate pain relief but only short term.  What is great about these is you can take as much or as little as you want.  You can finish one, or take only half.  Or, if the pain is severe, you can take two.  In dire circumstances, I have taken three.  They are for short term pain breakthrough only.  However, I have found that I have specific times of the day where I always exceed the limits of relief the Oxycontin gives me.  So, rather than go up in dosage on the Oxycontin, which probably wouldn't help stop the pain of a two hour carpool commute anyway, I sit back and break the pain with an Actiq.  Also, it allows me the freedom to do special things with my kids.  If I am just on the edge, or very tired and hurting just a little, and the kids want to play or something special, I can take an Actiq and do it with them because it is immediate.  It allows me to be a father when I need or want to be, and not have to suffer to do it.  These things are great, but have to be taken with care and under a doctor's careful supervision.  I was hesitant to take them because all the literature for them is for use for cancer patients and terminal patients, so I thought it would be too strong.  Those unfortunate people are taking much higher doses.  The 400's do the trick for most of us with t	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/34299

I use actiq as part of my total pain treatment. It works very fast but the taste of the new actiq (within 2 years) is pretty bad. It has a sandy feel and a bad taste.

actiq	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2005-08-23 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Actiq: I was put on Actiq 800 mg 4 times a day, from a doctor at the pain clinic and Narco for break through pain. I wish they had told me that the Actiq would make me lose my teeth. The Actiq works great. I have FMS, bi ladder pelvic hip rotation injury, from a car accident, and carpal tunnel. I can't take most of the medicines they use for these medical problems. The Actiq works so fast and helps me be mobile.  Most of the time I am in a wheel chair. I can use my walker when I take the Actiq. The Narco is better then vicodin or vicodin E.S. 7.5/750 There is a big difference. You can take 1-2 Narco every 4-6 hours 10/350 each. Vicodin only has 7.5 mg of narcotic and 750 mg of Tylenol. That is why you can only take 4 a day. It causes liver damage. Narco comes 10/350 I get more pain medicine and less Tylenol, less chance of liver damage. It works good as a break through medicine. Nothing else worked for me, with out sever reactions.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/26257
actiq	Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS)	2005-06-30 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Actiq (For Cancer Patients Only) It's funny, the thing that started me on the Actiq wasn't my Fibro, rather it was being prescribed to me by my Neurologist for my migraines.  (Which was working pretty well, I might add.)  Since using it for them, I noticed my Fibro. flares didn't seem quite as bad, so if I had a bad flare one day, I'd suck on an Actiq for a couple minutes (as I was on 1200mcg for my migraines and didn't feel I needed that much for the Fibro), and it worked beautifully!This went on for a few months, until one day I got a phone call from Blue Cross, my insurance company, who were calling to ask me if I had any form of cancer that they were unaware of.  I said no, so they asked what I was using the Actiq for &amp; I told them it was one of the ONLY things my Neurologist had found within the past 4 years that has worked for my migraines.  He informed me that my insurance was no longer going to pay for them since they were approved through the FDA for &quot;Breakthrough Cancer Pain&quot;, and since I didn't have cancer, I could no longer use them.  (At least, not without shelling out hundreds of dollars myself for a script.)  So there ended a wonderful medication that not only worked with my severe migraines, but was helping the Fibro as well.

My neurologist found a study done on it and found that something like 95% of the patients were able to eliminate trips to the ER with this drug. I haven't had to go to the ER since. However, since it's a powerful drug there are some prejudices on the part of some doctors, pharmacists, and insurance companies. While my last 2 insurance carriers paid for it, my current insurance will not. Their excuse is that the PDR does not include migraines as a condition for this drug. It costs the same as Axert though but it's $15.00 per lollipop. Even at that it's worth it for me as nothing else works. Axert, Maxalt , etc, works only about 40% of the time for me.

actiq	Herniated discs	2004-02-29 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	4.5	Actiq is excellent in CHRONIC severe pain  I was put on both 200 &amp; 400mcg Actiq 8 months ago for my 3+ year of severe c-spine (neck) painwhich would not respond to other meds. Within 1 lozenge I can say it worked like Cephalon claims in 15 minutes.1 month later, I was put on Duragesic (fentanyl patches) with the Actiq as a breakthrough med needed for flare uos.The combination is wonderful. I have 90% relief with both, and 5 months after being put on Actiq by my neurosurgeon he was able to do my surgery (discomectomy, allograft, fusion, powdered donor bone)...My recovery has been really rough, so I have remained on the Actiq and Duragesic since and I have been told I may need them both till I am fully fused in 1 year. Any longer term use of either Fentanyl based drug is hard to wean off of, so I will at the time needed go to a 2 day detox inpatient center for medical addictions (for people with legitimate drug use due to chronic pain). But the Actiq is a wonderful drug for SEVERE ONLY pain when other meds don't work, or in my case I am allergic to 2 major used pain meds).ACTIQ IS EXTREMLY EXPENSIVE WITH HAVING TO PAY OVER $1000 A MONTH FOR 2 BOXES OF 200MCG, AND 2 BOXES OF 400MCG.. IF PAID FOR BY CASH! (GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT THE 1600 MCG COSTS!) but for me I have a $30 co-pay.I will say a lot of insurance companies will not pay for Actiq since it is labeled for cancer patients only, but a lot of neurosurgeons and chronic pain centers use them all the time for non-cancer severe pain.It is a hard drug to get RX's for due to the high abuse factor if they get put into the wrong handsof known abusers.Actiq is not to be used unless lesser narcotics will help, and each separate wrapped in foil and plastic that you have to cut to get open package, they clearly state &quot;NOT TO BE USED BY NON TOLERANT MORPHINE OR FENTANYL PATIENTS)*** if your house has children they must be kept locked up in a cabinet since even 1 can and will kill a child or person over	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10983

I was weighing 289lbs when i started out on adipex. I am weighing 250lbs now from being on the pill for 2months.

adipex-p	Weight Loss	2009-01-10 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	First let me say I started in oct 2004 at 283lbs. WITHOUT any meds with JUST diet and exercise and going throug a divorce I lost 110lbs reaching 174lbs in 10 months. I am a 5ft 8in female so this was a good weight and got to keep my &quot;Betty Boop figure. I kept the weight off for about three years. In  the last year I put on 30lbs going to 207 I have been on adipex on and off for about6 weeks. The first 2 weeks I lost 15 lbs with diet and exersice going to 189lbs and platued i had to stop for a week because i had major constipation.  I gained 2 lbs back (prob in poop) When I started back with also eating 4 prunes nightly, i have lost another 4lbs. I think the week break helped to get the weight loss started again.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58965
adipex-p	Weight Loss	2009-01-08 00:00:00		1.0	2.5	4.0	1.0	The first time I took it, I was not overweight. I am 5'9 and I weighed 175 pounds. I was ecstatic because I lost 15 pounds in 2 months..then gained the weight back within a couple more months (although I maintained a healthy diet and exercise regimen). I took Adipex a second time and lost 25 pounds in 3 months. Then I gained back around 35 pounds within just a few months. I took Adipex again, but actually gained weight on it. I am now 80 pounds heavier than the first time I ever took it. I have been undergoing several tests and my endocrine specialist believes adipex may have had a long term effect on my metabolism/digestive system. While it does make you feel very content and happy, almost like an anti-depressent, the long term effects can be horrific. Before I took adipex I was very calm and easygoing. Since taking it, I am prone to horrible mood swings and aggitation. My recommendation is to stay FAR AWAY from this drug!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58945
adipex-p	Weight Loss	2009-01-01 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	Although this treatment is not right for everyone--check with your family doctor--I found that it worked for me. I also found that exercise and a proper diet has to be combined to make the treatment a success. It not only helps you to lose the weight, but it educates you on how to rethink what you eat, how you eat, &amp; that exercising is important. It doesnt call for you to starve yourself or work out for hours. However, working out for at least 30 minutes a day, &amp; eating a proper diet will not only improve your life but also produce results. It is not a fast fix, it takes several months &amp; it take effort, but it is well worth it. It only cost me $30 a month.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58888
adipex-p	Weight Loss	2008-12-12 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	I have been on adipex for 2 weeks now and have dropped 13 pounds.  I find this amazing since I had been on a 1500 calorie diet for 5 months with only a 2 pound weight loss.  I still remain at 1500 calories a day and this is sometimes hard to do since I am not hungry.  The only negitive effect is muscle tension.  I have noticed since I started taking this that my back is very tense and aches.  Other than that I would defintly recommend this to anyone who is having trouble loosing weight.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/58661

I have lost 30lbs in 3 months and the only side effect I have is the dry mouth-funny taste thing. I am not hyper and for the first time in 15 years I feel my energy level normal, I even sleep fine at night. My heart is fine and I have to say that long before I started taking these I did have a bit of an irregular heart beat but these pills in no way have caused me any problems. I know many doctors will look at you and say they are just speed pills but they are not. You really are not hungry. Its like gastric surgery without the surgery. And as a bonus with me its also  like an antidepressant. I have one more month left and hope to loose another 10lbs.

I insisted my Dr help me after everything else we tried failed because of allergic reactions to most medications and some food especially hebal treatments. Finally she tried Adpex-P  37.5 mg, once a dayI  I lost more than 25 pounds in 4 months. I still can't do strenous excercise, but I do walk at least a mile a day and I swim twice a week, I have had no  side effects that I have noticed, and  I have missed a dose or two during the few months I have been using Adpex and I had no problems. The only downside, which makes me HAPPY is now I have to buy &quot;SKINNY CLOTHES&quot; :) :)  I have already recommende this treatment to friends of whom one is a physical therapist.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57269

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2008-06-06 00:00:00		4.5	0.5	3.0	2.5	I have been on Advair for about almost 6 years now. I almost never use my resuce inhaler now. This happended about a week or two after starting the medication. I have only had one serious asthma attack sending me to the hospitol since on this. One side effect that I had no clue about was Intercystal Cystitis (spasiming of the bladder) this causes the walls of the baldder to spasm and then scar creating perfect conditions for infection. When I was diagnosed by a Urologist, he advised that he believed it was a side affect of the &quot;asthma&quot; medication I was on. He said he had noticed this in several of his patients over the years and found this medication to be the common link. Through online chatting I also found others who had the same trouble. Now I'm on another med to control that. Think before you take it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/57928

Since I had had these spots in my mouth &amp; throat twice and they cleared up with an antifungal prescription I Googled the symptom.  I found out that there have been reports of just that problem, spots on the larynx - some resulting in unnecessary treatment/surgery.  I had to seek a second opinion but he &amp; my GP agreed to give me oral steroids so I could take a break from the Advair.  It worked - a laryngoscopy showed the spots had vanished!  Unfortunately we found out I'm &quot;dependent&quot; on Advair...couldn't stay off it for long without ending up in the ER.  My GP even called Glaxo-Smith Kline &amp; was told there is no protocol for stopping.  If you have severe asthma - please do whatever your doctor recommends but if you have a choice I would not recommend this.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55122
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2007-07-02 00:00:00		2.5	5.0	2.5	0.5	I have been on Advair for 4 years now , I have always had asthma since I was a child but during my 2nd pregnancy it dramatically worsened. I have been on it ever since. At first it was a miracle drug, helped me breathe easier and almost completely stopped the attacks as well as having to use my rescue inhaler. Now 4 years later, I have tremors, chest pain, blurred vision, migranes, fatigue, SOB constantly , brusing , Dizziness and fungal infections of my digestive tract. THIS IS THE WORST MEDICATION AVAILABLE FOR ASTHMA. For the past 3 years I have had re occurant viral infections, rhinitis etc.,I really hope that I am able to stop taking this medication with out complications. I am only 24 years old. Hows that for improving the quality of life? I hope anyone just starting to take this medication is properly educated about the risks.

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2007-06-22 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	3.0	0.5	I have mild asthma.  I usually use an albuterol inhaler per year it is so mild. My allergist decided to try me on Advair for some reason and I ended up in the ER 4-5 times because this medication actually made my asthma worse instead of better. During each ER visit prednisone and other inhalers were prescribed to treat my &quot;severe&quot; asthma.  After about 6 weeks on this drug I was also taking prednisone, flovent, and nebulizing albuterol and ipratropium every 3-4 hours.  My healthcare providers never identified this drug as being the problem.  I did my own research and found out that some of the rare side effects of this medication are &quot;difficulty breathing&quot;.  I stopped Advair on my own and felt much better after 24 hours.  Of course I had to taper off of prednisone, but I was also able to stop nebulizing and taking the other prescribed inhalers.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/55079

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2007-02-13 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	3.0	4.0	Advair Works Great for Newly Diagnosed Asthma My doctor recently diagnosed me with asthma and prescribed Advair.  Within 10 days I noted a marked improvement in my condition.  So much so, I wish that I would have spoken up earlier.I regularly go to the gym and am sure to spend at least 25 minutes on the cross-training machine at various levels 3-4 times a week for cardiovascular health and weight control. I could not imagine that something fundamental was affecting my energy levels.  My doctor first discovered abnormally low testosterone &lt;200.  With the addition of depo testosterone my energy levels rose but I was still tired, very sensitive to cold, with frequent sweats.  This lead us to check my thyroid.  Sure enough, I have hypothyroidism.  Levothyroxine soon raised my energy levels and eliminated other symptoms of hypothyroidism.  Yet,  I still felt tired.  Changes in my depression meds did not help.  By chance, I mentioned to my doctor that I felt like I was drowning when I would drink at a water fountain.  Despite my frequent exercise, sometimes I would get winded just walking up the stairs.  He tested me and sure enough I was asthmatic.I suppose after living in some of the heavily polluted urban centers in the world, like South Chicago area, Osaka, and Tokyo, as well as suffering from allergies, I should have expected it.This medication has greatly improved my quality of life.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54311

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2007-01-29 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	3.5	3.5	Bad side effects This med works to control my asthma, but the side effects from the steroids are something I can't live with. I've had three separate types of symptoms at different times, all of which would go away if I stopped taking Advair and each of which caused me to decrease my dosage: 1) flu-like, listless; 2) dizzy/lightheaded, sleepy, tingling in arms; 3) intestinal pain. If I go back on this drug, I soon start experiencing the dizziness, then the intestinal pain. If I were to take a 'normal adult' dose, I would get the flu-like symptoms. I don't think these things will happen to many people, but be careful if you're sensitive to steroids.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54167

advair-diskus	Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease -- Maintenance	2006-12-06 00:00:00		3.0	4.5	4.5	3.5	Advair 500/50 I was started on this medication during a 5 month upper respiratory infection by my primary care physician.  I had been using inhaled salmeterol, inhaled corticosteroids, and albuterol.  It was a lot easier to just use the one inhaler but found the lower doses don't work for me.  It's also cheaper to buy one med with insurance than 3 meds.  My pcp gave it to me in part because she thought the combination of the 3 other drugs was causing thrush although I've been told that Advair can also cause thrush.  It's important to rinse one's mouth afterward.  Unfortunately, I&quot;m often too tired and just go to sleep.  Advair lets me sleep all night; I couldn't do it without the high doses of salmeterol.  Unfortunately, I think it's effectiveness has dropped slightly although it still seems to be the best thing around.  The diskus is easy to use - I can easily tell how many doses I have left so there's no playing guessing games as to whether I'm getting the last dregs of the cannister.  I've also gone back to taking Singular along with Advair to get the most treatment.  Still feel like I have a mild bronchitis going on quite often. My pulmonologist tells me that I have Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease which she says is just a collection of symptoms and asthma is one of them.  I've never smoked so mine is presumably due to severe allergies.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/53575

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2006-08-23 00:00:00		4.5	0.0	3.5	3.0	Guarded I tried ADVAIR at my doctor's recommendation.  I have had asthma all of my life.  I believe it started in early childhood around 4-5 years of age.I have used various inhalers all of my life and they have given me the freedom to do everything I wanted to do.  I have played sports, road off road motorcycles, sailed, waterskied and even scuba dived (not a good idea).My asthma has been consistent over my lifetime in that if I kept it under control, I was OK.  If it gets out of control, I can get into serious trouble quickly.  As an example, once I was staking a wood pile that had mold in it.  Suddenly, my inhaler would not work and I was taken to the emergency room where my breathing was so restricted I passed out.  I was given adrenoline and it probably saved my life.I take my inhaler usually once during the night while trying to sleep.  I noticed with ADVAIR, I could easily sleep through the night without the use of an inhaler.  I also noticed that my use of the inhaler during the day was much less frequent.I stopped using ADVAIR only because of the potential side effects I read about on Google.  It can cause death, especially in Blacks.  I did notice while using it, I was great.  But when I stopped using it, my inhaler did not seem to work as well.  That dependency scared me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/48159
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2006-08-16 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	A New Lease On Life I more than just impressed with the Advair Diskus, but I credit this medication, along with Singulair, for giving me a new lease on life.I used to be in and out of the hospital, had regular ER visits, and my flare ups were very frequent. I still struggle with my asthma, and still have several times each month that I end up taking nebulizer breathing treatments at home, but I have not had a single ER visit or hospitalization for asthma since I began taking the Advair two years ago.I also found that I was able to be compliant with my medication because it was only to be taken once in the morning and once at night...before this I was on several different meds that had two puffs or 4 puffs at different times during the day and I regularly missed most of them. The counter on the Advair is also wonderful (I wish they would add them to regular albuteral inhalers, as it would help me not to try to use empty ones and the &quot;float method&quot; is inconvenient when not at home). The Advair Diskus not only shows the numbers for how many inhalations are remaining, but when there are only 5 left, the numbers switch from black to red...which is very helpful to cue those of us who are forgetful to refill our medication.I have not noticed much in the way of side effects, accept sometimes a powdery residue left in my mouth which can cause mouth sores...but that is only when I neglect to follow the instructions which specifically say to rinse out your mouth with water after taking each dose.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/25310

I have not had an asthma attack since I began using the Advair discus. I use an Albuterol inhaler maybe once or twice a month; previous to the Advair I was using two Albuterol inhalers a month, sometimes three. Advair has been incredibly effective in controlling my asthma.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41940

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2006-04-13 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	4.0	4.0	Good results but very risky? I just started using ADVAIR.  I take it twice a day (morning &amp; night) with (1) inhalation.  I have had asmthma since childhood and currently was only using Albuterol to keep it in check.  I immediately noticed that I could sleep all night without using my Albuterol inhaler.  I use to use my inhaler at least once during the night.Then I stopped taking the ADVAIR for one day to see if it made a difference.  Immediately upon stopping, I noticed that my Asthma seemed to get worse than before I started using ADVAIR.  This scared me.  I then searched Google for more information on ADVAIR and discovered several people have died from using it.  Especially Blacks seem to have complications and a higher rate of mortality.  But White people have also suffered death.  Until this product has more history and testing, I think I will just stick with the Albuterol for now.  It's safer!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/40989

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2006-03-12 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Advair is a great combo for me After 20 years of MDI use, I was skeptical about the so-called &quot;dry inhalers&quot; and definitely did not like it at first, but now I think it's a much more effective way to get most of the medicine deep into the lungs.I like that the doses are counted out clearly (unlike your standard MDI, where you're supposed to keep track of all 200 doses yourself -- AS IF! -- has anyone ever done so?!) I like that the case forms a self-cover for the unit. I like that the medication combination is a good one for me, though I wish it had more salmeterol in it (Serevent).Complaints: there's no way to clean the mouthpiece easily and the different dosages do not have either different colors of labels or different color cases. It's impossible to tell a 100/50 from a 250/50 at a glance, and that's a problem in our house, because my four year old daughter uses this medication too. Here's has bright stickers all over it, while mine remains more dignified without the stickers, but it sure would be nice if they were red, yellow, and green, or even white/lavender/purple for the 50s and maybe cyan/blue/navy for the 25s -- anything to make it easy to tell them apart.This is one of the few medications I've been on for multiple years that I feel has continued to work as well after a long time as it did after I built up to a therapeutic level in my bloodstream.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10603

I was going through a rough period of trying to get rid of ongoing coughing and wheezing. The Advair helped me to get through this period. I did get a couple infections on my tongue from using it, though. Once I became stablized, I went back to just using daily Singulair and am very happy with that. I thought the Advair did a good job, and would use it if my asthma put me in very risky condition again. It was easy to use, but I did not like the chalky residue that would end up in my mouth upon use. I am most happy when I can just stick to Singulair for daily maintenance.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35197

After finally having insurance after being unemployed, I went to the doctor to try and find ways to fix my asthma.  He recommended Advair, even though I personally am very suseptible to steroid side effects.  Within a month of taking Advair, I ended up in the ER for 2 days.  Nothing else had changed in my life EXCEPT the addition of Advair.  After the fact, I found that in some cases Advair can cause asthma to get worse, and there is an argument about a 'black box' warning on the drug.  If it works for you great; but if you're sensitive to steroids of any form you might want to think twice about this medicine.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35162

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-12-15 00:00:00		3.5	5.0	4.5	3.5	Seretide This was prescribed to me after I was hospitalized. Normally I use Asthalin inhaler. I was at first amazed at the packaging which is vastly different from Asthalin and it took some time for me to get accustomed to it. But then the breathing patterns etc were the same as it was in Asthalin. The powdery taste at first made me cough but later it was alright. This medication does not give me tremors as Asthalin does. I think in the long run, this would be much better as it controls the symptoms better in the long run. though when it comes to subsiding an attack instantly, it falls back, for which reason i still feel comfortable with my Asthalin inhaler. Overall, this is quite a good product and I would like to use this on a long term basis except for the fact that it is very expensive.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/34285

I started off as a 10 year old using something called Vaponefrin(?) in a glass nebulizer and moved on to Proventil, Ventolin, AzmaCort, Intal, prednisone when in dire need, Serevent and finally in the early '90's when I made my first and only trip to the emergency room I moved onto Advair.  Today, on Medicare, I can not afford to pay US prices for Advair so I purchase it overseas for $50 less than local sources.

I have had asthma for thirty plus years and had been literally tethered to albuterol (which I had to use 3 - 4 times a day). So dependent was I that I would panic if I found myself out of the house without it. All it did really was to mask the inflammation, but given my condition, I was grateful for even this. Then came Advair! After taking it for several weeks without any effect (my doctor told me to expect this) my whole life turned around. Not only have I not had ANY asthma symptoms since (it has been  two + years now), I am able to get through a workout at LA Fitness and be around animals with no trouble. Even more extraordinary, I was able to cut my dosage from the recommended 2 inhalations twice a day to one inhalation every one-and-a- half days.

My vision then seemed distorted and I felt tired in the afternoons.  I was seeing floaters pass before my eyes.  At this point, I was into my second week.  My doctor reduced the dosage to 100/50.  The headaches increased to the point where I felt it was quite similar to a migraine. The eye pain was just horrible.  I felt like I had the flu.  I had body aches that were the worst I had ever felt.

Since I've used Advair (about 3 years), I have not had to take any prednisone at all... prednisone was always &quot;the lesser of evils&quot;, but a very bad evil nevertheless.  I only occasionally need albuterol during peak pollen seasons.  My asthma is mostly under control now, thanks to Advair.  I was never able to use any of the other steroid inhalers.  They caused thrush so bad that I couldn't eat.  I do experience that to a small degree with Advair, but it's tolerable.  The combo of the 2 drugs in the diskus work wonders.  I am fortunate, because in that I have no health insurance and could never afford the high cost of Advair, my physician keeps me supplied with samples.  I am grateful for the newer meds that make it possible for me to lead an active and relatively asthma free life!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/24199

Needless to say, that is a LOT of inhaling to do.  Especially if you need to do it properly (i.e., spacing out each inhalation with 1-2 minutes wait time..that's about 6-12 minutes just to take an inhaler!).  I was put on Advair, the 500/50 Diskus, and I've done much, MUCH better.  I can't say more to rave about this medication.  My only beef with it is the price.  Luckily, I have insurance, so I just pay $20.  But I feel for someone who has none.

I don't have chest pain or the tightening I had before I was diagnosed. But before Advair I had symptoms every 2 days or so and now its more like every day but less severe. Its like a constant lowered breathing ability. Not severe enough for anyone else to notice but quite annoying. Its only been a week so I'm hoping it will kick in soon-the humidity this summer isn't helping much. Does it get better with time? May try the Albuterol thing that my allergist prescribed as well.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23521

This year, I found myself using my albuterol inhaler 2 to 3 times a day for almost 3 months...not good.  My doctor had me try Advair and after the first inhalation, I never had to use my albuterol again.  I have reduced the amount of Advair inhalations to once a day and have had no more asthma problems.  I have 2 cats and 1 dog and am allergic to both kinds of animal.  No problems with Advair.  I was very lucky with the side effects.  I experienced nothing unusual and never got a sore mouth. I'm not crazy about inhaling steroids but it beats not breathing!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22654

My asthma was mild, and usually expressed as coughing at night that kept me up.  No problems with that now.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22603
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-05-07 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	Advair Diskus cuts down on wheezing at night. My actual dose is 1 inhalation once a day. I have been using Advair for about 2 years for asthma (wheezing). At first I inhaled twice a day, but that caused me lots of congestion, even though it eliminated the wheezing at night. Before I started using it the wheezing would keep me from sleeping at night or cause me to wake up early and not be able to go back to sleep. Because of the congestion it causes I now only inhale once a day at bedtime and it works most excellently this way! I have very little or no wheezing at all and am able to sleep without any problems. I also have less congestion since I cut my use to only 1 inhalation daily.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/22504

I do brush and gargle after using it but I get recurrent Thrush. It took the ENT doctor a while to find out that you have to take Diflucan for 7 days instead of the usual dosage of 1 day to get rid of the Thrush.  I've tried going with out Advair but end up with worse asthma, so it is a trade off, breath or not be able to eat spice food and have the roof of your mouth feel like shag carpeting.:&gt;  I also had to fight my insurance company tooth and nail to get the medicine I needed for 7 days.

I started having some problems, and my dr. became upset when she found out I did not use the Advair because of the difficulty getting to the bathroom to rinse my mouth. (I am disabled). So she convinced me that I should use it when using the bathroom, then rinsing, it surely began to help me much more.

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-03-15 00:00:00		1.5	5.0	5.0	3.0	Effectiveness of Advair 250/50 1dose 2x/day I suffer from mild asthma. My symptoms are more allergic in nature, I think. I will sneeze and I believe the release of histamines precipitates a mild upper and lower respiratory response in the form of mild bronchospasm and the production of a small amount of mucus from my sinuses and lungs. I suffered from some type of respiratory illness in the Fall of 2004. I did not have a fever but for 3 months I had a severe, whooping cough, I coughed up green sputum, and I wheezed and rattled. It was terrible. I have used Zyrtec for seasonal problems and it provided no relief. Could be it works better prophylactically rather than after the onset of symptoms. I tried Advair and Combivent. They provided relief for a short period of time. I am a Respiratory Therapist and I began taking nebulized Albuterol, Atrovent, and Mucomyst at least once a day sometimes twice a day. I would take a UD Albuterol, a UD Atrovent, and 1 cc 10% Mucomyst. I used strict technique when taking the treatment. I take a slow deep breath until my lungs are at full capacity and then I hold that breath for at least a count of 5. The effect and improvement was dramatic. I will not waste my time on inhalers again in the event I have this problem in the future.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19876
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-03-07 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	Advair I also suffer from Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia.  What I have found with those two illnesses is that whatever pre-existing issues you had (i.e allergies/asthma/pms etc) gets exponentially worse in correlation with the severity of your CFS/FM symptoms.I have always had asthma but since the CFS/FM diagnosis my asthma became so bad that I was using my inhaler sometime as much as 8 times a day even with accolate or singulair. Since I started taking the advair I still need my inhaler at night (probably an allergic reaction to something in my bedroom) but now almost never during the day.  I am getting my advair through the glaxosmithklein patient assistance program so I can't speak to cost, but if you can get it, I would definitely encourage you to give it a try.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19711
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-02-28 00:00:00		3.0	4.0	4.0	3.5	Getting better I had complete testing done (blood work and allergy testing) as I was getting bronchial infections, a sore throat and stuffiness on a regular basis. My allergist had me try various meds, including Advair and Allegra D, but I was still getting sick. So my allergist added Gaviscon (over the counter) and prevacid, along with allergy shots. My symptoms have been improving, and I try to limit my intake on foods and beverages containing mold and/or fungi. I will continue to experiment and cut back drugs where possible as my symptoms continue to improve ( I hope).	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18238
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-02-26 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	4.0	4.0	Advair works well for me A friend recommended Advair to me saying it has allowed him to leave the house without his albuterol inhaler for the first time in years. I've been using it for about a year now and pretty much agree. It hasn't &quot;cured&quot; my asthma. I still have some tightness and still feel the need to use albuterol for aerobic exercise, but that's about the only time I need the albuterol when I typicallyt used to use it 3x per day. Only downside I've found are that it sometimes makes you a bit hoarse and of course it isn't cheap.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19251

It is so much easier to remember this and not loose it seeing as it is a bright purple. I have chronic asthma and as long as I take it like I'm supposed to I'm fine unless exposed to an allergen. It has reduced the amount of times I need to take my rescue inhaler. It isn't cheap if you don't have insurance.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/19154

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-02-23 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Advair Had tried Dr's sample of Advair 250/25, but thought it gave me a sore throat, so discontinued use.  Then, as my asthma got worse this winter, he encouraged me to give it another try.  I am very happy that I did!  It has helped.  And, the sore throat that I was experiencing was more due to allergies (am going to an allergist today, in fact) than that particular medicine.  It is helping.  He bumped me up to the 500/50 and I feel it is even doing better.  Have had bronchitis three times this winter already and am willing to bet that I will not encounter it again due to the help this medicine is providing my lungs. Have read the earlier cautions about the medicine and am concerned somewhat.  As with any medicine we all know there is always a negative.  So, perhaps, during summer when I never have gotten bronchitis, I will discontinue this medicine and pick it back up in the fall.Overall, a super medicine!  Good luck.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12830
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2005-02-01 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	5.0	3.5	Effective, but beware of side effects I was placed on this medication after having several sudden episodes of breathing difficulty and wheezing that wouldn't go away. The doctor later determined that the cause was acid reflux, and after six months simply taking Zantec occassionally, I was able to stop this medication.But while on Advair, it worked great, but I noticed that, while normally prone to colds and sinus infections, I got many more colds than before. But the worst part of it occurred on Christmas Day, when I became violently ill with a stomach virus that caused me to throw up at least 50 times over the next day until I could barely move and was ready to go to the ER. I've never had any illnesses that were even close to the severity of that virus, and others in my family were minimally affected. After stopping the Advair in March, I haven't been sick since.While many people aren't as fortunate as me to be able to get off the Advair, be careful of the weakening of your immune system due to this medication!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/18446
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-11-28 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Advair is great for asthma! I developed asthma about 5 years ago.  It was pretty much out of control (sick all of the time, er visits,placed on prednisone numerous times, etc.) until I found an amazing pulmomologist that started me on Advair and singulair about two years ago.  My asthma is much more in control than it had been previously.  I'm able to function pretty normally.  I rarely have attacks and it seems to increase my symptom free days.  I didn't experience any side effects when starting this medication.  My only complaint is that this medication is a little pricey, luckily I have insurance.

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-11-24 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	5.0	0.5	Advair Diskus A total wash! I've had asthma since I was age 3.  I started medications around age 27.  I've been on several different remedies since.  Several years ago, my physician started me on Advair, Combivent, and Singulair.  One more thing I should mention.  I smoke heavily, almost 2 packs daily.  I've tried quitting more times than can be imagined.  Oh, also, recently I started DuoNeb.  I'm guessing that only the strongest medications work with me because of cigarettes.To that end, only Combivent and Singulair work efficiently.  DuoNeb works only briefly.  Advair never worked as advertised.  If I didn't smoke, maybe it would.  A woman who got down from one of the twin towers successfully told the manufacturer that without Advair she doubts she could have survived the experience.Now, there is some question about the safety of Serevent, one of the two active ingredients in Advair.  Do you know the concern?I am age 65 and retired, live alone in a small town in Indiana.  I worked during my career inside for the Commonwealth of Kentucky in welfare.  We instituted restricted smoking during the  last few years of my career	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/17171

I went to a asthma specialist and have been taking Advair 500/50, singular, allegra D daily with rescue inhaler and neublizer as needed.  My asthma symtoms are well controlled with only two other flareups since my first in one year.  Seems to work well for me. You do have to rinse your mouth after using and the price even after insurance is expensive in my view but breathing without struggling is worth it for me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16985

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-09-02 00:00:00		3.5	2.5	4.0	3.0	Advair Best So Far I was diagnosed with asthma when I was a small child.  It wasn't until about 18 years ago when a graduate student that I actually had a prescribed inhaler.  Until then it really just interferred w/my life and doctors didn't pay much attention to it.  I got the Advair about two years ago because my doctor thought I was getting thrush from (among other things) chronic use of Albuterol, the salmeterol (the green inhaler for long term relief) and the inhaled steroid.  Advair is far better as it has all the meds except Albuterol in one med so is less $.  Also, only one inhaler to use and the round discus is more convenient.  But, even so, I still have to use more than the recommended dose at times and when I get bronchitis 2 or 3 or 4 times a year it just does not help.  One allergist told me that what I really have is restrictive lung disease - I can get the air out but have trouble getting enough in.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/15166
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-07-30 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Great medicine Advair is great on many levels.  First, you can go up on the dosage if you're having a flare.  Only the dosage of the inhaled corticosteroid increases.  Second, by increasing the dosage, sometimes you can avoid having to take oral prednisone, definitely a good thing.  Be sure to drink something afterwards, or gargle, to avoid the possibility of thrush.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/14386

Since I have had asthma for 40 years, I have used many types of medications including giving myself shots when I lived too far from a hospital.  I have been through two big clinics in California and in Denver, CO.  I have done all the breathing treatments and taken many many test along with taking the allergy scratch tests 9 times, have used a variety of medications through the years along with several hospital stays to get the asthma under control.  I've been too shaky to sign my name, wanted to crawl out of my skin, not been able to sleep and ran my life at 100 miles an hour juggling 6 projects at a time because I was unable to slow down.  I was on 4 pill medications a day and 2 types of inhalers.  Over two years ago I started on Advair 500 twice a day for 6 months and then went down to Advair 250 twice a day.  After a year of feeling great and not taking any pills, I cut the Advair back to only one inhalation in the mornings. I have continued to feel great and have not had a bad asthma attack.  I do use a Albuterol inhaler for emergencies when I accidentally get into air pollution such as smoke or flower or perfume smells or inadvertently ingest red or yellow dye or artificial sweeteners or shell fish.I have a good vitamin routine and I remain a good detective as to what I smell and eat and I never forget to take the Advair inhalation.  Life is a joy now!- the only thing lacking is to get back to my exercise routine!ADVAIR RATES A NUMBER 10 WITH ME	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/13925

During the brief time I was on this med I did notice a slight improvement in my asthma, but this was when I was living in Central California. Once I moved out here to Portsmouth, I noticed it wasn't helping as much as it used to. That didn't mean that I was ready to discontinue using it though. Apparently the 13 year old who is also living in this house thought maybe I was considering it, because I come home one day to find the diskus lying right where I had left it except that there were now 0 dosages left when I know for a fact that there were 4 dosages left the day before and there was powder all over the mouthpiece.

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-05-21 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	Nasty stuff I'm no longer taking Advair, but I wanted to comment on it anyway. It's one of the worst medications I've ever taken. Right off the bat, my insurance company refused to pay for it. My doctor was willing to provide me with samples indefinitely, but the point was moot because the stuff never helped. The weaker dosage did nothing, and the stronger one worsened my breathing difficulty. All that plus the hassle of using the discus, drove me to try Singulair instead. All I can say is, good luck with it.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12726

I definitely find when I don't take it regularly twice a day as prescribed, my symptoms get much worse. Also, with this combination, I rarely get bronchitis, which I used to get 1-2 times per year otherwise.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12393
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-04-29 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	I love my Advair! This was such a surprise when I got it! After using spaces and having to count inhalations and all the work, with the Advair diskus --I had my Serevent/ inhaled corticosteroid all in one in a compact diskus, and it even had a counter on it to show me how many puffs I'd taken.  The one draw back, especially on the higher doses is THRUSH!  Even when I rinsed my mouth out well, I still ended up with thrush the three times I had to use the higher end doses.  So now my doctor has me on a Nystation mouth wash, just in case, to prevent that happening again.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/12317

Increased up to 500mcg 2 puffs 2x/day and my asthma did improve a tiny bit. What I developed was a horrendous case of oral thrush !!! I rinsed vigourosly a couple of times after using it and still developed this. I have never had this before in my life and it took a little while to figure out that I had this. My doctor took me off Advair immediately and my pulmonologist put me on Flovent 220mcg 2puffs 2x/day and I am miracuosly better than I have ever been. Have had to take meds to combat the thrush... horrible side effect !!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11892

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-03-28 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	4.0	4.0	BEWARE of side effects. My side effect snuck up on me.  I went to a new doctor and all of my medicines were changed at once.  So when I though I was having sinus pressure, due to the new medicines helping asthma, but not allergies, I ignored it. I thought could live with sinus pressure as long as I can breath.  It got slowly worse until my eyes hurt all of the time.  I went to two different eye doctors thinking it was an eye problem, but they couldn't find anything.  The pressure on my eyes was intermittent so the eye doctors didn't measure it as high when I was in their offices.  When I leaned over or did anything to cause extra eye pressure I got flashes of light.  I also got floater in both eyes. I even learned to half way sit up as I turned over at night, because I feared seeing and causing the light flashes. I did my own research and found a rare side effect from Advair of swelling of the tissue around the eyes.  I was afraid to stop taking it without another medication due to my asthma.  So I convinced my doctor that I was having this side affect and she changed me to an older inhaler with different ingredients.  Within 12 hours of stopping Advair my eye pressure faded dramatically.  Over the next year the remaining pressure and light flashes also slowly went away.  The floater however will remain since they don't fade for many years.  I also developed an occasional irregular heart beat while taking this, but I cannot be sure it was due to this drug although I suspect it. Conclusion, this drug helps asthma greatly if you are lucky enough to not suffer its side affects.  You need to be very aware because the side affects can be stealthy.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/11426
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2004-02-27 00:00:00		3.5	1.5	5.0	3.0	Side effects with the Salmeterol component My experience with Advair was, well... &quot;meh&quot;. It didn't provide effective asthma control, through no fault of its own-- my doctor didn't prescribe a high enough dose. And the salmeterol component interfered with my sleep enough so that my doctor even further reduced the dosage. I got to know the respiratory therapists over at the local ER *real well* after that prescription change. Finally my doctor ended the Advair experiment and switched me to the Flovent inhaler (which is, essentially, &quot;Advair&quot; in traditional inhaler form and without the Salmeterol). Flovent is working very well for me.One thing though, in praise of Advair: I find that the Discus is very much easier for me to operate than a conventional inhaler when my hands and arms are stiff with arthritis. Anyone with joint impairment might want to give the Discus delivery method a try.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10916

Couldn't play with other kids for long, always in and out of the hospital. Lots of allergy triggers, stress triggers, cold air, wind. Went through the gamut of Rx available at the time; at least all the ones the drs. prescribed!  Finally had a doctor who sat down and discussed preventative meds (Flovent, Beclovent, etc.) which caused a marked improvement in my symptoms and decrease in number of severe attacks.  I was able to play softball on a recreational team, go out and run with my children.  WOW!  Progressed to where I was taking the two meds in Advair separately, and I asked the dr. if he would prescribe the Advair instead (2-$30 copays vs. 1...hmm, makes sense!!).  He was all for it.  It has been great for me; I rarely have to take my rescue inhaler (Albuterol) and usually only because I have forgotten to take my Advair.  I combine with OTC Benadryl to keep the allergies down.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/10531

I couldn't inhale it right and no matter what I did I kept getting the powder all over my teeth and mouth.  It's very cumbersome to use.  It didn't work for me because I could barely get any into my lungs.  I have never had this problem with other inhalers.  I think I just can't do the disk inhalers.

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2003-12-07 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Advair Diskus I have been using Advair 100 for several years in conjunction with the Flovent inhaler.  Recently I switched to Advair 500 and have discontinued the Flovent.  This is why I say I have only been using this for a few weeks.The Advair is very easy to use, especially compared with the Flovent.  I had been using a spacer with the Flovent which meant one more thing to carry with me when I travel.I find that Advair is very effective with my asthma and has minimal side effects.  I had been having problems with hoarseness with the Flovent, but with the Advair this seems to not be a problem.  The Advair does have the problem of leaving a bad taste in my mouth, even though I rinse after each use.From a cost-effectiveness standpoint, it saves me money because I only have one copay instead of two.  If you were paying for this out of pocket, I believe the cost works out to be about the same either way.  I rated this an 8 because if you don't have a copay, this is a very expensive drug.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9556

Well here we are and Finally, something comes out that provides us with a safe alternative to nebs, to oral steroids, to rescue inhalers.

At the dose I need it is almost $200 a month after taxes. However, I love how convenient it is to use. I used to take 10 puffs a day of Flovent and 2 of Serevent so this one puff twice a day regieme is so much easier to comply with.

Advair is very effective in controlling my asthma attacks, in fact I never get attacks anymore. I only use my rescue inhaler (Ventolin) before exercise to stave off any attacks that I may have. Make sure you combine Advair with lots of aerobics and interval aerobics to increase you endurance and control any shortness of breath. The only side effects I get with Advair are back of the throat phelgm but all I have to do is clear my throat and all is well. Before all of this I used to wake from sleep with asthma attacks and could not run without stopping midway to hit the Ventolin. In fact I was like a crack addict going to the bathroom or other parts of the building or hitting the inhaler before I went out to prevent from getting any attacks, now I am down to 2 puffs/day before exercise or none if I don't work out that day. Ask your doctor to let you try this medicine out!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/6802

I still take Singulair and still use my albuterol, but I don't use the albuterol near as often as I did before Advair.HOWEVER!  Be super-careful to rinse 'n spit after using Advair Diskus--I've had three oral thrush infections in the six weeks I've used it.

My most recent dosages were:  220 mcg Flovent (the strongest) 4 puffs twice daily, Serevent 2 puffs twice daily.  This worked great initially (at much lower Flovent dosage).  Over time, I kept increasing the amount of Flovent, but this did not control my asthma.  Eventually, I found out about the azithromycin (antibiotic) regimen at http://www.asthmastory.com and my asthma is now totally gone.  (My rating of that treatment can be found under &quot;antibiotic therapy&quot;.)

I ended up getting a long term sinus infection that I could not shake until I quit using the diskus.  Perhaps it was due to the strength of the steroid component, since generally those suppress your immune system anyway.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1926

I was constantly using my Albuteral inhaler. I was always uncomfortable, making others around me uncomfortable as well. Since my doctor started me on the Diskus, each day is something to look forward to. I only take one dose at night and one in the morning. I go all day long without feeling like I have bricks on my chest. I have not once used my Albuteral inhaler since starting the Advair. I know when I am around my animals, I will feel &quot;normal&quot; which is so much more enjoyable for all. I have not experienced any negative side effects. Per my doctor's advice, I use the Advair in the morning and night right before brushing my teeth. This ensures complete rinsing which eliminates the chance for mouth sores. For anyone who has difficulty enjoying day to day activities, I highly encourage this medication.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1907

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2002-06-27 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.0	Advair can do wonders for Asthma... I started using Advair about 1 year and 3 months ago. As soon as it came out, my allergist/immunologist, switched me from Flovent 220mcg, to Advair 500. I find it works best when you break the new &quot;blister&quot; each puff, to inhale as deep into the lungs, and for as long as you can hold your breath. It does, however, cause thrush and other mouth problems, from the overload, if you do not rinse and spit, or gargle EVERY time you use it. It has helped my asthma extremely. I am a severe asthmatic, taking Singulair, Albuterol, Flonase, Zyrtec-D, and have a pari neb breathing machine (to use whenever needed). I also get 3 allergy shots each week. I have found that the Advair is very beneficial, considering the severity of my asthma, and how well it has worked. If you put a price on breathing, then you should not choose Advair..In TN, my Advair 500, is about $216.00 a diskus (month). If you can make such a difference in your life by enabling yourself to breathe better, full breaths, than cost should not be compared to the results. My insurance does cover it though. I have twice had to pay cash, though, when my deductible had to be met...it only took the advair being filled to meet it....But, overall, I am 34yr. old female, and it works GREAT!! Made a great change in my everyday life. It really has....Sincerely,...	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/1068

advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2002-06-04 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Clever design and effective! I have used the Advair Diskus for 4 months now and have noticed that I use my rescue inhaler and aerosol machine less than previously. However, I haven't noticed the  dramatic improvment I had when I used Flovent, despite the fact that this is a combination of Flovent and Serevent according to my Pulmonary Specialist. The small window that counts remaining dosages is ingenious and leaves no guessing as to how many metered doses remain, unlike with rescue inhalers. I also love the compact disk shape as it easier to hold and carry in a purse or pocket. I DON'T like that there is a gritty residue in your mouth after each use and I recommend that you immediately rinse out your mouth or drink something. Allow at least 2 weeks to experience any benefit. Cost is around $64 and isn't available yet in generic form.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/902
advair-diskus	Asthma -- Maintenance	2002-05-21 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	5.0	4.5	Some odd side effects First it is very useful to know than in Europe Advair is called seretide and exists also in spray form under different dosages (125,250,500).I take it one puff 2 times a day and when my asthma gets worse I can increase it to 2 puffs 2 times a week.It really works fine, I almost don't take ventolin anymore. But all singers must know that it affects the voice as well so don't be surprised if you have some mouth dryness and a voice that goes - it's what supposed to happen apparently. You can prevent serious problems by rincing your mouth after puffs. (UPDATE: After a few months using Seretide, I found out it dries my skin, it's common thing but still real nice to know if you are using it. Ask your pharmacist for a moisturizing lotion.I also read an article on Fluticasone, that thing induces laryngitis after a prolonged use, and stops once you stop using that med.If your voice  is hoarse again it seem like a normal effect.)	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/830

The reason is because I am allergic to pretty much all the narcotic medications available. It works great, but now I am having stomach problems because of it. It started out as acid reflux, which I was put on medication for a couple of years ago, then, more recently, they had to change that medication to a more potent one and a higher dose. Now I have to go have an upper and lower GI done to determine why I am having such pains in my stomach. So, if you take a lot of Ibuprofen, BE CAREFUL! It can cause many problems in the long run!I wish there was something else I could take!	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/54301

Nothing spectacular, but seems to help at least somewhat. I've been using it a bit more now that I've been hearing that acetaminophen can be rough on the liver, albeit in large doses.

It's a nuisance, isn't it?****** USE LORATADINE INSTEAD ******* daily, as soon as you wake up, then rest some more before becoming active for the day.  My day currently starts at 1pm.  Quite good eh? ;-).  And this is reliably just about every day now :-).  DO NOT RELAPSE - this is very serious and not good.It takes me a week or more on stomach meds for me to recover from taking 'one' Ibuprofen tablet!!! Shame though.  I really do think that the pharmaceutical industry should be doing more to reduce pain for those of who can't the current anti-inflammatories that are available.... come on drug companies......... hurry up will ya?Try to get hold of a 'short course' of steroids if all your symptoms are through the roof.  This will settle them all down again and then use the Loratadine.  This is latter stages of recovery info.If you are very sick and/or in the initial stages/relapse, use knock out on 10mg-25mg of Amitriptline nightly.ALL STAGES OF M.E.Do use holistic therapies (from a qualified and gifted practitioner if you can locate one), such as massage and 'reiki', use aromatherapy (lavender oils for relaxation - pain relief and bergamot for energy as required), natural products, good natural nutrition and exercise to stimulate blood flow to the brain to aid recovery and of course to promote seratonin output. Homeopathy may help (from registered practitioner). All toxins should be avoided. Avoid processed foods even. Meditation and yoga - when the patient is able (some years later!), may further assist recovery. Total peace and much resting is essential in the initial stages. Keeping the brain active as soon as possible, gently (i.e. some study but nothing major of course, of a subject naturally and thus 'easilly' interesting to the patient), to stimulate (brain) recovery and keep morale up, is also essential.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/44969

I have to say, when I have a flare up and I get the Rheumatoid Arthritis, I need Advil every 4 hours to keep my sanity. It is the only thing that gives me temporary relief from this horrific pain (besides yukky Prednisone). Per the Doctors, it is not good for the stomach so I may be doing myself an injustice as far as the stomach goes. I believe it can cause ulcers if not taken with food.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/50606

advil	Lyme Disease	2006-09-18 00:00:00		2.0	3.0	4.0	2.5	Only good if pain is mild I use more ibuprofen than I would EVER recommend to anyone.  My pain doc likes to do acupunture and massage, and won't acknowledge that pain from active Lyme is beyond the ability of these modalities.  So, with what I can get of Rx pain meds, I take huge quantities of ibuprofen.  It helps a little with the aches and pains, and the joint inflammation.  It is hard on my stomach, especially since the irritation manifests as hunger.  Try to find a good pain management doc if ibuprofen is inadequate.  This means one who does medication management and understands Lyme.  If max doses of ibuprofen don't control the pain, you need a stronger baseline drug.  Remember, pain is extremely exhausting and fatigue is your enemy if you're fighting Lyme.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49611

The only reason I continued taking the medication for several months was to see if it was ever going to work and to keep leg swelling symptoms down.  As a person who never really took any medication before, including aspirin/tylenol/ibuprofen, I knew that I had no tolerance built up, so if a medication was going to work, it would.  The amount of pain that I have had was only recently diagnosed and the only thing that has helped relieve the pain is Lyrica in combination with Baclofen.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/49377

It was quite effective and cheap, but after a while my blood pressure went up and my ankles and feet swelled terribly, which is the reason I finally gave it up.  I tried many other NSAIDS and some of them did cause me to retain water, but none of them as severely.

I would take it one to 2 hours before rising in the morning just to be able to walk. As the years went by it took more. To avoid stomach problems, i always drank at least 8 oz. water or ate something when taking every dose. When i began antibiotic therapy, i used ibuprophen along with fish oil and turmeric and other anti-inflammatory supplements to reduce inflammation so the antibiotic could reach the bacteria. After 8 months on antibiotics, i completely stopped ibuprophen. My crp is normal.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/47877

I was on one of another NSAID for several years. The end result was an ulcer and bleeding into the bowel. I had to take Pepcid for 6 years and even now have to be careful of what I eat as my stomach is still sensitive. I would NEVER advise an NSAID for long term use!Update: I have since met many people who have had the bad side effects with either ulcers or bleeding in the intestines. Also problems with esophagus etc. I don'teven take Aspirin unless absolutely a must any more. I still think these are the most dangerous medications prescribed for long term use.

advil	Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; CFIDS; M.E.)	2006-07-02 00:00:00		3.5	3.5	4.5	3.5	Great migraine relief, not much else Ibuprofen helps me with the migraines that are caused by CFS and the muscle/joint pains I've got from prednisone treatment and its withdrawal, but it really doesn't do much for most of my other aches and it also doesn't affect the fever I have 24/7.I haven't really got any side effects from it, but I only take it from food and I'm careful not to take it too often. It isn't at all sedative for me at least in doses up to 800 mg (it can be sedative for some even in these amounts).Btw, did you know that ibuprofen isn't only a painkiller, it also raises blood pressure? This is a bad thing for many people and ibuprofen isn't recommended for people with hypertension, but it can actually be quite good for CFS folks who often suffer from (neurally mediated) hypotension. It's just a shame that the risk of getting ulcers is so high and that the drug begins to lose its efficacy very quickly with prolonged use.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/45464

The problem with any meds like this is that taken regularly they can cause rebound headaches and you get into such a cycle that you don't know where your migraine ends and your rebound begins.I was nearly always prescribed ibuprofen to take in combination with another med like Midrin or Fiorinal. I thought it helped a little at the very beginning of my experience with migraines, but I know the ibuprofen alone does nothing. And the combination effects have worn off for me, so that taking it at all for migraines is pointless now.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/41075

advil	Irritable bowel syndrome - Alternating (IBS-A)	2006-01-23 00:00:00		3.0	4.5	4.5	3.5	Ibuprofin For IBS? I have had symptoms of IBS for more than 20 years. The first GI I consulted suggested doubling the amount of Ibuprofin. That did nothing more than the single dose. He then told me to try to think about &quot;pretty roses&quot; when I &quot;thought&quot; I was suffering from IBS. That was the last of him I saw, and IBS became another illness I just never mentioned to a new doctor. I tried everything I could think of, and nothing helped. Every six months or so I would decide it had to be food related. I would eat plain white rice for 2-3 days and then gradually add back &quot;gentle&quot; foods, yogurt, bananas, dry toast, sooner or later something would &quot;cause&quot; an attack, so I totally eliminated that food from my diet. But it would not be long before I would find myself curled in the middle of the bed thinking if it would not scare the children I would and could scream with pain for hours.Seven years ago, another corporate move and a new doctor. He sent me to a GI because he suspected GERD. The GI put me on Protonix, it immediately stopped the GERD and seemed to ease the pain of IBS!I still have the revolving bowel, but no longer have the pain. He has been all the way through my intestinal systen with an endoscope and has found nothing to indicate a physical problem. I was ready to cry when he said he had the same problem, and could find nothing to even offer much relief.Years ago, deciding no doctor had the answer, I re-potty trained my self. I did not want to spend my life in a bathroom, but I will admit to always locating a toilet in a strange place. This is not a particullarly easy thing to do, especially with the constipation. I took myself and a good book to a bathroom every two hours and sat for 15 minutes trying.I was able to return to the work world until 2002, when the Fibromyalgia became so bad I was counting a good day one I could dress myself. For the Fibro, I take Methadose. I am not sure anything inside would hurt unless I miss a med. Some	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/37078

If the little &quot;buggers&quot; (as I like to call them) are laying on a specific part of your brain, then it is my understanding that they are causing specific flare-ups in your body -- things like Bell's Palsy, Trigeminal Neuralgia, Foot Neuropathy, etc. No amount of Advil, Aleve, Aspirin, or Tylenol is going to take away the pain or the swelling. First and foremost, make sure you are seeing the correct kind of Infectious Disease Specialist about your Lyme Disease -- someone who knows what kind of meds to dispense for the symptoms you are experiencing.

advil	Osteoarthritis of the spine (Facet joint degeneration)	2005-05-30 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	3.0	3.0	Worked, but caused stomach problems I havent taken Brufen for a few years now but, when I did, I found it to be very effective as both a pain relief drug and an anti-inflamatory. I also found it to be very useful as an efficient treatment for a fever, on those rare occasions when I caught a bad cold or flu. So, as a useful drug for the treatment of the pain and inflamation caused by osteoarthritis, I found Brufen to have a very definite plus side. I would actually rate it fairly high on a scale of one to ten, probably about an eight.Unfortunately, I happened to be one of those people who has a rather sensitive stomach and duodenal lining so, if I take the drug on a regular daily basis, I very soon develop gastrointestinal problems including oesophogeal reflux (heartburn), peptic and duodenal ulcers (in less than 2 weeks). Even on regular anti-ulcer medication the Brufen still gave me problems. After having recurrent ulcer problems, which eventually led to a gastroscopy, I was taken off Brufen. In most cases it does, however, help to alleviate the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects if the drug is taken along with food and certainly make every effort to avoid taking Brufen on an empty stomach. I also understand that it is not advisable for anyone suffering from asthma to use Ibuprofen whether in pill or external gel form.I was also, however, given to believe that Brufen, at prescription strength, is an excellent, and highly sought after, treatment for hangovers. Although I didnt really imbibe enough at that time for it to be necessary to test this fact out for myself, I was assured of this by numerous, envious friends who wanted to pocket a few from my prescribed allowance! (This was prior to Brufen becoming available over the counter.)Take care now. Love and light to all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/23255

It does have a few advantages, although it didn't work that well for me.  The side effects (especially stomach irritation) seemed to be less with ibuprofen than with many of the other NSAIDs.  And the price can't be beat -- this stuff is cheap, particularly if you buy the over the counter generic, then take the dosage of that you've been prescribe (usually 3-4 tablets).I took this quite frequently when I was between doctors, and it did take the edge off the pain, although I personally find other NSAIDs to be more effective.  Perhaps this is because the prostaglandin inhibiting effect of ibuprofen is not as strong as some of the others.  Overall, it's good in a pinch, but couldn't come close to tackling the truly bad pain.  Still, it's much better than taking nothing at all.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16649

advil	Back pain- chronic	2004-10-26 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	4.5	0.5	Advil Ibuprofen - frequent urination bladder Ok, I know my ratings are quite low, but I want to drive home a point that Ibuprofen can be a dangerous drug (thousands die each year from bleeding in the stomach).  I do not recommend taking more than the 200 mg dose - if it does not work to reduce pain, see your Dr. - don't take more.Also, I would not recommend taking any pain medication unless it is chronic and is moderate to severe.  Miss a day of work if necessary.Briefly, I took 1000 mg of ibuprofen during a 10 hour period.  That night I experienced severe frequent urination (20x after going to bed - low volume on each void).  I had to some degree a urinary retention problem so this may have contributed to adverse reaction.  I repeated the same dose the next day and stopped.  I visited two urologists and did not receive appropriate treatment (each night I was getting up 10x per night - 120 days of little rest with no end in sight during the 120 days - I even agreed to surgery on my bladder neck during this time - made the problem worse.Finally, a third urologist prescribed Ditropan and it resolved the problem that same night - but I was in bad shape from what I considered as 120 days of torture.  In any event, stayed on Ditropan for about 3 months  - no longer taking Ditropan and frequent urination problem has not returned.  Still trying to overcome the damage that this stressful period had on me.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/16441

In my teens I had been mistakenly diagnosed with sinus headaches instead of migraines.  I was in the habit of taking a Tavist and 4 Advil (Motrin, Tylenol, etc) every morning when I woke up and repeating the ibuprofen or acetominophen (whenever the ibuprofen wasn't as effective I rotated between Tylenol and Advil, etc) every 4-6 hours as needed.  I did this for years because I thought it was just something I had to live with - didn't most people have sinus headaches and go on with their daily activities??  I thought i was a wimp.  Later, a new DR. correctly diagnosed me with severe migraines and tension headaches.  He indicated to me that it was far better to take a single (or 2 in combination) prescription drug to prevent the migraines than to take this qty of ibuprofen etc on such a regular basis.  According to him, I was doing far more damage to my kidneys than necesssary and not truly getting the relief I needed.  He was very right.  I would suggest talking to your DR. and asking for better options.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/15135

I have been taking Prednisone for nearly 7 years now and I despise the drug.  Rather than telling my doctor I'm having Edema (swelling) I just pop a couple of Ibuprofen or aspirins and the problem is taken care of.  Chances are, if my feet and ankles are swollen, I've been standing or walking for a significant amount of time and the swelling is not long term.

She said to avoid NSAIDS as much as possible because of the effect they had on my stomach.  Now that I think back on the time I WAS using it, I realize now that it wasn't doing anything to relieve the physical pain, it was just giving me a psychological &quot;boost&quot; and that made me FEEL like it was helping.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/4643

advil	Rheumatoid Arthritis	2002-12-19 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	3.5	4.0	Worked for my RA for years In Australia and New Zealand Ibuprofen is available over the counter as 100mg tablets.  Standard adult dose is two 100mg tablets every 4 hours, though I found just 200mg per day was usually enough.  This dosage suppressed my RA inflamation for about 10 years.  Over the last few years I've needed up to 800mg per day which is a hassle to take every 4 hours.  I changed from Nurofen to Brufen which is a prescription-only slow-release 800mg tablet taken once or twice daily.  Both forms have given me no side effects provided they are taken with a good amount of food.  If I miss the food I get intestinal pain and diarroea for several hours afterwards - so if I forget the tablet I have to eat another small meal.  Unfortunately my arthritis has become quite severe and ibuprofen is no longer enough though it still provides some relief.  Several other NSAIDS have also helped me, such as Feldine and Naproxen (Naprosyn) - I'm unsure of the US brand names.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/3487

I can't say the same thing about prescription pain meds.  I either sleep all day or do not get any relief.Make sure to take the Advil on a full stomach or at least with food.

The only over the counter drug that has ever worked for me was ibuprofen. My doctor, a headache specialist, told me to just go ahead and take 800mg as soon as the pain started so that the pain arc of the headache would be cut off significantly. He also wrote me a prescription for the 800mg tablets, which cost $1 for 100 pills on my insurance plan. Way cheaper than advil or anything for that purpose. Hope it helps. Norco has been the best pain reliever that I've found though. Hydrocodone with something else. You can take it and still function because it doesn't knock you out, just kind of relaxed my tense muscles and head.

Each consecutive use provides instant relief but actually damages the lining of your nasal passages.I'd never recommend to anybody. FDA should take off of market. I have had excellent results for nasal congestion with 2 other sprays: Nasalcrom (non-Rx) or Rhinocort (Rx) which do not work as quickly, but are MUCH safer.

I have long used it to treat chronic bedtime nasal congestion when laying horizontally, a condition that requires me to breath through my mouth and causes me to awake frequently.  After warnings from my MD, I have gone weeks without Afrin use but find that the bedtime congestion does not ease.  When I resume Afrin use, I also find no need to increase use beyond the once per day before bedtime.  This tells me that I am not having the dreaded rebound congestion.I have tried nasal steroid spray and nasal antihistamine spray, separately, at my MD's direction.  Neither of those treatments reduce my bedtime congestion.  I only occasionally experience seasonal allergy symptoms, at which time I use an inexpensive, OTC 12-hour antihistamine.  I do take 4 mg of generic &quot;Chlor-Trimeton&quot; every night to cope with the likely underlying allergy condition.  With this approach, I rarely have nasal congestion during the daytime and my bedtime condition is sucessfully controlled.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/45394

I wish it were a maintenance drug. In the past, I would tend to use it too often, in which case it does have the rebound effect and I must always make myself &quot;de-addict&quot; from it. Once I even had to go to the doctor in order to treat myself for overuse. Now I am wise enough to save it for only those times when I need it the most--like when I have terrible congestion from a cold, or am having an extremely stuffy nose night and cannot sleep.  I limit myself to 3, 4 or 5 days at the most, and try mainly to just take it at bedtime to get a decent night's sleep.  It works beautifully and I love how it makes me breathe! Even after 3-5 nights, it's still very difficult to continue on without it, especially in the winter when my heater is going and there is lots of dry heat.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/35228

This has been going on for 3 years now.  During the day I take a claritin and 12 hour oral decongestant.  It may be bad, but I am able to sleep at night.

The truth is, I have gone for several years with clogged passages, blowing my nose around the clock, and feeling that nasty, stuffy, infamed with infection feeling. It was so bad I bagun to wonder if I didn't have a more serious disease. I naturally suffer from sinusitisitis, however with the discomfort of a congested nose daily I begun to feel uncomfortable in my surroundings 99% of the time. I know this sounds like a bizarre story, but its true. A few days ago, browsing at the dollar store, I figured anything is worth trying, and so I bought the family dollar nasal spray. And to my chagrin, this product the rid me of all the nasal problems of nasty congestion both my throat the nose that I have been suffering from for years. I can feel myself breathing better and my sense of smell is much more acute. I feel like I have been blind for so long, but now I can see; and it is the most remarkable experience ever. I have used it for about two days, starting in the evening prior to bed, with the next use approximately 12 hours apart. I just don't understand what a difference this product has made.

afrin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2004-01-05 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	4.0	Follow the Directions It always amazes me how people misuse nasal sprays. (Before I knew better, I was guilty of this myself.) They sporadically use the steroid sprays (see my review of Flonase) and wonder why they don't work as well as they claim.  Then they overuse an OTC spray that clearly states on the bottle not to use for more than 3 days. You will get rebound congestion if you use Afrin for more than 3 days in a row.  Save Afrin for really bad allergy days or when you get a cold or sinus infection.  My doctor also told me that you can use it for 3 days skip 3 days and then use it 3 more days.  But if you're still severely congested after that, you need to see your doctor! PS If you want a spray you can use everyday to relieve stuffiness get Entsol spray. It's a saliene spray developed by an ENT.  It's aerosol so it gets in deep.  You can get it at any drugstore, but you have to ask for it.  It's non prescription, but for some reason they keep it behind the counter.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/9866
afrin	Hay fever - Seasonal allergies	2002-10-25 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	Always use as directed I used this medication many years ago for  treating my hayfever.... I found that without realizing it overtime was using it more frequently. Discusion with my a friend who was a Resident MD revealed I was addicted.. yes addicted.. not somethng I thought possible with an Over the counter medication.The addiction took the form of increase sinus congestion if I did not  use the Drug and I found I was actually using it every 2-3 hours some times more....just to get my sinus open enough to breath.My first attempt to get off was to  dilute the Afrin with sterile saline.. this did not work... My nasal congestion was so severe.. I  was having headaches and mouth breathing all the time  I ended up on Oral steriods for 2-3 weeks and a steriodal nasal spray to get off Afrin and get my Sinus congestion under control.Personally I will never use Afrin or any of the over the counter nasal sprays.I recommend that any one who does use Afrin  use it only  as directed and if the problem lasts for longer that 7 days or gets worse see your doctor immediately..Do not try to self treat. Do not make the same mistake  I did .  This Medication in my opinion is not meant for long term extended use.	http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/review/comment/2514
