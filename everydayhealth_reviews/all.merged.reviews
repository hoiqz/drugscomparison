abilify	Agitated State	2012-10-15 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I see the negative comments here, but I have to say that this drug at 2mg saved my life. I was going out of my mind for months with high anxiety (and no apparent cause). I was under a psychiatrist's care but really felt no hope. I was taking 22.5 mg Remeron and that didn't do it, but then he sdded just 2mg Abilify and the drug relieved the anxiety in a day ... one day. I can't say enough good things about this drug, simply wonderful. It is now a year later and I am still taking 2mg Abilify along with 22.5mg of Remeron and feel GOOD, and those of you that can relate to that high angst know what I mean when I say GOOD (normal).
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2012-09-28 00:00:00		4.0	2.5	4.0	4.5	works like no other meds i have taken for Bipolar
abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2012-09-27 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I suffered from extreamly loud voices and wild dellusions before taking Abilify.  At 30mg once a day, I am now symptom FREE, and have been for 3+ years.  I know my case is a rare one in that it was so effective with no percievable side effects.  But I believe this drug is a step in the right dirrection for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoeffective dissorder...
abilify	Agitation	2012-08-23 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	0.5	0.5	I was given 2mg of Abilify along with 10mg of lexapro. I was instructed to take them at night before bed, the following is my expierences: the first thing I noticed was that no matter what I could not sit/lay still I was constantly kicking my legs and thrashing around. The constant movement coupled with racing thoughts would not allow me to fall asleep. I have never had racing thoughts until I took the drug!! Luckily they were not depressing or violent, but more goofy in nature. Eventually I went to get out of bed and things rapidly went downhill. Immediately I was nauseus and as I attempted to make it to the bathroom I became incredibly dizzy at that point an intense ringing began in my ears and I fainted hitting my head on a door frame. I then attempted to steady myself and go back to bed i failed 3 more times each time tunnel vision and ringing in my ears. These symptoms continued into the next day, I will not take this again.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2012-08-09 00:00:00		2.5	2.0	4.0	1.0	Helps with the upswings, but seems to leave only depression. So bad that I have spent the last week pretty much in bed, I am so uniterested in life right now its ridiculous. When I first started I fainted 2 times, so I had to cut the dose in half. I am still on half the dose for the past month and a half and am unsure if its the abilify causing this depression or something else, but I haven't felt this bad in years.
abilify	Agitated State	2012-07-23 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	5.0	2.0	This drug is HORRIBLE. I am a 19 yr old girl standing at 5'6&quot;. I was at size 5, 120 lbs. (Underweight) I took this for 4 months and got to size 13, 170 lbs. 8 months later, I have the metabolism of a 39 year old at 150 lbs, size 9. The weight gain intensified my mental instability, ruining my self image and happiness.
abilify	Schizophrenia	2012-07-03 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	0.5	Although this drug relieved the symptoms, I developed compulsive gambling as a result of taking this medication.  If you have also experienced this side effect, please  contact me me ASAP:gambilify@gmail.com
abilify	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	2012-06-24 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	I have severe obsessive compulsive disorder. I had been on Lexapro, AND I was doing well after 2 years I went off it. I was doing well for a few months, and then my OCD spiraled out of control. I started taking Lexapro again 3 weeks ago. Last week I was still doing horribly. My Psychiatrist put me on 2 MG of Abilify and it seemed to kick in for me the next day. I'm not perfect, but my OCD thoughts are much less. I'm not ruminating. I don't have rituals, just obsessive thoughts. They're practically gone in one week. This medicine seems to have done the trick for me thus far. I have just started CBT therapy too. My appetite has increased. I don't know if it's actually from the Abilify.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2012-03-28 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	I at first was eager to try this new med about 3 years ago.  I started to realize over time that I was losing interest in what I enjoyed most.  I stopped reading, listening to music as it became all noise in my head. I gained over 40 pounds and became even more depressed.  When I brought this concern up to my doctor he increased the medication which brought on worsened symtoms like paranoia and difficulty sleeping.  I started slowly weaning off and experienced restless leg syndrome and more paranoia.  They need to take this med off the market!!  Plus the co-pay is expensive,\.
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2012-02-12 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	5.0	0.5	what a nightmare!!! and from only 5mgs!!! made me weak, clumsydid not help with Panic/anxiety/agoraphobia disorders, I was on 2mg's for a month, didn't notice anything, until the jump to 5mg's. I feel poisoned now, and afraid to continue using this drug....should be named Disabilify, it crippled me literally
abilify	Post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)	2011-10-20 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	5.0	I have been on Abilify from 20 to 30 mg/daily for over 4 years and have had no inpatient hospitalizations.  I have not needed any lithium for over 4 years as well.  All I need is anxiety medication upon occasion.  Vision blurry and weight gain are main side effects.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2011-07-31 00:00:00		3.0	1.0	5.0	2.5	Caused blurry vision. I had to stop driving at night. I quit the meds and my vision cleared up. Took it with Lamictal and it worked well
abilify	Autism	2011-07-31 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	4.5	4.0	Seemed to help a lot with OCD symptoms associated with autism..also my son seemed to no longer be in a fog like he has been for many years, much clearer thinking
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2011-05-16 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I finally got a diagnosis after years of being considered depressed.  Tried 60 to 80 mg of Prozac, which made my legs restless.  (AWFUL feeling!).  So we backed down to 40 mgs of prozac and added 10 mg of Abilify.  WoW! What a difference!  I had lost interest in everything until I started on it.  I'd like to increase to 15mg, to see if it would help with my being tired in the a.m...Still would like to be a bit more active and interested in doing things that I should be doing.  Still have a dislike of people in general, though.  I don't work and I am afraid to go &quot;out there&quot; again...
abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2011-05-16 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	5.0	4.0	I was on Abilify for about 5 to 6 months. I did saved my life. My manic depression was under control for the first time. I have Abilify +200mg Zoloft. I barely remember what happened before Abilify. That was how effective it was. The only side effect I have was weight gain. Huge. I gained 20 lbs the first 10 weeks. I did not bother me much as I was slightly underweight at the start (bmi 18). After 6 months, I was totally overweight (bmi 25), gained in total close to 40 lbs. Needles to say, I asked my doctor to stop this treatment.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2011-01-31 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	Abilify took away my mania symptoms and left me feeling safe from those high mood swings. I would recommend it to anyone who has bipolar disorder.
abilify	Depression	2010-12-27 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	5.0	It was with deepest regret that I had to stop taking Abilify. Along with my main depression medication I took 5 mg a day and it put me over that hump to where I finally felt like myself again after two years of struggling to find the right mix of drugs. I had always been a fairly cheerful person and this allowed me to truly enjoy my life again and not just try to enjoy it. However, after several months, 3 or 4, I began to move my jaw from side to side throughout the day. At first I didn't think too much of it, but then it became more exaggerated and more constant. It never occurred to me that this was a drug side effect, but it was embarrassing and annoying. My close friend finally asked me about it and then said I should tell my doctor. He immediately stopped my Abilify and although it took about 6-8 weeks to stop it did finally go away. I was fortunate as with this drug it could have been permanent. This was the ONLY side effect I had. It broke my heart to stop taking this drug.
abilify	Depression	2010-12-27 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	2.5	0.5	OMG! I used this medication in addition to Lexapro, because besides Depression, I have PTSD. And I must say that I repent 100 times that it was added. I slowly but surely started to have vivid nightmares and crying bouts constantly. I felt hopeless and worthless. I started getting ideas of killing people around me(which I NEVER, EVER had or even thought of doing EVER! I felt I never could go out without anyone going with me. Even driving made me quiver!I finally called my mom one day and she told me to go to the E.R. and there Mental Health Crisis Center helped me wean off this terrible drug. See, Lexapro, wasn't helping me, so my Dr. thought it was safe to add Abilify. But, Thank God today I am on another medication and I have no thoughts of Suicide or Killing anybody and I would not recommend this to ANYONE! Please be aware if you are looking into this, so, that this doesn't happen to you too.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2010-10-23 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	5.0	Before taking Abilify I spent years looking for the right medication. In this time I was often deeply depressed &amp; went back &amp; forth between not caring whether I lived or died, and being VERY suicidal. I often felt &quot;crazy&quot;, and had periods of depersonalization or derealization, during which I had no energy or motivation and isolated myself. Other times I had lots of energy &amp; would have fits of rage or sadness, involving screaming, crying, &amp; violence towards both myself &amp; others. Other times yet, I was very happy, extremely confident, and very promiscuous.Irritability was a constant, as was impulsiveness (which led to much regret).Since taking Abilify (7.5mg daily), I have still felt a wide range of emotions, but none of them have been extreme, or uncalled for, and negative feelings haven't lasted long. It's what I imagine being &quot;normal&quot; feels like.I behave like an average, respectable person &amp; make good decisions.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2010-07-18 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	I have been on this drug for 5 years. I have taken between 10-15 mg a day. I first started taking Abilify while in a manic episode. I have never had severe depression or mania while taking Abilify. The only side effect I have encountered is a slight twitch in my foot. The benefits out weight the side effect for me. I have never taken any other bi-polar meds.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2010-05-23 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I love Abilify.  I have taken this drug for 2 years.  I take 30 mg. each morning and 15 mg. in the afternoon.  I do not have any side effects.  Without Abilify I am excessfully anxious and have continuous panic attacks.  With Abilify, I can deal with everyday problems. My only problem is the cost of this drug.  I am on Social Security disability for having Bipolar.  I do have Medicare Part D.  Right now I have fallen in the donout hole.  My Abilify for a 90 day supply was $1,750 at CVS.  I like to have fell over.  I started crying at the drug store.  The only alternative was to order the generic Abilify over the internet on a strange website.  I wish Abilify price would come down so I can afford it. I also take Lamictal 200 x 2 a day, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Xanaz and Ambien. I really need help. I have applied to drug company and was denied assistance since I have Part D Medicare. Any ideas?
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2010-05-02 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	5.0	I am 40 and have been taking Abilify for over two years now and for me it has been a life saver. It has made my life tolerable to extremely livable depending on the day. I have had no major side effects other than a bit of weight gain. I work out regularly at a moderate rate to counter this. The crazy thoughts and swings have subsided because of this medication. I am working and my family has noticed a significant difference in my ability to function under stress because of this medication. I can not say enough good about it.
abilify	Asperger's Syndrome	2010-04-09 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	this drug can cause serious side effects that can kill. muscle break down in children this almost killed my son he is 12 years old. Please be very careful when deciding to use this drug in children. this drug shouldn't be on the market fro children we are sueing the drug company and doctor who gave this to my son. be very aware of this drug.
abilify	Post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)	2010-04-04 00:00:00		3.5	1.0	4.0	3.0	I take this medication for racing thoughts.  Treatment has significant weight gain and my doctor and I decided to lower the dosage and take it every other day due to my significant displeasure of this side effect.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2010-01-05 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	3.5	1.5	I AM SURE IT HELPS SOME PEOPLE ....BUT CAREFUL MONITORING IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY!  I NOT ONLY HAVE HAD THE WORST PANIC ATTACKS I HAVE EVER HAD, I FELT SUICIDAL. I WANTED TO LEAVE MY SKIN, ESCAPE THE HORRIBLENESS.  I ALSO HAD DIARRHEA, VOMITING, ANDWEIGHT GAIN.  AWFUL!!!!!!!!!
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2010-01-03 00:00:00		1.5	1.0	2.0	1.5	made my anxiety worse i feel very anxious all the time and short of breathe for sure. definately going to get off it as soon as possible and go to the doctors soon!
abilify	Autism	2009-12-21 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	My son was placed on Abilify after being diagnosed at 5 with autistic tendencies, Adhd, and bipolar.. I feel like I got my little boy back after putting him on this medicine. Less repetitive behaviors, less anger outbursts, ability to focus increased, better communication skills and less insomnia. I feel that Abilify is wonderful for treating the conditions that my son has been diagnosed with.
abilify	Depression	2009-12-21 00:00:00		4.0	1.5	4.5	2.5	Added as supplement to prozac.  Found immediate increase in energy.   However, using just 5mg per day, I found myself with moderate restlessness, inability to relax and intermittent sleep at night.  I had high hopes because of it's early effectiveness but this is too much.  I halved the dosage and will give that a week or so but if there is no improvement, I will ask the Dr. to recommened something else.  Any suggestions for a supplemental aid to prozac?
abilify	Depression	2009-12-16 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	3.0	well it is only my first day taking abilify.  i currently take paxil 30 mg as well.  today i took abilify 10mg.  the effects i have noticed so far are after taking it i felt extreme fatigue, but not sleepy.  definitely less anxious... my body temp feels higher than norm.  it completely killed my appetite.  do feel sort of restless now after 5 hrs from taking it
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-12-11 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	4.0	5.0	I was so disappointed I had to stop taking this due to horrible muscular side effects (crippling neck pain and tightness). It worked wonders for me. It stopped my mixed episodes, made me happy without being manic, made me rational and organized and able to think! It turned me into myself for the first time in years. All I could do was sit back and be amazed. My friends were amazed, too, at how much more myself I was. It was brilliant! So I say it is definitely worth a try, it might be brilliant for someone else as well.Regrettably I had to go off it due to the side effects. I had horrible neck pain, it felt like my head was being squeezed in a vice, and I felt like I was going to throw up, the pain was so bad. It was dreadful. And a shame, because the med worked so well for the BPII. I would recommend it still.
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2009-11-20 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	3.0	I started taking 2mg Abilify 3 weeks ago. I am already on 30mg Cymbalta and 100mg Lamotrigine twice daily but was still feeling down and crying easily so the doc put me on Abilify. I felt great until a week ago.  I have had shortness of breath which is giving me anxiety attacks and the beginning of a panic attacks. Needless to say, as of this morning I've decided to stop taking it. I read last night that this is a serious side effect and you should go to emergency. My doctor isn't in on Fridays (today) and won't be in until Monday at 1:00. Frustrated! On the positive side, I did NOT gain weight. I have actually been losing it. I feel so much better but this side effect has ruined it for me. I hope there is another drug that will make me feel so good mentally. I would tell people to give it a try. If you don't like it don't take it....in the end it's up to you.  Thanks for listening.  I just had to put my opinion and experience with this drug out there.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-11-04 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Have only been on Abilify for about 7 days.  So far so good, but don't want to be misleading to others.  So far am tolerating ok, but having symptoms that may have been there prior to beginning treatment, but can't remember as I sometimes suffer from placebo effects and if a side effect is mentioned I often think it is related to the new treatment rather than being able to differentiating from prior symptoms.  Keeping my fingers crossed
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2009-10-21 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	3.0	I am on my 5th day of Abilify (2 mg in the morning). I started on a Saturday because I was so worried about the side effects and didn't want to deal with those when I had to go to work. I am also on Lamictal 350 mg/day and Wellbutrin. So far, I am in a better mood during the day and have energy. I have had a headache since I started, some days worse than others. My stomach is a little upset and I don't have much of an appetite....nothing sounds good. I am still on Geodon at night, but am weaning off that within the next week or so. I don't have any problem sleeping at night...in fact, I am very tired. But not during the day, which is what's important. Hopefully the 2 mgs will work...it sounds like the higher the dose the more side effects you experience. Good luck to everyone!
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2009-10-13 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	Within a month of taking it I gained 15 pounds, despite that I worked out 5 days a week.  It made me insanely hungry nothing felt like enough. Mouth watered, these were the reasons why I stopped, the hunger felt like a constant obsession, while it stops the obsessive thoughts, it gave me obsessive hunger. wtf. Tradeoff not worth it. Better since I stopped, I stop eating after I have a meal, now it registers in my mind that I am not hungry anymore. Never had this problem before this med.
abilify	Depression	2009-10-02 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	So far I've been on 2.5mg dose Abilify for a week as an add on to Wellbutrin. So far its working good. This is the first med that has worked effectively for me. Wellbutrin alone dosent do much. I've been a lot less depressed and irritable, calmer. The only side effect is sleepyness. I need 8 hours of sleep not too feel tired throughout the day. Without it, I can normally go with 6.5 or 7hours.
abilify	Depression	2009-09-25 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Have had atypical depression &amp; anxiety for 20+ years. Recently began Pristiq after Cymbalta pooped out. After 3 mo. it helped &quot;some&quot; but FATIGUE was at an ALL TIME LOW. Thought I might have to quit work &amp; go on disability. Cried all the time, couldn't socialize, go anywhere, or do anything. 2 wks. ago I asked  Dr. to add Abilify. Very 1st day I had more energy!  Has been 2 wks. &amp; has been a MIRACLE drug for me. Went from suicidal thoughts to enjoying life again! I take a 2 mg tablet 7:30. AM. Have had NO side effects but trouble falling asleep at night. Also take Klonopin for anxiety &amp; sleep. Started taking calcium/magnesium at night too. Tried adding Tylenol PM but had trouble waking up next day. Recently added Estroven PM  &amp; I'm falling asleep much easier &amp; less tossing &amp; turning from hot flashes. Also take 1/2 vicodin 3-4 X's day for back pain &amp; 72mg Concerta ER in AM.  Concerta was SUPPOSED to help fatigue but I was still basically unable to function until I started the Abilify.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-09-20 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I was just diagnosed w/Bipolar II after being treated for depression &amp; anxiety.I’m on Cymbalta &amp; when my Dr. decreased my dosage to 30 mg from 90 &amp; added 2.5mg of Abilify, I stabilized. Then he changed diagnosis from depression to Bipolar II. It's like an evil spirit was excorcised from my soul (metaphor to describe futility of struggling with something that felt out of my control.) I've been wildly productive for a month &amp; feel great. I don't sweat the small stuff now, most of which would become huge &amp; suck me down into a pit of depression. Now it's like 'everyone get out of my way, I have art to make.'I hope this lasts. I never felt this good before &amp; I'm 39, so I have a lot to catch up on.Don’t give up. If meds don't feel right, tell your psychiatrist.Research everything you're prescribed. Read the info that comes w/them.Too high a dosage can cause negative side effects but just the right one may not.I wish more people find success with their meds &amp; treatment.
abilify	Depression	2009-09-10 00:00:00		2.5	2.5	2.5	4.0	i just started with combo of lexpro.  So far so good, still a little tired.  Side effect; stomach upset, trouble sleeping
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-09-08 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	5.0	5.0	I feel normal for the first time in my life.  Only side affects:  severe constipation (take a laxative or 6); restlessness (hey, better than  what I felt before!); difficulty falling to sleep (up the trazadone).  Otherwise, it's a great med.  Why didn't I try it sooner!!!!!!?
abilify	Schizophrenia	2009-08-18 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	3.5	0.5	Experienced loss of appetite within the first few days of taking Abilify, became extremely fatigued, some abdominal pain. Found out a few days ago that Abilify was giving hepetotoxicity. Made my skin yellow, urine very dark. I feel miserable, stopped taking the meds a few days ago but still can't eat very well and want to sleep all the time. Haha the noises I was hearing stopped, but It pretty much made everything else 10 times worse.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-08-14 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	4.0	5.0	I have been diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder for about 10 years, and have been on every medication on the market.  My disorder favors the depressive side, and I am taking Lamical 200mg, Wellbutrin 200 mg, and Trazadone to sleep.  I am usually well controlled, but I still have an average of two intense episodes of depression a year. The last episode of depression, I actually considered suicide.  My psychiatrist prescribed Abilify 10 mg as an adjunct therapy and my symptoms improved dramatically!  This is the best that I have felt in years!
abilify	Depression	2009-07-29 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	I had some pretty adverse side effects to this medication. I was using it in adjunction with Depakote for my depression. Immediately I was in a state of constant fatigue, irritability and vomiting. I was throwing up everywhere. Not fun. It may work well for others but for me, being a sleepy, vomiting mess was not my idea of alleviating depression. I would also like to note that I was only taking 2.5 mg a day, half of the smallest recommended dose. I can't even imagine what the full 5 would have done.
abilify	Depression	2009-07-24 00:00:00		1.5	1.5	5.0	1.5	I was on lexapro for two months without seeing any results so my doctor put me on abilify also. I am only on 5 mg and the side effects are aweful. I am so restless i cant sit still and my anxiety has gotten worse. I have head aches almost everyday and i get so dizzy and tired after i take it. It hasnt even done anything for my depression so i am going to talk to my doctor about stopping it next week
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-07-23 00:00:00		3.5	3.0	4.0	4.5	I just recently have resumed taking abilify.  I stopped taking it first time due to strange side effects. I have since tried numerous drugs similar to abilify. Im my opinion, Abilify's benefits far outweigh the negatives.In the beginning I experienced slight drowsiness at first, and also began gagging.  I am experiencing the same side effects the second time around as well.  The gagging is apparently a pretty rare side effect.  I ended feeling better than ever after getting adjusted and finding the right dosage (about 6 weeks).I am being treating for Bipolar II, ADHD, depression, and PTSD.  I know that abilify isn't for everyone, but I have had wonderful results with it.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2009-07-13 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	Problem with this med is the Doctors over-prescribe. I take 2.5 mg (5mg pills cut in half to save  money). It is extremely effective and I have no side effects. Comparing to the reported side effects, I have opposite effects. It actually stabilized my sugar levels and I'm not as hungry, I feel an increase in libido, I can sleep, and all other stress / anxiety symptoms have disappeared. I have tried several meds and this is the only one that made me normal again. Lamictal made me feel like I was dying. I'm bipolar, was mostly manic, every day. I also take atenolol for my heart rhythm / rate.
abilify	Asperger's Syndrome	2009-07-10 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	My husband is taking 5mg. of Abilify a day for his Asperger's, and he is back to the man I fell in love with years ago! His symptoms seem to get worse the older he gets, just like his dad's did, and an anti-deppresant helped some but he needed something more. One day last week he missed his pill and by noon the next day told me he could barely string together a coherant thought. He said his head felt like it was stuffed full of &quot;oily cotton&quot; and it was too much of an effort to think, much less to think rationally. He said this is how he'd been feeling for the past few years, which explains a lot of the horrible decisions he'd been making. It had gotten so bad that I had one foot out the door before he started Abilify, but in the past couple of months things have made a 180. We're about to celebrate our 15-year anniversary, and for the first time in years I'm actually looking forward to 15 more!
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-06-18 00:00:00		3.5	2.5	3.0	3.0	took at bedtime still tired at times with 10mg not as bad with 5mg.  then didn't help the BP2 as well.
abilify	Depression	2009-06-14 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I've had no side effects from Abilify and it brought me out of a deep depression within two weeks with 10 mg a day along with me already taking Cymbalta 60 mg per day.  I highly recommend this prescription drug in combination with another antidepressent.
abilify	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	2009-06-03 00:00:00		3.5	1.0	5.0	2.5	When I first tried 10mg of Abilify in the afternoon I became very sleepy, probably due to its antihistamine effects. That night I woke up after about 5 hours of sleep and couldn't sit still for the rest of the night. I simply felt I couldn't get into a comfortable position. The next day I was tired and slightly confused, and almost completely unmotivated and slept several times throughout the day.A few days later I tried half the dose, with about half the side effects. I tried this for a few days and did notice some relief from OCD in the morning, but the side effects were still intolerable.It works, likely due to its 5-HT2a antagonism, but only if you can tolerate the dopamine and histamine antagonism.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-05-21 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	4.0	0.5	I asked for this drug because a friend with Bipolar I took it and suggested it when I didn't tolerate Geodon very well. Within a week of starting this medication I developed severe akathisia... very agitated, crawiling out of my skin all the time, couldn't sit still and was overwhelmed with panic on the edge of complete terror, especially being out of the house ... had a lot of uncontrollable anxiety attacks, crying fits, etc.It did not help me with depression at all, I can't speak for hypomania or mood stabilization because I wasn't on it long and the side effects were far too severe to gauge any benefits.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-05-11 00:00:00		2.5	4.0	5.0	4.0	I started taking Abilify after a few months I was diagnosed bipolar and  before that  I was on risperdal..:(  and the Abilify was a major change which was much better.. I started on 15 mg. I was also given lexapro,cogentin for sides and ativan.Then later after a few weeks I was getting depressed  I was also a compulsive eater and manic so I gained 80- 90 lbs in 3 years... and then switched to geodon,prozac and cogenton but it made no difference in sides and weight gain, it added sleepyness tofor about 2 years on this med...Then I went back on Abilify 10 mg..a couple months ago and I feel ok just need to go up on dosage, but I dont know what to expect when the Abilify takes full affect yet.I am also on trileptol 900mg once a day and 1 mg of cogentin a day..I think this med has a different affect on everyone not all but most..
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2009-05-02 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	3.5	3.0	I have had sever weight gain, insomnia, trembling and now I am having sick thoughts of wanting to be with young girls. I have never had any thoughts like this in my life and I am terrified!
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2009-05-02 00:00:00		4.5	1.0	5.0	2.5	When my Zoloft 100mg stopped working, my pdoc prescribed Ability 5mg.  I tried for 1 month.  I could not sleep (wide awake every 1 to 2 hours), I was acting impulsively (eating and shopping and speaking sometimes) and that my mind was three sentences in front of my mouth (which made me sound like my brain was a bit on the fried side).  I dropped down to 2mg and nearly immediately had a return of the depressive symptoms/suicidality.  Bumped back up to 4-4.5 and returned to the aforementioned side effects.  I also gained 15lbs.  While I understand this medication works for some and it did work on the depression, the side effects were intolerable for me.
abilify	Depression	2009-04-11 00:00:00		3.5	3.5	4.0	4.0	Four days ago, I started taking 2.5 mg of Abilify as an addition to the prozac I'm already on.   So far, so good, for the most part.  The only side effect so far is insomnia.   It used to be impossible for me to get up in the morning, and I could fall back asleep easily when awakened.  Now, if something wakes me up at night, which it frequently does, I lie in bed for hours, trying to get back to sleep. The odd thing, is, the insomnia at least makes it easy to wake up and stay awake during the day.  I have more energy, more motivation to get things done, and have even found myself smiling once in awhile.  Its the closest I've come to feeling &quot;almost normal&quot; in so long.   So far, with abilify, I've actually smiled a few times without having to force it, or even think about trying to appear &quot;happy&quot;.  I guess I can try to live without sleep.
abilify	Borderline Personality Disorder	2009-03-24 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	3.0	Worked miracles for me as far as treating paranoia and delusions! It would have been the perfect med if not for the side effects. I would get muscle jerks and feel on edge- like drinking 20 cups of coffee, and extremely agitated and jittery. It got to the point where I couldn't tolerate the side effects unfortunately.
abilify	Schizophrenia	2009-03-22 00:00:00		1.5	4.5	5.0	3.5	Well, I feel a little ambiguous about this med. It didn't give me any side effects, I have lost 6 kilos over six months while on it, but it simply wasn't effective for my symptoms. A higher dose just increased side effects, but did nothing to help my condition.This is a really good med to try if you suffer from schizophrenia med-induced weight gain, but as I said, watch out, cause the symptoms may come back.Hope it will work for you. :)
abilify	Agitated State	2009-03-05 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	4.0	0.5	I was prescribed 5mg abilify tablets, nightly at bedtime, for anxious mood.  I have concerns about the diabetes side effect; however, I'm more worried about my restless legs!  I feel like I can't sit still and have to pace, yet my legs feel like they weight 200 lb. each!  Attention span is lacking as well.  Only benefit I personally feel is that it's easier for me to fall asleep after taking this.........basically restless and lethargic most of the time during the day..........wouldn't recommend this medicine for anyone.
abilify	Asperger's Syndrome	2009-02-10 00:00:00		4.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	have a 4 year old son that started taking 1mg of abilify in april08. the medication seemed to be the answers to our prayers for about 3 months. then he returned to sleepless nights and self harm. at about six months, his doctor uped his dosage to 2mg a day. no positive changes occured! it has been 10 mos. since my son started abilify and i am noticing that he is starting to chew his tongue and his tantrums are getting more intense. the most positive effect of this drug has been his ability to be more social and accepting of outsiders. at this time i am struggling with the decision to continue this drug for treatment!
abilify	Borderline Personality Disorder	2009-01-26 00:00:00		4.0	4.5	4.5	4.5	Before taking Abilify I was Harming myself frequently and was lucky to still be alive.  I would zone out and not even feel the pain.  After taking Abilify I couldn't even understand how I could have begun to get this serious urge to harm myself.  I took this medication for a few years and when I stopped after slowly lowering the 15mg dose to none, I was extremly sucidal and had effects like I was on some kind of meth.  Several other meds were tried over a period over about 5 weeks and the only thing that helped was to start back on Abilify.  It is a great med while you are on it but can a person ever get off of it?
abilify	Depression	2009-01-10 00:00:00		3.5	3.0	5.0	3.5	After literally years of trying different meds for dysthymia (which led to excessive sleeping and inactivity), Abilify seems to be helping.  I am awake when I'm supposed to be awake and i'm actually motivated to do things other than just fulfilling the minimum obligations in my life.  Side effects include considerable nausea and restlessness.  Also, I am on the verge of crying a lot but not because I'm sad... TV commercials, songs, well-wishing friends, etc. make me choke up from joy or sentimentality.
abilify	Depression	2008-12-31 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	Abilify is the most horrible drug on the market; It worsens depression and anxiety. Other side effects include suicidal thoughts, uncontrolled saliva production, trembling, night mares, blurred vision.This product should be taken off the market, it does harm and has no benefits whatsoever.I used Abilify for 4 months and almost died from it.
abilify	Depression	2008-12-20 00:00:00		1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0	Cognitive-behavioral therapy is the best adjunct to treatment for major depression.The abilify depression commercial now on TV is misleading. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and medications are equally effective at treating depression, and CBT will reduce the likelihood of a relapse for depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy is effective at helping you re-interpret your depressogenic (or depression causing) thoughts in a different way. How you interpret the world is going to have a strong impact on your depression. But they don't mention CBT on commercials for abilify, and your psychiatrist, not being trained in psychotherapy, may not know CBT. Be sure to use all non-medication options first before using an antipsychotic for off - label applications given the potential for side effects for this drug. Abilify is an antipsychotic - don't believe the hype, this was not intended as an anti-depressant and the drug companies are simply trying to make more money.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-11-05 00:00:00		2.0	1.0	3.0	3.0	I'm a dental hygienist and found that this med made my hands tremor, so much so that I am need of going off it so that my hands don't shake. It is quite annoying and I just didn't get relief from my anxiety. Still having to take xanax to quell my nerves and am as paranoid as ever.... Anyone else get hand shakes/tremors?
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-10-21 00:00:00		3.5	2.5	4.0	2.5	I began taking Abilify about three weeks ago, and although my moods seem to have stabilized, I am experiencing restlessness and at times a rapid heartbeat and palpitations. These side effects have not become reason enough to stop taking this medicine, but because my doctor started me off on a very low dose (2.5 mg) and I'm slowly increasing, I'm wondering if the side effects are more likely to get worse or if it's still possible for them to subside after taking the drug for a certain period of time, as maybe your body gets used to it? Does anyone have any thoughts on this?I also take Effexor XR 75 mg and Adderal 5 mg daily.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-10-16 00:00:00		2.5	4.0	3.0	2.0	Worked great for about a year for BPII. I was only on 5mg, so I didn't get tired, but I didn't notice a huge help, I would still have light mania and depression here and there. Then I started getting head ticks, and had to stop taking immediately.
abilify	Cyclothymic disorder	2008-09-23 00:00:00		2.0	1.0	4.0	1.0	I was on this for 1 month. I really couldn't tell if it stabilized my mood because of all the negative side effects. I had EXTREME restlessness and insomnia. When I didn't have that, I was so tired that I could barely function.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-09-21 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	3.0	1.0	My Son Was put on abilify 10mg in the morning and 10 mg at night he is 7 years old he starting taking abilify, then 4 days after attacked me and my husband was put in a mental hospital for violence and 2 er visit before we finally figured out what was wrong with him so after 6 violent attacks on us and 3 hospital visits we finally figured it out we took him off and the next he was instantly better so just be careful
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2008-09-12 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	I have GAD and Major Depression. The abilify really helps manage the depression aspect of it. It's easy to take and haven't noticed any side-effects other than it makes me feel restless, but otherwise that's it. If you are on it, DON'T DRINK!!! As with any medication its a bad idea, but on abilify it will actually make you MORE depressed. I had to have my dosage increased because of that. Works very quickly, got me back up and running in a couple of days. You still have episodic bouts of depression for about the first 3 weeks, but far and few. After a month it's great.
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2008-09-03 00:00:00		2.5	1.5	2.0	2.0	I have been on Abilify for a while now and at first it worked fine.  Later on, I experienced more and more side effects such as weight gain.  I could not lose weight even with eating right and exercise.  Overall, the medication is alright, but not for me.  I am getting it changed soon.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-08-28 00:00:00		4.0	0.5	4.0	2.0	My pdoc prescribed Abilify in conjunction with Depakote. The plan was to use Abilify while I titrated down from Depakote and then up with Lamictal (since Depakote and Lamictal can't be taken at the same time i.e. the Stevens-Johnson rash increase). For the first time in six years, I was not depressed. I am also on Celexa. But this was a pure happy feeling and it made me realize that other people must feel this way too. I was not used to such joy. It took four weeks to reach 50 mg. I became more agitated with each 10 mg. increase. By the time I did reach 50 mg, I felt EXTREME akathisia. I immediately began titrating off the med and within a week the main symptoms stopped. It took 25 days for it to fully leave my body. The depression reappeared.Akathisia is the the main side effect. Be aware.

abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-08-09 00:00:00		1.5	3.5	4.0	2.5	Didn't help me a bit with the mania part of Bipolar Disorder, I was up to 10-15 mgs per day, allthough it was easy to take, gained a lot of weight while on it.  Might work for other people perhaps combined with other meds, but as we know, that is very hard to find sometimes.
abilify	Borderline Personality Disorder	2008-07-25 00:00:00		2.5	2.0	3.5	3.0	My daughter is on this med after being hospitalized for 5 months.  I would probably have rated the med better but while in the hospital I felt they had her on much too high of a dose.  She was on 30mg daily plus Prozac 60 mg daily.  (If you read the literature that is double the max daily dose).  She was very &quot;blunted&quot;.  She is now on 20mg Abilify.  I am noticing side effects.  I also do not feel the doctors and counselors were listening to her.  Now that she is home I really like her counselor and doctor and we are slowly decreasing the med.
abilify	Depression	2008-07-07 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	4.0	5.0	I have been taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder for 26 years.  Both of my parents died within the last year and after my mom died this May I started to descend into what I call the &quot;hole&quot;.  I could not concentrate or focus on anything even at work.  I was extremely anxious and even though I could not seem to be still I never accomplished anything.  I was constantly obsessing about things.I finally told my Dr. what was going on and he prescribed Abilify in addition to my other meds.  I take 5 mg twice daily and to me it is a miracle.I feel so much better and all the problems I was having have definitely improved even after less than 2  weeks.  Side effects are tolerable so far.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-07-02 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	4.0	I have bipolar II and am on 5mg of Abilify.  It has helped with the mania (hyperactivity) that I use to get. The bad thing is that I gained 7 pounds. I will be trying only 2.5mg to see if I get more energy and lose the weight. This helped me to be able to drop some Effexor that I was on - now I take 150mg instead of 225mg :-)  I feel kind of tired on this and lack motivation  and energy to do things but am very happy to not have the mania.  Caffeine helps bring my energy up so 3 cups of coffee a day works pretty well.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2008-06-24 00:00:00		2.0	1.0	3.5	1.5	I had most of all the bad side efffects
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-06-20 00:00:00		1.5	4.5	4.5	0.5	Soon after I started taking this, I started gaining weight. By the time I stopped I had gone from 155 to 192. No problem with the medication except that there was too little change in my feelings or behavior to warrant unlimited weight gain. Dr. said I had metabolic syndrome and now I am seeing a dietician and on a strict dietary program. Don't know if I'll ever get back to my normal habits. Now on Cymbalta nd quite happy with it.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2008-06-19 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	I was started on this medication after being stabilized after a major manic episode that required 2 months of hospitalization with Depakote.  The Depakote had some nasty side effects (major weight gain), so I was switched to Abilify,1 15mg tablet a day.  When on this medication, I had no episodes and few symptoms of mania for 18 months.  It wasn't until I went off of it (due to not being able to afford it, it's about $350-400 a month without insurance) that the symptoms returned.  It wasn't quite as effective for the depression, but I could function at least.  The pharmacutical company that manufactures Abilify rejected me for their patient assistance program, despite my low (read: none) income and history of hospitalization,  so seeing as it's about $13 a pill, it's not feasible for me to be on this medication via any legal means, so international online pharmacies, here I come. &gt;&lt;
abilify	Depression	2008-04-14 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	This medicine is great!  For such a tiny amount in a tiny pill it has really done the trick combined with the other medicine I am taking!  Hope it keeps working!  I am starting to lose weight, I can stay awake all day now, I get lots of chores done all day, I can organize better now, I am not as irritable as i used to be toward everyone and everything.  I am much happier now.  I am using only a 2 mg. tablet every day!
abilify	Depression	2008-04-06 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Although it is not enough to treat my depression on its own, this medication is an important component of my medication cocktail. It is great at reducing my intrusive negative thoughts. Without it I become delusional and unable to function. The only side effect I have noticed is a tendency to gain weight. I have to really watch my diet while I take this medication.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-04-03 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Abilify saved my 8 year old son.  Not to mention me and his sister.  The constant  mood swings and violent outbursts were unbearable and getting worse with time.  He was wonderful at school (usually) and at his Dad's but an absolute monster with us.  We knew from the first week on Abilify that our sweet little boy was back and I didn't dread picking him up from school.  If I did not have insurance to cover this medication I would take a second or third job just to cover the cost - it has made such a complete difference in our lives.  I only wish I had seen the symptoms and admitted something was wrong years earlier.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2008-01-24 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	This medication has been AMAZING for my 9 year old son!  Have tried Geodon (side effects) and Zyprexa (gained 13 lbs. in 3 wks, didn't work).    Couldn't reach doctor during holidays, stopped Zyprexa, arrived on office doorstep on Jan 2, with son fully manic.  Doc said, &quot;We must stabilize before school starts!&quot;  Gave 5 mg. Abilify right there in the office.  Within 24 hours my son seemed absolutely NORMAL, just like he was before DX with BP!  I was in shock--the good kind!  Almost one month later the change in our family life is just unbelievable.  I have my great little guy back.  Oh, he also takes Adderall XR 25 mg and Strattera 25 mg twice a day.  Doing GREAT in school too!
abilify	Borderline Personality Disorder	2008-01-15 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	I have struggled with BPD for 15 + years.  I have tried numerous meds with little to no success.   I was gaining weight and had no energy on seroquel, so my DR. switched me to Abilify (10mg)  It has been a miracle for me!!!  I am also on Zoloft (200mg)  in the am, i take Valium (30mg) throughout the day, and Trazadone (300mg) @ night.  I LOVE Abilify.  It has given me motivation and focus.  I actually feel happy ( so rare...)  I have not cut, purged, or drank since the switch.  Only thing I would mention is stiffness of my muscles.  ( nothing advil can't fix)  However, I would suggest and BPD's considering Abilify to get on an anti-anxirty med and some form of sleeping pill because it was the only way I could deal with the restlessness and insomnia.  As for me, I believe I found the perfect cocktail.   Hope this helps.   :)
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2007-12-19 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	5.0	0.5	I was very happy while taking this drug. Unfortunately I was manic the entire tiime.
abilify	Schizophrenia	2007-12-04 00:00:00		3.5	5.0	5.0	3.0	Abilify helped me become more motivated and gave me more energy but that was on the minimum dose. After raising the dose I became agiatated out of my skin, couldn't move, couldn't talk, couldn't do anything. Overall it didn't give me exactly what I wanted but it could definately work wonders for other people. Worth a try
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-10-16 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	5.0	0.5	Abilify is the WORST med I've ever tried! I was put on Paxil, Wellbutrin, and Lexapro before I was even diagnosed as Bi-Polar II. First I was told that I had Generalized Anxiety and Depression, then Hypomania, then GAD with Depression again. It was when I finally landed in the hospital that I was diagnosed as Bipolar II. When I left the hospital, I was on Lexapro and Abilify, with Vistaril for occasional panic attacks or sleeplessness. Abilify made me restless, about to jump out of my skin, ADD (I've always had a long attention span), and finally after about two weeks, I had one of the worst panic attacks I have EVER had. I literally felt like I was on a bad LSD trip. I kept hugging my mom and my two-year old niece because I was so freaked out. Abilify made me feel HORRIBLE. Fortunately, it was stopped right away, and now I'm on Lexapro and Trileptal instead, which is thus far working much, much better for me.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-10-11 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	5.0	This medicine pretty much saved me. I was so close to going back to my old days of self-injury; at the time I switched I was on Risperdal and Lexapro. Now I take Lexapro and Abilify. I can't believe what a difference there is. I had little or no side effects, and it has been working ever since! The only thing is that I may need to up my dosage (I'm only on 2 mg daily) because I occasionally feel a little bit of a mood swing (I have rapid cycling).
abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2007-09-28 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	3.0	2.5	I felt less anxious on abilify, but I gained a lot of weight.  This was partly because taking the drug had a very negative effect on my ability to exercise.  I didn't have the energy or motivation;  Since exercise is very important to me, I had to stop the drug.  After a few weeks, I had lost the weight and was exercising nornmally.  I was disappointed since I had been told that abilify did not have these side effects.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-09-28 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	1.0	0.5	This was the first medication that was prescribed after my diagnosis. I can't believe they would put anyone who is hypomanic on this drug. After 2 days, I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin. I was jittery, continued to not be able to sleep, and my thoughts raced even more! I wasn't really nauseated, but I lost my appetite. This medicine obviously didn't work with my brain chemistry.
abilify	Agitation	2007-09-08 00:00:00		3.0	1.0	3.5	3.5	I noticed a big change in responses toward my anger and hostility.  I definitely recommend, everyone realizing that they need a little help and get it!!
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-08-23 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	I suffer from a mixed state and Abilify has not only stabilized me, but it's also made my thinking a lot clearer and rational. I am better able to apply cognitive restructuring and distress tolerance techniques. The only side effects from taking this drugs are: 11 pound weight loss (titrating off Pamelor concurrently), severe constipation, little to no appetite and I can't sleep more than 6-7 hours before springing out of bed, wide awake. I now have lots of energy and motivation to get my work done. Which is a good thing. I am back in the gym and feeling good about myself. Problems while titrating up in dosage, which are transient in nature include: increased hr, sweating, restlessness and anxiety. These side effects do go away over time. Titrating slowly is highly recommended. I started at 1mg and slowly worked my way up.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder	2007-07-26 00:00:00		0.5	1.5	2.5	1.0	This medicine did absolutely NOTHING to help me.  I got so fidgety from it I had to take Congentin, a Parkenson's drug, to get me to be still and even then I was fidgety.  My stability did not improve whatsoever from this and after a month my doctor took me off it.

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-07-14 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	Abilify is the best antipsychotic on the market. There are no long-term side effects that I have had to deal with. The only short-term side effects were restlessness, insomnia and a zombie effect that went away after a few weeks on it. There is weight stabilization too. Abilify is a good drug to try. I am on 10 mg once daily. Take it in the morning. It helps.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-07-11 00:00:00		4.5	1.5	4.0	4.5	I Have Bi-Polar II and had been taking Trileptal with much Success! Unfortunately, my company switched Insurance and the insurance would no longer cover it, except Abilify. A weeks worth of samples of 10 mg as well as a Script for a 30 day supply, 15mg. Talk about catatonic! Within an hour I was so dizzy and sleepy that I would almost crawl to bed. Morning I was a walking Zombie. I &quot;pill-cut&quot; the 15mg and just took half. Finally am now taking 3-4mgs a night. GOOD NEWS! Like Goldi Locks, I had to find the right dosage. I know believe that Abilify is far superior to Trileptal! My mood swings are alll but gone and after my morning cup of coffee I am happy as a Duck in Water. My advice...Dont give up on the stuff. Do Find the Right Dosage for you. 10-15MG's was Over-Kill. 7mgs was good, but still too much. The medicine does what it is suppossed to do. Stop the mood swings. I have gained a little weight, but now that I know it is happening I am increasing my activity.
abilify	Depression	2007-06-27 00:00:00		4.5	2.5	5.0	3.5	As a patient in a lengthy (16 months) depression and a history of severe mood swings (sudden feelings of despair), a low dose (5mg/day) of this drug greatly increased my mood stability. (I have also tried: Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Ativan, Cymbalta, Lamictal and Geodon without any success. While I was also on Abilify, I was simultaneously taking low does of Lexapro and Klonopin, which had elicited partial responses, though more by improving my baseline mood rather than doing much for my instability.) Unfortunately though, as soon as I started Abilify, I began gaining weight quite rapidly. This was the only negative side effect I experienced, but it was severe enough that I discontinued the drug. I'm disappointed though, because what it did in terms of improving my mood stability and general resilence were far, far better than anything else I'd tried, and it didn't make me feel dulled, tired, or any other similar complaints that often crop up with these kinds of meds.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2007-06-10 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Before Abilify, the voices and &quot;hearing&quot; other things was pretty bad.  Now, I hardly ever hear them.  This drug does make you drowsy though, so I take it at bedtime.  I'm up to 20 mg a night.  It also helps with other problems like anxiety and panic attacks - at least for me.  It seems to have a calming effect on me.
abilify	Autism	2007-06-07 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	When our son was 17, he had been weaned from all medication to erradicate obsessive compulsive behaviors. We had started drug therapy when he was 12.He had been without meds for about 3 years.A parent recommended Abilify, describing that it 'took the edge off' and 'got rid of the weird stuff'. Given that those assessments were interesting, yet hardly tangible, we waited a year and tried it for ourselves.It has made a difference. The highs and lows related to anxiety are definitely tempered. He does not perseverate or obsess as much. He does seem more calm.He has been taking Abilify for almost 2 years now, and we did question a sign of 'drooping' of his tongue. We took him to a neurologist and he assessed that it was not a tartive dyskinesia.When I draw it to my son's attention, he pulls his tongue back. He can control it.So far, we are staying with Abilify.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-05-07 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	1.5	0.5	I wanted to keel over! I saw my pdoc for a switch from Zyprexa; I have BP-2 disorder, along with depression, OCD, and panic disorder. I take several other medications and was gaining weight like crazy after a month and a half on Zyprexa. My pdoc told me of Abilify, which I had never heard of, and I thought I'd heard of most of the new atypical antipsychotics. When I got home and took my first dose, I was dizzy within 15 minutes. Within an hour, I had a fever and was vomiting and close to fainting. I felt like this for roughly 28 hours. It was horrid. I notified him right away, and he switched me to Geodon, so we'll see how that goes. It's been a long time since a drug has made me this sick. When I looked into the side effects of Abilify, every single side effect I experienced was listed. Scary.

My 14 y.o. son started Abilify recently after 4 years of Risperdal.  He likes Abilify better, because he has lost the weight that he gained during Rispersal.I like Abiilfy better, because his moods are stable -- no ups and downs, just constant smoothness.  My son's behanvior is much more pleasant and predictable now!(Our insurance pays for the meds, so I don't have to rate cost effectiveness.)

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2007-04-04 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Abilify for Bipolar II This drug is the best for me. Started in January after several years of only managing 2 months at a time w/o cycling or episode. To date, 4 months have passed with not even a blip on the radar!  No side effects to report, either. Hope it lasts!
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2007-03-14 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	4.0	3.0	Ok for School I guess if you needed to finish school or do well at work this med could work.  There are some side effects that you have to live with:  balance, problems swallowing, sensitive to the sun.  But it does help out in the concentration department.
abilify	Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder combined	2007-02-16 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Abilify This medication works great for my 11 year old son.  Although taking it twice a day seems to help him the most.  He has a better morning when taking a small dose of 2.5 mg at night and 5 mg in the am.  It has made him much more coherent and mature acting.  It helps greatly with rages and argumentiveness.  He is much more reasonable.  His focus/organization could be better, but he can not take stims due to the tics it causes.  His social life improved greatly when starting this med.  It does seem to cause constipation though.
abilify	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2007-01-10 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	3.5	0.5	Horrible drug They gave me this after detoxing from benzos. I was already in bad shape, but this just made me worse. I couldn't sit down and had to pace endlessly.  I couldn't think straight and I had no attention span.  It took a long time to wear off too.  I wouldn't suggest anybody ever take this stuff.
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-12-10 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	5.0	0.5	Terrible! Don't know if it would have worked or not. Only took it for 4 days and felt just so sick in genenral. Very, very dizzy....shot my blood pressure straight up. I do have hypertension, but it has been mostly under control. The Abilify made it shoot straight up from day 1.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-12-08 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	too soon to tell I've been taking amblify for 7 days and the best things i notice are a slight increase in energy and motivation. I am less depressed even though I have been taking lamictal for a year. The lamictal alone wasn't cutting the depression entirely and the amblify seems to be a nice add on. I'm looking forward to having some trileptal added also for irritability and anxiety. Matbe the amblify will take care of these issues as well!I have noticed that I am only sleeping about 4 or 5 hours and  the dreams are not as nice as I would like but fortunely i forget them as soon as i get out of bed. thank God because as I am laying there i'm thinking what the hell was that all about shit!! that part of the drug is not good so I'm not looking forward to tonight and I might leave the lights on. lolno more strange dreams more calm and feeling better every day. it's unbelievable. I can't believe it's only 2 weeks. it's been over 1 month and we've gone up to 20mg. I am super productive and slightly restless. Some nights I sleep very welland other nights I don't sleep many hours but the quality of sleep is excellent. I do take 2 tylenol pm and a calcium magnesium at bedtime for my painfull degenerative neck. This is very annoying. With the bipolar and the neck I am easily aggravated. The addition of trileptal  will hopefully help me and smooth out any rough edges of the abilify. I do love abilify!!!
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-12-08 00:00:00		0.5	3.0	5.0	1.5	Abilify? Are you serious? It made me ABLE to lose my freaking mind! This was the first antipsychotic I was on after I was diagnosed.  I didn't know what to expect and needless to say, I was scared.  The first day, no side effects.  This continued for the first week.  Somewhere between week 2 and week 4, I lost all ability to concentrate on any one thing.  I became so restless at times that I felt like I wanted to jump out of my skin.  I was on this med as a combination with Paxil.  Between the two of them, I gained 45 lbs in 5 months.  It didn't help with any of my mood swings...depression or hypomania.  I actually started experiencing my first mixed episodes.  Hearing about them scared me.  Living them was a nightmare!Then the really weird side effects started.  I started having strange visual disturbances.  When driving at night, all the tail lights of the cars ahead of me would blend together.  I couldn't tell one car from another.  I also started having leg stiffness.  It would feel like my legs weighed a ton and when I got up to walk, I felt like a 90 year old woman.  I was only 26!I can write a book on all the crappy things this med did to me, from anxiety to hostility and terrible nightmares.  About the only GOOD thing about this med was that it allowed me to sleep...when I wasn't having nightmares, that is.Almost forgot to add: get your blood work done regularly.  I have blood work done on a regular basis and in the short time I was on this stuff, my cholesterol and triglycerides went up and I developed metabolic syndrome (the set of symptoms you get before developing diabetes).  Believe the warnings from the American Diabetes Association.

Abilify has worked for me .The side effects went away fairly rapidly.I am happy with abilify and having taken so many different meds ....this is one of the best...just give it some time.I have no complaints...I'm just trying to lose a bit of weight and I don't think Abilify is going to stop me....I'm hoping!I'l let you know!Good luck!

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-12-05 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.5	4.5	It helped a great deal! I have been struggling with bipolar since my 20's and now I am in my 50's.  This drug has helped more than all the rest combined.  I don't know why, but I feel relaxed, my blood pressure has gone to normal, I am not fearful, paranoid and angry as used to be.
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-12-05 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Terrific! I love this drug!  Few side effects (no weight gain) and it does not sedate and make me zombie-like.
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-12-02 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	5.0	1.0	weight gain! I'm Bipolar I, but mostly depressive.  Have only had one manic episode in 2 years.  Most of the time I am in a depressive state.I started on Abilify 5 mg. a day in May, and have gained about 30 lbs. since then.  I have been gaining about 5 lbs. a month since I started on it.It has done nothing to ease my depression, except make memore depressed due to weight gain.  However, Abilify did help with my &quot;voices&quot;  - a sort of murmuring and mumbling as if I were listening to a distant radio, after I went up to 15 mg. a day.I am going to ask my doctor to take me off this medication, because I feel slightly uncomfortable when out in public (I feel like &quot;the fat girl&quot;).There was only one other person on RemedyFind that mentioned weight gain, so this may be a side effect very infrequently experienced.

abilify	Schizophrenia	2006-11-16 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	Abilify - Helps Me Write  I started Abilify by itself, when in the hospital in July. It made me extremely agitated and irritable. My pdoc added 160mg of Geodon and immediately I calmed down. The voices and delusions were still a problem though, so she added 15mg of Haldol to the mix as well. On this combo, things rapidly improved. I can however, attribute one major benefit to the Abilify alone, since I'd been on the other two drugs before: a drive and ability to write and write -- my one talent and ability -- like never before. I write pages and pages a day in my notebook, and usually a poem each day and a blog entry of several paragraphs and e-mails galore. Sometimes I write all day long, right up until the instant I fall asleep at night, and it's great. THe delusions are under control, as are the voices. My mood is balanced, neither up nor down, and the irritability has completely vanished. In fact, I can wait and wait and wait without the least impatience. So I'd say that Abilify has a role to play in my illness, even if I can't tolerate it by itself, and it is not effective completely on its own. I would not want to stop taking it!

It worked well from the first day, and has kept working, without side effects for 5 months now.  I did go up to 10mg, briefly, but felt it was making me too tired and went back down.  It's a med I wish I'd had years ago.

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-11-11 00:00:00		2.0	3.0	5.0	2.5	OK Just average I guess.  I used it for mood stabilization.  I hear it causes a TON of symptoms and other side effects in a lot of people.  For me, there weren't too many, but it only worked so-so.  Can't say I'd be wildly enthusiastic about recommending it.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-11-08 00:00:00		0.0	5.0	4.5	2.0	Didn''t work There were no side effects, no benefits.  It just didn't work for me.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2006-11-05 00:00:00		2.0	2.5	5.0	2.5	Didn''t work for me. I used Abilify for my bipolar symptoms for 2 weeks.  My psych took me off due to the fact that I did not sleep more than 6 hours the entire 2 weeks I was on the pill and the daily headaches.Abilify also made me rapid cycle and increased panic and paranoia.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-11-03 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Abilify is a Godsend for me Abilify stopped the rapid cycling and put a halt to the dysphoric mania (&lt;-- fancy words for extreme crankiness and irritability).  No side effects.  A bit pricey, but well worth it for me.
abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2006-11-01 00:00:00		3.0	5.0	4.5	3.5	Great at the beginning. Not sure now. At the beginning I had very satisfactory results. I have taken the drug for two months, I have experienced no unpleasant side effects at all. The first two weeks I had more energy, was sleeping great at night, (My insomnia gives me a hard time),I felt like exercising, I cooked, etc. I thought this was definitively the medicine.But two months after start taking the medicine, things have changed. I am having trouble sleeping, I have a terrible lack of energy, I am afraid my depression is coming back (even though I am taking antidepressants). I guess this is happening because I am Bipolar II, and my understanding is that Abilify is FDA approved for Bipolars I.I am taking Lithium and the idea was to replace the Lithium with Abilify , but as soon as I got a smaller dosage of Lithium I felt terrible, so now I am back with Lithium and at the same time with Abilify, giving some time to see if Abilify works. I am taking also Stablon (not approved in the US).I really want to try again with Lamictal, because I have read it is the best for Bipolars II, but I tried 2 years ago and I had terrible itching, not a rash thank God, but my doctor preferred not to continue with Lamictal. I will keep you posted, in case Abilify works. Good Luck everyone!

Before taking ability I had simple racing thoughts and maybe a few other things but I liked and enjoyed who I was.  Now when trying to go without the medication I feel terrible, I had my dose lowered because I felt like I couldn't sit patiently, like I couldn't get comfortable, squirmy.  I feel caught between a rock and a hard place.  I wish I wouldn't have been forced to take this medicine without more accute symptoms for peace of mind that it was helping instead of causing the symptoms I now experience.

Took it around 8pm one evening, then didn't sleep a wink all night. When I woke, I was sensitive to all light and sound, and then vomited just for good measure. A friend told me that these side effects are likely to ease after a few months, but I didn't see the point in taking something which was giving me the symptoms it was supposed to treat, i.e. the insomnia and overacuteness of the senses of a manic episode.

I take it with my ADD meds, and they have not caused any real problems for me. A bit of weight gain, just a bit. But all in all this a good drug for me. Very smooth as far as the way I feel. Helps take the edge off adderall. Glad to here others have it work well for them as well. Remember all drugs are not going to work the same for everyone. Try and keep trying till you find the one that makes you say YES. Feel free to e mail if you have any questions.
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-10-23 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.0	Working Great! I recently switched to Abilify (10 mg. one a day at bedtime), from Seroquel (600 mg). I have been on the new meds for about a week.  It feels like the cob webs have cleared and I can smile again. My thoughts are clearer, my anxiety is reduced and I have more energy.

Well it has been about 12 days and I can honestly say that I am feeling more positive effects within this time than with 8 months of taking Seroquel.  I am really kind of timid to say that it really is working, but so far things are looking up. I have been dealing with a bit of insomnia, but I have medication for that problem.  Please keep your fingers crossed for me and I will keep you posted.......Still taking Ambilify.  It makes me feel different than Seroquel in a positive way except for figity problems and problems sleeping. I am taking meds for the sleeping problem.  After about five weeks of taking Ambilify, I am not sure where I really stand.  So I will keep on trying with this med.  Hopefully next time I will have better news.

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-10-11 00:00:00		3.0	2.5	4.5	3.0	Not for me, but I''ve seen it help another This medication made me incredibly restless. I tend to be like that anyway, but it made the sensation unbearable. I felt like climbing out of my skin. It did seem to help level me out and I probably would have remained on it longer if not for that side effect.My friend takes this and it works remarkably well for her. There is a very clear difference between when she takes it and when she does not. She had one odd side effect though. Apparently, it caused her breasts to swell almost uncomfortably. The doctor told her that is a possible side effect, something about it can trigger lactation or something along those lines. I think it's a rare thing to happen. It, unfortunately, didn't happen to me! :-)

I have always been sensitive to meds - so my fatigue may be more related to my body chemistry than anything else.  On the positive side I was experiencing severe bipolar (and somewhat psychotic) episodes where I thought I saw and heard things (more like conversations in other rooms and people calling me than commands to take actions).Once I started taking Abilify I almost immediately was relieved of these truly disturbing symptoms of my illness.

I am currently in the more depressed side of my mixed states and have been given several medications new to me, most of which do not seem to be working against my anxiety.  I'm shaking a lot and was told by my doctor that it may be the Abilify.  I will probably not stay on Abilify for very much longer.

I think it was a horrible drug for me and made me worse. It's a bear to lose weight with exercise at a gym 3X a week and watching my diet carefully (I had previously lost 80 lbs). Since being on this I've gained 10 lbs. very discouraging. Also causes constipation and drowsiness. My depression is worse than I can ever remember.

abilify	Depression	2006-09-26 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	4.5	0.5	Became &quot;severly&quot; depressed I believe my depression is associated with lower levels of dopamine as my lack of libido was one of the first things I noticed when I intially became depressed(age of sixteen in the fall of 1983) and dopamine is the sex enhancer chemical in the brain, and another reason why the selegiline (MAO-I type B) boosts both my mood and libdo sometime too much libido.Abilify was &quot;Horrible&quot;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I work out often and was very fatigued on this CRAP-Abilify too.
abilify	Depression	2006-09-21 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Relief This was prescribed for Depression/PTSD/DESnos ( Disorders of extreme stress - not otherwise specified ) from childhood.I suffered from refractory depression, debilating fatigue, anxiety, severe sleep disorders, chronic diffuse pain (fibromyalgia), and ADD-like symptoms.Tried without adequate response (4+ weeks each): Zoloft, Paxil, Lexapro, Amitryptaline, Wellbutrin, Lamictal, Effexor(helped some) and Cymbalta.The first 4 days were really tough to get through but worth the effort.  I was extremely sleepy, felt like my limbs were made of lead and really struggled to perform cognitive tasks of any kind regardless of what time I took the dose. The &quot;zombie&quot; like effects were severe enough that I almost quit taking it on each of those first 4 days.  After the 5th day on Abilify, there was a fairly abrupt shift for the better that has persisted.  I feel much calmer, relaxed and have noticed an enormous difference in my ability to handle stress or unexpected events.  Also, instead of feeling constantly uncentered and awkward around people I don't know well, social situations are now much more comfortable and even pleasant for me. Abilify has also helped with the depression and significantly reduced the ADD-like symptoms that had only been exacerbated by SSRI's or SNRI's. Finally, I feel like living life again instead of being trapped dwelling on the past and hiding my wounds from the world.  No weight gain to date and perhaps a small amount of weight loss.I am also taking desipramine(100-150mg/day for past 6 mos) which has helped enormously with the pain, fatigue and mood.Only side effect so far has been a slight increase in the anticholinergic effects of the desipramine, which for me is only a mild heart rate increase and urinary hesitency.  Those side effects are nothing compared to what this med has fixed.  Based on my experiences so far I would recommend starting at a low dose first and try to start it when you have no serious obligations

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-09-20 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	4.5	4.0	Hospital I started taking this in the hospital and it stopped my paranoia and hallucinations.  It doesn't make me nervous, though my heart rate has gone up.  I also take Pamelor.
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-09-19 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	3.5	4.5	Abilify is OK This medication was given to me first in the slightest dosage and then in very small increments upped.  That was a total pain.  If I was given too much of an increase I would shake.  However, once stabilized I seem to have no problem with this med.  It also seems to be doing it's job as far as stabilizing my mood.
abilify	Depression	2006-09-19 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	made a huge difference I have Fibromyalgia and Major Depression.  I had been in a Fibro relapse with a subsequent depressive episode that had been weighing on me like a stone for months.  I had no energy and couldn't focus.  I was taking Wellbutrin XL and had tried a couple different anti-depressants in addition to the Wellbutrin but nothing worked.  Then my doctor suggested Abilify.  I take a fairly low dose.  The doc wanted to raise it but I said &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;.  Abilify doesn't impact my Fibro symptoms, but it sure did help lift my severe depression.  Don't let the fact that it was initally approved as an anti-psychotic scare you off.  The new anti-psychotics simply modulate the same neurotransmitters that anti-depressants do--but with a different &quot;flavor&quot;. The are being use for lots of psychiatric complaints now.  I highly recommend Abilify for depression.
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-09-17 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	4.0	0.5	Felt Like I Was Fading Away When I first started using it for my Bipolar I it seemed to help almost immediately with my nighttime anxiety. I was taking it with Wellbutrin,which was stopped because the doc believed it may have been contributing to the anxiety.So I was on the Abilify alone. Thats when all hell broke loose! I couldn't eat, food repulsed me ( I wanted to lose weight but not like that.)I had NO energy, no motivation, couldn't sleep and the WORST anxiety I ever had 24 hours a day. It was a feeling of utter panic and dread from head to toe and I paced the floor for hours! It was the first time since I was diagnosed that I really felt &quot;crazy&quot; for lack of a better word.Worst of all, my doc made it seem like my reaction was rare and unusual, but reading what i have here shows that it was not.I took the semester off from college because I couldn't function. I ended up being taken off of it and was given Xanax( 1 or two 0.25mg 3 times a day) which cleared the anxiety literally in a matter of hour or two after taking the first dose. I also take a very small dose of Seroquel(25 mg), and so far, so good.God bless the people it helps because it made my life a living hell for the time I had taken it.
abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2006-09-09 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	4.0	Abilify giveth, and taketh away Update.  As I read other reviews ofthis medication I am struck by similarity of experience.  I, like some others, have felt a loss of affect. My illness is quite well controlled, but I have lost my passion (a friend said this to me). Never very happy or very sad.  Life is comfortable but without a great deal of color.  I am on a heavy regimen of medications so I will not point the finger solely at Abilify (for the good or the bad).  I just feel this is important information.Abilify was added to me regime almost four years ago. I was already on Geodon and and anti-depressant (forget which one). I was in a state of depression, paranoia, and low energy. This drug did not fix everything but it did give my energy level a boost. I find I tolerate it well and it is easy to take. I have had a tremor for some time. I think it's from the Geodon, can't be sure though.

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-09-06 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.5	Abilify is a MUST for me... I started out with 20mg, developed tremors, cut it down to 10 mg with slight tremors.  I tried to cut it down to 7.5mg but began to have &quot;intrusive thoughts&quot;.  Going back up to 10mg did away with those.  As long as I can afford to stay on this medication, I will.
abilify	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2006-09-05 00:00:00		0.0	5.0	5.0	2.0	100% ineffective Abilify is an anti-psychotic. One, there is no research that shows it is even effective for panic disorder. The only effective treatment from my personal experience with Panic Disorder is Xanax(benzo) and research shows that as well. The overuse of anti-psychotic is getting on my nerves.  Abilify did nothing for my panic disorder symptoms for obvious reasons since it is not designed for it. It is designed for psychotic symptoms as the very name suggest.

My Dr. wants that initial response without getting the side effects.  I will keep you posted.

abilify	Schizophrenia	2006-08-16 00:00:00		4.5	3.5	5.0	4.5	Following up on my earlier review. I've been on Abilify a few years now, therefore I'm in a good position to tell you how it's helped me.  It has totally wiped out my hallucinations/delusions and, along with Seroquel, has controlled my manic phases.  The only real side effect I have is a totally flat affect.  I don't feel any intense emotions about anything.  Happiness, sadness, fear, stress etc. have all been limited to moderate.  I feel nothing much more than numb most of the time.  I didn't like not having any feelings, so, along with my Pdoc, I weaned off of the Abilify only to be sent into a deep depression.  Severe enough to cost me my job and very likely, my career.  Anyway, I'm back on it and feeling much better.  Still numb, but much better than depressed and manicky.

My symptoms did not respond to Lamictal.  I do experience somnalence but hopefully with time this will resolve.  So far no weight gain.  I did initially have an increased heart rate but this has resolved.  My primary symptom is anxiety and insomnia.  Even though I have day time somnalence....the insomnia, or frequent wakening still occurs.  My overall appoval of this drug is good at considerably less than a therapeutic dose.
abilify	Asperger's Syndrome	2006-08-11 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	Excellent My son with Asperger's has been on this and I notice a huge difference in his repetitive behaviors and the obsessive thinking.  He has also lost just about all his violent behavior due to sensory overloading.  He maintains a healthy weight and sleeps well.  He was on Risperdal for awhile and he gained almost 10 pounds in a short time and was still aggresssive on it.  This has been much better.  We did try a little higher of a dose once and it produced a sedating effect.  At the 5 mg dose, he is 8 and weighs 71 pounds, he has had no ill effects.  I like this medicine and would strongly recommend it.

Most horrible month of my life. They make me unable to sleep, unable to think, and for some reason, really twitchy.

The Dr. said I might feel anxious and agitated after starting it, but so far all I've felt is GREAT !  I'm sleeping better, and I've been able to take up my daily exercise routine again.  I REALLY, REALLY hope this lasts.  The Dr. told me this med is his first line treatment for obsessive thinking - pretty common in Aspies, but it has also lifted my depression.  My psychologist recommended Abilify some time ago, and I was afraid to try it.  Now I wish I had listened.

abilify	Social phobia (Social anxiety disorder)	2006-07-13 00:00:00		3.5	3.0	2.5	3.0	pretty good      i took abilify for social anxiety after having bad luck with ssri's, my psychiatrist thought it was because i was getting wild ideas about what people were thinking (which isnt really true)the problem i have is that my brain just shuts off, and this helped with that by keeping me more alert, i stopped taking it though because i had muscle tension/pain
abilify	Depression	2006-07-07 00:00:00		2.5	1.5	3.5	2.5	So Tired..... I started on the 10 mg once a day at night.  It made me feel drowsy all day, like I was sedated.  I could barely function.  But when I tried to take a nap, I felt anxious and uneasy.  I went down to 5 mg, which helps with the drowsiness (still drowsy, but not as much), but at about 4pm, I would get suddenly very anxious.I was still really tired with the 5mg, so I'm down to 2.5 and although I am tired, I am able to function.I am not hungry, but have kept my weight pretty constant.  No other major side effects.I can't tell if the meds are working or if I am just in a state of sedation, but I do feel like I am not as rocky emotionally throughout the day.

Why they let these guys prescribe this stuff, I don't know!) I decided to continue on it and the swelling diminished to almost nothing.  I am not sure about the blurring yet but I am planning a trip to my eoye doc soon.  In combination with Lexapro it does seem to work better than what I was on prior to recent hospitalization, which was Chorimipramine (it has a more common name but I can't remember it.  Isn't that odd!)

I'm probably in the minority, and I wanted it to work b/c of the side effect profile, but it became clear quickly that this drug does not agree with me. I hope it works for others. As for atypicals, Zyprexa and Seroquel are the only two that have worked for me, and Seroquel more than Zyprexa. (Risperdal did nothing and Geodon kept me up at night and wouldn't let me wake up in the morning, w/questionable effect.)

I take Abilify, provigil and wellbutrin. The combination has done wonders for me. I have tried being on each of these drugs by themselves, but they did not seem to work as well. The side effects with abilify have been mild--I just wanted to eat carbs or chocolate for the first few weeks.

My manic episodes have now elevated to a point where I am miserable and I have an appointment today with the psychiatrist for a med checkup, and I am going to tell her that she HAS to take me off the Abilify. I can't sleep or eat and I am physically and mentally exhausted. I am teetering on the edge it feels like and I just want to sleep. I've been on this for a little over a month and it has just been winding me up more and more as time has gone by. Besides Bipolar I, I also have OCD and Acute Social Phobia so it's been a real hard time. I have lost 17 pounds in this time as well and have felt like I've been in a deep freezer. Constantly cold and wearing a coat in the house. This is crazy. Sorry to ramble....

Love it! also I take a few fish oil tabs a day for omega 3.This combination works so so so well. Love it.I wanted to die before this (even with an SSRI) and this has helped me get out and do so much.It has all kicked in and i feel great.Dont be afraid to try a few diff ones if one doesnt work.

abilify	Bipolar Disorder NOS	2006-05-06 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	5.0	4.5	Abilify has restored my life - There is hope ! After taking abilify for only a few days, I felt myself again. My old self, (silly, funny, loving, with energy, creativity, motivation) I had not felt this way since 1990's. I have taken so many medications over the years. None have compared to Abilify.  I am also taking a regimen of other medications, as many of you are.  I want to give hope to everyone that there is hope.  Also, try not to focus on your mental illness, it is only a condition that we must deal with.  It does not define who we are.  We are NOT bipolars....we are Mary or Bob, or Lamar, or whomever.  Be strong people!

The side-effects I experienced were not worth my taking it as it seemed to be counterproductive.  Instead of making me feel better about myself, I felt worse because I became constipated, had a voracious appetite and gained a lot of weight.  I was not happy at all with this med.

I was already on Geodon and and anti-depressant (forget which one). I was in a state of depression, paranoia, and low energy. This drug did not fix everything but it did give my energy level a boost. I find I tolerate it well and it is easy to take. I have had a tremor for some time. I think it's from the Geodon, can't be sure though.

(i'm @ 50 now) so far the results are great, i feel &quot;normal&quot;. i only have a little trouble remembering things, the occasional headache and too enthusiastic at night, which changed once i switched to taking meds in the morning. finally, don't get discouraged by the &quot;antipsychotic&quot; word.

The only problem was after a couple of days I started to have insomnia which I couldn't handle and a nervousness inside I couldn't quite get a handle on.  I also had a heavy heartbeat, like I shouldn't have been feeling my heartbeat like that when I was laying down.  It did make me drowsy but I can handle drowsy, can't handle insomnia though which I have now.

Its embarrassing to be poor but its better to be well and have some money in your pocket!!  Just a tip, don't be afraid to ask for samples, they got tons, trust me, they've told me!Also, on a briter note, i'm back on Abilify at 2.5 mg with propanolol to keep my heart rate steady to try to ease up on the inner restlessness and heart palpitations I guess and i'm taking Ambien for the insomnia.  The dose isn't high enough and i'm a bit irritable but slowly but surely hopefully i'll be back to the normal dose.the Ambien didn't work and I'm sad to say had to discontinue the only med so far that was working for me due to the insomnia side effect.

I started at 10mg and am on 30mg, dose set when hospitalized in January.  I developed EPS, my jaw spasmed, so the doc put me on Cogentin.  That has helped a lot.

Just on edge all the time; couldn't calm down, but not in a good way.  I have a good friend who is on it, however (also Lithium) and she appears to be doing ok.  I was getting frustrated by the time I'd tried this one, so it's possible I didn't give it long enough...

abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-04-13 00:00:00		0.0	1.0	5.0	1.0	Caused Horrible Side Effects I was prescribed this for bipolar 2 with quasi-delusional thinking, and anxiety. I used it for 6 days before stumbling back to my pdoc to get me off asap.I was super tired and groggy constantly, and I felt like it slowed my thought process. But when I tried to sleep I couldn't due to a pounding heart, trouble breathing, and a general inability to relax. It also made me very agitated, but not in a productive way. More like I was constantly on edge, feeling on the verge of a panic attack, and absolutely could not calm down. I couldn't get comfortable sitting, standing, or laying down, because of the agitation. It did absolutely nothing for my mood. If anything, my mood was worse because of the extreme agitation.I also had constipation and severely decreased appetite.To sum up my experience, this was the worst drug I have ever been on--and I've tried many of them. I couldn't even stand it long enough to let possible 'start-up' symptoms go away. I do have a low tolerance for many medications, but nothing should ever make anyone feel like this one made me feel.Now on 25mg Lamictal/day and feeling better already. :)
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-04-06 00:00:00		3.5	1.5	3.0	2.5	Great clarity but bad akisthisia The drug worked well to calm my moods and my mind, but the inner tension (akithisia) was worse than Prozac. I discontinued the med due this side effect. It wasn't essential for me to take it I just wanted see what alternatives were out there. I still think depressives, insomniacs and bipolars should steer clear of antipsychotics.

Although I have only taken the drug for two weeks, I have experienced no unpleasant side effects at all. To the contrary, I have experienced more energy (not a manic disphoric type of energy but what I believe might be normal for most people), elimination of paranoia, better sleep at night (I take my dose at bedtime), no racing thoughts, my speech and behavior have become less pressured, and my athletic performance has returned to normal as a result of having found a drug that does not make me drousy, dizzy or &quot;slowed down&quot;. I also take 1mg of Clonazepam at bedtime to aid in maintaining a normal sleep pattern. Previously, I have tried Lamictal (resulted in itching and an acne like rash on chest), Trileptal (worked great but with side effect of dizziness and a feeling of slowed response time that affected my performance as an athlete), Seroquel (caused me to feel nervous and grind my teeth) and every antidepressant out there (all of which caused me to become manic).  So far Abilify earns a gold star with me.  Of course everyone is affected differently by any given drug as a result of our unique brain chemistry, but I would suggest to give this one a try if you are not 100% satisfied with your current medication(s).  I never thought I would find a drug that was so transparent to use. Good luck to all in the search for the right coctail.
abilify	Post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)	2006-03-30 00:00:00		0.5	0.0	0.5	0.5	bad as in bad i was prescibed abilify after ending a distressing relationship. i was actually diagnosed bipolar at the time, however i believe wrongfully. anxiety, anger, depression, obsessive negative thoughts were present. i am going to classify this med under PTSD b/c that's what i feel i was dealing with. abilify was not a good choice. it was too powerful; i felt initial relief w/ the first dose, it calmed me down, but quickly knocked me out/put me to sleep and made me feel horrible the next morning &amp; the few days following. not reccommened

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-03-27 00:00:00		4.0	2.5	2.5	3.5	My son may finally have help!!!!! Although my 16 year-old son has only been taking Abilify for a short period of time, it appears to be a miracle drug.  He is taking it for Bipolar Disorder.  His outrageous aggressive behavior and sudden fits of rage seemed to be under control yesterday for the first time in years. Recently, he was court ordered to get residential treatment because he started getting into trouble with the law and refused to take medication; all I could see was him in prison off and on for the rest of his life. However, when I went to visit yesterday I could not beleive what I was seeing and hearing. For the first time in about 8 years I actually felt comfortable around him. I don't know how it will be later for him but I pray that he continues to experience the same results years from now. He actually smiled and told a joke!!!!!!
abilify	Bipolar II disorder	2006-03-26 00:00:00		4.5	3.0	5.0	4.0	Good; but the weight gain is unacceptable It works great. It took some time to get use to the drug.  It made me manic at first but settled me right down and now I like it real well.  The weight gain is a problem that I will complain about to my doctor.  I don't wan't to go up and down like this with my weight.  I take othe meds as well...but it has calmed the kindling and rapid cycling which was intolerable.

abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-03-20 00:00:00		2.5	5.0	2.5	3.5	Pretty easy It did seem to work; however I did start taking it at the same time I started taking trileptal so it's hard to tell which one was doing what. It was pretty much side effect friendly meaning there wasn't hardly any side effects at all. I have to say that was a relief.

I was very forgetful, hyper, and ate everything in sight. I had frequent headaches and my vision was affected. I have not taken any for 2 days and I still feel heavily medicated.
abilify	Depression	2006-03-18 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	0.5	1.0	Ready to quit I've been on this about a month, starting at 2.5 mg.  It didn't cause too much problems and I didn't notice a worsening of my symptoms.  At 5 mg this has caused extreme drowsiness and a slight dizziness in my eyes (effecting my vision). And I've gained about 5 pounds.  Either I will go back to 2.5 or try something new.

abilify	Depression	2006-03-15 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	4.5	Abilify for intrusive thoughts Some people with depression have problems with intrusive thoughts and memories that are distressing.  Abilify helps me shake these off.  It also gives me more mental energy for sustained concentration at work.  When an anitdepressant isn't enough, or if it starts to &quot;poop-out&quot; this could be just the thing.
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-03-15 00:00:00		3.0	0.5	5.0	2.5	Too many side-effects for me My theory on why this was effective for me as an anti-psychotic (anti-manic, really) is that basically it made me feel like I had the flu.  And on top of the flu, restless leg syndrome.  So, I didn't want to do anything (the anti-manic effect), but basically because I felt horribly sick, and yet I had to get up and pace because of the restless legs. Basically it was driving me crazy.  I was climbing out of my skin and could not concentrate whatsoever, so I had to stop.
abilify	Bipolar I disorder	2006-03-13 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.0	The switch turned on! I am bipolar 1 with mixed states, which is what Abilify is FDA approved for (mixed states).  Whether it's the histamine or the dopamine that Abilify targets (or both) all I can say is WOW where have you been all my life?  I was preparing for ECT when I decided to tritate off Seroquel and use Abilify hoping it would hold me over until shock treatments could begin. After the Seroquel was completely out of my system, literally almost overnight I felt so good, I held off on ECT and so far so good. I should note that I'm allergic to all anti-convulsants so my only recourse is the newer atypicals or ECT and I was at the end of my rope!Of course this is in addition to the other meds I take, Adderall, Buspar and Xanax, but those were on board before Abilify.  Since it's not recommended for any other type but mixed states I assume there's a good reason why?  It may have to do with the Seretonin factor since Abilify doesn't mess with it. If you're a mixed state, I'd gladly be the poster child for this drug and you just may too!  The only drawback is the cost.  A 3 month supply retails for over $1000.00 and as far as side effects, a slight headache and occasional muscle cramps are the worst of it for me. It beats the hell that is bipolar depression.

I now feel I live a normal life because of a tiny dose of this wonderful drug.  I have gained about 6 pounds but that is insignificant compared to the mood swings I used to experience.  It's spends.

I kept taking it and they got worse. After being on it for a month. I stopped taking it. The panic attacks stopped. I waited one week. This seemed IMPOSSIBLE to me. So to prove myself wrong I started taking it again. The massive panic attacks started AGAIN. I took it for another full month and had to endure the worst panic attacks I have ever had. I then stopped taking it. The panic attacks again STOPPED. I have NO idea why this drug did the OPPOSITE of what it was supposed to do,but did. I assume I am the only person out there who had this reaction to it. If there is anyone else out there, I'd love to know about it. In a funny way, having those massively intense panic attacks from the Abilify helped me overall. Now when I have a panic attack-compared to the ones I experienced then, they are NOTHING. lol Hope I am able to help someone out there with this blog.

I say that this is the happiest that I have been in years. Lately I have been able to look in the mirror and tell myself I am pretty. I wasn't able to do that before. I still get manic, but not to the extreme I was before. In the combination of the 2 drugs I seem to be holding off the hallucinations and the voices pretty good. Overall I am extremley happy that after a year of doctoring with my new Pysch, we have finally found the best meds for me for the 1st time in 14 years.

Anything that helped the GAD in the past caused a manic or depressive state.  Using Abilify in conjuction with Lamictal has made me a new person.  I no longer lay awake at night and worry about anything.  I have a normal amount of worry about things I should be worried about, but not an obsessive amount over things I should not.I started at 5 mg, went up to 10 mg and am now back to 5 mg.  It makes me a bit sleepy, but after not sleeping for 4 months, it is more than welcome.  Though 8pm seems a bit early when that's earlier than my 7-year old goes to bed.  Hoping that it'll only be a matter of time before everything evens out.

abilify	Schizoaffective disorder	2006-02-03 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	Works great, but worried about the weight. I recently switched from Risperdal 2mg to Abilify 10mg. My pdoc had me cross-taper the two medications over a two week period, and I have been on Abilify 10mg and completely off the Risperdal for a week now. So far, Abilify seems to be working very well in controlling the psychotic symptoms. The only real problem I am having so far is that Abilify doesn't seem to be as effective as the Risperdal in controlling my moods. I get upset/worked up more easily now, although not nearly as bad or as often as when I wasn't on any medication at all. With Risperdal, nothing could make me mad or upset. Everything was easy breezy, although I felt a little bit like a zombie (not emotions at all). The only reason I got off the Risperdal was because I had gained 62 pounds in a year on it. I went from 110 pounds to 172 pounds. I have read that abilify does not cause as much weight gain, so I am hoping to lose weight. However I have read all of the above responses and I see that one person did gain weight on it, so I am a little worried. Can anyone else offer their experience with weight gain/weight loss after taking Abilify?Update: I have been off of Risperdal and on just Abilify for almost three weeks now. So far I have lost 6 pounds. I hope I keep losing! I am also finding that it's starting to work better for my moods than it was in the beginning. I guess it takes awhile to really get going.Update: I have been on abilify for almost five weeks now, and have lost seven pounds. I had hoped that I would lose weight faster based on what I had lost in the first couple of weeks, but I guess seven pounds in one month isn't too bad. I forgot to mention before that although I had trouble sleeping in the beginning, that has pretty much gone away.Upadate: It has been about eight weeks since I have been off of Risperdal and on just Abilify, and I have lost ten pounds so far. That is without really exercising (I'm not working ye

Speech and language improved drastically. He initiated conversations, used eye contact, self-stim dropped way down - he wasn't constantly talking out loud to himself. His aggression level dropped to near normal. His reading skills improved. It was almost like having a typical child. The rare side-effect that hit was loss of vision. There was short periods of partial and total vision loss, which he did not let us know about until he completely lost his vision. His vision did return in several days after stopping the medication. He did still have occasional loss of vision (could see shadows) for several months before it stopped completely. He was 14 years old so he was in the middle of puberty which changes everything anyway.

Side effects were hard to handle in the beginning, particularly the nausea and drowsiness, but those go away after a week or so. One note-- ABILIFY AND EGGS DO NOT GET ALONG!!! For some reason, the drug interacts badly with eggs in my system, brining on rampant nausea and almost flu-like symptoms. Maybe not for others, but my husband and I are both on it for bipolar, and we both have the same reaction.
