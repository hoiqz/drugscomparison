Other	Clarity, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	35-44	2/22/2010 5:36:27 PM	Taken for nerve pain after a RTA and resulting whiplash and ocipital neuralgia. Nasty drug, left me wacked out and feeling stoned, not enough warnings given by doc about side effects and drove whilst first on this drug and on a high dose, very dangerous. Had to take in liquid form so could reduce dose myself as so reactive to the drug. Only take if you really really have to it makes you feel detached and out of it, and only just took the raw edges off the nerve pain, so not retrospectively worth the side effects. I would never take it again. 
Migraine Prevention	tinkerbellemmaapril, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	8/17/2010 8:00:33 PM	I was prescibed this medication for 2 reasons. For Migrane prevention and to help with my panic disorder and depression. Before I started taking this I would have up to 2 panic attacks in a day and after all of the Hospital visits for migranes and the pain pills and no results I was starting to feel helpless. I couldn't sleep, relax or deal with stressful situations without ending up in a panic attack or with a migrane. This medicine helps me sleep at night as well as decreasing my panic attacks and allowing me to go throughout the day without having to take a Zanex or any other meds. I am extremely happy with the results for the depression I do unfortunetly still get headaches but it's only been a week so with time hopefully it will help that as well.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	Koffeefreak, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	8/20/2010 9:30:38 AM	My post-traumatic stress disorder causes me to have abdominal migraines.  I take this medication at night along with Klonipin and since starting this regime I haven't had a migraine (which always brings me to the ER).It makes me really tired about an hour and half after I take it, so I always take it much earlier than the the time I plan on going to bed.  My doctor has increased my dosage from 10mg to 20mg but I have a 3 month old son and I sleep through his cries at night when I take both pills at the same time.  If I know my boyfriend is going to be home to feed him at night than I take both pills as directed and sleep for a good solid 7-8 hours without interruption.  My biggest problem was waking with horrible stomach pain and now when I wake up I feel fine.  The side effects (dizziness, drowsiness) are great for me because I take this drug before bedtime and it helps me fall asleep even with the stress disorder.  I definitely would recommend this drug to others suffering from a similar problem.

Other	Maggie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	6/16/2011 9:10:58 AM	I was prescribed 25 mg for shingles' pain, which helped immediately but I also found that I had depression and sleep deprivation that I didn't realize I even had, having been laid off of my job after 19 years.  I have not slept this deeply (lots of good dreams) nor felt so rested in the AM as I do now this med.  It IS hard to wake up in the morning and I oftenneeds lots of coffee and often take a nap but I feel so much better than I did before (I was depressed without knowing it) that I find it very helpful !  I had forgotten what it was like to feel rested in the AM, good during the day and sleep well for 8-10 hrs. at night.

I suffered for 4 months with a cluster migraine and nothing would work until I took Amitriptyline, 2 doses and no more headache!  I have to take it daily for prevention but I haven't had a migraine in over a year and if you suffer from migraines, you'll know how amazing that is!  I take it at night before bed so I sleep through most of the drowsiness but it's still hard getting out of bed in the morning.
