It caused the condition that caused extreme agitation and uncontrollable muscle movements.  I couldn't sit still literally for 5 minutes or sleep.

I was suicidal. I have noticed the minute I go below 7.5 the symptoms return. No anti-depressive, and I have tried every single one of them, has worked for me. This was the last hope and it has helped.The only draw-back is the weight gain of 10 lbs. I am not active and cannot exercise to lose it. Overall, I will continue this drug unless something better comes out.

My doctor just started me on Abilify a month ago. i'm up to 10 mg a day so far. I feel happier. Less depressed. My mood doesn't change so quickly anymore. The best part is i no longer even think about suicide. I am less anxious about everyday activities. At first it made me drowsy but it doesn't anymore. The only bad thing about it is i am becoming increasingly paranoid about dying. I'm worried this may be a side effect. Other than that i think this is a great drug. I've been on so many others, and i finally think this is the one that's going to help me get my life back.
Schizophrenia	bjr28, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	2/10/2008 7:20:01 PM	Although I feel that Zyprexa is the most efficacious anti-psychotic on the market (it just has very serious side effects, such as diabetes related to weight gain), in my opinion, Abilify is (perhaps surprisingly) a close second.  Abilify has very minimal side effects (unlike most of the other anti-psychotics); however, it didn't completely quell my symptoms - I still experienced some psychotic feelings.  This is not surprising, however, because Abilify is the newest (and &quot;weakest&quot;) anti-psychotic.  By &quot;weakest&quot; I am referring to the fact that it is only a partial dopamine agonist, which, in some cases, facilitates the manifestation of some psychotic symptoms.  However, for many people, Abilify is a highly efficacious drug.  For me, however, it just wasn't quite strong enough, so I switched to Zyprexa (which quells my psychotic symptoms, but has its own related side effects *see my Zyprexa posting*).  In sum, Abilify is a very gentle drug that is well tolerated by many people.  Given the potential side effects of other anti-psychotic drugs, I would try Abilify as my first line of defense.  Who knows?  It just might work.

I don't take more than 10mg or I feel anxious. It had me overheated, mild sunstroke in direct sunlight over 20minutes.  Higher doses (15-20 mgs) actually give me mild short term (visual and audio) hallucinations, esp. before sleep at any time of the day or night. I have gained 30 pounds during the two months that I have been on this drug though I have watched my diet carefully. It is not easy with the loss of short term memory as well. I am on a huge regimine of other drugs coinciding with this but I am aware of it's effects due to the timing of when I began treatment.

It really helps me with mood swings and anger issues, basically levels me out. The only draw back is I have gain excessive weight in this year of taking Ability along with Cymbalta. My Dr wants to cut back my doses and this gives me anxiety just thinking about that b/c this is working so well now. But everytime I'm complaining about weight gain so that's why he wants to cut back. I am obese as it is and perhaps the extra weight is causing Dr's concern with medication.

However, he stopped taking it and he has gotten severely ill again. I finally talked him into taking it again, so i am hoping he will get back to doing as well as he was while he was taking it. If anyone takes this medicine, do not stop taking it unless instructed by a doctor. We've had to start all over again. I just hope it gets in his system fast--he need it. It's a good drug, from what I've observed through my son's behavior.

I had a lot of trouble sleeping and I felt very restless.  My concentration hadn't improved but thats probably because I was only on it for a week.  According to my doctor this could have been due to the fact that I am very sensitive to the drug and the dosage was too high.  Right now I'm in the process of either getting on a different drug or lowering the dose.  Don't be afraid to take this drug just because of my experience though.  Everyone reacts differently to each drug so just because I didn't feel ok on this drug doesn't mean you won't.

Instead it became full blown Myasthenia Gravis. There followed 165 days in the hospital, countless infusions/tranfusions, three surgies to remove thymus to try and get my immune system under control. Many difficult drugs: prednisone 100 mg./imuran 400 mg./ and twelve others, Many addition side effects. I am lucky to be alive three years later. But lost my business and asset base.

These helped, but had significant weight gain with Seroquel and Depacote.  The Lithium helped alot, but suffered severe tremors.  Abilify has not helped AT ALL.  Is there not something that will help the symptoms of Bipolar disorder and PTSD without these unpleasant side affects.  I can't seem to loose the weight although I am walking about two miles per day. Abilify is as expensive as the other medications, but not helpful at all.

Hated it.  I hared my life to begin with, and this made it worse.  I couldn't stand to be touched, had no sex drive, wanted to eat constantly, was gaining weight that i fought hard to lose, was mad all the time, and I couldn't sit still.  I would even twitch in my sleep! Plus, I got headaches, and would get so lightheaded I felt like I would faint.  If it did anything to help my mood, I might-might-have been able to deal, but I felt no improvement in my mood swings, and I couldn't concentrate on anything except how crappy and crazy I felt.  Yep, it made me feel more crazy than I already was.  Don't take it.

I have noticed a lack in appetite, sometimes I have to force myself to eat. Have lost 8 pounds so far. All my other meds cause weight gain, particularly Lyrica. these dont seem to be the typical effects others are having taking it, I dont know if it has something to do with Lyrica.My doctor put meon Abilify to enhance the effects of my antidepressants, which are currently Pamelor and trazodone.Right now all I can say is, I see some areas of improvement,I welcome the increased energy and weight loss. I dont like the insomnia and the inability to stay focused.

My doctor prescribe this medication (5 mg) along with my normal does of xanax (.25 three times daily). I had been on zoloft prior to this and gained weight.I hated this medication. It made me feel horrible. I had headaches, twitching and dizziness allday long. The effects even worsened when I took Xanax, a drug that has worked for acute attacks for years.

I take Abilify along with other meds and have had a tremendously positive response.  It has removed the loss of energy that I suffered from, I feel awak and alive and energetic.  I have the energy to cook dinner--and even dinner for the freezer for the future,am happy doing chores (as happy as you can be doing chores) and overall a positive sense of being.  My heart goes out to those who have had negative side effects from Abilify---I've been there on other medication.  If you are about to try this medicine, know that some people do have positive outcomes, while others do not.  There is a weight gain, and I've started doing minor exercising.  I don't like the weight gain, but at least I feel good again.

Nothing else ever has. Helped with my depression as well. Does have the side effect of Akathisia, which is a feeling of mild dicomfort in my own skin. But this has decreased over time.  Took Cogentin for awhile and this helped.All in all I would recommend this med to someone who has tried almost everything else! The price is high as the insurance only covers 1/2 the price of $425/month!Glad I can afford it at present.

I was throwing up all the time. Had to take additional meds to sleep. Developed numbness, tingling, and extremely painful muscle spasms. Felt as if my boby was there but my mind wasn't. Couldn't comprehend anything. I could hear people talking but not absorbing anything they said. I cried all the time and I'm not the crying type.Extremly detached from reality. It was an extremly horrible experience.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	6/2/2008 7:17:28 AM	This drug SHOULD NOT be used for bipolar II!!!!!! I was a part of a clinical trial for this drug and the side effects were horrible. I had nausea, slurred speech, irritablity, severe restlessness (could not sit for more than 2min), increased manic thoughts, rapid speech/thinking, along with several other less severe side effects. Also, my depression was not helped by this drug and I had to take lexapro to control that. I also had to take something else to help me sleep and I still did not sleep for very long. I do NOT reccomend this drug for anyone dealing with bipolar II. The risks simply outweigh the benefits. Also there are many other treatments such as seroquel that, for me at least, can be much more effective. (Note: some of these effects take a bit longer to show up than others.)

Abilify turned me into a zombie, I could barely hold my eyes open.  I could not mother my own child.  In a month &amp; half I gained 25lbs, went from 120 to 145, with no change in eating patterns.  I made myself exercise to no avail.  All in all, I remained depressed and suicidal. if it helped any, I was too lazy &amp; tired to act on it.  When getting off Abilify, it took my body 8 months to return to normal, in order to lose the weight, after taking it only 1 1/2 months.  Weigh your pros and cons.

I was on it for about two years, and gained 75 pounds.  I drank more than ever on it,and picked up smoking.  Now that I've quit taking it, I have lost the weight, cut back on drinking, and quit smoking.  Been off for about a year and a half.  While my episode of schizophrenia seems to be gone, I would not take this again due to the weight gain and the overall lack of energy and motivation.  My grades have also improved, although probably due to the decrease in alcohol consumption.  Only time will tell if it has &quot;fixed&quot; the problem.

It has been wonderful for him.  He has been taking the combination of the two for almost two years now.  He lost over 45 pounds when he started taking the Abilify.  You have to take what works for you.  Abilify didn't work for my daughter.  She had MAJOR arm and neck pain.  Very severe pain!  It is not for everyone.  However, it has been a life saver for my husband and our marriage.  He is very Bipolar and a true textbook case!

We switched from seroquel after it stopped working and kept pushing him into manic states. Also, he had severe stomache issues.Anyhow, after one dosage of abilify, my son was violently ill. He bcame a zombie with his eyes rolled to the back of his head. He vomited for the next week, and started to become dystonic (VERY serious reaction)It took a week and seveal trips to the emergency room and Dr to get him back to square one. This medication was truly frightening.  BEWARE!!!

I have been diagnosed with depression w/suicidal ideations and recently with mood disorder at the very least or bi-polar at the very most. While this drug is not perfect, I am not angry as much. When you first go on it or if your dosage increases, I became anxious and needed to move around more. After being on the dosage for 3 wks, I then return to normal. I take the drug at night as it does make you sleepy.In a perfect world, I wouldn't need drugs to function but abilify is as close as I am gonna get. I advise it but you gotta stick with it through the temporary side effects.

I suffer from a sever pain condition and am disabled. So I am severly depressed. This has to work, I feel like I'm running out oif options. I'm already on Tegretol, Lamictal, Keppra, Restoril, OxyContin, Zanaflex, Percocet. As many of you know it's upsetting when your only 31 and you take over 20 pills a day.

For the last 12 years I've taken clonazepam, and they just took me off it. The last 2 months have been hell. I wasn't weened off it. The Abilify doesnt really help with the shaking or nervous tension I feel inside.They(dr.s) say I have the depressed side of bipolar. I don't know I think I want to check into accupuncture. Too many years of Dr.s and different medications that don't appear to do any thing for me. I've only been on the abilify for 1 week, I know its still new to me and I'm hoping it will kick in an start to help me.

I recently went through rehab for drug addiction. I was addicted to cocaine because I gained about 80 lbs on mainly the Abilify( however I was slightly overweight and had diabetes to start with) By the age of 16 I weighed 260 lbs at my highest weight! I am now 220, but my doctor has told me since I goto the gym minimum of 3 days a week and eat like a bird, that I will most likely lose weight off of this medication... I hope so, Being paranoid sucks, but to spend your entire teenage life hating yourself is worse in my mind.I do have depression which has been previously treated since the age of 12 and I don't really understand how this drug can be good for me since it is not even an off label use for anxeity. wish me luck.

I was on seoquel but after gaining SO much weight I was more depressed! Doc started me on this.I've only been on it a little over a week, but so far so good. However I just read that this drug too can cause weight gain!! Is there anything out there that DOESN'T cause weight gain??? A note to sugarpiee75. I too went through terrible grief after I lost my mother. I can't imagine the pain of losing a child. Hang in there, it does ease up as time passes. People would say that to me,and I didn't believe them, but it is TRUE.I'm going thru a bit of a rough time as it will be 6 years in August that I lost my mom. Hang in there,and most importantly take your meds!

I really don't remember, except I believe it was for depression or it could be bipolar disorder.  my dosage was 5mg, takeone tablet by mouth at bedtime. that is all I have on the bottle.  I would like to know why they would prescribe this medication, were they assuming depression would set in as from things like having a stroke.  I have suffered with anxiety and panic attacks for around 30 years.  help me understand if you can?  Thank Youtexjasper50@yahoo.com.

Other		1	1	1			7/26/2008 5:08:10 PM	Worst experience of my life this Abilify drug. This drug is for Mania of Bipolar disorder or Schizophrenia. I have movement disorder all over my face and body and feel like I am going to jump out of my skin. I gained a lot of weight as well. Couldn't sleep. Had racing thoughts. Found a new doctor who knows his stuff. I am now on Seroquel- thank god. a blessing. It took my NEW DOCTOR a few weeks to figure out the right dose of Seoquel for me. I no longer have the jumping out of my skin feeling. I'm calm and can think straight again. The weight is slowly coming off with a better diet and I walk. Do NOT take Abilify. It will screw you up.

I'm on 5mg of it and it really has helped me. In my diet I am including my high fiber so I do not get constipated. It is still hard to go to the bathroom. I am taking it in conjuction with Cymbalta 60mg. And my husband says I'm a changed person. I do sweat profusely though. I hate that part. But it the benefits out weigh the side effects I think I should stay with it. and Just watch what I eat.

My psychiatrist apparently did read the manufactor's prescribing instructions.  I could not afford this medication at one point in time.  10 days later,  akathisia set in.  Akathisia is one gigantic horror experience.  Then I contacted the physician explained my symptoms, for which he never ever mentioned akathisia.  This guy is nothing more than cruel.  At the second to last visit, I was complaining about not being able to get off this drug.  He replied in a very LOUD VOICE, &quot;Oh, for God's sake, you're not even on a therapeutic dose!&quot;  Iwas stunned.  Why would doctor prescribe a non-therapeutic dose?  I think I have Bipolar II not 1.  Last session, he bowed his head, using a humble voice said, &quot;I think you are right to get off Abilify.  After all,  tardive dyskinisia could have been growing, becoming more permanent.&quot;  I have been diagnosed with permanent tardive dyskinisia and akathisia by a neurologist.  Why is it that the sheriff doesn't simply make an arrest as other criminals?  I left a voice mail for him saying, &quot;Have you ever heard of a word, akathisia, just google it and then you will know the definition.  Then do you mind sending information to my home address, please?&quot;  No response.  He took 2 months to send my records to my primary care doctor when it was suppose to take 3 days according to his office staff.  There is much more to my story but my advice is NEVER, NEVER EVER TRUST ANY HEATH CARE PROVIDER FOR ANY REASON!  DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND GET A 2ND OPINION.  THE CODE OF ETHICS HAS DISAPPEAREDIN ALL PROFESSIONS.  I could write a book.

I still had voices every day, all day.  The side effects were miserable for I had tardive dyskinesia, an uncontrollable jerking arm.  I got off the medicine without anyone knowing and everything about my health improved like weight loss, etc.  Now I have to go back on and I am miserable because the medicine is totally ineffective, no better than when I was off it.

I was the 3rd patient my Dr. had put on this med and the 4th to report similar effects, one patient even ending up in ICU, then when taken off Abilify, was fine.  My Dr. immediately took me off this med and contacted the pharm. company and they denied my symptoms and the other patients symptoms as being side effects of this med. even though problems went away when taken of the med.  Can't attest to how well it works, but has really serious side effects.

By day 4 I had a great day - even went shopping BY MYSELF!! Day 5 through 2 weeks I went downhill.  I had dry mouth, sore throat, dizzy, confused, lethargic, unfocused, chest pain, slurring,cough, shaky, queasy, vomited, stomach cramps, my tongue felt like it was an inch thick, increased thirst/urination, loss of appetite, swollen nasal passages and started getting very sleepy again!!!  The chest pain was the WORST!!! I thought I was going to have a heart attack. My doctor replaced Abilify with Xanax, so if you have depression that isn't getting better you might talk with your doctor to see what is right for you if you're having ANY of the symptoms I described.  It was definitely a scary time for me.  Good Luck to you.

Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/9/2008 9:34:21 AM	I have been on alot of different meds, but this med, so far... has been working. Each day I feel more like the person I once was. Knowing I am bipolar, Dr. put me on Zoloft, and only Zoloft alone. No mood stabilizer or anything. I feel into the worst case of depression. Finally, I was put on this drug and Depakote, and I'm feeling great. I've been on this combination of meds for about one month. Getting used to Abilify was a challenge. I felt very manic. Couldn't sit still, had to move my feet and legs, and couldn't sleep at night. I was put on  med to help temporarily with sleeping problems. Now that I'm sleeping, and the meds were increased, I'm doing better, for now. Everyone needs to remember, being bipolar isn't a choice. It take alot of tries to get the correct meds, but hang in there. You will be strong, and will be back to the things that you once loved.

I'M NOT BIPOLAR OR SCHIZOPHRENIC. I WAS GIVEN THIS MED TO HELP WITH DEPRESSION AND IT MADE ME SO MUCH WORSE.  I THINK DOCTORS OUT SIDE OF PSHYCHIATRIC PRACTICE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO PRESCRIBE THIS MED.  I FELT LIKE A ZOMBIE.  I HAD CONFUSION, WAS UNABLE TO FOCUS OR CONCENTRATE.  I DID UNCHARACTERIST THINGS FOR ME,FORGETTING THINGS,LOSING WALLET AND KEYS, THESE ARE THINGS I DON'T DO. I WAS UNABLE TO WORK,UNABLE TO MAINTAIN MY HOME IN MY NORMAL FASHION.  I FELT COMPLETELY ABNORMAL, LIKE I WAS GOING TO JUMP OUT OF MY SKIN.  WHEN I WAS STANDING I WANTED TO SIT, WHEN I WAS SITTING I WANTED TO STAND.  IT WAS HORRIBLE.

It was great fun, but I spent too much money, but was extremely creative and productive, slept 3-4 hours a night, was absolutely CRAZY! I stopped it, and my psych tried me on Lamictal-that threw me into a horrible, very, very dark depression, from which I've yet to recover. I'm screwed, and want to die.

I was on a high dose and wanted to get off it. So my dr. slowly took me off it I was fine till about 4 days after I was done with abilify I noticed I was VERY fidgety and it just got worse, I felt sick I couldnt keep my face from twitching I was obvoiusly having withdrawl but really bad one, my dr. had to put me back on abilify 5mg only at bedtime but he said I may not be able to ever be takin off Abilify without being admitted to the mental ward. I cant go to the hospital! I have way to many things to do in life. So I guess I am on that and 2 other meds to help my mental illnesess. So my over all experience wasnt that great. It looked like I was a drugy looking for a hit. LOL seriously!

I like some of the effects of Ablilfy but it does make me somewhat sluggish in the mornings sometimes I have to fight myself to take my medicine.  I also take 2 cogintin at night to help with the restlessness, but am sleeping fine.  The bad fellings of takeing my medicine over weigh the feelings of sucicde and gloominess I felt before.  Sometimes you have to get worse before you can get better.

BUT that is only after many different other anti-psychotics before and trying to find the correct dosage.....  so important!!  Was all the way to max at 30mg and had symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, sent to see neurologist twice, then lowered to 20mg, then at 10mg where I have been stable at for over 3y with little reoccurance of manic swings, voices, hallucinations or depressive suicidal idealation, ect.  Also take Prozac, Colodipine, and Remeron to make my strange cocktail......  took almost 1y to figure correct amount.  Insist on low dosage at first, then titrate up slowly due to real symptomatic reactions like unvoluntary shaking and body movements!!  Warn your doctors about these REAL side effects.

This seems to have worked  quite well for me except the Abilify made me experience restless leg syndrome horribly and gain over 50 lbs. in a year.  I receive treatment with a pain treatment center for back and hip issues and cannot include restless leg problems as well with the excessive weight gain.  I plan to get off the Abilify because of the ease of weight gain.  Depression has been under control for quite some time now.  Wish me luck.  Topomax is suppose to help with weight loss, not with Abilify.  I've never taken a medication that has caused such weight gain.  Good luck to all and to me.

My doctor added Abilify, starting with a small dose, working up to 10mg/day.  After about 5-6 weeks, I could really feel the difference.  I could get out of bed in the morning again, wasn't so lethargic and morose, and had a positive attitude again, where before the Abilify I had begun to feel that it &quot;just wasn't worth it&quot; and giving up on all the hard work I'd done to get into remission in the first place.  I am no longer depressed, and we're going to switch out the Zyprexa I currently take with Abilify.

It has made his mood very much worse and he is crying and yelling all the time. Since starting this medication he cannot let his brother or sister touch him. If they get even a little close to him he screams and runs away. He acts childlike and cries all the time. He has started showering 3 times a day. I believe that Abilify has made my sons symptoms alot worse and will be calling his doctors office as soon as it opens. Please do not let your child use this medication. I will update later after the use of abilify to let everyone know if taking him off helped.

These 3 drugs combined has been a lifesaver to me &amp; to my family.  I've not had a manic episode since being on this combo of drugs.  The only side effect I've had is weight gain but, I'll take that instead of making myself &amp; family suffer with those horrible maniac episodes I used to have.  I wish my insurance would cover this medicine because it's a lifesaver &amp; also making us poor, very expensive.  But, I'm finially able to enjoy life &amp; to be there for my wife &amp; kids.

Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	TragicallyUninformed, 35-44 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	1	4	1		35-44	11/16/2008 11:09:45 PM	At 14 our son began taking Concerta for ADHD. At 16 our son was diagnosed as Bipolar and began taking Trileptal. At the age of 17 Abilify was added. After taking Abilify along with Trileptal and Concerta for several months the dosage of Abilify was increased from 5mg to 10mg.  Sadly within 36 hours (Friday pm to Sunday am) he committed suicide.   After the tragedy had occurred two people came forward to tell us that he had complained that his medication was making him feel unstable. In retrospect we recall that there was a noticeable increase in volatility within just 24 hours.  The event that triggered suicide occurred 36 hours after the increase, when he wrecked his car.  When he arrived home after wrecking his car it was apparent that he was not himself. He was extremely agitated and irrational and within 10 minutes had taken his life.  Although we were taken aback by the increase in mood swings, we did not associate his behavior with the increase of his medication.  I believe this tragedy may have been avoided if the Dr. prescribing this med had clearly informed us of the warning signs associated with the increase in dosage.  When we notified the Dr. of the tragedy his response was shock and disbelief.  He stated that he believed our son was &quot;doing so well&quot;.  It seems apparent to me that the doctor had become comfortable in his Dr/Patient relationship with our son and therefore may have minimized the warnings and risks associated with Abilify when taken by teens. My intention is not to place blame but rather to highlight the need for better communication between Dr's and both patients and parents.  Warning signs and side effects should be clearly stated each time there is a change/increase regardless of the length of time the patient has been taking the medication.

Tried a bunch of those this time and they were useless or made things worse. Lamictal and Provigil combo &quot;raised the floor&quot; for me so the depths were not as bad, but it took Abilify on top of those to just eliminate it altogether.I take 5 mg daily. My only complaints are that I have trouble sleeping after 3 AM and it makes me get up to pee like 5 times a night. I may switch from PM to AM dosing since I pee all day anyway from HCTZ for blood pressure! I get very mild restlessness  2 hours after dosing for an hour or two then it passes.Love this stuff!!! No sedation or irritability which other meds gave me even when they eliminated depression.

I have quit depakote and serequel for terrible side effects.  I just cant do this again. I read the &quot;who should not take this&quot; and it clearly states that I shouldn't.  Do psychiatrists not talk with your primary care dr's.  I was ok on prozac.  It just reached its peak and wouldn't work anymore, same w/ celexa, zoloft, paxil, effexor and everything else.  The symptoms I am trying to overcome seem to become worse with these mood stabalizers, worse if you have an eating disorder.  PLEASE, ANYONE WITH ADVICE.

It has has caused my testes and penis to Shrink to the point intercourse is not unlikely an option anymore. Because of this I have become increasingly Depresed. I have sinced stopped taking this medicine with no problems for two month now. I regret my Doctors decision for prescribing this in the first place since long term effects were not known at that time.

So far I have no awful side effects.  What I do notice is that my thoughts are NOT constantly racing through my head, also don't have so many negative thoughts racing through my head, my appetite has decreased (I used to do &quot;emotional eating&quot;) but I do feel tired NOT energetic just calmer and tired.  I got a couple of headaches but I just starting taking it so maybe my body just needs to adjust to it. I also take Ritalin and Klonopin.

The complaint I have is serious loss of memory.  I don't know whether this is due to this drug, Lamictal or depression itself.  My loss of memory is affecting my performance at work-it is both short- and long-term.  I am 50 years old, not old enough for this to be due solely to my age.

I tried it a couple weeks ago but quit cuz it made my body ache.  Now I am also on Cogentin and I have been having some spells of confusion and now chest hurts( could be a pulled muscle)  But I am sort of a hyprochondriac so I am really freaking out about some of these side effects and probablly then causing myself an anxiety attack.  Anyway my head feels sort of better but I am wonder if these side effects will go away?  I was a meth addict for 14 years and have been clean for 2.  Sometimes I kinda feel almost high from this or the cogentin I don't know but I don't know if I should ride this out or get of it.

I've ben bipolar for most of my adult life.  In the past I have been on Paxil, Lexapro, and Cymbalta. The first two worked ok, but only for my depression, and the Cymbalta gave me really bad Manix episodes. The Abilify smooths everything together. It's been 3 months or so and I'm on 5mg I'm really looking to have it increaded, cause it does not seem to be working as well as it was.  The only bad thing baout it is that when I first started taking it I was told to take it at 6pm and it made me a upset stomach, so i have to take it right before i go to bed.

No problems with those symptoms that come with the diagnosis.  Pill is tiny so swallowing it is easy.  Abilify helps me feel balanced and normal compared to what I had been going through.  It helps me sleep, too, without the knockout punch of some antipsychotics I've taken.  I've been on many other antipsychotics, including some from the older class (typicals), and this one is the best so far.

I must take mine in the AM as it works as a definite &quot;pick me up&quot;.  It has really helped with my treatment resistant depression and my paranoia that the seroquel was not quite addressing fully.  Also no more audible hallucinations for the moment either.  I am sleeping better at night and getting up at a decent hour and actually feel like being productive.  I hope it continues :-)

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	25-34	12/22/2008 10:47:12 AM	I was always happy as I remember, but I also felt that I was &quot;not right&quot;. I never really told anyone because they would just brush it off, or tell me that I'm imagining things when I tried.  When I was 24 everything finally caught up to me. Attempted suicide, but someone found me and took me to the hospital. Obviously I was saved.  I was put on Zyprexa 7.5mg. It worked good.  But I gained 40 lbs in less than two months!  I was then switched to Abilify but honestly it did nothing for me.  I felt like I wasn't even taking anything. So I was switched to Geodon, which made me very very ill, throwing up for over a month before I switched Dr.'s because mine didn't believe that the vomiting was a side effect. I lost all of the weight I gained, which was great! But it was just horrible living off freeze pops and in and out of the hospital many many times for I.V's. for dehydration. I am now on Seroquel 400mg. Works great but I'm back up to the 40lb gain again. I have a Dr. appt coming up soon in which I will discuss alternatives.  But all in all, Abilify might be a great solution to other people so don't take my word for it about not working.  It just wasn't the right one for me.

Please let this combo work. I've been looking for the right combo that works and doesnt make me gain pound after pound. I have other health issues too that i cannot keep gaining weight for(spinal problems and copd). I'll take any input seriously , PLEASE

It helped a lot, but adding Abilify brought my mood up to a whole new level. I haven't felt this good in years. I am only on 2.5 mg/day. (I cut a 5 mg pill in half)..and have been on the drug only about ten days. I feel a huge difference already. I had trouble getting out of bed and starting my day before, now I am up early and anxious to get the day going, excited about life again. I feel more energetic than I have in years.A couple of downsides I have noticed: It seems like most reviews say that the drug makes them tired, but I seem to be having the opposite issue, insomnia. I now take it in the morning, and hopefully that will help. I am also experiencing constipation, which is one of the possible side effects. As far as I am concerned though, it's all worth it, this drug is a wonder drug for me!

I have only been on abilify for two weeks, but I have already noticed a major improvement.  I also take other meds for depression and anxiety (lexapro, Remeron,&amp;  Clonazapam), but none seemed to work until my Dr. added Abilify.  I am 44 and feel the best I have felt in 20 years.  I now wake up by 7:00a.m. and am excited about starting the new day, despite the fact I was laid off from work on 12/2/08.  My wife use to have to beg and then literally pull me out of bed.

It controlled my mania and suicidal thoughts.  After a while I started getting side effects that were hard to deal with.  I would sweat profusley, become tired to the point that I would go to bed very early in the evening or fall asleep at a friend's house.  Then I began to have uncontrolable lip movement called tardive dyskinesia.  It was very noticiable and was the last straw.  Although this medication saved my life, I am now functioning on Stavzor with much more bearable side effects.

Last week I visited with a new doctor who prescribed me 15 mg abilify and 50 mg trazadone.  Yay, I already feel better overall except not sleeping as well as I should.  The medication is helpful so far with little side effects at this writing.  I was prescribed a coctail of topomax, zyprexa, depakote, lamictal; then on lithium and gabapitin; then on seroquel with depakote and zyprexa. My anxiety level was horrible.  Feeling less anxious now with the abilify and trazadone.  I'm hopeful but having this disorder is a nightmare even between episodes.  I hope you find what works for you.

Started taking it two weeks ago to augment the Zoloft and Remeron I am currently taking.  Even though I was taking the maximum dosage of Zoloft I was easily overwhelmed by routine daily tasks and spent periods of up to five days in bed sleeping most of the day and had lost all desire and interest in family activities.  day.Since starting the drug my motivation level has increased, I have been able to cope with the stresses of daily life and have stopped isolating myself from my family.The only side effect I experienced was nausea, but that went away after two days. have been minimal.The only downside of the drug is its price, which may be a barrier for many people.  For me it is money well spent in terms of improving my quality of life.

Took Abilify for 1 month and my condition deteriorated daily.  Had every bad side effect: anxiety, extreme restlessness, inability to lay still, insomnia, extreme fatigue, sore and tender muscles, carpal tunnel in my right arm, crying spells, no motivation, extremely tired, but unable to sleep.  This was a really horrible experience.  I went off Abilify and most of the side effects were gone within 48 hours.  I only take Cymbalta now and things have calmed down.

I been on Celexa for about 3 years and recently added Abilify (w/o any side effects). I've been fighting this major depression for almost 18 years.  Abilify is the first sign of real hope I've found in all these years. Beginning to laugh more, dance more and just overall feel better.  But, I still lack energy and would love it if the Abilify would do about triple of what it's done so far.  Maybe, I would truly find my old self again.  I miss her a great deal.  And, my 14 year old daughter has never met her, only seen this person on old home videos.  Good luck to all of you out there who have been suffering needlessly.  AJ

Feeling a lot better than before. What has worked for me is to sense yourself out. Do what other people do. After some time your body adjusts. I'm not liking the negative results here. My doctor told me that it breaks the depression signals and allows you to adjust to the surroundings. I spent a summer just sleeping, yes sleeping. There's more to that, so go and have fun but make yourself realize that you are having fun! If not find out why

I developed a tremor in my left hand that was never there before - and now I have neuropathy, in other words permanent damage from it.  I sit here and cry thinking of this, and wondering just how much damage these other psychotropics do.  I am so frustrated I would throw the whole messy cocktail down the sink, but now I'm old enough to realize there is *something* in that nauseating mix that keeps me relatively sane.  Bottom line is that I will avoid this med at all costs.  I'm not only speaking from my looong experience of dealing with bipolar I and meds for it, but from friends who are being treated for bipolar and depression.

Good results in the beginning for mild depression. I took a super colon clenz, then drank alcohol for New Years, next day became moderately depressed and have been for a month and a half.

I started taking it in August of 2007.  I literally lost 6 months of my life.  This medication caused me to have memory lapses, nausea, vomiting, weight gain, acne, blurry vision, no libido &amp; so much more that I don't have enough room to list.  The final straw was when I tried to sleep at night I felt as though I was being shocked by electricity in my whole body.  The uncontrollable sweating was horrible.  No deodarant would handle it.  The last straw was when my hands started to have uncontrollable movements that prevented me from working!  I stopped it cold turkey!  Took another 6 months to feel like a human being again with a clear mind!  Steer clear of this medication!  Of course it's only my experience but it helps one person then I've shared my story for a good reason.

I talked to the druggist and took her back to 5 mg and she seems better emotionally because of the lower dosage.

We have tried several different doses to find the right one.  She had rapid weight gain,&quot;fuzzy brain&quot;, and just not our girl with 7 and 10 mg.  She had been taking 5 mg for about four months. Her weight leveled off but she did have periodic nose bleeds, hot flushes.  She started making a funny noise when talking so we reduced her dose to 2.5 mg.  The noise went away but her ability to cope with her anger and impluse control was not there.  We went back to 5 mg and now we are dealing with nose bleeds, hot flushes, and increased appetite.  We just started giving her 3.75 mg to see if that is the magic dose.  It has been a rollercoaster ride and I worry about the affects on her overall health. We have scheduled a Dr.'s appointment to have her thoroughly checked out. It is comforting to see her have impluse control which has allowed her to develop friendships and have a more positive attitude.

I stay on maintenance dose of Prozac. Since menopause began several years ago I have suffered increasing depressive episodes. I recently started on 2 mg Abilify to increase to 5 mg after 3 days. Noticed a positive difference imediately. The first 3 days were awesome! I was able to concentrate, remember things,and I felt a burst of energy. I accomphised more in 1 day than the entire previous month! I actually went right to sleep at night and sleep well. I felt happy and SERENE. I had never felt that before. I increased to 5 mg and now I can't sleep and I feel hyper. My husband noticed a tremor in my hand and I feel nauseous right after taking. I will call my Doc first thing Monday to talk about decreasing back to 2 mg. At 2 mg it was a wonder drug for me. Perhaps some problems others have experienced are due to the dosage. We are all different and it may take some time to find what works, i.e., provides the benefit w/out nasty side effects. In spite of some of my concerns I am so grateful that I have a chance at a normal life. Good luck to all.

It was very effective in managing my depressive episodes and the pill was easy to take. However, I gained over 30 pounds (over 1/4 my original weight) in two years. I also had the extrapyramidal side effect oculogyric crisis, in which I lost control of my eyes for periods of time and would look as far up as my eyes would go, regardless of what action I was doing. This was eventually balanced out with benztropine.I ceased treatment due to the incredible amount of weight gain.

But he had an extreme reaction that looked just like a seziure.  It was a dystonic reaction where the muscles in your body stiffen and spasm..he was even unable to close his mouth.  It was the scariest thing we had been through.  It took staying in the hospital on meds to flush his system to get the 'spasms' to stop.  I don't know if there is a way to tell if you are 'allergic' to this med or not..but this was a hard way to find out for a 10 year old.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	sheshela, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/25/2009 1:07:34 AM	I recently started taking Abilify (15 mg) in conjunction with my Prozac (20mg).  I was experiencing anxiety, poor concentration, and manic behavior when taking the prozac alone so my psychiatrist prescribed Abilify to &quot;help the Prozac work better&quot;.  I honestly feel great!  I have only been taking it for a couple weeks, but I do feel that it has greatly improved my concentration, leveled out my moods, and alleviated my anxiety.  I have a lot of energy also.  One downfall to Abilify is that it doesn't have a generic yet, so it costs a lot more for me to use.  Another downfall to Abilify is that it makes me VERY sleepy.  I take it at 10:00pm and I am asleep by 10:30 and i sleep a full 8 hours.  I tend to be fairly sensitive to medications that make people sleepy and this medication is no exception.  Overall, I am highly satisfied with this medication.

I chose 4 stars for satisfaction only because of some of the side effects that I'm having. I feel nausea throughout the day and the first week it decreased my appetite a lot. I haven't noticed any weight gain yet. I would definitely recommend this drug to people with rapid cycling bipolar disorder. But don't just rely on these reviews because it works differently on every person.

Any side effects (slight nausea, some nervousness w/ insomnia) have all resolved. I am now able to take in the morning w/ no problem and feel great all day. Lots of energy and motivation. Have not gained weight. Perhaps my success is due to the low dose, i.e., just enough to be effective w/out causing side effects. I can't speak to other diagnoses but as additional medication to treat depression this has been my miracle drug. If you have a good medical practioner don't be afraid to try this medication. Good luck to all!

It took me a couple years for the side effects to get so bad I had to find something else.  Peristent weight gain, drowsiness at inappropriate times/places, tardive dyskinesia (read about it if you are on this drug, mine was very noticable and has since reveresed), nausea and vomiting.  Controls symptoms of the disorder, but moniter side effects closely.

My doctor added Abilify to my medications (Wellbutrin SR, Xanax, Topamax [for migraine disorder] and Nexium [for GERD]). I felt no change the first few days, but didn't expect to because he started me on the lowest dosage. After a couple days I started feeling general achiness like the flu was coming on. By day four I was curled up in a ball crying because every bone and muscle in my body ached and I could hardly move. My boyfriend grabbed all my prescriptions and the pharmacy leaflets and took me to the ER. Good thing he read the leaflet for Abilify while I was being triaged and pointed out the list of &quot;rare but dangerous&quot; side effects that should prompt you to &quot;seek immediate medical attention&quot; to avoid &quot;life threatening and/or permanent injury&quot;. The ER staff had no idea what to do for me, so they started an IV, flushed two bags of saline through me, and ran labs to make sure my liver function was still normal. I was there a total of three hours, and all they said was don't take any more of the Abilify and come back if you get worse. And they reminded me to call my Doctor. It took nearly a week for my body to return to normal, and it was the most painful week I can remember having.

I am on my second day so far...so I think that it's a little too soon to tell whether it works or not for me.  To those of you who are having troubles with sleeping at night, you should talk to your doctor and see if he/she will prescribe you some Ambien or Lunesta.  I was already taking Ambien prior to starting the Abilify, so I haven't had ANY PROBLEMS with sleeping at night.  However, I have had some really nagging nausea...so much to the point that I don't want to get out of bed for fear that I will &quot;spew&quot; everywhere.  I am hoping that this is only a temporary side effect and that it will go away fairly soon.  I really would like to see if this medication works for me...

The last one ended when my girlfriends ex murdered their children.  That's when it all came crashing in on me. The Cymbalta and Wellbutrin weren't keeping up.  Emotional all the time, didn't want to be alive. Have been on Abilify (2 mg) for a week and feel like a new man.  No nausea or tiredness.  It's been a wonder drug for me.

After about a month, he began to enter a manic phase--the first one he ever had.  Not able to sleep, not able to concentrate, he stopped going to work and lost his job with his insurance coverage.  Now he is in the hospital and they are still giving him the Abilify. He is still having hallucinations, voices and trouble sleeping.  Has anyone else became manic after taking this drug?

I still get tension in my jaw area and it gives me headaches. I take Trazodone to help me sleep, but still have trouble. After reading some of these other reviews I'm going to cut the dosage down from 10mg to 5mg and see how that works. 
Other	mortalcity, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	4/17/2009 11:17:17 PM	To begin, I have no physical health problems and am a normal weight. I took only one low dose of Abilify before going to bed and I fell asleep within minutes. It was very hard to wake up, and when I did I felt like I had been hit by a bus. For the next two days my chest was pounding, I had a fever, every cell in my body was in pain, I could barely move, couldn't eat, I would burst out in tears for no reason, and I had to miss two days of work because of it. I also had strong suicidal urges for those couple of days (and never did before until that one pill). If I took one more pill I would have either died from pain or killed myself. I don't suggest anybody take this medication based on the horror I went through, but then again everybody's body reacts differently.

To minimize tiredness in the morning, I take lexapro about an hour before going to bed. This  morning/night placement of these two drugs gives me mental stability without the tiredness that lexapro normally gives me. Taking lexapro in the morning makes me tired and yawning all day.

I have been taking 5mg for six weeks and have just increased to 10mg starting today. My doctor added Wellbutrin SR 150mg to help with the depression. Abilify does well for the manic episodes but did not help the depression. I hope this increased dosage of Abilify and Wellbutrin does the trick.

My dr. added 2.5 mg ABILIFY and within weeks I was able to have very good orgasms as well as feeling happier and calmer overall.Sadly, I was also starving 24/7 and so have stopped taking it after a ten lb. weight gain. I will really miss it :(

I also take Xanax ( 1 mg) 4 x daily, Soma, 3-4 daily, Percocets 4 daily. I have been through alot of stress over the past 18 months, and tried to comment suicide. My daughter was in the car wreck with me that has disabled me for life, and she has her arotic &amp; mitral valve replaced. Things for my daughter have not gotten better. Just last year she  had over 80 blood transfusions, among other things. The car wreck left me with 7 broken ribs, two budgling discs, torn ligaments, and a broken hand that no one ever noticed.I am completely disabled in my left arm &amp; hand. I had a collasped lung, and a big hole in my arm.  Zoloft worked for awhile, then my Dr. added Abilify and I feel its made a word of difference. I now look forward to doing things. I haven't done anything but  go to the doctors, hospitals with my daughter. The rest of the days I stayed in my Pjs and in a dark room and cried all the time. I still can't run a marathron, and have to be VERY careful with daily activeties. I'm not going to say that I'm never depressed, because that would be a lie, but life is truely getting better. I have no insurance for myself, so I can't get the medical attention I need for my discs and neuropothy and broken hand. I wish everyone the best, give the medicine a chance.
Bipolar Disorder in Remission	clk, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/4/2009 9:59:09 PM	Although it took a few months to adjust the dosage of my Abilify, I have been more than satisfied with how the medication has helped to control my bipolar disorder.  After living with severe mood swings for all of my adult life, I was finally diagnosed and prescribed Abilify almost three years ago.  It is like living a different life.  I am practically symptom-free!  I have not had a major manic episode during this time.  My psychiatrist has adjusted my dosage twice during depressive episodes, but overall my moods have been VERY stable!!  I also take .25 mg of Klonopin at night to relieve anxiety and help me sleep.  Getting a good night's rest has also proven to be very helpful in controlling my bipolar symptoms.  I talk to my doctor regularly, and I am SO very thankful that he has me on Abilify!  It has changed my life!

I gained a lot of weight while on them.  I was also extremely tired all the time and sleep between 12-16 hours a day.  I went off of both about 16 months ago, I have lost almost 40lbs. and no longer have to sleep so much.  I was lucky that my bipolar depression has gone into remission around the time I went off the meds.  Since going off I have noticed some weird symptems since being off of it, but my doctors can't find anything wrong.

I am hesitant to take because of all the reports of weight gain.  I cannot afford to gain weight so I was wondered what dosages those of you who had weight gain were taking.  Please ANY feedback would be greatly appreciated. Also, when you went off the Abilify, did the weight come off?  Thank you !!!!

Each time hoping it will work better with whatever additional meds I have to tak in conjunction with it. In short Abilify has had extremely negative effects on me. Anxiety, fear, panic, confussion, restlesness just to name a few. I asume poison has similar effects on the mind and body. I have begged to be taken off of it but my Dr. refusses. Im sure Abilify must work for some people but I doubt many of them live productive lives as this medicine truly makes a zombie out of ones personality. I hope the FDA bans this med someday. This stuff is bad news.

Sometimes less is more. This combo for major depression has worked. I have been on Lexapro for 4 weeks and on Abilify for 6 months. For the 1st week I felt worse but stuck with it. The only adverse side effect now from Lexapro is the anorgasmia. My doctor has prescribed 150 MG of Wellbutrin XL (Eon Labs-Buproprion XL 150mg) to counter the anorgasmia but I have only been on it for 1 day so we will see if it helps. I am praying it helps without adverse side effects.

It helps my moods from cycling as much or as dramatically as they once did.  I have also noticed that Abilify helps rid me of some depressive symptoms.  Most importantly, it helps with some severe anxiety I have, associated with the case of Bipolar I that I have.  Several of my symptoms were gone within two weeks of starting Abilify, which was a pretty dramatic and much needed change!  I may have gained some weight while taking Abilify, but it could also be attributed to lifestyle or other medications.  I also know that my body &quot;can't handle&quot; a higher dose than 10 mgs or I get mild tremors.  Overall though, the positive effects definitely outweigh the negative.

Have to consult with doctor on course of action without drug.

Abilify has helped significantly. I can control my behaviors and thoughts better and am able to keep things under control. I do have the leg cramps with the abilify but my doctor prescibed congentin to deal with that and it's working very well. I tried to go off abilify when the leg cramps began, but my doctor put me back on because the benefits are outweighing the side-effects.

I have also experienced some muscle stiffness, I am also on several other medications for my Bipolar Disorder so this may be the cause of my side effects. My advice is to take carefully and report any and all side effects to your doctor immediatly.

I often wake my husband at 3am and ask him if it's time to get up!Before Ability I dreaded getting out of bed in the morning and slept until 9 - 10am. I also take Depakote and Klonipin, Seroquel and Ambien to help me sleep. I dont like taking so many drugs, but I CANNOT sleep withot them and I feel great during the day. Has anyone had the problem of waking in the middle of the night ready to  get up? Also, the Seroquel and Abilify have made me gain 10 pounds in 2 months! Has anyone else experienced weight gain? I HATE the weight gain! I am going to try to wean myself off the Seroquel and see if the weight gain will slow down. Someone Help Me!!!

All it does is cause severe bouts of insomnia. This drug does not work at all. and the insomnia lasts for up to two weeks after having stopped it. Think twice before taking it. I wish i had.
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	some guy, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	19-24	7/15/2009 7:40:51 PM	I've been taking abilify for the past 8 months (approximately).  The effects of this medicine for me are varied.  Currently on 5 mg, thinking about going up to 10 or 20 mg.  I'll start with the cons first: Ive gained about 40-50 pounds eating the same amount of food I've been eating for years, I sleep for 10-14 hours a night, it hasn't stopped my depression, I'm less talkative to my significant other, I'm more stir-crazy than normal (I have jittery legs, feel some tension in my calves and shin), I lose my balance once in a while, my memory seems to be effected (more short term), I get hot much easier than normal (notwithstanding I live in AZ), I get little joy our of sex and masturbation, it's difficult to become happy, and I'm more apathetic than I was when I was manic and unmedicated.  The pros are as follow: manic episodes are much rarer, I'm able to control my emotions (when I have them) more than I could, and I've not cut myself for the time I've been taking this medication.  Honestly, there are a lot of cons to this medication, at least in my experience, even though I'm thinking about going to a higher dose because it seems like I'm building up a tolerance.  I still have outbursts at work and home, albeit much lessened (like I'll get pissed off at an incompetent client and will start swearing like a sailor once they're off the phone).  I still get overwhelmed by life, though not as much as before, though I find it hard to become motivated as well.  I guess I'll move to a higher dose, hopefully I don't keep gaining weight (and yes I go to the gym 3-4 days a week).  I don't think I'd really recommend this medication without trying something else first or without taking something else in conjunction to alleviate these negative side effects.  Granted, I'm just one person, however these side effects are pretty serious to me.  I'm like a slug now, with very little personality.  Moreover, I still have racing thoughts and suicidal impulses.  Those haven't gone away.

He also takes Wellbutrin for concentration. I think his dose needs to be changed. He doesnt seem to be my son. He is what I would like him to be but its not letting him be himself. Its changing his personality. Hopefully a lesser dose will allow him to get his personality back and still have positive changes.

Other	Hope Springs Eternal, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/22/2009 10:35:01 AM	So far Abilify seems to be the best option for me.  I was taking Effexor with success in improved mood, but found my motivation and energy level were depleted.  Same thing with Lexapro.  I am much more energetic and &quot;feel like myself again&quot; in terms of energy and motivation, which improves my mood.  I do feel a little irritable still, but am only on my second week of treatment and still hope to see improvement there.  I do feel dizzy/lightheaded at times, which is a little disorienting but not serious enough for me to be too bothered by it. Because the other I was experiencing negative side effects with Lexapro and Effexor, my prescriber suggested trying the Abilify alone to treat my depression.  Like I said, so far I am happy with it.

Worse than that, however, was worrying about everything and fears I never had before.  He lowered the Abilify to 10 mg and I am already noticing less worry and fear.
Manic Phase of Manic-Depression	Deb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/23/2009 2:04:32 PM	I know that I have only started taking abilify one dose, but I can already tell a difference.  I was diagnosed as bipolar I in November 08 at the age of 48.  After taking pretty much everything except lithium, I was FAIRLY stable taking 125mg lamictal and .50mg clonazepam with 5mg ambien to sleep.  However, I kept getting more and more hypomanic, with hypersexual tendencies.  My psych added 2.5mg abilify yesterday when I told her I was getting no better, only worse.  The only thing I have noticed today is some drowsiness.  I am to increase dosage to 5mg in 4 days.  If it has adverse side effects I will drop back down to 2.5mg.  After so many months of feeling totally not normal, it is very very refreshing to feel pretty much like I used to feel before the bp diagnosis.  I have gained weight before starting the abilify, about 15 lbs., but I needed it.  I could not eat or sleep for so many months when taking all the other meds that I looked horrible.  I do not need to gain anymore, however, so I am going to do my best to keep the eating under control.  My hope, and my docs, is if the abilify works, to get rid of the lamictal totally and only use the clonopin as needed.  That would be SO wonderful.  Taking all these different drugs when you are already &quot;messed up in the head&quot; is a nightmare.  I have very little depression with the bp, so I cannot speak for the effects on that, but my mania seems to be less today than since over a year ago. I will keep posting here on progress.

So I stopped using it 2 weeks ago and am having some terrible effects going off it.  I feel physically sick like I have the flu.  Mentally I am having the same suicidal thoughts I had before and feel impulsive enough to act on them.  I have attempted to kill myself twice before going on this drug and now feel just as bad.  Not bad enough to go back on it, tho.  I went off this drug without dr suppervision which I would NOT recommend to anyone.  I hope this feeling passes soon.  I don't want to be another statistic.
Other	sarahbn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	7/28/2009 1:47:15 PM	My two sons with Asperger's Syndrome are on Abilify.  (Yes, I know this is off-label and it's dangerous to give psych meds to kids, but they are under top-notch medical supervision and I thought it worth the risk; read on to know why.)  It has made a huge difference in their lives.Before the meds, one son was full of rage and constantly hurting others.  The other had no idea where his body was and once tried to jump out a second story window without even knowing it.  They were stimming all the time.  We tried other treatments like sensory diets and social stories, but it was too difficult to keep up with the needs of both of them plus my other two children who have multiple food allergies.  Our home was a living hell and I was totally exhausted.Since they've been on the meds, they've been calm long enough to start learning how to deal with their Asperger's and they've made lots of progress.  The older child has learned social skills and now has a circle of friends.  The younger child has moved from violent rage to merely saying he hates us, and is learning how to recognize when he's getting mad and withdraw to his room.The only thing I don't like about giving Abilify to my boys is that I have to cut the pills in halves and quarters to get the right dose for them.  It would be really nice if they came in juvenile-size doses.  But that's a petty complaint; I'm just grateful the drug is available in the first place.  It has transformed my sons' lives.

She also prescribed this medication without seeing my son in her office. My son had a bad reaction to the drug this evening and it almost caused him to have seizures. His body move uncontrolably, face, arms, legs, every where. His eyes were rolling in the back of his head and he was in a tramendous amount of pain. These side affects can become permenant. The ER doctor this evening told me to stop this medication. So if your child is under the age of 10 I highly recommend that you do not give this medication, it is very hard on your heart to watch your child go through what I watched mine go through tonight!

I take it for my Bi-Polar disorder and as an adjunct to Cymbalta for my depression. I take 30 mg. per day. It has greatly increased my functioning. When I go off of it, I go back to being much less functional. I had no side effects from this medication. It was easy to ramp up to 30 mg. If your doctor recommends this medication don't hesitate as you might be pleasantly surprised at the good it can do.

However, I started it on the weekend and stayed with it. Three days, the side effects went away. It has only been a week later and I have an increse in energy and a lift in depression. People around me have noticed I have been happier. I plan to increase (under doctors orders) to 1mg and eventually 2.5mg/day. I like this medication.

I was in a mixed state, and this was a good choice, especially since my dosage was increased to 30 mg/day. I feel that I am finally reaching the point of being more stablized and centered. I don't have any side effects whatsoever, although the first couple of weeks I was a little sleepy. I got over that quickly, and am now so happy I found this drug. I recommend asking your doctor about it if you are having a hard time with side effects from the drugs you are on, or not improving from them.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	Jamie, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	8/14/2009 7:27:22 PM	I have been taking Effexor for years, and, from time to time a secondary med. In the last two years, Effexor has been upped to 375mg/day, but I have had several life-altering events, and depression remained severe.  My doc started me on abilify about six weeks ago, and the difference is AMAZING. Gradually, depressed thoughts (to which I am severely genetically predisposed)have disappeared! Now, no matter where I look in the corners of my mind, there isn't one scrap of depression visible.  It is truly lifesaving.  I have been doing very poorly for very, very long time. Now I laugh and laugh - which I've missed more than almost anything - but it is very natural ... nothing manic about it.  I am also diabetic (type 2-on insulin) and so far the Abilify has caused no problem.  The ONLY drawback may be that I get too BIG to fit through the doors in my house!  It may be a &quot;small&quot; price to pay, but still ...I hope this helps -- I would LOVE knowing others have been as helped by this med as I have.  God Bless all.  Jamie in No. Cal.

For all of you who are on PRISTIQ - you all need your heads re-examined! Abilify is not the problem. My doctor had me on Pristiq for about one month, and I thought I was going to either put my fist through the wall or someone's face. I was so angry, frustrated, and deeply depressed. My doctor said it was the Pristiq and he even said this medicine should be taken off the market! He put me on Abilify with Prozac and Lamictal, and I have already noticed a difference after one week. Pristiq will make you crazy!
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	8/16/2009 6:53:21 AM	Abilify has been a life saver for me. I have tried other drugs in this class, but i have had the best results with the abilify. I do get leg pains so I'm on cogentin to combat the issues. The only think I don't like about it is that once I take it I seem to crave sugars and carbs. So, I've gained some weight. I think with a little willpower I can lose the weight I've gained.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/18/2009 10:15:13 AM	I have been on Abilify for about 5 months now.  I had my third depressive episode in six years.  I couldn't believe it was happening again.  I have been on Lexapro for those six years.  The first episode I went on Lexapro, the second was because I tried going off of it.  This third time was triggered by a tough break up.  However, I was shocked that I could become that horribly depressed while on medication.  That was the first time I started seeing a psychiatrist.  I can't recommend it more!  I have realized that primary care physicians don't have the knowledge to treat people with more complex situation like me.  My depression was so horrible.  I was on Depakote for a month, which stabilized me, but I gained way too much weight.  Abilify seems like just the right thing for me.  I feel so much better.  My doctor is suspecting that I could have Bipolar II now based on what I went through.  I am weaning off the Lexapro and only take 5mg.  I take only 2mg of Abilify at night.  That is amazing to me that someone soooo depressed could be okay on just a little medication.  That is why it has been so vital to for me to meet with the psychiatrist.  My PC physician just had me on such a high dosage of the Lex and I had insomnia for two years and times of horrible anxiety and panic attacks which I didn't know what cased by that dosage of Lexapro.  I wanted to write something positive about the mental health field and the drugs that we take on here.  I think sometimes these boards draw in people that just want to complain and tell horror stories.  Yes sometimes there are horror stories but don't give up.  Drugs really work.  If I just took a hand full of vitamins and exercised more I would probably be dead now.  Keep at it!  I know trying different things is frustrating, but you can't stop fighting for yourself.  I am a mental health victory.  If Abilify stops working like Lexapro, then I will start fighting to find something again.

I had ataxia, poor balance, muscle twitches and tremors just to name a few. The side-effects in my case far out-weighed the benefits.
Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	8/22/2009 2:59:37 AM	At first, I slept much less than normal, 5-6 hours.  But eventually, I adjusted and began to sleep a lot, as that was a bad habit for me before taking the drug to begin with.  I was very motivated the first month or so, up early, going to the all the time, but that is when it went downhill.  My anxiety, which was a problem to begin wit, increased dramatically.  By the end of the usage, I could barely leave the house.  Nothing was exciting because I was always dwelling on everything that could and might possibly happen.  It was a horrendous experience at the end.  I have switched to Luvox, which may or may not be helping--as it is very early.  And I can tell my anxiety is better by just being off Abilify.  Plus, it is ridiculously expensive, and my insurance was about to discontinue paying for it because of a limit on funds for prescriptions.

It has decreased the edginess and irritability of the hypomanic states, but I have the worst insomnia and passing anxiety of my LIFE on this medication. I can't remember the last time I got more than 3 hours of sleep at night. This med has made it nearly impossible to function.

It also has caused loss of sensation and the ability to grasp things properly with my hands. For these reasons I have decided to discontinue use of this drug.

I noticed the change almost instally with minimal side effects. they all went away with time. I have been on abilify for 3 months and has worked great. Also take effexor. Good combo for major depression. If the cost was a little cheaper that would be good but you cant put a price tag on goood health so take if it can help nevermind the cost.

Have had chronic dysthymia punctuated by major depressive episodes for 30+ years, even though I've tried many different anti-depressants. My psy-doc finally got the worst symptoms under control with a &quot;cocktail&quot; of Wellbutrin, Zoloft &amp; Ativan, but I still struggled w/ unremitting dysthymia.

I can't believe the difference in side effects of the reviewsers. I am not lying when I say this medication is helping me so far, the side effects have been minimum. To the person who commented on the med not helping enough - ask your doc about an increase in dosage. You are only on 2 mg and I started out on 20mg. I had to go down to 15 mg because I felt too tired. The 15 mg with other meds (Effexor, Neuorontin, etc.) is much better. I am hoping that the med continues to help after being on so many over the years.

I have also noticed slight leg cramping. The extra energy I feel is regurgitated into anxiety.  I know I have things to do, but just sit and fret over them instead of getting them done. I can no longer sleep at night, nor take a nap.  It is not good for someone with GAD along with depression.

I have noticed a decrease in my need for Xanax, my mood is better, I feel calm and no problems concentrating.  My legs are restless and sleep is broken, my vision is also somewhat worse.  But I am happy with how it works with my depression.

The problem with this (or any) medication does in NO way mean it may not work well for another. I REFUSE to take a medication who has weight gain in the top 3 of side effects. That is not worth it to me to gain anymore than 10lbs and even that is pushing it. Sorry, I am hard wired like that. Trust me Ive tried to change my thinking on weight.. My diagnosis is bipolar 1 rapid cycling and much of my life has been very chaotic. I am 38 and hoped it would have mellowed out a lot more, it has some. My current cocktail is 300mg Lamictal, 150 Wellbutrin, 750 of depakote, 25mg seroquel and now (for 1 wk) 2mg of abilify. I feel really antsy and am annoying me self a little bit. I wondered why my sleep was sucking past few days (abil might explain it) so i added a bit more seroquel and clonipin when necc. Do not recommend someone chging up meds and does willy nilly. For me I have been doing it for 25yrs and go w/ the flow of what helps me. Good luck to everyone.
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	just too sensative, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	13-18	10/6/2009 12:26:43 AM	My son is 17 and diagnosed bipolar and has adhd. After taking 3 dosed of abilify his jaw began to clinch so tightly I could hear his teeth grinding together and he couldnt stop. Then all of a sudden his mouth opened very wide and he couldnt close it. His tongue actually twisted inside of his mouth and he had no control over it. He couldnt speak during this but said later that the pain and spasms in his jaw muscles were terrible. He was in extreme physical and emotional distress. When I took him to the E.R. they said he had a dystonic reaction to the abilify, which is in the phenothiazipine family of meds. He was told to never take anything in that family again. After a heavy dose of benadryl in an i.v. He acted like nothing ever happened..Im glad it works so well for some people, but it looks like its back to the drawing board for us. It was such a bad experience that he really doesnt want to take anything at this point. Some people are just very sensitive to certain meds. He had a very strange reation several years ago after starting resperdol where his head turned all the way to the right side and he couldnt move it..same deal, we went to the ER, Got Benadryl, and he was fine...Hopefully one day we can can find something that will work for him without the reaction. 
Other		1	1	1			10/6/2009 7:46:36 AM	Cost/Benefit: Cost too high, benefits 0! **My Doc prescribed it as a substitute for Lorazepam. **Abilify causes very uncomfortable anxiety, affects thoughts . . . what was I talking about? . . . I then need to take lorazepam!I can't hold on to thoughts, talking to others leaves them and me totally confusion - they know something is &quot;wrong&quot;. They assume I on some kind of street drug and stop talking with me - and begin to gossip. Why is it so hard to find good meds for our brains?

I had no motivation and stayed in bed most of the day. After switching from the Respirdal to Abilify (5mg/day), I have never felt better. After only 5 days, I started getting up in the morning and have re-gained my motivation. This has literally been a life-saver for me. While I did suffer from insomnia at first, I now take 100mg of Trazadone to help me sleep. This has been the only drug I have taken that has made a difference.

I have gone through so much in my life in the last 2 years, that I needed help from a pschologist. He put me on 3 mg xanax and 15mg lexapro, I saw him last week and he put me on abilify. So far I can function a little better with little side affects. Vision a little blurred, but I am over 50, so my eyes might be troublesome to begin with. I am on the lowest dose of abilify, and hope that my anxiety and nightmares and anxiety subsides a little bit. I do have a lot of faith in my doctor. He does care and is willing to help me. I have gone through some much trauma, 3 family deaths within a year, a divorce of 29 years, the loss of a home, the loss of a car, the half loss of my retirement. It all came crashing down, and you know I never wanted to take my life. I know there is hope so maybe abilify will help me. Nice posts. Nice comments. I know it does not work for everyone, but my doc has faith and is willing to help me.

This led to instability in work and living space, as well as relationships and health.  I decided to go back on meds, and take 1500 depakote ER at night for racing thoughts and hypomania.  But it made me depressed and I still felt overwhelmed and anxious.Abilify gave me the worst side effects, but I am thrilled with it.  I take 10mg in the morning.  Nothing has worked as well on my mixed-state depression without making me a total zombie.  All other anti psychotics and anti anxieties I've tried either haven't been helpful enough or have zonked me out so I can't work.  This one made me very sick, I threw up for a few days and got chills and aggitated states.  But after sticking it out, I feel calmer and better and clearer than I have in my whole life.If you have issues with mixed states, don't write this one off because it sounds scary or the side effects are bad.  I would definitely say its at least worth considering!  I am really really glad I went with my gut feeling and tried this medicine despite its bad reputation.

I'm on 5mg (titrated up from 2 for 4 weeks). I do notice some weight gain though...cravings for sweets much more than usual and I don't feel full nearly as quickly as I used to. This worries me because I've read about the huge weight gain some people have. I'd rather be fat &amp; happy than thin and miserable (I'm a big girl already), but I don't want to go to extremes and become diabetic.

However, I do not like the weight gain, increased anxiety, and increased insomnia.  The cost is prohibitive.  Why can't there be one drug instead of taking 4 others?

Abilify for two weeks now after years on 2 mg. Risperdal daily. I feel WILD--most definitely not pleasant: can't sleep; odd, throbbing headaches; much-increased generalized anxiety; racing thoughts, the works... Have not noticed weight gain as yet though I did gain quite a bit on Risperdal. The fact that I was up at 4:00 a.m. this morning and have just read about 150 reviews of this drug in less than 10 minutes ought to tell you something... I imagine it would be difficult to remain depressed on this drug; I feel like I've just been shot out of a cannon and makes my manic episodes feel very tame by comparison. Caveat emptor...

I actually wake up early and don't nap during the day.  I use Lunesta for sleep. I am a little jumpy/shifty at times.  The productivity is the most positive side effect for me. I feel pretty good so far, but I am worried about weight gain.  I started taking the med and have worked out just about every day to every other day.  I even programmed my ipod for the first time in 2 years.  And organized my closet.  It feels good to be motivated to work out whereas before not so much.  I'll stay on it for a while.  But I am on a low dose in addition to the Prozac.

I have taken many, many, anti-depressants. Most would work a while, then stop, necessitating going to another. My latest is Lexapro.  I am also taking Lamictal to smooth out the edges (signs of bipolar II). I take Xanax for anxiety and Ambien CR to help me sleep. One day I woke up and there was dead silence in my head, whereas there's usually some kind of noise or static. It was unnerving! Talked to my shrink, he gave me Abilify, at first 2 mg per night, then after my telling him it was doing NOTHING, he increased it to 10 mg per night. Haven't really been on it long enough to judge. Was fairly happy with drug combination until this Abilify, even though it's very easy to take. Price is A FACTOR:  Both Lexapro and Abilify cost $100 each. Lamictal costs $50, but at least I do have a good insurance. My mother is paying for all the medications at the current time, which helps me out enormously, while I pay off my credit cards. When they are paid off, I will resume paying for my own meds.

The overall experience has been 10fold much better than the alternative. He used to be so angry all the time. I hated waking him in the mornings, school for him was a war zone. He has improved at school with learning and listening. The bad effects he does have is even though it causes a VERY deep sleep for him he still has night terrors. He has went from 2mg, to 3mg, to now 5mg. For a year I had been paying $89 a month (for a 30 day supply while he took a pill and half) from our local pharmacy. I called our BCBS and Walmart, Walgreens, and HyVee offers a 90 day programs that allows me to pay $100. MUCH better. The medication has worked for my child who has been diagnosed with ADD with explosive behavior.

It has made me a bit nauseous, and my mouth has a metallic taste. I've been a little jumpy as well. It seems to make me sleep better/deeper.I will update again after a couple of weeks.

Other	emkgemini, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	11/26/2009 3:34:13 AM	I recently started taking this drug at 5mg for 1 week. Experienced extreme tiredness and slight uncomfortable feeling in the stomach. Along with just a weird doped up feeling. After the first week the dose was upped to 10 mg. I now only experience slight tiredness. The butterfly in my stomach and the doped up feeling have gone. I feel more like I'm in a very mild hypomania..no depression. I'm hoping this is how it will remain as it's very pleasant. And just like with marijuana I kind of get the munchies (or how i remember it) It is just a matter of telling yourself you've had enough to eat and are not ACTUALLY in need of food. The only thing that I would like to see dissapear is my libido. If anything I'm more hypersexual than before. And with a spouse that consistantly isn't interested it leads to depression. But that's for another drug another time I suppose.

However, a few days ago I had an horrific headache with numbness and tingling to my face, fingers and foot.  I wound up in the emergency room and had an MRI of my head.  Nothing found as far as a stroke.  So I guess unrelated to Abilify.

It makes me rational and more calm if I'm aggitated. I would recommend a low dose, especially if you are on other medications. It seems to work pretty well with eliminating problems: focusing, depressed mood. While other medications have sometimes worsened my problems, Abilify has really helped me to make progress. I think that the way it works makes it more effective.

Many other things, drugs, conditions etc can cause decreased WBCs, including viruses. Your physician should be following this effect closely. I haven't been on this med long enough to tell whether it helps me.

His reactions to other medications led us to try Abilify and to question ADHD as his sole diagnosis. This medicine has been a god send for my son who is 8 years old. 2.5 mg a day of Abilify is all the medication he takes. It has made him more able to interact with other children and form and maintain friendships. He is much less reactive and irritable and is happy at school and doesn't complain about it anymore. The only down side so far is some weight gain. We have to work extra hard to get in plenty of physical activity and make healthy food choices to offset the effects of the medicine. Not the end of the world and so far managable. Things are not perfect but I would say they are 80% better for him on this medication and we are thankful everyday.

The doc added Abilify 3 weeks ago and I have notice a significant improvement. I realize that I have only been on it a short time though.  I also take 200 mgs of Trazadone for sleep.  I've actually noticed a decrese in my appitite (lost 10 pounds). If I get up too quickly I do get dizzy.  While I think that it is sometimes helpful to read other peoples review it's important to know we are all different and we are frequently taking other meds.  I took Serequil for 3 months and gained 30 pounds but slept like a baby. I guess that the MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO IS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD DOCTOR, FOLLOW THEIR DIRECTIONS, REPORT SYMPTOMS AND SIDE EFFECTS AS WELL AS ALL OTHER MEDS -OVER THE COUNTER, SUPPLEMENTS ETC, GIVE YOUR MEDS AND TIME TO SEE HOW THEY HELP OR DON'T HELP TO TREAT YOUR SYMPTOMS.  aBILIFY SEEMS TO HAVE HELPED ME SO FAR.

The veteran clinic added abilify to prozac lamictal and Ativan.  While taking abilify the depressive state diminished greatly.  They have me at 2.5 mg which is a pain because I have to cut a 5mg pill in half.  It's not very big so this is a challenge. The only side effect that I seem to be having is I will wake up at night stay up about 2 hours then go back to sleep.

I feel a lot more happy, and much less anxious about everything.  i also take 30 mg of celexa, which was recently reduced from 50 mg because of paradoxical effects.  i started feeling a lot of depersonalization that would not go away, even with klonopin.  after 7 days on abilify, i don't even think about it anymore. so far so good.  and no scary side effects.  i do think i've been eating more than usual though.  i'll have to keep an eye on that.  i was initially scared to take this med, but i'm really glad that i did.  i will update how i feel after a month of use.

I have terrible joint and muscle pain from the Abilify. It blows my mind how bad it can be at times, along with neuropathic numbness and tingling at times. I was managing my BP1 with cognitive behavioral tools and xanax for episodic agitation, because I didn't want to be on any kind of daily head meds, but after a manic epidsode that went on for days and days and crashed into full blown psychosis, I crawled back to my Doc horrified and willing to do whatever it took to never ever feel that way again. All around, Abilify has made me feel GENTLE. There is no other way to describe it. I feel easy-going, compassionate, hopeful... but also utterly undriven. My house has gone to hell, and I'm just not bothered. I have a disabling writers block (this is how I make my living, peeps), and I just feel like, oh well... it'll clear up. I have no sense of urgency.  I'm kind and loving and patient with everyone in my life, but I can't deal with the constant physical pain and the total lack of give-a-sh*t. When I have stopped taking it for a few days to &quot;just see,&quot; the physical pain resolves, and I'm able to feel angry again, but I feel like the crazy rages are out there waiting for me. My blood sugar is through the roof, so I can't see worth a damn and I'm peeing all the time. I love feeling so fearless and gentle, but I don't think I can stay on this wonder drug. The physical side effects are too great.  I could deal with the lack of motivation, but I can't change the physical issues.  Such a shame.

He has been taking it for four years, beginning at age 10.  Shortly after starting, I noticed he developed a vocal tic (throat clearing).  He has since developed other motor tics.  Rather than change his medication, his doctor has prescribed quanfacine (a blood pressure med for the  most part) to help with the tics.  So far, no luck.  I am without doubt that the Abilify has caused the tics and my fear is that they will become permanent.  My college-age daughter took a small dose to supplement Wellbutrin and was  pleased with the results generally.  However, it caused her to hyper-focus.  It does this as well to my son.

It has worked wonders on my mood, energy, and overall happiness.  I'm also on 20mg of prozac.  I would recommend this to anyone having depression issues.  One thing negative is I can't stop eating but I just need to learn some self control when it comes to food.  Overall I wouldn't give the medicine up for a little weight gain.

Removes a lot of the 'foggyness' previously experienced. I was on Abilify for months and requested to be taken off this medication because of &quot;do not overheat yourself&quot; warning, and I have developed a overly sweating problem.  I was off Ability for several months and the lack of focus returned as did the foggy thinking. It did not affect my sweating problem. I am now back on Abilify with good results.

Before having this added to my Zoloft, I cried almost constantly and often had feelings of suicide(in the passive sense).  I feel more alive, have less bad thoughts, has helped me with my anxiety and has motivated me and given me a new lease on life! Also, I am not so fearful of things like I used to be. The only problem is I don't get as much sleep as I used to but all things considered, I am willing to deal with this and hope this goes away in time.

Adding Abilify seemed to help within days. Not out of the 'dark' yet, but actually can see the light.Downside: Constipation and gas. at 45 I have never had a problem in this arena. My wife says it seems like I am 'about to explode', but I think that is the 'fidgetiness' side-effect...as I don't feel like I am about to blow-up over anything. Mostly, has lifted my mood. I needed that.

I take lexapro 40mgs a day,klonopin 1mg a day, xanax 6mg a day. The lexapro worked for about 2-3 yrs the most of any drug, when it started waning my dr.put  me on abilify 10mgs a day, only side effect so far is sleeping  less with more energy, i even had to start taking it in the morning because it  kept me up, thats a good thing when you sleep 16hrs a day sometimes, but i have noticed some blurred vision during the afternoon, not bad though. I'm going to keep taking it for awhile and see,I've got nothing to lose!!!!

I lost 17 pounds, have a spotless apartment, but can't sit down for long, nor sleep for very long.  I then discovered Rescue Remedy a liquid herb that takes the edge off and helps sleep longer than a couple of hours. Drops under your tongue on in your water and you might be able to get a full 8 hrs of sleep, like I now do. I highly recommend this to all.

I liked that it made me feel better for the depression. However, it did make me where it was difficult to concentrate. I had blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and terrible stomach cramps. My doc told me to quit taking it. It was doing more harm than good. This drug (2 mg) was too strong for me. I used it to treat MDD. I am glad this drug does help some people, but not me.

Bipolar Disorder in Remission	Happy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/6/2010 6:11:23 AM	Abilify is a miracle drug.  In 15 years trying all sorts of bi-polar meds, I've never really been stable.  Today, I am stable, don't have mood swings at all, can think clearer and am not depressed or manic.  It has promoted an overall sense of wellbeing.  I no longer have panic attacks either and got off Klonapin.  I feel much more involved in everyday life and my relationships have greatly improved as a result.  I was suicidal before taking Abilify and it has turned me around 180 degrees.  I love life today.  It's no longer and uphill battle.

It has always been hard because one antipsychotic is not enough for the severity of my condition. I also take Trilafon (Perphenazine) but these two combined have worked wonders! :)I rarely halucinate and have come to terms with reality, my condition, and m regrets of failed friendships, etcetera. It helps with (lamictal included) on wicked severe mood swings, help with depression, and my libido. :)The wifey likes that one! :)I would highly recommend it or risperdal (also took in the past). Anyways yea its a good med for me, not everyone I'm sure but I'm also sure it helps a lot of people too!

Other	drsean, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	3	Male	35-44	2/7/2010 12:58:33 PM	As a physician I feel that this med is potentially a very good medication. Based upon my specialty, I do not prescribe it, but I will say that it is important for patients to be aware that Abilify was grouped with many other atypical anti-psychotics and given a black box warning about potentially common and significant side efects (Especially severe elavations od blood glucose/potential development of type 2 Diabetes, rapid weight gain, and a host of undesirable side-effects).However, recent clinical research indicates that this drug may be far safer than the others it has been &quot;grouped with&quot; (i.e. Zyprexa, Geodon ; And by no means am I stating that the benefits of the above mentioned drugs do not significantly outway the risks).Abilify is different, apparently acting primarily not only within the dopaminergic system, but specifically within the &quot;D2 ans D3&quot; sunsystems, exhibiting both inhibitory as well as stimulatory effects.Because I have always believed that many depressive disorders can be linked to the dopaminergic system, yet we keep hammering away at the Seretonergic and Norandronergic neurotransmitter systems, this drug may not only proove helpful to some, but more significantly may lead towards far more future research into the dopaminergic system and perhaps breakthroughs in the treatment of depressive disorders.

Lower or exterminate libido (at least in my case).  I know my Doc. is trying anything that might work but we are throwing spaghetti against the wall to see if it sticks.  Abilify has not worked to aleviate depression symtoms as advertised, in my anacdotal case. And I think it's to dangerous to risk. That is the opinion I would give others with a similar condition to mine.

It has been very effective for me. I noticed a difference within the first week. I am no longer hurting myself and no longer have an interest in it, which is a miracle in itself. My moods are a lot more stable even on the 5mg dose. I am interested in the things I used to like again, and I feel more active and motivated.

I feel better emotionally because I was going through a major phase when I started this.  But I feel anxious, and I am constantly hungry which is very odd for me.  Biggest thing was I felt like a bobblehead.  I had to hold my neck most of the time because I felt like it was just going to fall over on my shoulders.  Overall, this drug was ok, worked for manic, didn't like side effects.

I No longer need regular bloodwork done and the potential danger to my kidneys is no longer an immediate concern.  Abilify does a much better job at controlling my symtoms and I feel better when I can take it. My insurance will not longer pay for Abilify and it cost too much for me to afford on my income.  I'm trying to find help with getting this mediciine again on a permanent basis.

So dr. put her back to 2.5 mg, We see Dr. tomorrow to see what other medicine they will place her on or will they keep her on this one?

Abilify was added to prozac and I've felt great. The fog has been lifted and I have more energy. I haven't had a good night sleep, and gained 14 lbs in a little over a month. I might go off of it because of those two reasons. I hope that part gets better.

I've tried other drugs to treat the bipolar, but it is a strong illness and does not want to leave me be. Abilify has been the best so far, and helps me fight away the bipolar so I can function and live my life.Side effects have been neck and jaw pain. Took cogentin for it until it went away. Pain was quite bad at one point, but the benefits of clear thinking far outweighed that pain.

The drug was fast-acting (meaning I felt better in less than a week) but I am unfortunately having to stop it due to 2 side effects.  It causes insomnia (which I read about here) although for those new to the drug, taking it at *night* instead of in the morning helps a *lot* to curb the insomnia.  However, my major complaint is constipation.  I have never had such a problem in my entire life--Miralax, milk of magnesia, even prescription constipation medication was not working and I have been resorting to suppositories each and every day for two weeks to manage this.  This is on top of only 3-4h of sleep each night.  It is to the point where the side effects are worse than the benefit I am receiving.  It is a shame b/c the drug has helped me mentally but for new users, please be aware that the side effects *may* severely affect your quality of life. :(

I don't know what to do next, it's scary to feel this way. I'll talk to the doctor but wanted to warn people to be careful while driving and pay attention to your mood, my moods worsened and I want to try another medication or go back on wellbutrin instead. I also feel itchey, so maybe there is an allergy to this drug. I'm not satisfied.

I do feel better and am more interested in cleaning etc., however, at the cost of gaining weight?  I'm not sure I like that payoff.  I would think if I was more active, I wouldn't have gained the weight I have.  I am also not sleeping that great, wake up really early in the am.  Atleast its quiet in the house.

I've been taking it for about a year now. I have also started taking Lithium at the same time to help with my mood swings. I have noticed a great deal of snacking that has started and has lead to about 20lbs of extra weight. The medications work great together but the side effect of weight gain is causing a deep depression all over again. Don't know which medication is causing the weight gain being i started them both at the same time. But both medications have side effects of weight gain which is the down fall.

Before the abilify nothing seemed to work for the OCD and anxiety.  Adding the 5mg of Abilify really seemed to cut down on the anxiety and the OCD tendencies.  About the only side effect I have noticed is weight gain but that is par for the course with any of these drugs.

I have been on both Lexipro and Wellbutrin for a couple of years to treat my depression.  Both helped considerably, but I still had residual symptoms of depression, and I was still, for lack of a better way to describe it, only operating at 50% my normal self.  I saw the commercials on TV and I asked my psychiatrist if I could try Abilify.  He put me on a trial, and within 2 weeks, I felt my old self again.  I no longer feel depressed - and I'm actually feeling cheerful - something I've not felt in a few years.  My work performance has improved remarkably, which is good, because I was slowly digging a hole for myself there.  While I have a way to go there, I'm actually catching up, rather than falling farther behind.But here is the kicker: For many years, I've suffered from Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS).  My RLS got considerably worse when I went on anti-depressants.  I've been taking Mirapex, which helps some, but it just makes it milder, it doesn't get rid of it.  Within a week of going on Abilfy, my RLS is GONE.  For the first time in 30 years, I can sleep without my legs waking me up several times a night, or preventing me from going to sleep.

As others have noted, I have noticed weight-gain &amp; only 4 hrs. sleep per night, BUT it is worth it.The only downside is that my insurance won't cover this medication.  So, after 6 weeks of samples, I have stopped the medication.  My depression is as bad as ever.  This is a great disappointment for me and my family.  I am hopeful that my Doctor will help me fight my insurance company to get back on to the Abilify.
Additional Medications to Treat Depression	anonymous, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/30/2010 6:26:04 PM	To start off, I am a firm believer that every medicine can have different affects on different people.  I was prescribed Ambilify at the lowest dose made (I can't remember how many mg). I do not know how or why this drug did this but within a week I was having suicidal tendencies. I would think about how I would do it and had to force myself to not act on my thoughts. I remember just laying down and being not scared of dying and hoping that something bad happened to me so I wouldn't live. I am still in awe that a medicine actually did this to me. Very scary experience.

Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	kelam710, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	6/5/2010 12:00:07 PM	I started Abilify about 3 weeks ago and immediately began noticing side effects I didn't like. The shaking and tremors I already get from lithium got worse. I felt jittery and tired at the same time (not good when you really need/want to sleep). I think the worse side effects are the weakness and feeling like it's hard to catch my breath. So this morning I didn't take it and it's only been around 5 hours but I am feeling a difference. So my next appointment with my psychiatrist I'm going to ask for something different to address the issues with my Bi-polar disorder/Borderline Personality Disorder that haven't been addressed with my other meds (Lithium, Paxil, Lamictal. I'm also on Trazadone but that's for sleep.) I'm not going to say I don't recommend this as someone else might have a different experience because it did indeed help my symptoms but the side effects just were not worth it.

I have some intolerable side effects: insomnia (5-6 hours sleep/night), constipation, and pounding and rapid heartbeat.  I also developed such a bad sinus infection that my lymph nodes all the way from the back of my neck into my head are infected- causes much pain.  My primary care physician wants me off this medicine ASAP. I find it difficult to get an emergency appt. with my prescribing ARNP.  Abilify has been effective in stopping racing thoughts; however, the side effects are dangerous and I am stopping the medicine.  I read on the &quot;side effects&quot; list that acute sinus infections and rapid heartbeat are severe symptoms.  I wouldn't recommend this medicine to anyone who is sensitive to medications.  I've also gained 10 pounds in 3 weeks.

Haven't felt this good EVER.  However, I am rapidly gaining weight despite dieting and exercising.  I also cannot sleep.  As far as the drug working for depression, it is a miracle drug.  I just can't tolerate the weight gain and sleeplessness.  Will be looking for something else.

It truly was a wonderful combination. I was happier, and nicer, than I'd been in years. Major problem: I developed Parkinson symptoms..Falling, tripping up and down stairs, unsteady on my feet, shuffling walk, mild tremor in both hands, and restless leg syndrome. These symptoms developed gradually. At first, I didn't even notice them, until it peaked almost overnight.I'm off the abilify and the zoloft for two months now; and am happy to report these symptoms are 99% gone, just a little wobbley at times. Tomorrow I will begin a medicine called Savella. It's an SNRI Rx for fibromyalgia (which I've suffered with for years)AND it is also used for depression..&quot;two birds w/one stone&quot; hopefully. I hope you find this review helpful; and will be on the lookout for the symptoms I've described. I miss what I called my &quot;be nice&quot; pill; and am so thankful my side effects were not permanent!

My license plate bulb was burned out. A previous person following me into town was an officer from a neighboring town and when I fumbled with my cell phone, I crossed the yellow line and I'm sure it looked like someone impared but guess what? He was wrong. I was not drinking anything but a cherry coke, so he radioed ahead and when the city police officer pulled me over, I could tell he was confused. Anyway, I broke down. I had just started taking that ablify so now I'm scared of it. My whole life has been turned upside down because of what one person assumed and then of course my reaction. It was my first manic breakdown that bad. I didn't get violent or touch anyone, it was that I said something out of the way to the officer and now I'm facing 18 months to 3 years in prison. I'll loose my license ,my house and if that happens, probably my marriage. I need mental health, not a jail cell.  Southwestern Indiana Area

Gained 15-20 lbs, which makes you more depressed.   Still sleep all day (although sideaffect is insomnia).  Throat starting getting sore and had allergy-like symptoms.  Went up to 10 mg and sideaffects were too much for not feeling much better, it was like my head &quot;dried up&quot; - nose was always dry, throat hurt - even the ear wax was non-existant!  Switched to Saphris and sideaffects (except for the weight gain) are disappearing and I feel better.

I gained close to 100lbs in 6 months. I was horrified. At that time there was no connection to this med and weight gain.  I told my cardiologist and he stopped the abilify.  In less than 8 months I had lost 50 lbs.  Another 45 lbs after that and though the medicine worked very well, for me the weight gain was unbearable.

I hated this medication, it did not work at all for me. I was depressed, my speech was slurred, I wasnt myself at all, i wanted to curl up and die, i felt so helpless. It was horrible I will never try it again. I am now on prozac, i think that antidepressants are best for bipolar, especially if you have more depressive episodes over manic, like most people do.

After a couple days I did feel better, less anxious and less depressed, however, the insomnia was too much to tolerate. I only slept for about 4 hours a night. Also, the inner sense of restlessness was too much to tolerate. I just felt like a machine that would not turn off. I could not sit still and I did not like the feeling. I only took this medicine for about 6 days. Oh and, I almost fell over when I found out how much this drug cost before insurance!!! The makers of this drug should be ashamed!!! I am glad I didn't like this medicine because I would not have wanted to put that kind of money in those greedy pharmacudical people's pockets.

I fell into an abyss of depression, one which i have never experienced before, i had to go back on the abilify and taper myself off for a month. even then i was having a continous panic attack with heart pounding, no eating for 4-5 days, severe sense of lonliness, guilt, and poor self-worth. It was absolutely miserable that lasted for about 6-10 days. I have family support, but needed to see a psychiatrist (still waiting for visit). Be very cautious going on this med. it's great for a couple weeks, but very exhausting.

On Abilify he could not sleep, it caused tremors so severe that could not write name, two gran mal seizures and complete disorientation.  He was on Abilify for three months.  He discontinued use after his gran mal seizures. Three months later stange spots showed in the on a CT scan. About 9 months later a radiologist noticed a shadow below his liver.  Further testing showed he had pancreatic cancer.  My husband died in March 2010.

Her moods can range from suicidal to super excited and talkative (at home only).  A combination of Abilify 2mg and Prozac 5 mg daily has eliminated all symptoms.  The problem?  She has gone from 75 lbs to 110 lbs in 10 months! Exercising is not reversing it. I tried stopping the meds for 1 month to help her lose the weight but she has cried daily and is miserable.  What's a mother to do?  I wish there was an answer to the weight gain. It's a miracle drug, yet the weight gain is horrible.  There aren't many meds out there to help a child.  Help!

My phychiatrist recommended ECT which I agreed to. While waiting for ECT I suggested to my psychiatrist to try Abilify which he did. Abilify has really helped my depression. I start on 4mg and he tapered me up to 15mg. 15mg was too much, I felt like a zombie. So I have been taking 7.5 and that seems like a good doseage for me.

So, then was tapered to 2.5mg.  Within 2 weeks, my depression totally lifted.  I felt &quot;normal&quot; again.  Unfortunately, I couldn't handle some of the side effects.  I gained around 5 lbs in the first month!  I also had more energy, but then had insomnia and had to take another pill to get to sleep.  I finally stopped taking abilify due to the side effects.  If you can tolerate some of the side effects, I would recommend this drug.  It truly made me feel happy, something I was not used to at all.  I'm upset I couldn't tolerate the side effects though.

The first thing I noticed was I cannot sit still. I'm constantly shifting myself while sitting and fidgeting alot. I also noticed the insomnia. It takes me forever to fall asleep, and when I do, I wake up every few hours. My doctor actually told me that this would help me sleep better. I've also not been able to focus or concentrate... It's hard for me to even do crosswords which I enjoy doing. The worst so far is the &quot;zoning out&quot;. My boyfriend always thinks something is wrong because I seem out-of-it, spaced out. Driving home tonight I thought my contancts were blurred and I kept trying to make my eyes water, apparently it was blurred vision which is a side effect of the Abilify. I also read alot about people gaining weight. It took me 2yrs to lose 30lbs and I feel great. Now that weight gain is one of the major side effects, I do not want to go through that again. It seems like the cons outweigh the pros in this case. I am debating whether or not to stop taking it.

Within 2 days the intensity of the &quot;high&quot; and the irritability had dramatically reduced. I am now on 15mg daily. In 1st 3 weeks I lost 5kg in weight and my appetite reduced from its previous level, other antipsychotics had really increased my appetite. Only side effect is slight restlessness, best medication i've ever been on. For me, it's a case of &quot;finally the torment is over and i feel normal again&quot;. I was out of hospital after just 2 weeks treatment on Abilify, I am able to take antidepressants alongside it, without going high. This medication has literally changed my life!

I was preparing for ECT treatment and then, if that failed, I was certainly preparing in earnest for suicide.  My doctor, who would not give up on me, put me on a brand new drug called Abilify.  Three or four days later, I was up and out of bed, the depression totally gone. I&quot;ve been taking Effexor, Abilify and Adderrall now for about ten years with NO MORE DEPRESSION!!!  Not one episode in ten years!!

I have to stop because if the swelling, knee pain and feet pain. I have to talk to my doctor to stop this drug. Its also has an effect on my legs, they feel so heavy at time. I take it alone. Anti depressants were causing me to be more depressed.

He takes 1/4 of a 2mg pill at night, so he's getting .5 mg a day, along with Wellbutrin for his anxiety/depression issues.  This combination has been an enormous help for him.  We were lucky - this is the first and only meds combo we've had to try, and we saw improvement within 3-4 days.  After a month, his doctor increased his dose to half a pill, but that made him sleepy during the day.  We took him back down to 1/4 pill a day and he's doing great!  His doc also suggest that he take an OTC Melatonin as a sleep aid, so he hasn't had any insomnia issues.He has been taking it for 4 months, so I don't know what the long-term outcome will be for him.  I just hope it keeps working!Cutting the already tiny pills into fourths is kind of hassle, but absolutely worth the effort.

Side effects can be annoying but living with depression is much worse. Price of med is crazy! Can't believe they charge that much for a little pill. It's a crime cause I need that little pill to function. I have sleeplessness or short amount of sleeping. Heat reactions and anxiety. Still better than depression and wanting to kill yourself.

When i do finally get a couple of hours of sleep, my mind works overtime racing and having bad dreams so I can't get a good solid 3 hours of sleep. I have a funny taste in my mouth and nothing I eat or drink tastes good. I feel more depressed now than I did when I was taking th geodon. I have sudden and very short burts of energy. I'm suffering from even more anxiety than before and I feel guilty because I know I have so much to do, but I just don't have the energy to do anything. I'm very irritable and get annoyed easily and my throat is sore.

I take 20 mg. per day.  It is effective where others (a long list) have failed. Extreme mood swings are in complete control.  I've had side effects such as throat irritation and occasional constipation.  I am having improved sleep.  Won't give up Abilify for anything.

Other	Mother of young teen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	9/1/2010 3:29:35 AM	My teen son took Abilify for one year for severe anxiety and OCD.  Dose started at 1mg, then 2.5 and then 5.  At 5mg, his coping skills were quite good, but throughout it all, he had a 40% increase in weight (40 pounds).  Metformin was given to suppress his appetite, but the fact is that the weight gain was not in proportion to his diet; his metabolism changed.  So, due to the sluggishness he feels with the extra weight, and teasing he's had because he's &quot;fat&quot;, he wants to go off Abilify and we support that.  Now that he is recently off, we are reminded just how effective Abilify had been.  We are trying to find alternatives that don't cause such big weight gain.

Up and down multiple times daily. In and out of hospital, day treatment school for over a year.  Started Abilify end of July while in hospital, felt nauseated for 3 days, then completely amazing.  I have my son back for the first time in years!  He is more revved up than &quot;normal&quot;, is I believe in a mild manic state, always (still) obsessing about one thing or another, very busy, busy, busy, but happy, not aggressive.  Furniture isn't flying across the room, knives aren't grabbed and directed at himself or others anymore and the suicide talk has disappeared.  He started public school today!  Very satisfied with this med.  Tried Depakote, Lamictal, Buspirone, Risperadol, Seroquel, Wellbutrin, Celexa, Ritalin, Adderall, Strattera, and 4 others that I cannot remember the names to.  Is now on Abilify, Buspirone, and Luvox combo....LOVE IT.  Hope other kids can get as great of a benefit as my son.  Good luck and parents...don't let others tell you what's NOT wrong with your children.

I started feeling less depressed and was even able to do all my yard work for the first time in years. After a few months I began having a very uncomfortable sense of restlessness inside and my Dr. lowered the dose and increased my Klonopin. I began having tremors in my hands which got so bad people were constantly asking why I was shaking so badly. I knew it was caused by the Abilify and took myself off of it by lowering dosage gradually, with my Drs. approval. I've been off this med for about six months and the tremors have not improved and have been told this may be permanent. I regret ever taking this med. I found out that my niece had been taking it for 2 years and developed terrible Parkinson's effects and is now on a Parkinson med she will have to be on for the rest of her life. She is only 31 yrs. old. Her Dr. told her the same ingredients are in it that were used in high concentrations by the Nazi's to torture Jews in concentration camps. I can relate, as it can be somewhat torturous to go through what we both are now. For this reason alone  I would recommend anyone beginning to have even the least amount of tremors report to your Dr. IMMEDIATELY, as it only gets worse, not better, with time.

It has helped control my angry moods a lot, and when I tried to stop taking it, I ended up crying all day. The problem: huge weight gain, about 20 lbs/year! I know it's the drug, because I had lost 75 lbs on Wt. Watchers, and as soon as I started Abilify, I started gaining it all back; I was no longer able to stick to my diet because I felt hungry all the time. My MD has suggested switching to Geodon, but I'm leery, as one of its possible side effects is &quot;weight gain.&quot; hmm.

I had got on Abilify 2006. In 2008 my doctor took me off my ADHD medication. All of the sudden I was eating every 2 hours and yes i know that is also from my brain working harder but I could not lose weight I kept gaining. Before I was on Abilify I weight 110. After I weight 125 while on my ADHD medication. Off my medication I weight 160. and for my Height that is over weight. Im 5'4&quot;. I am now off Abilify i have been for a year. I know weight 115. So if you have had a series weight gain I would check too see if it was after you started Abilify. Because most likely its from Abilify.

For the first two weeks I euphoric.  After that a little anxiety set in and I had it bumped up to 5 mg per day in May.  The anxiety remained and I had it bumped up to 10 mg per day in June.  The anxiety became uncomfortable for me and I discontinued using this drug on my own on July 26th.  Two weeks after that I went into a major stuper for two days with extreme anxiety.  For the past two and a half months I have tried different drug treatments and have entered into therapy with no success.  I fear the little boost I wanted may have cost me the rest of my life.

It worked but the side effects were awful: I gained 30 pounds; I felt disassociated like a zombie; I was unresponsive to personal interaction; I was constantly tired; My energy levels were low (possibly due to weight gain); I was going broke paying for this misery; and my wife threatened to leave me! I took myself off of the medication and within a day I started feeling like my old self again, and within 2 months I lost 20 pounds.

Since then I've been diagnosed with sleep apnea and that seems to explain the feeling of extreme fatigue. Now the problem is the weight gain and the insomnia from Abilify. I intend to discontinue immediately and rely on Pristiq and the sleep apnea treatment alone.

Immediately noticed I dont feel so sad. I stopped crying and feelings of being a complete failure and completely alone have subsided..i have read these reviews and are insanely scared of gaining weight. I dont know if i feel much. But, if i get angry i will be raging/ furiously angry. Throw things, curse profusely, break things. Besides that I am able to better handle my sad sad life. Unemployed, in debt for school, home alone all day. This drug has made me more productive. I take Desyrel to help me sleep so I do not get restless.

I did feel the restlessness for a bit but it went away. I have gained some weight because in the beginning I always felt hungry and my blood sugar was low. All this has passed. I have now increased my dose to 5mg., so far so good. Hopefully I will be able to stay on it. Overall it's been a miracle drug for me!

My doctor decided to try me on Abilify because Zyprexa doesn't seem to be working anymore. I have been on it for a short period of time, and I noticed a fantastic change immediately after taking the first dose(5mg). I love the drug and I can hardly wait to complete the switch!

As his physician stated recently, because he takes this medication as prescribed, no one would know he has a thought disorder.  It has been a lifesaver for him.  Because it did cause him to crave sugar, and gain weight, our family is on the &quot;Sugar Busters&quot; program, and he works out consistently every week. Our family would highly recommend this medication.

Allows me to manage bipolar disorder with rapid cycling.  In combination with Wellbutrin,sleep, exercise, nutrition, etc I feel &quot;normal.&quot;  Had to ask siblings if my behavior was &quot;normal&quot; it had been so long.  Two grown children are thrilled with the results as well. First few weeks problems with insomnia.  Use ambien when this occurs. Taking a low dose, 2 mg.  Seems enough for me.  Couln't be happier.

I've suffered with major depression for many years and starting this medication I have had a number of people comment on how I seem like a different person.  Except for a rather strange taste in my mouth, I rate this drug a 10 - everyone should try it if your current drug regimen isn't working well.
Other	icecream4me, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	11/28/2010 8:15:48 PM	I've taken many atypical antipsychotics but I took Abilify for more than 10 years in doses ranging from 10-30 mgs. I've had one permanent side-effect that has not been mentioned in this forum but has been reviewed in medical journals.I started making uncontrollable noises and singing, bobbing my head, rocking, and moving my fingers simultaneously as if playing the piano. I cannot control this, I would even wake up at night humming and doing my fingers.It gets worse when I'm under stress.A neurologist diagnosed Tardive Tourette's Syndrome. It is a result of long-term use of Abilify. This post is to warn others that this can happen, occur suddenly without warning and be permenant. I am glad that so many people are finding relief with Abilify and are able to live their lives, but be careful and maybe take a drug holiday.

However while my symptoms have remained in check, I have had to syop taking it.  While I was on it my triglycerides skyrocketed as did my cholesterol.  Neither were affected levelwise by medications used to treat these physical conditions.  Therefore it became necessary to stop the Abilify.  Within 6 weeks my triglycerides and cholesterol returned to normal with no more need for the meds for theose conditions.  So as a mood stabilizer it was effect, the cost to my physical well being however was to great.
Schizophrenia	pika-party, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	13-18	12/6/2010 1:52:53 PM	I've been on 5mg of this med for about a week. my p doc has been titrating me to 15mg and already, at 5, i feel much clearer in my mind. I'm caring about my appearance again and finding a little motivation. Also, save for a brief breakthrough the other day, the psychosis has eased and I am better able to function. It also helps me be less anti-social in that I actually want to talk to certain people now instead of spending my days alone in my room. Abilify has offered me new hope, and I don't want to kill myself anymore because of that. So far it is the best medicine I have tried.The only side effects I've had were about 3 days of akathisia upon starting (mild) and moderate nausea on occasion.

I have been on Lamictal for 2 years during the holiday season and get very depressed my doctor asked me to try this in addition to my Lamictal (on 400mg a day).  I have seen a rapid improvement since I have been on this medication.  So far I have not gained any weight that I have noticed.  I was started on 5 mg but I had to cut it to 2.5 for the 1st two days then I moved up to 5mg.  Today is my 1st day on 10mg.  I feel a little more jittery today but it should ease off by tomorrow.  I will have to warn ....i have been spending a lot of money.  You have to watch yourself but my house and laundry have never been finished at the same time. Awesome.

The Doctor I was seeing at the time kept me on it for 3 years because he could not accept the fact that the muscle movement problems I was having, and still have, could be Tardive Dyskinesia caused by the Abilify. He claimed my symptoms did not match the &quot;criteria&quot; for TD, but according to the drug manufacturer &amp; the FDA it DOES. He also claimed that because the possibility of Abilify causing TD was so low there was no way I could have TD!I fired the Doctor, found one who knows what he's doing &amp; got off Abilify. Now, 3 1/2 years later I STILL have Tardive Dyskinesia &amp; it affects me daily. I'm glad it seems to help some people, but PLEASE BE CAREFUL!When I was on Abilify I had MANY other side-effects (panic attacks, agoraphobia, problems maintaining my body temperature, skin infections, hair loss, forgetting how to do things, OCD/hoarding, and more, even an autoimmune disorder that has since gone away), thankfully most of those have gone away completely (except the weight gain, skin infections, &amp; while the hoarding tendency is better, it's still there), or at least have become tolerable, but the continuing muscle problems are very frustrating &amp; debilitating to say the least! On a GOOD day I might be able to walk 2 blocks without trouble, on a bad day 10 feet can be a huge struggle.Abilify also caused my personality to change &amp; I'm still trying to learn how to overcome that (I had a friend who won't speak to me now because of it).Now that I've been off Abilify I've realized that it was magnifying my moodswings.I am now on a totally natural/vitamin-based treatment program &amp; I'm doing MUCH BETTER than I ever did on antipsychotics!PLEASE, if you notice ANY muscle problems, or ANYTHING else UNUSUAL FOR YOU, NO MATTER HOW SMALL, talk to your Doctor immediately! And if they won't listen &amp; take it seriously FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR!!!

Schizophrenia	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Male	35-44	1/22/2011 12:53:27 AM	This is the most horrific drug I've ever taken.  My doctor let me try this because the Risperdal I was taking had caused a lot of weight gain, and Abilify is known to cause somewhat less weight gain.  I took it for several months.  It was a terrible experience.  I had one of its most common side effects, which was anxiety and insomnia.  I had constant anxiety just gushing inside my body, and I would be awake all night, over and over again.  I started making fewer and fewer meals and just ate handfuls of peanuts instead just to stay alive because I felt too bad to cook a balanced meal.  I did lose some weight, but the situation got worse, where at 15 mg. I was starting to hear voices again, and I was afraid to ask my doctor to increase the dose because the awful anxiety might have gotten worse.  I finally switched back to Risperdal and later Invega (a slightly improved version of Risperdal), and it was the biggest relief I have ever had in my lifetime.  My sleep immediately went back to normal, no more voices, and the awful gushing anxiety just stopped.  I wish it was easier to lose weight on Invega, but I have had some success in doing so, since it's not like it causes me hunger all the time.  The weight just sort of creeps up on me with these drugs, and it's possible to eat healthy and keep a healthy weight, it just takes some effort.

Anti-depressives and bipolar meds for about 16 years.  Abilify was added last month. Really is helping, now that I'm up to the 5 mg dosage.  Weight gain and hand tremor minor penalty to make such a difference in how I'm feeling otherwise.  Only problem is that my doc started me on half a pill for a week.  Pills are so small, difficult to cut in half.  Otherwise, WONDERFUL medication.
Additional Medications to Treat Depression	happy girl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/20/2011 1:46:04 PM	Just started 14 days ago. Seemed to work right away. Waiting to be sure placebo effect is not involved. Taking lots of anti-depressants and anxiety drugs. Only taking 1mg. of Abilify, so I probably can get by with 2mg with no trouble. Need to talk to a pharmacist. Bet I can cut out some of the other pills, but not sure which ones. Maxed out on Zoloft, 300 XL Wellbutrin and small doses of Klonazepam.I sure hope this medicine works as well as I &quot;think&quot; it does.

I have gained SO MUCH WEIGT that I feel disgusted with myself.  I had insomnia in the beggining, and I often feel spasms in my legs.  This drug is not for me.  How can something help with your depression when all it does is make you pack on the pounds?  The worst part is, I can tell it's mostly bloating.

My psychiatrist put me on Abilify to quell the attack. I don't remember the dosage. I was also takibng Lithium and Lamictal as the time. It worked well for a while but then I felt emotional numb and had cognitive clouding. I was going through a horrific custody battle for my son and was earning more time with him and I figured this was how things were going to be. I was communicating to my psychiatrist and psychologist that I was having a hard time talking to people and remembering things but my psychiatrist didn't recommend a change for almost a year which of course I was scared to do because I was gaining more time with my son. My psychologist never told me she though my meds were off she just said she thought we could move to meeting once a month as I didn't have much to say! Luckily I told a guy I was dating that I was BP and he did research on Abilify and said it was a nasty drug and that I needed to get off of it. I talked to my psychologist again and she said I think you are having cognitive clouding and that you need to talk to your psychiatrist and have your meds changed. I got off it and I'm a new person. I have emotions and can talk to people again. I've since switched counselors and she said I was probably on too high of a dose and that it's not a bad drug, but for me it robbed a year of my life. Hopefully this will help someone else and you won't have to lose so much time in your life.

I find it annoying that this medication is listed as one that does not cause weight gain.  It did for me and I also know three other people who have used this medication and have had significant weight gain while using it.
Additional Medications to Treat Depression	bladinbabe, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2		35-44	3/18/2011 9:39:44 PM	Diagnosed with clinical depression back in 2000 and Effexor worked well, but then I felt &quot;good enough&quot; to continuously lower the dose (With my Dr approval) to 75 mg and then lost it one weekend, anger like I'd never felt before. Went up to 225 mg Effexor but had horrible night sweats so went down to 150 mg effexor and added abilify. Started with 2mg, felt no improvement. Upped to 5 mg and thought I was doing well, but Dr upped to 10 mg (still taking 150 mg Effexor). No one told me about the weight gain and I'm SOOO relieved to hear that so many others had that side effect. I've gained 20 lbs in three months despite a rigorous exercise program and diet. I can't stand having this huge belly, never have been out of shape before. Meeting with Dr in 2 weeks and will be asking to wean me off this drug.

When I started taking this medication I had no idea it caused weight gain, but in fact i gained about 40 lbs in the first six months, eventually adding up to about 60lbs before  figuring out it was the Abilify. My doctor told me i could stop taking it and when i did the weight started coming off. I recommend not taking this medication if you do not want to gain a significant amount of weight.

Increased appetite is a problem, though, and I am trying to eat healthy food.  Have never woke up hungry at night before taking this medication, so we'll see if the appetite issue eventually gets under control.

I kept telling the Doctor that the Cymbalta 60mg x2 was NOT WORKING  she wanted to keep me on it because it has been approved for fibromyalgia.  Finally went to another Psychiatrist for a second opinion. She put me on 2 mg ABILFY in the AM WITH the Cymbalta and it has WORKED wonders!!  So far knock  on wood NO NEGATIVE side effects!!  Hope this helps...

I had energy, I was up and doing things, it was great.  First day I noticed my face was hot and flush...this continued each day.  I also had an episode that scared me so bad I went to ER.  This medication made my heart beat irregularly and my blood pressure was way above my norm.  These symptoms subsided once the medication was in my systen for several weeks.  I might add that my psychologist said she didnt believe these symptoms were from the medication so I continued to take it (I still think it was the med...new to my system, etc.)  I felt uplifted for about 6 weeks and then back to my old self, no energy, not interested in things, etc.  I have a review coming up and will more than likely be bumped up on the milgrams, crossing my fingers.  And I have gained about 5 pounds in the 8+ weeks Ive been on it.

My sister and I are both bipolar.  Having gone through the various mood stabilizers and see her reactions to mood stabilizers, I can tell you that there isn't a single med that works the same for everyone.  So my advice would be to try as many meds as you can giving each atleast 4 weeks to get the full effect then decide which has the least bad side effects.  For me, its abilify.  Granted I went from 120 to 170 and I eat healthy and got a Y membership but cant get the weight off, but I'm sooo much more of a pleasant stable person now than I have ever been.

My father killed himself as did my son. I have been on anti-depressants since 1993. All helped for a while keeping me out of the deepest black pit most of the time. But I never felt really good, just blah. I tried Zoloft, Lexapro, several others, all of which were less effective over time. I have been on Effexor XR 150mg for 4 years. I felt, as usual, blah and hoped I would not wake up in the morning. Suicide was not a logical possibility as I couldn't put my wife thru a second one after my son. The only way I thought I might kill myself was suddenly, in anger. One month ago I went to a new doctor who suggested I try Abilify. I has seen the ads but never thought I could get better and had no energy to try. Doc gave me two weeks of free 2mg tabs and after about 7 days Abilify switched my life back on. It is amazing and I almost am scared at how good I feel. I have not felt this good in 30 years. I have been on 2mg for 6 weeks and notice no adverse side effects. Right now, I see no need to bump the dosage.

It made me feel totally numb.  I had no emotions: no tears even though I was sad; no laughter even when I knew something was funny.  I was just blah.  I had zero libido.  I also had terrible muscle stiffness.  I used to be very limber and I was just horribly stiff.  Then I got tremors.  My head would start mildly shaking and I couldn't stop it.  When I got off of it, the tremors stopped, and it took a little while, but the muscle stiffness went away.  Would not recommend this, unless there is just no other alternative.
Additional Medications to Treat Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/2/2011 8:04:02 AM	I am 28 and have suffered from depression since I was 12.  I have been on and off meds.  Abilify is the first to make me feel this good.  I have amazing energy, decreased obsession with eating, and feel happy to be alive.  The negatives (which I will tolerate since the med works so well for me): jitters if I don't take my pill at the same time everyday.  I feel jumpy if I sit too long.  I get very tired in the afternoon, but a 10 minute rest and I feel great again.  I had severe headaches the first week, but they are gone now.  This drug has probably saved my life.  Yes, its side effects aren't fun, but the benefits outweigh the negatives in my case.  I hope they soon come out with a generic or reduce the price.  I take this with Lithium.

I feel better now that im off that poison.

I went into annafalactic shock this afternoon because of doing so and taking Abilify.  My Dr did NOT warn me of this and for some reason there was not an information packet in with my medication informing me of any of this.  Wished I would have looked at WebMD FIRST!!!!

Tried everything to get back to my normal self.  But, now only after 6 days have returned to my normal self.  No side affects as of yet after 2 weeks of Abilify.

Gained 20 lbs and started smoking about a pack a day. Decided to get off when I was plagued with extreme restlesness. I wanted to run away, to do anything other than what I was doing. I had impaired judgment and lost the &quot;soul-check&quot; one gets when they have irrational or sporadic thoughts. My advice is to make sure you are being honest with your doctor when taking this medication, because your mood and demeanor can flip in an instance. It worked for me for about 8 mos and then it back-fired.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	Unfocused , 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	45-54	7/4/2011 10:44:06 AM	I have been taking Abilify for 2.5 months officially for depression but suspected Bipolar ( with mostly depression). I've had good energy boost. Waking in the morning is so good that I go to bed looking forward to the way I will wake in the morning. I've upped to 5mg. Tried am, pm, and am/pm split. Not sure which is best, yet. I am am also in Suboxone treatment for opiate dependence from chronic pain treatment. Almost off Suboxone, but -- and here is my major concern -- I still find it hard to concentrate well enough to write. I'm a professor and am having trouble writing scholarly material.  Find it hard to put complex argument together.  I know what I want to say, but I can't seem to get enough clarity ini my thinking to make it happen. Will go back down to 2.5 to see if this helps. I had good results at that level and thought 5 would &quot;seal the deal.&quot; maybe the lower dose is right.  I all quite pleased but need to be able to complete my work.  I have, I should add, weird sleep things. Dozing off while trying to read, though as soon as I move around it's clear I still have the good energy level. I think I've learned, as doctor indicated, that regular sleep patterns to manage energy levels is critical.  Gaining some weight but could eat better, a lot better! I short, quite good, but not &quot;perfect.&quot;

After about 6 months I ended up having involuntary muscle movements in my neck that became so bad that I had to hold my face to take a straight forward picture. I told my doctor and he did not believe me and told me to see an eye doctor and a neurologist. I spent a lot of money on the tests and they found nothing. I finally convinced my doctor to take me off of it and about 3 months later all the involuntary movements were gone.

I read online that Abilify can cause High Blood pressure or Fluctuating blood pressure...my prescriber's office still would not lower my dose...I felt this med was doing more harm than good...I then went to see a neurologist...I was told this medication can cause the dizziness and went back to my prescriber...reluctantly my dose was lowered by 5 mg...the abrupt feeling of faint has not returned by I do still get a feeling of vertigo or dizzy at times...my blood pressure went to borderline...I was told at some point if I could drop some weight this might help...I've been working out in a gym on a treadmill and lifting weights for over a year...the most weight I lost was 10 pounds...I am trying dieting now...I feel I need to ask for my dosage to be lowered again to see if my blood pressure will drop...read online in NY Times article on young adults taking Abilfy...that lowering the dose does not help with weight loss...I will continue to diet and exercise even still...and see about getting the dose to see if my blood pressure will go down...

This has been the best med. for my problem EVER!! I am now going on 3 1/2 yrs. and actually have enjoyed life. For the first time along with my other meds. and they do not interact or have any side effects with abilify.  I would highly recommend this one RX. I am happy again after so many years of being miserable.  The only drawback is slight weight gain and I have diabetes.  So I have to keep close watch on them.  Good Luck and I hope you find this helpful.

Since adding it onto Cymbalta it's done wonders. I have worked at a bar, went to a pool party, spend the weekend with a wonderful guy, and am no longer to take the trash during the day time! It may effect you differently, but as for me I am starting to enjoy life again. After 8 months of adjusting medications I think i have found the right combination. Personal warning: The abilify makes me very sleepy. A simple solution to counteract this is to just take your Abilify at night get a restful nights sleep.

I also take wellbutrin and effexor. I am 53 and have suffered from depression for most of my life. The abilify has worked better than any other drug. I can now function like a normal person. I have much more energy and my anger and constant sadness are gone. The only down side is the cost, even with insurance it's $80 a month. My husband says it's a small price to pay for a miracle. I hope it continues to help me, because I don't want to go back to the dark place that used to be my life.

First time in 4 years that I FEEL happy and not just floating through the day until time for bed. With a husband and 2 small biys, it is not possible to be laying around all the time.

She has been treated for ADHD, but was still suffering from mood swings.  She's had been on Abilify for about 4 months and it's been a huge change.  Besides the weight gain (1 full clothing size) she has had no side effects.  She takes the medication before bed to avoid any daytime sleepiness. She is SO much happier, which in turn, makes the entire family happier. She's a little clingier, I think, but the mood swings are gone. I'm hoping that this med is a long-term solution for her and does not wear off in a year.

I'm so productive now, I finally feel like my old (good) normal self. I see things in a much more positive way. I'm really shocked how quickly and well this drug is working for me. Just a note, tried 15mg and felt too sluggish. 10mg worked better for me.

Was put in the psych ward by the police.  I was doing fine until the DEA got involved and pulled all the xanax from the drs who were prescribing it.  Thank you gov.

First I feel weak all the time, but at the same time, when I lay down I feel restless. The other and more serious issue for me is that I've been uncontrollably peeing in my pants. Its happened twice in two days. This last time, as soon as I felt the slightest urge to go, I went straight to the bathroom. Before I even got the door closed or my pants undone however, I was peeing with no warning. Both times it's happened I didn't need to go that bad and then suddenly, There's pee running down my legs. It's always a big accident too, like my whole bladder, and I don't even feel it coming till it's too late. I don't know what to do other than to talk with my doctor.

This medication has given me a LIFE I could only dream of...I never realized just how depressed my life really was. I had and that was HAD side effects but they went away in a couple of weeks. I had muscle spasms in my arms and legs but i was happy. To me it was a small exchange but they went away. As for the cost, my Dr. gave me a discount card and with my insurance i only pay my co-pay of $15. The company helps with the cost as long as you are not on state insurance. If anyone is depressed and wants a life get Abilify, it gives you the ability to Live.........

The 40 pounds of flab are slowly fading, but his self-image has been wounded.  At the time, being desperate, we thought the benefits outweighed this side effect, but I would now advise parents to consider very carefully how negative it is for a teen to be fat.  Proceed with caution.

I have found just recently, that this medication SHOULD BE DISOLVED ON THE TONGUE, and NOT SWALLOWED!!!!!  I found this out by reading the white dosage information inside the box.  This medication has really worked for me very well. I just read some disturbing comments from other readers on this web site, concerning the adverse side effects. I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia in early June of 2011, and I just read from another patient, that THIS DRUG MAY CAUSE SERIOUS NEUROLOGICAL SIDE EFFECTS, HENCE MY FIBROMYALGIA????????  Just worried now.

Everything the commercial spoke about as it relates to side effects, I experienced and had to be hospitalized. I did begin to feel better taking Abilify but after what I went through witht he side effects, I am afraid to take anything else as an antipsychotic.

It's a great drug for the prescriber, it cuts down on your phone calls to him. I am so glad, I took myself off it and all other chemical straitjackets. It robs you of your soul. Your cognitive function suffers tremendously, but you don't realize it unless you have to function at a high level and deal with complex problems. It's touted as the only atypical that doesn't cause weight gain, not true! It's just another me too drug in a poorly understood class of pharmaceuticals. Yes it has a better side effect profile than Haldol. If your doctor suggests an antipsychotic for you, maybe you should ask him why he thinks you need an antipsychotic. Short term therapy maybe 2-3 days of Zyprexa are enough to take care of crisis situations. Taking this drug routinely is like taking chemo to prevent cancer. Don't think of this as a mood stabilizer. I predict it will be off the market in 8 years. Educate yourself on this class of medication, be an informed consumer. Oh yeah, I'm a pharmacist too with 34 years of experience. Is this pill really worth $600/ month. That's 3 hours of good therapy you could be getting instead. Big Pharma at it again !
Additional Medications to Treat Depression	???????, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	10/7/2011 12:02:51 PM	I've only been on it for 2 weeks. I felt much better after 1 or 2 doses. (2mg)I have battled depression for many years and so far this seems to be a miracle pill. I am also taking prozac and ritilan. Side effects are tolerable. The first week I wanted to eat everything in sight, but after 2 weeks it's not so bad. I eat very healthily so I have not gained any weight, I just eat more. The bigger issue is waking early; I wake up at 4:30 am like I've set an alarm clock. That's 6 1/2 hours of sleep with no naps. I am however enjoying the quiet time to read and pray. Overactivity was an issue for about a week but that seems to be susiding, although I've cleaned out the garage and basement! My spouse has noticed the difference in mood and energy level. Overall I'd give it a 9 out of 10! Thank God for the person responsible for developing this little pill!

I was on it for a year and it made me feel restless, anxious, and nervous.  I was totally unable to sit still and felt like whatever I was doing, I wanted to be doing something else.  So, I was never happy with what I was doing.  Abilify also gave me an insatiable appetite.  Although I only ate 1400cal/day and kept a daily dairy of my calories, I still gained about 15 lbs.  My doc put me on Chlonipin because of my anxiety, which made me 10X worse.  I ended up in the hospital Oct 2010 suicidal.  I had had a problem with Chlonipin about 10 years prior.  The doc there took me off Abilify and Chlonipin and put me on Seroquel and Prozac.  I've been on this combo for a year and feel better than I've ever felt in my life!  I also lost the Abilify-related weight gain and have a normal appetite. I can't believe that I withstood a year of taking Abilify.  It was a nightmare!

This drug was added to another drug I was taking. While taking this drug I would have to force myself to get out of bed. I had to force myself to do just about anything other than sleep. I gained about 30 pounds as well. I also became more depresed than I was when I started the drug. I found this out by forgetting to take the drug for a few days. I felt much better off of it that on it. Both myself and my doctor decited this was not the durg for me. I had an awful time on this drug and had thoughts of suicide and just didn't want to do anything. If you are on this drug, make sure you watch your moods and keep a record of how you are feeling. If you start going into the dark hole, you can catch yourself before you get so lost you can't see your way out.

So far, it has made me sleep for 12+ hours of the day, feel like my stomach is trying to crawl out of my body, become depressed (when I was not), cry uncontrollably for 3 days and unable to concentrate. I also got the shakes after only day 4 and I am having a difficult time driving, due to blurred vision and lack of concentration. For those of you interested, it also ruined my sex drive. This drug has not helped me for what it was meant to treat. It is more disabling than helpful. Abilify? More like Dis-Abilify.

Thus, I need more abilify if I don't have the brand name drug.  I also notice more side affects at 5mgs.  For example, the company warns in their side effect literature that diabetic type symtoms are possible.  I have noticed these very symtoms, such as increased hunger, thirst, urination, swelling of extemities, craving sweets, etc.  Have others noticed this?  I gained 10 pounds in the last month so I am going down to 2 mg. after I check with my doctor for his approval in our overall treatment plan.  (Anytime I have tried to play doctor by myself it ends up in disaster!)I will be checking back if other people have these symptoms that lead to weight gain.  I can loose 10lbs. quickly so I am not going to stress over it, this combo of meds works the best out of sooo many I have tried.  Good luck to everyone else our there!

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	12/3/2011 11:54:37 PM	Well I struggle with depression, anxiety, and hallucinations.  I went to my primary doctor and he first prescribed me Zyprexa, and something with both Prozac and Zyprexa in it, and then Abilify.  Abilify worked the best for me, I felt happy all the time, I didn't find myself constantly thinking about horrible things, my hallucinations became pretty mild and less consistent.  I was on it for about a month or two when I began having a bad side effect.  I find it a little funny, but I started to develop facial twitches.  My upper lip would pull the &quot;Elvis Face&quot; without me wanting it to and my smile would twitch on the sides as well as having other random facial twitches.  This sort of scared me out of it and I did not refill the prescription.  I'd take it again, if not for the facial twitches.  It worked really well, especially for anxiety, but it's been over a half a year since I was off of it and I'm still experiencing facial twitches.  It was helpful, though, besides the twitches.

Other	jc, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	12/9/2011 2:32:10 PM	Doctor has suggested this abilify, have reservations about using it. I put low ratings because I had to enter something in order to post. Reading the reviews to help me decide to try or not. I see some good reviews but many with bad side effects which causes me much concern and hesitant to try it.  I wish doctors would test brain chemicals before using these psych meds. My psychiatrist does not do this kind of testing before prescribing. I understand it can be done simply with saliva tests.  Have been on effexor, cymbalta, clonazapam and buspar - cymbalta was the worst to go off of - terrible withdrawal.  I understand now that many psychiatric problems can be caused by hormonal imbalance - recently was found low in adrenal, thyroid, progesterone &amp; DHEA hormones on saliva testing.  Had to see an alternative minded doctor to get these tests. A must read for all, including doctors, is Dr. Mark Starr's book Hypothyroidism Type 2 available on amazon.com.  He explains how thyroid affects every body system including the brain and nervous system. Many people may get relief from psychiatric disorders with proper thyroid/adrenal treatment. One must find a doctor open minded enough to test for this. Hopefully, modern medicine will start to realize the interconectedness of all our body systems and give proper treatment instead of just prescribing antidepressants and other psych drugs.

My doctor prescribed me Prozac.  It did absolutely nothing for me.  I was then prescribed Zoloft.  Alone it did nothing so my doctor added Wellbutrin, Ativan and Ambien to help all my ailments.  That cocktail did nothing help with the extreme exhaustion or motivation.  I told my doctor I was frustrated and wanted to stop taking all meds if I wasn't going to feel better.  I don't want to take pills just for the sake of taking pills.  My doctor then prescribed Celexa.  Still not much difference.  Then, he prescribed Abilify in addition to the Celexa.  I have been taking it for 2-1/2 weeks now.  It seems to be the only thing that has taken away the tiredness.  My mood has definately improved.  Every one around me notices the difference.  For the first 2 days I had a headache, but that went away and I have had no other side effects.  I would like to continue with this treatment and hopefully the effectiveness doesn't wear off after time.  I take 5mg a day.

I had never had a manic episode in my life until I took Abilify and I haven't had one since.  I actually changed Psychiatrist becaue of this incident it was that horrifying.

I had suffered from bad depression and lack of motivation which left me hopeless.

(She had taken Risperdol before that and had a relapse.) She developed severe tardive dyskensia-mouth twitches, head and hand tremors-and her psych told her that she had Parkinson's. She had become so oversedated that she was nearly catatonic, and had lost all desire to eat or do anything except slump in her chair in front of the TV. She developed aspiration pneumonia and ended up in the hospital, where they had to put in a feeding tube because she could no longer swallow food or liquid. She was seen by a neurologist who correctly diagnosed her with tardive dyskensia--NOT Parkinson's--and put her on Clozeril. After 8 months of suffering, and intensive speech therapy, she is now home, eating regular food, and is more alert and lucid than I've seen her in years.  Please, if you are on either Abilify or Seroquel, and if you are having any symptoms like hers, tell your dr and don't take no for an answer! It's a miracle she's still alive.

Abilify has changed our lives.  She tried other meds (risperdal, trileptal) before Abilify because of insurance reasons and they did not help her.  She takes it along with Lamictal and the combination helps to put her in remission.  She recently was triggered by the unseasonably spring-like weather and an increase in dosage did the trick almost immediately.  She normally takes Abilify 10mg and Lamictal 150mg once daily.  To deal with her current relapse she is now at Abilify 15mg.  I hope that this review can give some other parent hope.  When we were struggling for a year to find the right medications for her, I was desperate to find good reviews among some of the bad ones.  This medication has given us our lives back.  I only hope that she will be able to continue on with it for a long period of time.  As far as side effects go, when she goes through med increases/decreases she may experience painful headaches and overwhelming nausea.  This always passes within a 2-3 days.

The weight gained from Abilify has been so hard to lose. Abilify didn't work too well for me, I was still pretty manic, it's hard for anyone to find the right mix, but I don't suggest taking Abilify because gaining a massive ammount of weight takes a real toll, especially for those who are already depressed.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	Ashley W., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	2/16/2012 8:39:02 PM	Had severe allergic reaction. Almost died. Hallucination, confusion, suicidal thoughts, excessive sweating in palms.  Hands drawn up, ankles swelled &amp; feet to where I had to wear a man's size 7W shoe.  2 sizes larger than normal. difficulty urinating. muscle spasms. Pretty much 95% of the side effects that could occur did occur.  I went off 2 mg.Dr. had me discontinue w/o cutting back.  My arms and hands drew up.  Had to take cogentin, vistaril, and valium to counter-act the muscles drawing up.  I continue to this day to take these medications.  It was a yr ago in January that I quit taking this medicine.  I wasn't even on it for 3 weeks.  It has taken over a yr. to get mobility back.  In the first month of quitting ablify, I could not use my hands.  My mother had to feed me, bathe me, dress me.  I could not do anything for myself.  I couldn't walk down my stairs, so I was house-ridden for an entire month!  I did not sleep for several days.  I could not lay, or sit.  I had to stand up 24 hours for 3 days. My mother finally got me to sit on the sofa. I could not lay in my bed. I am not 100% back to normal yet.  I am in severe pain.  My muscles still spasm especially legs, shoulders, glutes. I was taking remeron along with abilify.  I would not recommend this drug to anyone. My cousin's girlfriend had a bad experience with this drug as well. I lost over 100 lbs in less than six months after stopping abilify.  20 pounds in one week.

Other	Be of good cheer!, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	3/10/2012 3:01:44 PM	   Two separate times I've been prescribed Abilify 20mg or more per day for Bipolar I Disorder as an anti-psychotic and for mood swings.   This medication caused me much extreme high anxiety both times. Already having some issues of social anxiety, inherited tremor, and some tremor possibly induced by years of medicinal treatment for differing aspects of manic-depression, I really was at a severe disadvantage by taking Abilify. For me a vicious cycle results between tremor and anxiety especially when taking Abilify. I was taking after breakfast 20mg per day this last time then stepped down to 15mg with no let up in either tremor or anxiety. Having been completely off of Abilify now for 15 days hasn't caused me any negative side effects or concerns of psychosis or mood swings. Hopefully I will now have less anxiety and tremor as the influence of the medicine leaves my body.  Manic-Depression(and in particular Bipolar I Disorder has been part of my life for over 35 years. I highly advise against Abilify if one deals with anxiety of any nature or does not realize that Abilify can be the source thereof. Hang in there!

It like other newer anti-psychotics might bring about a clearer sense of conscious awareness; but for me the side effects are so aggravating and difficult to handle that another anti-psychotic with less side effects, was well worth making the switch. I now take Seroquel XR 200mg nightly. All anti-psychotic meds can cause weight gain and I've just about been prescribed everyone of them at different intervals. Having bipolar 1 disorder which in my case the manic stage is more prevalent does not allow for meds that would be prescribed for depression(i.e. Prozac, Zoloft, etc.). &quot; Different strokes for different folks&quot; is the bottom line in all medicinal treatments! June 2012 will mark 40 years of known dealing with manic-depression and even longer with anxiety issues; I'm 54 now. There's always hope; don't give up. It's the sign of a Champion to keep on keeping on. I wish I could have been of more help to whomever reads this. Have a great day!

I noticed my depression increasing, an inability to get up and get motivated to do anything! I saw the commercial for ABILIFY and finally asked my shrink about it. She said,&quot;oh sure, let me give you some samples.&quot; Why didn't she suggest adding 2MG of Abilify in the 1st place since I have been complaining about my lack of energy to even make something to eat for months.  Although on Abilify 3 weeks now, after 1st week, I definitely noticed a difference in my demeanor for the good. Actually felt like getting out of bed &amp; getting something done that had been sitting around for months and not done.  Now on week 3 I am  simply amazed at the 360 I've done since on ABILIFY!!!  My depression is better, my mood swings are more controllable, my activity level has increased quite a bit.  I'm elated, so far, as to how well ABILIFY is working with me!  Now, could someone fix my lower back and my knee I had arthroscopic surgery on in October, 2011 and still is giving me problems?  LOL.  I HAVE TO SAY TO AT LEAST GIVE ABILIFY A TRY.  I AM ON 2 MG AND AM VERY SATIISFIED!!

The past year I've been forcing myself to 'suit up and show up' even tho all I wanted to do was stay in bed. My doctor added Abilify and within 2 days I felt like my old self with abundant energy, more self confidence and no more anxiety. The future looks bright, like someone turned on the sun. Downside -- can't stay asleep, no appetite and am losing weight, my mind races at times, almost manic. Since I'm still new to Abilify (1 month) my shrink may have to tweak my dosage to relax the racy feeling.

Anti-depressants help for awhile and then leave me more depressed than before I started taking them.  This happens over and over again.  My last anti-depressant was Lamitrogine which helped tremendously for about a year, then the depression was worse than ever.  I went off everything and went on Abilify 2 MG.  The effect was overnight and I don't take anti depressants with it.  I just hope it lasts.  I wondered if I would ever feel like a human being again, if I would smile, laugh, tease ... well all that is happening!  I am my old happy self.  I do take 2 mg of Clonazepam which is for anti-anxiety to help me sleep.  The one bad thing about Abilify is lack of sleep. I wake up between 2 and 3 AM and never go back to sleep again.  I get up and start working or play on my computer.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1		45-54	5/5/2012 2:52:39 AM	I've only been taking Abilify for about 2 weeks but I don't think I'll keep taking it. So far I've had several of the side effects and a few I haven't seen listed. I'm getting really bad headaches with it (already have more than occasional migraines)and horrible stomach problems (the other side of constipation) I'm having more muscle stiffness than usual (already have fibromyalgia) and wanting to eat CONSTANTLY. I normally don't do that. From last fall to this spring I had lost between 35 and 40 lbs, now I'm gaining it back. I'm going to stop taking it while I'm ahead. Weird thing is, it didn't help with the depression that I noticed. Maybe all the side effects over-rode the &quot;go gettem&quot; attitude it's supposed to help with??? Anyway, didn't work for me but good luck to those it has helped. Got to say, it's not for everyone.

His doctor added this, and increased the dose over two years.  Everybody PLEASE note how they've changed Abilify's commercials and the warnings.  There's a reason for this!!! My husband has now been weaned off this drug and may be facing permanent disability.  His therapist tells me she warns all her patients against using it.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	5/18/2012 8:05:51 PM	I was taking 50 mg of Pristic, and I really wasnt working for my menopausal mood swings and hot flashes. I was given 5 mg of Abilify to help boost the effects.After taking it for about a year, my family noticed I couldnt stand still in one place without shuffling my feet. My husband saw the side effect on tv about unvoluntary leg movements. I discussed this with my Dr and she took me off of it and increased my Pristic to 100 mg.Ive been off of Abilify for 6 mos now, no more leg movements and somehow I've lost 20 lbs in 5 months!I just thought I was gaining weight due to my age.

By day 20 my stool was mustard yellow. I called the Doctor and he said to stop the medicine immediately! My digestive system was shutting down! I just finished two weeks of antibiotics and something to get my digestive system going again. I have been to the Doctor 4 times in the last 2 weeks for this 'unlisted' side affect. I have two more appointments next week..........

Other	shadowspawn, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	35-44	6/12/2012 8:24:00 AM	I've been prescibed this medicine for anxiety. I was taking clonazapam but did not want to be adicted or develop a tolerance. Zoloft and other anti-depressants made me nervous and gave me tremors. This drug, while helping reduce anxiety, has increased my energy level to the point where I've doubled my workout (intense bicycle exercise, 30 miles every other day) and have a lot of spare energy.  Caffeine doesn't seem to affect me, but I have almost too much energy. I sleep less, work more, do more physical work. I eat more, up to 3k calories a day (I monitor myself) and still lost weight and size. I feel like I'm jumping over things, looking at things symbolically at times. Example: where things I type make sense even though mispelled. I've never been diagnosed with any of the reasons this drug is prescribed for; this is a test by my doctor and it seems to work out. But instead of nervous energy it seems as though my physical energy levels have increased ten-fold. I do not take any other drugs nor drink alcohol at all and am very active physically. My blood pressure at a rest after walking is 130/70's, heart rate is higher than normal while at rest but during workouts is average (70% of 220-my age). I am still debating the overall effectiveness but willing to go for 3 months on this drug to see if it works for my anxiety.

Abilify worked very well, but as a diabetic it raised my A1c from 6.9 to 9.7 and I gained over 50 lbs in 6 months despite remaining on my diabetic regimen. Insulin needs skyrocketed and insulin resistance stayed high for over 9 months after discontinuance; A1c now finally back to 7.1 as of 4/2012. Psychiatrist replaced Abilify with 20mg of Adderall which I take at 6am with great effects, no jitters and no addictive feelings (but still sleep all day if I don't take it). For all this physical insult I paid co-payof $375 for 90 day supply of Abilify. The Adderall comes generic for $12.50. But I still have to fight to lose the Abilify weight the hard way on my own!

I tried almost everything out there and abilify has the least side effect for me. The older typical antipsychotics were so debilitating for me. I was on haldol and at one time prolixin for a while and I will never take abilify for granted again.It has been the best med by far for me I just had to give it time to build up and work. I take 30mg a day and it took quite some time to work but when it did I could function pretty well on it.

I am currently on 90 mgs of Cymbalta and 5 mgs of Abilify. Abilify lifted my mood within 3 days, but the longer that I have been on it the more pronounced becomes my difficulty in swallowing food. At this point, I am literally choking down every meal. I'm going to reduce the medication by 1/2 and then get off of it. This is not something that I want to do, but am forced by side effects to do.

I was ALWAYS nausious. All I was able to force down was VERY watered down cream of mushroom soup. Took me ALL day to get 1 can down. I could only handle 1 spoonful at every hour or so, even that made me wanna puke. As I said, my Dr said it wasn't a possible side effect, but it was the only thing that had changed, and it began about 48 hours after I began taking it. After I quit taking it, things went back to normal in 2-3 days.

She had a staph infection and after hip surgury she get staph in the incision. Between the white cell count and the blood suger she had no chance to fight the infection that developed into mrsa and then vrs.

I'm on a regiment for panic disorder using Effexor, Klonopin for about 8 months and just in the past 2 months Abilify has been added. The reason it's hard to rate it is because I noticed that progressively I've been feeling better even before taking Abilify. Whether or not this is accelerating the process...I don't know. What i do know is that I'm trusting my psychiatrist because I feel a hundredfold better than before starting any med.Only thing i noticed is that i sometimes feel restless, or i wake up early. But that isn't really a bad thing, because it saves me from hearing the buzz of the alarm clock.

But when I took Abilify, I was on the 10mg pill and after about a week I went into a severe state of psychosis and needed immediate psychological care. I don't suggest it if you have other medications as I did.
