I am underweight to begin with, and since being on addrell, I have lost about 10 more pounds.  I think I have gotten used to it, because I eat way better than the first few weeks of being on the meds. And the second thing is that I have had incressed mood swings in the mornings and evenings.

The 30 mg capsule made my heart race, so my dosage was reduced to 25 mg. The ideal dose for me would probably be somewhere in between 25 mg and 30 mg. My symptoms gradually worsened over a period of 30+ years and resulted in multiple job losses, divorces and financial difficulties.  I was not accurately diagnosed until age 45, although I had virtually all of the classic ADD symptoms dating back to childhood.  About 5 or 6 years ago I actually wondered if I had some type of learning disability because I could not process a complete thought, could not retain spoken information or instructions, was unable to concentrate on any task, etc. Although I discussed this concern with my psychiatrist at the time, there was no mention of the possibility of ADD.  I was given additional medication to treat my existing anxiety &amp; depression, which did nothing to improve my ADD symptoms. However, on my first visit with a new psychiatrist several years later, I was given the diagnosis of ADD.  Of course, it would have been great to have been accurately diagnosed and treated years ago, but I am grateful to have found help at all.

This was dealt with by adding adderall (immediately acting) to the XR (30 mgs each).  This seemed to work, until I changed jobs and ended up with a worse working enviroment.  Now unable to focus at all off work, overstress at work requires increased medication for depression et al.

Hearing this, my Dr. decided to begin with one 30mg dose of AdderallXR first thing in the morning and 30mg at noon.  As I attempted to perform the boring tasks of my &quot;new&quot; job--anxiety increased so high it seemed I would snap in two--thus, I resigned.  At this, my Dr. switched me to one 30mg XR and one generic non-extended release of 10mg at noon.  The anxiety lessened and I found I could focus on things like never before (the bad side is, sometimes I focus on things I DON'T NEED to do and hours pass as I search the web as I was doing just now).  While on the 60mg XR, even though I experienced a heightened level of anxiety, I did an experiment and for the first time in my LIFE, I was actually able to make an outline, a REAL outline for a speech!  As a public speaker, this is pretty important.  One strange side effect--before Adderall, I had stopped biting my nails and now I can't keep from chewing and ripping at them.  I have to glue on plastic nails to stop.  Also, I can't seem to fall asleep before about 1:30 AM, even if I take it at 7AM. But OFF of this drug, I used to feel lethargic almost all day and perk up at night, and on this dose, I have no more lethargy and I never nap at all during the day--I actually feel like a normal, thinking human being.  I wonder, what could be wrong with that, even if it IS addictive?  I'm not sure.  Honestly, It's as if it connected those pieces of my 52 year-old brain that were never connected before...Adderall is not perfect--sometimes I have menopausal episodes of angst that are exacerbated by taking this stimulant, but even my husband noticed a marked change.  I am more &quot;real&quot; on this mind-assisting additive than not. Angst and nail-biting aside,  it's as if it has helped me find who I really am--helped my frontal lobe behave normally.  I don't want to go backward in processing information.

She has since passed away from cancer and I decided to take charge and go to a doctor.My doctor has been very, very friendly with me. He is a general practitioner and he always asks me how I am doing on it. When I began going to him, the dr asked me what I would recommend for the medicine for me to be on.The first choice was Daytrana. I noticed nothing from that medicine.Next was Ritalin SR 20. It worked..but gave me headaches.Next try was adderall 10mg BID (Twice daily). It seemed to work, but my schedule didn't really allow me to keep taking it. I also didn't like bringing a C-2 drug to work.So he asked me about adderall XR. I told him that it was worth a try, and since 10mg twice daily wasn't working, let's up it even more.What a great decision!! Adderall XR 30mg once daily is working! I am now accepted more by my peers.The only thing I don't like is the fact that I'm not as hungry anymore.",effectiveness: 5, ease_of_use: 5, satisfactory: 4, created_at: '2008-03-07 011:02:47', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-63164-Adderall+XR+Oral.aspx?drugid=63164&drugname=Adderall+XR+Oral&pageIndex=100&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

I didnt notice the side effects until i was a senior in high school. I have struggled with sleeping, relationships (due to the emotional effects i am overly sensitive and believe i have developed depression from it), loss of weight(especially earlier on, not so much now. kinda wish it was the other way around after being in college 3 years), cotton mouth, sexual side effects, and most of all dependency. when i tried going off the drug for a year the withdrawals were hard to deal with. i slept most of the day for about a month and gained  weight from increased appetite. after the withdrawals had finally ended, i felt happier and easier to be around. my relationships were great and my depression was gone. all side effects had disappeared. i felt more like myself off the drug. but my grades in school suffered. i got back on the dosage and all the old side effects came back. my grades improved, but i am back to the empty sole less feeling of a study drone. my current relationship is suffering and i dont sleep much. i will be on the drug until i graduate. as soon as i do, i will be saying goodbye forever to it. i love my parents and know they were trying to do the best thing for me. If i have kids one day, and they are diagnosed with ADD, i wont be putting them through the same hell i have suffered for the past decade. ADD has been around much longer than it has had a drug for it and most people seemed to have still lived a good life with out it(my dad for example). I would not recommend putting your kids on this drug early on in their lives. wait until they can fully understand the side effects of the drug and let them make the choice because this is a life changing decision that is extremely hard to revert back from. if your child is happy, isnt that the most important. im still scared what the long term effects of the drug will do to me down the road.",effectiveness: 3, ease_of_use: 3, satisfactory: 1, created_at: '2008-04-01 13:40:12', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-63164-Adderall+XR+Oral.aspx?drugid=63164&drugname=Adderall+XR+Oral&pageIndex=98&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

He no longer &quot;daydreams&quot;or have trouble understanding what people say to him (we had his hearing tested, EEG's etc..).  Homework went from 3-4 hrs. to 1-2hrs. and it's done correctly! Most of the time he's done it all before he gets home. His grades went from C's and D's to A's and B's in one marking period. The side effects I've noticed are dry mouth and sometimes he's irritable with his 6 year old sister and he used to be extremely tolerant (it actually seems more normal now). He's lost 4lbs but he can afford it because he was 77lbs. I was worried about the slow growth side effect, but he grew 1 in. since he started. I'm just not sure if I want him to take it during summer months or maybe I won't give it to him on the weekends.  This is something I'll discuss with his doctor.  It definetly works, it's just one of those things you wish you didn't have to do.",effectiveness: 5, ease_of_use: 5, satisfactory: 4, created_at: '2008-04-30 15:22:38', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-63164-Adderall+XR+Oral.aspx?drugid=63164&drugname=Adderall+XR+Oral&pageIndex=97&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

Any side effects i have had haven't bothered me and I never formed any habit or addictions to it. by tis I mean i very rarely take it during the summer or during weekends. I only take it when i need it. I cant recall ever feeling strande diffrent because of the medication either. Honestly i only realise how much i need it when i forget it. again i cant imagine id forget if i were addicted. I was never extremely hyper so i couldnt say how well it calms. I am also a sucsuessful artist and allways have been, i never have felt like it hinders my creativity or make me a zombie as it were. I have ADD, without the H but the squished the two together more recently i guess.

I have a deficiency of it so it not inattention as much as, we try to pay attention to everything at once. witch is why during conversations my eyes dart around the room looking at everything, like the shiny stuff. I have been very happy with the medication, to the point where i may postpone increases in dosage in fear that they may decide i have too strong a tolerance and change it on me. I have been taking it long enough to have built confidence in the brand. I'm not sure if i will need it in college, only time will tell. the goal of course it to eventually no longer need the medication.

I was very athletic, and an all-state goalie for our local ice hockey team and had scholarships poaring in the mail for college.

That was almost 10yrs ago. I have been on Adderall for about 6 months now. I was always energetic but when my wife and I had our daughter I noticed a big change in my sleeping habbits, emotions, and ability to stay alert. When I was given Adderall, the first day, I just couldn't believe the difference. I'm sharper probubly more so then when I wasn't on it. I'm so energetic, positive, and just all together alot better off. The only side effect I have is sometimes I wish I had been put on it a long time ago. I'm due for another spine surgery, this time will be the third. I have Scoliosis, a sever case too. I have 3 curves in my spine. So, with the help of god, this time when they go in and take the rods that were put in on the second surgery and somehow snapped in half out.

My mood was much better, I could think crystal clear, and energy!!!  My house stayed SPOTLESS. But, after about a year of using it, the effects began to wear off. It became a typical narcotic.  The &quot;high&quot; would not last but a couple of hours and as I could feel the effects starting, I'd begin a bad mood because I knew it wouldn't last long.  Then, when I would &quot;crash&quot; it was Katie bar the door! I dared anyone to give me a reason to go postal. I suffered thru until this past February when they came out with Vyvanse.

Doctor is aware of the side effects and am going to try for a few more weeks before making any final decision as many med side effects fade for me over time.

I wrote, I focused, I read, then before I knew it, the crash would hit. And I would pop another one. At one point, I was up for FIVE DAYS with NO FOOD. Things start to go down hill on day 2. You can't focus as well, your nerves are shot. You are weak. But man, when that exhaustion hits, it's so scary. I did this off and on for months until one day my doctor said, &quot;No more.&quot; This was because I finally told him, &quot;Im out and I feel like I'm dying!&quot; I was taken off large doses 60-80mg a day for 4 months COLD TURKEY. I was out early. And this time I told him. I could not take it. I hard trouble just moving from the bed to to bathroom.I was SEVERELY depressed to the point of suicidal thoughts. I slept 23 hours a day for five days. My tolerance was though the roof. I could take 80 mg in the morning just to feel &quot;normal.&quot; Finally a doctor took mercy on me and cut my dose down to 20 mg a day with the explicit understanding my mother would be doling them out to me. I weaned off them gradually. Finally down to 5 mg a day. The withdrawals from this drug when it abused is nothing short of the definition of hell. Exhaustion is complete and total. You are NON FUNCTIONAL.  It's hard to give it a rating because my addictive mind abused the hell out of it. If you have any history of substance abuse STAY CLEAR!

I think the drug has helped me immensely, I have been taking 20mg of Lexapro for about 4 years now and it has helped with my anxiety but my head always felt clouded, I always felt like &quot;my get up and go got up and went&quot;.  I was always just sluggish and wanting to nap all the time.  My attention span was always very short and I became bored with things very fast, I was constantly punishing myself for daydreaming and trying to make myself focus.  The second day of being on Adderall XR was when I noticed the biggest differance, and it has been the same since starting.  My thinking is SO MUCH clearer.  The constant &quot;background noise&quot; of continuous thoughts is gone.  I was afraid when I started the drug I would feel like I was on a caffeine overdose, but it's not like that at all.  Your thoughts just clear, I even speak slower, I'm more focused on what is going on, I don't even think about taking a nap anymore, don't have a need to.  Things that I used to constantly procrastinate on just get finished.  Not only are you doing the things you didn't do before you have an enjoyment in doing them.  I have always felt that I was an anxious child growing up and I think that A LOT of my anxiety problems as an adult were definitely related to my ADHD.  So far I can't say anything bad about Adderall XR.  I take one 25mg capsule in the morning, eat breakfast and go about my day.  The only other medications I take are a multivitamin and a fish oil supplement at lunch and Lexapro 20mg before bed.  I would highly recommend Adderall XR especially if you have anxiety and depression.

I dont feel like its doing anything for me anymore and I often find myself staring... just zoned out. You will always need more of this drug over time for it to actually work. It is highly addictive. I cant get out of the bed without it. It used to be my &quot;wonder drug&quot; in the beginning. I felt better and worked harder and smarter than I'd ever dreamed possible. Now I suffer with severe anxiety and cant focus on anything for very long. It causes irritability and keeps me from eating regular meals. But I am addicted to the energy it gives me and just today I told my psychiatrist not to take me off of it even though I have such bad anxiety. He isn't the same doctor that once prescribed 120mg. He really thinks I should come off of it. Deep down, I believe I should too. Sometimes, even on just 40mg I feel so wired. My eyes dilate, my hands are always cold and I shake. I have to take Lunesta 3mg to go to sleep at every night. I will say that Adderall XR was only a short-lived fix for me. I have never been hyperactive... just attention deficit.

I saw the 'top' doctor in NYC who charged $750 and saw me for 15 minutes to make the diagnosis - promptly prescribing Adderall RX. Each subsequent $250 session lasted less than 5 minutes to monitor my progress on the Adderall RX. Initially things were great. I was able to focus on tasks, I did not get drowsy driving and my appetite was manageable. I actually lost 12 pounds! I saw that as a positive side-effect. At the time I started, I read that Adderall RX was the new Hollywood diet drug, so I felt tres chic! Anyway, it took me a while to realize that Adderall RX was making me less tolerant with more feelings of rage. At one point, I broke a full length mirror in my wife's office by impulsively putting my shoe through it during a heated argument. I MUST NOTE THAT I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE IN MY LIFE!!! I also felt what I could only describe as a pain in my liver after several months of taking the drug. If I stopped temporarily, the pain went away. As soon as I resumed, the pain came back. Another leading NYC expert consulted with a top expert at Mt. Sinai, who had never heard of this side effect. Whether it was recorded or not, I had it and don't since stopping the med. My course on Adderall RX lasted about 9 months. I also was in a n ADHD group therapy class. In the end, I deceided that this is who I am, that drugs are not a miracle cure and that the pain in my liver and feeling enraged was not something that was worth the extra focus and appetite suppression. I do keep a stash for long driving trips, because it absolutely keeps me alert and I don't feel like I have to pull off the road to nap. Hope this helps.

I used to be very very anti anything ADD/ADHD, I use to think it was a way for the pharmaceutical companies to &quot;push more drugs&quot; on us.  What changed my thinking was when my son was having a lot of trouble with school work and was diagnosed with ADHD.  I saw the exact same symptoms in him that I had when I was young.  I have always had trouble in school.  It wasn't that I wasn't interested I just couldn't stay focused long enough to get into the material.  I went and spoke with my family doctor, told him the situation, the symptoms I was having, my past school performance, current job performance, etc... and he decided to prescribe me Adderall xr 25mg.  Another thing he told me to do was to cut out ALL caffeine, which I did.  The first three days I popped Ibuprofen all the time because of caffeine withdrawal headaches but after that the transformation has been wonderful.  I have had anxiety problems with mild depression for as long as I can remember, actually anxiety runs on my side of the family.  Starting the first day with Adderall I could tell a big difference.  I had that euphoria that everyone writes about but my thinking, concentration, my ability to prioritize, and get things done has been AMAZING.  Now that I have been on the med for a little over 3 months the euphoria feeling is gone, that was gone in the first few days of use, but my ability to stay focused, concentrate, prioritize, and basically &quot;get er done&quot; has been excellent, actually after a month of being on the med it seemed like it improved somewhat again, I actually find myself speaking slower and more methodically.  I couldn't be happier.  I actually think that A LOT of my anxiety and mild depression have been related to my NOT being diagnosed with ADD sooner in my life.

So I say to everyone, young and old always discuss the way your ADHD, &amp; ADD medicines are working and if you find something is not working well, then try another medication to find the one that works. Never give up.

This med is great. Im immediately awake 20 min after I take it and I dont come down or get moody like other things that keep you awake.

They never thought to test me.  i wish i would have been diagnosed as a child, i feel i was cheated out of of life.  maybe i would have completed college and not switched majors multi times.  instead, i am now working to support a child and i have 6 years or so of school i have completed but no degree.  if any parent is unsure, let their child try it.  trying it wont hurt anything, you can always take them off.  i wish i would have known or had the opportunity to decide on medicating, i may have made the wrong choice but at least i would have had a choice.  Adderall has helped me w/a lot of things.  i have better friendships b/c i am a clamer person.  at work i can actually sit still and get tasks done.  i have always got work/homework done but now i do it without thinking how much i dislike whatever i am doing, i can focus and get it done before i even think about how i feel about it.  i love adderall and never go without it!",effectiveness: 5, ease_of_use: 5, satisfactory: 5, created_at: '2009-02-03 09:50:36', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-63164-Adderall+XR+Oral.aspx?drugid=63164&drugname=Adderall+XR+Oral&pageIndex=75&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

I have had every negative side effect, as well has had a lot less trouble with school. Some of the negative things the medicine cause for me are Nausea, Headaches, Dizziness, Dry Mouth, nearly Fainting when standing, General fatigue/weakness, Muscle Tension, Muscle Spasms (Sometimes EXTREMELY painful, most pain I've experienced ever), Lack of sleep, restlessness, jiteriness, Some OCD-like symptoms (Obsessing over little annoyances), and that's not all. Even though this drug has brought me so many bad things, it has also been the only thing that allowed me to be successful in school, and not be so hyper-social. I honestly wouldn't recomend this drug for some one who hasn't tried other ADHD medicines without success, as they would probably be less troublesome, but for me, this is what worked. This drug is also NOT for some one who doesn't want negative side effects, as they seem abundant. The only problem really, is the consistency of negative side effects. For some they don't appear at all. I have found that this drug makes it so that when I stay up late, I don't get tired easily, and the next day it barely feels like I stayed up late. This can be a blessing and the opposite. For instance, I stayed up late once, and forgot to take my pills the next morning, and what resulted felt like being drunk, half dead, and like I hadn't slept for at least a couple days. All I could do is sleep, and I ended up so weak that I got sick. So, the moral of the story really is, Try Adderall, and if you get negative side effects, make sure there isn't an alternative medicine for you.",effectiveness: 4, ease_of_use: 2, satisfactory: 2, created_at: '2009-02-24 01:31:00', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-63164-Adderall+XR+Oral.aspx?drugid=63164&drugname=Adderall+XR+Oral&pageIndex=72&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

I have Insomnia which is a sleeping disorder, it doesn't help that much when you take it later in the day. Some people take the Adderall XR in the morning and then take the instant release form of the medication in the afternoon/evening. I highly do NOT recommend that kind of treatment. Especially to people who don't already have a sleeping disorder such as Insomnia/RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome) I also have Paranoia,Major depression,Anxiety,Panic attacks and phobias. I take 30 MG Adderall XR one time in the morning get that good feeling then the feelings just kinda melt away, and leave me somewhere in the middle of the day. Also again I highly don't recommend taking Any form or MG of Adderall in the evening hours if you don't already have a sleeping disorder cause it &quot;will&quot; cause you to stay up later than normal and develop a habit that unfortunately 9-10 times can not be self medicated in anyway to fix. You cause yourself to get Insomnia trust me you don't want to have Insomnia. It will make you more tired during the day worsen Depression if you don't already have it you will when you have Insomnia you will be more agile, and frustrated,Angry at the world blah blah blah. Something I'm going to try and do Is take the 30 MG Adderall XR closer to noon. Therefor I should be covered for the whole day and then be ready for bed at a normal hour. The Adderall helps me with my mood,Depression,Anxiety,Panic Attacks. Not my Phobias in case your wondering what my Phobias are. Here you go get ready to laugh cause they may seem innocent and true for a lot of people, and may seem like I don't have phobias their normal. Believe me I think their funny too so don't think if you laugh at some of these your going to hurt my feelings.

It provides a &quot;kick&quot;, of sorts, to the mind and body.  I find it spurs mental motivation, which in turn, the body responds to quite well.  I take 1 in the a.m and 1 in the mid afternoon.  This seems to get me through to the early evening. Note:  There is some irrability experienced, in my case, as the dosage fades.  Foretunately,I discovered Strattera long before adding Adderall XL, which actually works very well as a counter measure.(Read my review on Strattera).  Although, I should add that Adderall XL does not have the crash that I experienced on some of the more popular &quot;stimulated&quot; drugs.  Nor do I feel a &quot;pull&quot; of dependency.That being said, I did inadvertently take a short &quot;Holiday&quot; from the drug, and noted  a definite drop in mood towards depression accompanied by an increased lethargic feeling.

As for the loss of apatite I just decided to get more carbs protein all the calories etc, more in just a 1-2 meal's a day instead of having 3-4 ( yes i love to eat and I am a cook) But for the most part the loss of apatite will dissapate once i get myself, used to the medicine.Now as for how it helps me out has been great, I have alot more focus, I don't feel that my mind is running around at 1000mps in 800 different directions. I also get that euphoric feeling of happiness, and sometimes catch myself spacing out to the clouds sometimes, or just good enjoyable moments that i prolly couldn't stop myself to see.Overall I enjoy this medication, sometimes yes i get mad that i only get 4-6 hours of sleep but I am learning to manage my sleeping times to were it cycles just right, and now that i have been on it for about 10 days i am starting to actually sleep 1-2 hours more a night as long as knowbody calls me or etc. (before i was a heavy sleeper now I can't even take naps :( i will miss you naps.) but now i dont have to string my alarm clock across the room to force me out of bed and to turn it off etc cause before i would just sleep through it",effectiveness: 5, ease_of_use: 5, satisfactory: 5, created_at: '2009-05-06 012:51:27', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-63164-Adderall+XR+Oral.aspx?drugid=63164&drugname=Adderall+XR+Oral&pageIndex=63&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

He started having what I called &quot;These Fit's&quot; He would get so upset at the drop of a dime.On the way to the psychologist one day, we were leavin well he wanted a cheese sandwich and we were out of bread.The only bread was end pieces. Well he went CRAZY! Kicking, screaming, hollaring, &quot;I hate you! I wish you were dead! Nobody likes me anymore!&quot; It was as if the exordist had entered my little angles body. We got to psych. and it was only once I told him, that he was able to settle him down(after a 2 hour drive there)and he also got him a cheese sandwich. I later found out from his pediatrician that this was a really bad side effect of the meds.Except for the mood swings, outburst the medicine was great.

I was started on 20mg of Adderall xr, then went to 25 mg xr, and now I take 25mg xr in the morning around 6am, and then an Adderall IR, 10mg, around noon to one p.m. I think Adderall works great, the problem I had was that even though it is an XR formulation it seemed to wear off around noonish everyday. I was never able to get &quot;all day coverage&quot;. In February my doctor added the 10mg IR &quot;booster&quot; and it has worked great ever since. He told me that every one's body metabolism is different and some get longer coverage than others. This is what worked for me. I was worried about sleep issues being on this dose, the amazing thing is I actually feel like I sleep better since being on this medication. When I lay down to go to sleep I don't have a million and one things floating through my head like I use to. It's like the background &quot;white noise&quot; is gone. My thoughts are so much clearer now and I can actually get things accomplished instead of 20 things half accomplished. It's too bad people abuse this drug, it's makes it more difficult for people who use it for legitimate medical purposes to get it. All of my other medications I can get a 90 day supply in the mail.

newuser.reviews.create(comments: "Adderall XR is a very effective treatment for ADHD.  It helps concentration all day.  In my experience, it should not be taken after 11:00 am because it may cause insomnia.  This medicine also decreases appetite, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on the patient.  I am not overweight, so the appetite supression became a slight problem for a while, but the positive effects outweighed the negative effects by far.  Once I had been taking it for a while, I was able to eat normally again, but people who are under-weight should be monitored in order to make sure they are eating enough.  Another thing about this medication is that it is very addictive.  It has been effective for me for the past 4 years, but I am unable to function normally without it.  People who are prescribed Adderall XR should be aware that they may become dependent, and if they are to discontinue taking it, they should definitely taper their dosage down fairly slowly.  Overall, Adderall XR has been an incredible improvement for my concentration.  I believe, however, that it should not be administered to young children because of it's strong effects.  If it is needed for a child, they should take the lowest effective dose.",effectiveness: 5, ease_of_use: 5, satisfactory: 5, created_at: '2009-07-10 22:44:01', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-63164-Adderall+XR+Oral.aspx?drugid=63164&drugname=Adderall+XR+Oral&pageIndex=57&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

I wake up with energy, take on the day, I dont binge eat nor vommit because with the adderall suppressing my apetite I do not get the urge to eat when im bored. However, it is easy to maintain a healthy diet and eating regularly. For the first time I am making A's in my classes, which NEVER happened in highschool &amp; I enjoy life so much more. The thing I really had to get used to was harnessing my energy. I would start a &quot;project&quot; and not want to finish it until I was done but i would really need to do homework or something of greater importance. I had to train myself to prioritize and make schedules, something that comes so easily to others. But, once I re-trained my brain how to function to be successful it really helped me get through life. Like I said, I'm finally making good grades AND getting to class (and everywhere else) on time.

I lost a lot of weight, as well as my appitite, and became very irritable. I also developed annoying little habits like tapping my foot and clicking my tounge uncontrolably. But overall, this drug has done wonders for me. My first year of 8th grade I failed miserably. I was written up over thirty times that year as well. I could not concentrate no matter how hard I tried, and I got in trouble so much because I was so hyper and bored. I was prescribed Adderall XR the next year and I did a complete turn around. I made honor roll and maintained an A average throughout the whole year. My behavior also change. I had a better attitude and did'nt get in any trouble at all. I have just graduated high school, and thanks to Adderall, I continued to make great grades and control my behavior throughout my high school years as well. I was even accepted into a great university and given a scholarship. Adderall changed my life. I am convinced that I would not be where I am now without it.

He is aware on how ineffective the Amphetamines react within me. No side effects, slight increase in heart rate and slight rise on the BP. No burst of energy or any other effects.  I am now on a base prescription of adderall and adderall XR combination at 160mg per day. At times the ranges may go as far up to 240mg or down to only several.  The amount of the dosage is directly dependent of the days requirements.  I also try to take 1-2 days of Adderall free days to lessen the problem of drug tolerance.  The adderall still at the high dose performs very poorly in managing my microsleeps. I can take a full dose, wait 45 minutes, then lie down and fall asleep. I am also on Xyrem treatments for the last 5 months.  Xyrem is not working very well.  I have been diagnosed as a right clinical context narcolepsy.  I unfortunately am one of the exceptions to the effectiveness of amphetamines and the like. Even from the beginning, the amphetamines have had little effect on my body. History:  I was never a drug user and I never liked to drink alcohol. I still don't drink or use recreational drugs.  Never had any of the 'so called side effects' that amphetamines can give someone at the higher dose. In the past I have had provigil and ritlan with no effective treatment.

Since beginning it, I have less distractability, more focus, more concentration, easier time remembering tasks, not losing things anymore or misplacing things.The few things that have slipped away are the racing thoughts, the negative outlook on all things in life, and my inability to sleep through the night. I am glad they have. I can concentrate more. However, it has also taken muscle spasms away and now I can feel every bit of my fibromyalgia pain. So in conjunction with Adderall XR, I take Lagnasil (Lamotrygiene) and have a muscle relaxer (Xanax) which helps with the pain at night.

newuser.reviews.create(comments: "I am 25 and have been on Adderall XR since I was 14. Adderall has worked very well for me. Some of the benefits for me are increased focus, ability to effectively process information and form and express coherent thoughts more effectively. When I am on my medicine, I find it easier to complete tasks, whereas without the medication, completing even the easiest of tasks (like unpacking groceries) is difficult because I get sidetracked. When I am not on my medicine I tend to exhibit a lot of impulsive behaviors, but on my medicine, I am better able to think before I act, so to speak. Another benefit is that I am not bored as frequently. One obvious negative side effect is loss of appetite. I lost a lot of weight in the first year or so of being on Adderall. I could easily go for a day without eating. I just didn't look healthy. Some of my family members and teachers thought I had become anorexic and were getting worried. After I graduated college, I went off Adderall for about a year and hated it. I gained back the weight I had lost plus more because of nervous/bored eating, and I struggled in school (in my masters program), at work, and some of my relationships with others suffered. I have been back on Adderall XR for about 3 months now and am much happier with life in general. I just feel more balanced and in control of myself, which is nice. I have noticed decreased appetite, but to a MUCH lesser extent than in high school and college. Some of the negative side effects I have always experienced while on the drug are decreased sex drive (although that has improved), dry mouth, and what I call &quot;hyper-focus&quot; - the inability to switch from one task to another. The effectiveness of AdderallXR obviously varies from person to person, as do the positive and negative side effects. THough I have had some negative side effects, my overall experience with AdderallXR has been VERY positive.",effectiveness: 5, ease_of_use: 4, satisfactory: 5, created_at: '2010-01-13 13:23:02', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-63164-Adderall+XR+Oral.aspx?drugid=63164&drugname=Adderall+XR+Oral&pageIndex=38&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

My eyes were always bloodshot and I was always paranoid.  I feel at ease and can focus and concentrate for long periods of time at school and work.  For people that legitmitally have ADD/ADHD like me, this drug works wonders, provided that you take it properly and DO NOT crush the beads and snort it or inject it.  It is meant to be taken orally and create and acheive a steady baseline level so there aren't as many highs and lows throughout the day.  One side effect I have found out to be negative is that it takes me 2 hours to fall asleep at night.

My brother has ADD and my sister has hyperactivity without the inattentiveness that she finds highly adaptive. My nephew (brother's son) took Adderall with great results for many years. Although I have had a lifelong history of ADHD (and was in special ed) I had always been misdiagnosed. I won't even go into the crazy things I was labelled with. Despite such a grim prognosis I was able to complete grad school with a 4.0 average at USC and obtain a professional license in health care. When I tried to obtain meds for ADHD this was used against me and I was told that I could not be this successful with severe ADHD and was even labelled bi-polar by the chief of neurology due to my hyperactivity which has become worse when I turned 50. Finally a colleague prescribed Strattera which not only made my sick it also gave me nightmares. Next was Concerta which worked great but gave me such severe dry mouth that it destroyed my mucous membranes. Recently I switched to Adderal. By this time I was saying my prayers. It works great! I had mild dry mouth that was self-limiting and am on top of my game. The best thing is the improve social skills due to &lt; impulsivity and the improved concentration. I am a new woman! Thank you shire. I take 20 mg QAM and 10 mg in the afternoon. It also decreases my PTSD symptoms.

I loved the euphoric feeling and weight loss side effects, but it was so addictive I broke down and took it during my last trimester of pregnancy and now I fret it has caused a disproportionately small head size in my11-week-old daughter.  (weight and length are off the charts but head is only 50th percentile, and was only 25th percentile at birth)It was also so addictive I quit breastfeeding at 5 weeks to go back on the meds.Now it's causing dry mouth to the point of receding gums and ruining my teeth, and I'm still considering going back on it.  (when I realized the affect it was having on my dental health -- I quit taking it, and that was 2 days ago.  The fatigue from the withdrawal is crushing.)I wish my parents had never started me on these meds.  Please, parents, do not start your kids on these meds.

It makes me very irritable and short tempered, and if I do not take it for 2 days I feel worthless. If I miss one day, it's not terrible because I still feel it from the day before. I have never gotten the greatest sleep on it, but have learned to deal with it. I've found it to be extremely addictive and I would NOT recommend it. I have a complete love-hate relationship with this medicine. Without it though, I'm not sure I would've graduated high school on time, and am now currently about to graduate college in may. I have an 18 month old son and I did NOT take it during pregnancy, and I did start taking it immediately after he was born, due to lack of milk anyway. I was not able to breastfeed. It has helped tremendously with the ability to keep up on the demands of a toddler, school full time, and recovering from major back surgery. Downsides for me based on personal experience are: dry mouth, excessive sweating, dizziness, sleepless nights on occasion, COST if not covered by insurance, heart palpitations, extremely tight back muscles in the evening, teeth gritting, and anger/frusteration. It has helped me in so many ways, but also has many side effects, and due to the fact that it is so addicting, I wouldn't recommend it to people under 21.",effectiveness: 4, ease_of_use: 4, satisfactory: 2, created_at: '2010-04-30 22:45:31', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-63164-Adderall+XR+Oral.aspx?drugid=63164&drugname=Adderall+XR+Oral&pageIndex=29&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

Zoning out, easily distractible, terrible working memory, poor verbal expression, thinking quickly, things that a lot of people take for granted. I began taking Vyvanse about 2 years ago at the 30mg and then 60mg daily doses, and while it helped a bit it wasn't great and mostly just gave me overall energy, but not necessarily mental efficiency. It also gave me heart palpations and tachycardia. Then i switched to 20mg Adderall XR twice daily about 12-18 months ago, and it seems about the same as the Vyvanse. I later added 80mg Straterra as well, with no perceivable difference to me (maybe more irritable?). Good energy booster, and it seems to help motivate me, like beginning difficult or monotonous tasks (aka homework) isn't climbing mount everest anymore, but the palpations and tachycardia are still there. It does seem to have slightly helped my working memory (sometimes), concentration (sometimes), and motivation (consistently, but not totally).

I had adult ADHD so my mind would try to focus on multiple things at once and it would overload. For the first few months the medication was great.The last year and half has gone from good times to a living hell. I upped my dose from 20 mg to 20 mg and 15 mg in the afternoon. That is when the living hell began.It made me feel like the world around me didn't matter. The only two things I cared about were my grades and my girlfriend. Everything else was non existent in my mind. I started losing friends left and right, I became a lot less sociable, and my parents knew something was up. When my only other friends I had told me what they noticed, the medication made me not believe them and I then became very paranoid.I thought everyone around me was an enemy looking to make my life miserable someway or another. My anxiety levels skyrocketed and I always had my head on a swivel. It was a terrible way to live life. I even started thinking my girlfriend was up to no good when she wasn't around me so I started becoming clingy to her.Thank God I stopped taking this medication. I found self worth in myself again and I my ex friends became friends with me again. Everyone in my life noticed a great difference and that's when I realized I needed to stop taking this medication.My advice, &quot;DON'T TAKE THIS MEDICATION UNLESS YOUR ADD/ADHD IS RUINING YOUR LIFE.&quot; And if you have to use this medication, make sure you use it only on the days you need to concentrate.

I was never hyperactive, don't currently have difficulty reading or focusing on specific tasks. I do however, tend to hyperfocus, don't like interruption and don't transition very easily. I also don't like a lot of activity and noise as that affects my ability to focus. At times, my mind is being barraged with a bunch of external and internal stimuli. It becomes too much and I will get irritable and react negatively to my family. It's not the way I feel inside, but it's all right on the surface trying to defend my focus. It has evolved into a degree of anxiety and depression about the inability to soften the impact of stimuli. I was starting to get more and more down, more withdrawn, and dark. I tried some of the anxiety/depression medication like Zoloft (a year and a half), but I felt more anxiety from them. I am not sure the Zoloft ever worked for me at all. I finally decided one day to try my daughter's Adderal (she also has ADD). The difference was significant. 80% of the negative stimuli dissipated and was replaced with positive feelings... confidence, patience, peace. Everything became more manageable and I felt a lot more normal. So after a couple months on Adderal XR25, it is working pretty well... not perfect, but a lot better. I also tried Focalin and was initially prescribed Vyvanse. The Vyvanse laid too heavy on me and I felt out-of-body. The Focalin was better, but the Adderal XR25 seemed the best fit.

I like Adderall XR because it lasted longer than the Ritalin, therefore I didn't have the up down up down feeling.  Adderall is a smoother transition too.  Of course it is not a cure all.  I still watch what I eat, work on time management, and do the occasional talk therapy.  I have also been the subject of multiple studies on ADHD since I was &quot;raised on Ritalin&quot; here it what I learned.  I am more prone to Alcoholism, I am more prone to &quot;falling in love&quot;, I am more prone to acting out my anger.  Actions and feelings are easy impulses but my ADHD is not an excuse.  My mind understands, what has been so hard is to delay the impulse whether I am on medication or on a medication vacation.  I take 30mg of Adderall XR in the morning, 30 mg of ritalin in the afternoon, 80 mg of Straterra, and 300mg of Wellbutrin.  All this Medication in one day so I take med vacations in order to lower my tolerance.  Funny thing is I am only diagnosed with ADHD.  Believe me Doctors have tried to find some other condition bc ADHD usually is combined with &quot;something else&quot; but I am a classic ADHD case.  Getting meds for ADHD is easy now adays what is hard is taking responsibility for your treatment after your diagnosis.  I quit drinking, have taken the anger and time management classes, and married a man I respected.  I also don't use my ADHD as an excuse in my professional life, my employeers don't need to know my personal life.  Finally Yoga has had a great affect on my ability to focus, HUGE.  I hope the people who are ADHD make it clear to their Doctors that the H means hyperactive NOT manic.  I have experienced too many non ADHD doctors who are ready to label and prescribe the newest &quot;condition&quot;.  I don't have much respect for the medical communities understanding of ADHD.

Concentration was never really a problem for me. In school I often got in trouble for shouting out answers without being called on. Also before I started Adderall I almost always reacted before I thought, and said and did a lot things that I regretted later. Now I usually think out actions before I act, so I get in a less fights now. The only drawbacks to the medication are because it is extended release you HAVE to remember to take it early in the day or else you will be up like all night. Also  probably the only real side effect that bothers me is the apetite reduction. But I have found the best way to get around that is eat a good breakfast before you take it, and have some healthy snacks around the house for when the medicine wears off night so you can have something to eat. Overall I am very satisfied with Adderall xr and a pleasant surprise was if I woke up too late and didn't take it  I didn't experience any major negative consequences, but I did have to try a little bit harder to make sure I was thinking before I spoke.",effectiveness: 5, ease_of_use: 5, satisfactory: 5, created_at: '2011-08-27 22:01:49', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-63164-Adderall+XR+Oral.aspx?drugid=63164&drugname=Adderall+XR+Oral&pageIndex=11&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

I have known that something wasn't right with me since I was very little but I have parents who were in denial and too afraid of stigmas and what other ppl think about them to have had any help until now. With Adderall so far I have noticed that altho it definitely helps my concentration/focus/motivation it causes me to hyperfocus (act OCD) about certain things, my anxiety is worse, and I get mean and brutally/cruelly honest with those around me at times. I've also noticed that I talk to myself more often (which I've always done to a certain extent; like when I'm frustrated, doing math, or figuring something out)but now is more noticeable. I also have very bad dry mouth, an unquenchable thirst, and chapped lips. I can't go anywhere without a bottle of water and chapstick now. Otherwise, the sleep problems and loss of appetite went away after the first 3 days. Right now I'm in the 'deciding' phase trying to figure out if the benefits outweigh the side effects. I know that I have to continue some sort of medication along with my cognitive behavioural therapy because I can't function at normal expectations at this point otherwise but I'm uncomfortable with some of the possible side effects and the idea of becoming dependant. I have a history of street drug use(I self-medicated as a teen/young adult) and altho I have been clean for years I am always very careful and afraid of becoming that person again. Up until recently, I had only heard positive things about Adderall but now I'm not so sure.

After a sleep study followed by a nap study to rule out narcolepsy, my pulmonologist deemed it not narcolepsy and started me on Provigil to see if conditions improved. Soon my need exceeded the maximum dose and he switched me to Adderall XR. I now take 60mg a day before bed. Yes, before bed. Taking the pills the morning didn't really work when I couldn't wake up to take them. I sleep wonderfully and after a couple years of taking this have finally established a routine sleeping schedule. I go to sleep every night at around 10-11pm and wake up at 6am every morning WITHOUT an alarm clock.Since taking this pill, I've benefited nicely by some of it's other side effects mostly relating to learning capacity. I've never been one for reading, mostly because I'd fall asleep, but now, I'll read through an interesting text book like it was a novel.A side effect I wish I had was decreased appetite and weight loss. Since this pill, I have gained 40-50lbs. Probably because I spend most of my spare time advancing in non-physical activities. If only a mental workout burned more calories.Some really bad side effects include withdrawals. DO NOT stop taking this pill before speaking to MD. Imagine how bad you were before and double it; if you didn't have depression before, you will. Because this Med is a Class 2 in the US, it is highly controlled, very hard to refill and not run out. Talk to your MD about a backup MD when that one is out. There are no refills, you must have original signature (no faxing), maximum is 30 days per RX, and they can only release the RX one week prior to running out.
