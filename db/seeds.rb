Not quite enough mg's to get through day but better than the &quot;2 pot a day&quot; coffee habit that I had before. I did not seek treatment until 30 years of age and so I did not take Ritalin until then.  At 30yrs of age I finally had a neuropsyc exam to see if there were any learning disabilities.  Diag'ed with ADHD but also with assessed IQ at above 90% of population.  ADD is real and any who doubt it have no clue.  It's a shame they can't experience it for one day.  It was not until the neuropsyc exam, resultant ADHD diagnoses, and Ritalin script; that I found peace.  Prior to I might as well have had an IQ of 50.  This whole time I thought that I was below average IQ &amp; ability.  I barely grad'ed H.S.  At this time my social skills were poor, I had great hyperactivity, and also no ability to focus.  Resultant poor self-esteem leading to anger/frustration and then illicit drug use to &quot;self-medicate&quot; as they say. My life was problematic before due to impulsivity as well and the usual inability to focus. Everyone around me would joke of ADD but I didn't take it seriously. After starting Ritalin I am now a college student w/3.0 avg GPA in the hardest Mathematics sequence that exists on this planet. God Bless Ritalin. I hope that parents out there with a kid who fits this description of my past doesn't fall victim to the hype that this drug is destructive. Sure, any substance can be misused.  However, if a doc recommends it for these symptoms in a person, it's worth a shot; a shot at life.

I graduated high school with a 1.2 G.P.A, barely getting by. Stupidity was acceptance when it came to my self image. I am currently in college finishing up my degree with a 4.0. G.P.A. Not bad considering I was expelled from my first high school and maintained less than C average most of my life. It causes some jitters at first, like way to much coffee jitters, but that subsides over time. It pulls your focus so you stay in 1 lane at a time by filing your thoughts. It feels good to finally see your mind as a gift instead of a curse. Afterall, we are some quick thinkers, so just imagine being able to organize all those precious thoughts to be saved for the right time and place.

I was diagnosed with ADD my senior year of college (over 10 years ago) and had been taken Ritalin ever since.  I agree with all the comments about experiencing the jitters and how you can operate with little sleep.  Despite the side effects, it was a miracle!  I had always taken the max dosage 20 mg/x3.  Over the years I started to see a decrease in effectiveness and even tried other drugs - strattera, adderall, wellbuterin...nothing as effective as ritalin.  Even now I feel somewhat addicted and have even exceeded the max dosage signifcantly.  (For those others who had concerns - ritalin is addictive, esp mentally in my case.)  Needless to say, I've gotten off of it completely for approximately 2 months.  I've been struggling like all of us with true ADD, but I had to prove that I could function without it.  For those of you in the same boat as me, take a break from it.  Once you get back on the ritalin after a break it becomes more effective again. (Just make sure you regulate yourself...I have to divide up my doses by week, and hide the rest.  If I run out then I have to make do without!)  Hopefully this helps!  (Please share your experiences here if anyone knows of anything else that helps with ADD/Depression.)

The upside: The drug works quickly! in 15 to 20 minutes I was ready to go. It kept me alert, and when I got the proper sleep, works very predictably, and is easy to take. Now the downside: The drug is very ADDICTIVE! I was on a very high dose (20 MG 3 X's per day)and when it wore off...WATCH OUT! Not only were the Narcoleptic symtoms of tiredness coming back, but I was also &quot;Coming Down&quot; After many years my wife and I determined that arguments between us occurred most frequently when I was due to take my medication. I was &quot;Coming Down&quot;! The medication IS MOODS ALTERING! After many years I noticed it had an effect on my nervous system, that included muscle spasms when falling asleep (Medium severity)and an extreme sensitivity to certain loud noises when tired. Hands clapping when I was tired, could send me through the ceiling. It was a rollercoaster. You went up fast...and came down hard!     I know this because I was &quot;Weaned&quot; off of Ritalin to Provigil. It took me 6 weeks to &quot;De-Tox&quot; For my family...it was hell! Daddy is reducing his meds today....STAY AWAY! After about a year off the drug, The muscle spasms stopped, and the sensitivity to noises mostly sub-sided. Awareness to these facts are important. Now do not get the wrong impression here. If other drugs are not do-able, for whatever reason. For the person with Narcolepsy this drug is a GOD-SEND! It works! It's better than a life spent fighting to stay awake...and failing.

My mood has been so much more calm and my angry outbursts have practically gone completely away.  I do find that I am a little more tired but my increase in mood helps me to overcome that.  No trouble going to sleep but staying asleep is the problem.  I find I am a little more jittery than usual, again not a big deal.  I still forget things on a daily basis, but not near as much as before.  My husband has even noticed a change in my mood, for the better.  I find that it is easier for me to stay on task at work and to prioritize my work more effectively.  I still find myself being distracted a little, but not as much as before the medication.

They sell the medical unthinkable as a disease.Grief and mourning are now being transformed and given the status and the statute of a neurobiological illness  (PGD, Prolonged Grief Disorder). &#171; Work &#187; is also done to force pregnancy to be conceived as a medical-pathological &#171; disorder &#187;, so that pregnancy can be treated with preventive drugs against post-natal depression. The advantage would be that premature babies (bingo!) with osteoporosis (bingo!), will be born with withdrawal symptoms (bingo!) and that mothers will have to continue their taking persistent doping (bingo again!).The allergy of the multidisciplinary team (PPHS, Projected pedagogical helplessness syndrome) against a normal child behavior appears to be an incurable disease. PPHS has the same symptoms as ADHD.But the &#171; children &#187; are treated as supposed to be suffering from ADHD.The allergy itself is questionable, especially when the &#171; patients &#187; were trained to manage this allergy.That alienation is to be considered to be a crime because the kids can not resist.But what initially was considered as medically unthinkable, takes now only 1 moment of decision. There is nothing medically wrong with these three examples.Up to this point the patients are medically speaking  perfectly OK, (but this is but a small detail).To speak in terms of a neurobiological disorder is premature.Treatment itself is making the disease the alleged disease.Indeed, no doctor,  neither a real nor a psychiatrist, has explained the mechanism that doping would mobilize  immeasurable and alleged deficiencies of dopamine, serotonine, norepinephrine, etc. All the myths about these biochemical molecules are presented as scientific dogmas.Indeed : how can SSRIs , such as Prozac and  Strattera 'selectively' treat  the dopamine deficits in ADHD?Selectively releasing serotonine by massive dose",effectiveness: 1, ease_of_use: 1, satisfactory: 1, created_at: '2009-09-22 03:57:24', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-9475-Ritalin+Oral.aspx?drugid=9475&drugname=Ritalin+Oral&pageIndex=24&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

After about 3 days I could notice a big difference in my ablility to focus and concentrate.  After a week I moved up to 10mg twice a day and then 10 mg three times daily.  I experienced some of the side effects; dry mouth, not hungry, sleeplessness, racing pulse and higher blood pressure, tiredness.  Sleeplessness AND tiredness, well after taking the first dose you hit your peak after about 1-2 hrs and then come back down(crash) which tires you out, take the next dose and go back on that rollercoaster.  I finally figured out how to space my doses out so it would be worn off by the time I needed to get to sleep and for me that was taking the last dose by 3pm so I could hit the sheets by 10pm.  I hated that roller coaster ride so I talked with my doc and he put me on 20mg extended release that I take twice daily.  The effect lasts between 4-8 hrs.  I get up at 5am for work and then go to night school and am home by 930.  Long hours to be needing focused and the extended release is the perfect fit for me.

I also find that if i TRY (purposely) thinking about anything...i can't. Unless whatever im thinking about is visible or if im talking about it, i can't think ahead to plan anything. i cant think things over in my head. i HAVE to verbalize it or be actually doing it. i dont like that aspect. i almost feel like my thoughts are in a rubber band and as i try to think about something outside of what's visible or what the conversation around me is, it gets snapped back and im forced to think about the present. i know thats part of the reason for taking the medication, but i cant sit in my own thoughts, at all. any suggestions or help?",effectiveness: 4, ease_of_use: 5, satisfactory: 3, created_at: '2010-05-06 15:59:17', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-9475-Ritalin+Oral.aspx?drugid=9475&drugname=Ritalin+Oral&pageIndex=17&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

I finally started a combination of Trazadone and Welbutrin, while this helped some I still felt that something was missing, still felt lethargic, and still working on the depression. Worst of all the Welbutrin caused me to become mentally unfocused, and my mind was wandering constantly. It was, however the only drug that had helped me at all. I then was prescribed Ritalin in addition to those. Wow is it exactly what I had needed. I have been able  to keep my focus, able to have enough energy to get through a standard day and not want to hide from the world. For the first time, I have actually been feeling good. I honestly feel like I have found a miracle combination for what was troubling me. I have noticed no negative side effects. the only down side is that after about 6 hrs or so of taking it I begin to feel a slow down, or crash. As if I hadnt taken it at all.

I started on concerta ER, which was perfect, no side effects, no notice at all in change of behaviour. lost my insurance and could no longer afford it. its 135 without insurance! so i had to switch to generic ritalin, I take just 10-20mgs,the smallest dose avail. If i have a busy day or meetings, ill take the 20, but usually just a 10mg dose is good. I dont feel or notice anything at all, but I do know it works because im able to focus, work, and i don't forget things or my mind doesn't wander. Scary moments like forgetting my 8 mnth old son on by bed and he rolls off it on to the floor. NOT GOOD! LUCKILY bed is close to the floor and we have thick carpet and he just kind of slid off it, but still reminded me that I have to be more alert and if im watching him myself i take larger dose. It does wonders. Sometimes Ill have these weird panic attacks in middle of the night. I wake up alarmed, with a sense of doom or that im dying or choking, but then i realize in 5 seconds or so that im just having an episode or dream and that I'm fine. I get a drink of water and go back to bed. see your doctor to try different doses or even different meds, but it takes few weeks to settle in and get used to. you can't make decisions based on just a week of use or a few days. hope this helps.",effectiveness: 4, ease_of_use: 4, satisfactory: 4, created_at: '2011-10-04 010:47:23', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-9475-Ritalin+Oral.aspx?drugid=9475&drugname=Ritalin+Oral&pageIndex=8&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

Head doc diagnose me with add and gave me strattera. didn't know much about it but it turned my life around.

Body doc told me to stop, and the head doc started me down the road of lexapro and other meds that made me not give a damn.  Got off those after my house went to crap...and wasted 8 years of my life.  Recently started screwing up at work, and relizing I couldn't get anything done outside of work, went back to my 3rd head doc and ask for generic add med. He tried to put me on prozac, saying it was the same as ritalin, adderall, but I wasn't buying it.  He put me on 30 mg ritalin and what a help! First day I notice I was slowing down, not making the mistakes I once made, taking care of my home and myself on only 2 5 mg dose. I like that you can cut the instant release pills in half, I have for months settled on taking 10 in the morning and 2 half throughout the day.  That is all I need, no side effects, I like that I can take only what I need unlike stattera and adderall which you are stuck with the dose and side effects.  No dry mouth, dribble peeing, or obsessive thoughts as with stattera.  Course maybe I was on too high a dose with stattera, who knows?  Just hate that I have to see the doc every month, wish he could do refills so i could cut back on visits, wait times are an hour or more.
