does absolutely nothing I have found ibuprophen to be asolutely useless to regular headaches as well as migraines.  It's a horrible feeling to have taken it only to have your headache increasing worsen knowing you cannot take anything effective for a few hours.Getting to a migraine a.s.a.p. is the key.  You cannot wait it out.  Ibuprophen in my experience is only helpful with menstrual cramps.  It doesn't even touch the pain of a migraine or tension headach for me.

Better than Narcotics Ibuprofen 800mg works better for me than most narcotics without the space cadet feeling.  Ibuprofen 200mg does nothing at all.  The only problem is that it tears up my stomach. I'm on Prevacid anyway so it's not a biggie.  I use this for breakthrough pain along wih Ultram.

Not Great for this Pain Advil seems to only work on my headache pain.  It is a good back up to other pain meds that I have.  But I could never get pain relief from just the advil.

Worked, but caused stomach problems I havent taken Brufen for a few years now but, when I did, I found it to be very effective as both a pain relief drug and an anti-inflamatory. I also found it to be very useful as an efficient treatment for a fever, on those rare occasions when I caught a bad cold or flu. So, as a useful drug for the treatment of the pain and inflamation caused by osteoarthritis, I found Brufen to have a very definite plus side. I would actually rate it fairly high on a scale of one to ten, probably about an eight.Unfortunately, I happened to be one of those people who has a rather sensitive stomach and duodenal lining so, if I take the drug on a regular daily basis, I very soon develop gastrointestinal problems including oesophogeal reflux (heartburn), peptic and duodenal ulcers (in less than 2 weeks). Even on regular anti-ulcer medication the Brufen still gave me problems. After having recurrent ulcer problems, which eventually led to a gastroscopy, I was taken off Brufen. In most cases it does, however, help to alleviate the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects if the drug is taken along with food and certainly make every effort to avoid taking Brufen on an empty stomach. I also understand that it is not advisable for anyone suffering from asthma to use Ibuprofen whether in pill or external gel form.I was also, however, given to believe that Brufen, at prescription strength, is an excellent, and highly sought after, treatment for hangovers. Although I didnt really imbibe enough at that time for it to be necessary to test this fact out for myself, I was assured of this by numerous, envious friends who wanted to pocket a few from my prescribed allowance! (This was prior to Brufen becoming available over the counter.)Take care now. Love and light to all.

I also understand that it is not advisable for anyone suffering from asthma to use Ibuprofen whether in pill or external gel form.I was also, however, given to believe that Brufen, at prescription strength, is an excellent, and highly sought after, treatment for hangovers. Although I didnt really imbibe enough at that time for it to be necessary to test this fact out for myself, I was assured of this by numerous, envious friends who wanted to pocket a few from my prescribed allowance! (This was prior to Brufen becoming available over the counter.)Take care now. Love and light to all.

Ease Potential Liver Problems For those who are taking interferons ( like myself), it would be better for you and better for your liver if you did not take Ibuprofen and instead opted for a different pain reliever such as Advil. Also, Advil does not have other harmful side effects that other various pain relievers might behold.

ibuprohen works when i can't stand the pain...can't take perscrips. so better than nothing...dulls it, doesn't remove it but can make the difference between functioning and not functioning. nothing but Motrin works as well for me.

Not the right drug for migraines For years I tried to manage migraines with OTC meds. I finally started going to doctors only to discover I was probably exascerbating the problem. With ibu I almost always have stomach upset, and it rarely knocked out a headache unless taken right away with Tylenol.

Advil Advantages Advil was the first thing I ever began treating migraines with.  The advantage is that it's fairly inexpensive, and easy to get.  However, it only worked for me if I caught my migraine extremely early, and then immediately laid down and stayed there.  I have come to prefer other treatments over Advil, but this is a good fall-back for me if I don't have access to those other treatments.  It's effectiveness for migraines is wanting, however, if all you have is a normal tension headache, this is a great remedy.

I started taking Advil in 3rd grade. I started taking Advil in 3rd grade, with Drs permission of course. Back then it did dull the pain. The pain never really went away though, no matter what OTC I took. Once I reached ninth grade I started alternating Advil with other meds like Tylenol hoping to find the right mix. I never did and now I have given up on OTC's completely. Now I work closely with my neruo and take Topamax daily.

600 mg 2 times a day at the start of the cycle Very helpful. Especially, if you also use a heating pad &amp; relax while it kicks in. Sometimes, need 800 mg, but rarely.

Ibruprophen I found this otc pain reliever to be the most helpful for some of my pain.  Muscles and headaches.  It didn't help when my feet,ankles,fingers or hips would flare up.  What I would say is that ibruprophen helps with inflamation and muscle cramping, but fails to be a good choice for severe pains of fms.

It works but I don't take it anymore Ibuprofen was the only thing getting me around for many years.  However toward the end, I noticed that the more I would use it, the worse I would feel (flare up).  If I could go with out it, the next day didn't seem to be so bad. My nutritionist told me to immediately quit taking it when she found out I was using it, because she said it degenerates cartilage after long term use. So unfortunately, even though it works pretty well short term, I quit taking it.

Can destroy your stomach and liver Ibuprofen shouldn't be taken over long periods of time. It's good for a quick resource while searching for other options but it can seriously harm the lining of your stomach and cause liver damage. Over the counter meds are not as expensive as the doctor prescribed meds but are usually weaker and require more pills to get the same effect as those   prescribed by the physician.

Motrin 800 mg This is one of the many NSAIDs I've tried to help reduce the pain of my endo.  It does have a few advantages, although it didn't work that well for me.  The side effects (especially stomach irritation) seemed to be less with ibuprofen than with many of the other NSAIDs.  And the price can't be beat -- this stuff is cheap, particularly if you buy the over the counter generic, then take the dosage of that you've been prescribe (usually 3-4 tablets).I took this quite frequently when I was between doctors, and it did take the edge off the pain, although I personally find other NSAIDs to be more effective.  Perhaps this is because the prostaglandin inhibiting effect of ibuprofen is not as strong as some of the others.  Overall, it's good in a pinch, but couldn't come close to tackling the truly bad pain.  Still, it's much better than taking nothing at all.

Advil Ibuprofen - frequent urination bladder Ok, I know my ratings are quite low, but I want to drive home a point that Ibuprofen can be a dangerous drug (thousands die each year from bleeding in the stomach).  I do not recommend taking more than the 200 mg dose - if it does not work to reduce pain, see your Dr. - don't take more.Also, I would not recommend taking any pain medication unless it is chronic and is moderate to severe.  Miss a day of work if necessary.Briefly, I took 1000 mg of ibuprofen during a 10 hour period.  That night I experienced severe frequent urination (20x after going to bed - low volume on each void).  I had to some degree a urinary retention problem so this may have contributed to adverse reaction.  I repeated the same dose the next day and stopped.  I visited two urologists and did not receive appropriate treatment (each night I was getting up 10x per night - 120 days of little rest with no end in sight during the 120 days - I even agreed to surgery on my bladder neck during this time - made the problem worse.Finally, a third urologist prescribed Ditropan and it resolved the problem that same night - but I was in bad shape from what I considered as 120 days of torture.  In any event, stayed on Ditropan for about 3 months  - no longer taking Ditropan and frequent urination problem has not returned.  Still trying to overcome the damage that this stressful period had on me.

Ibuprofen is acidic and should not be used for IC Although Ibuprofen has anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties it is acidic and should be avoided if you have IC.  Please realize that meds can hurt the bladder even if they are anti inflammatories and this is one of them.  Be Careful!  It is on the list on Prelief's site....don't take Ibuprofen unless you have found it helps you (we are all different).  If you follow the norms with your IC diet most likely Ibuprofen will hurt you.

Advil, Motrin, etc.... I think I have tried most of the ibuprofens on the market - both standard and &quot;migraine&quot; forms.  In my teens I had been mistakenly diagnosed with sinus headaches instead of migraines.  I was in the habit of taking a Tavist and 4 Advil (Motrin, Tylenol, etc) every morning when I woke up and repeating the ibuprofen or acetominophen (whenever the ibuprofen wasn't as effective I rotated between Tylenol and Advil, etc) every 4-6 hours as needed.  I did this for years because I thought it was just something I had to live with - didn't most people have sinus headaches and go on with their daily activities??  I thought i was a wimp.  Later, a new DR. correctly diagnosed me with severe migraines and tension headaches.  He indicated to me that it was far better to take a single (or 2 in combination) prescription drug to prevent the migraines than to take this qty of ibuprofen etc on such a regular basis.  According to him, I was doing far more damage to my kidneys than necesssary and not truly getting the relief I needed.  He was very right.  I would suggest talking to your DR. and asking for better options.

Ibuprofen I have attempted many times to relieve my IC pain with Ibuprofen.  It is only effective with me in mild pain.  It does not do anything for me when I am in severe pain.  The good thing about this med is there are no side effects for me.

Hardly ever works I cannot say that Ibuprofen had never worked: because it has. To a degree. Normally it does nothing for me. It has occasionally happened that I took a large dose of Ibuprofen and my headache went away. But when it does, it always comes back and then more Ibuprofen is futile. Also even when it does work, I don't feel very normal. Sorry for the grim report.

Not For Me Advil  is just not for me for anything. I've tried it for some different illnesses but doesn't work. Stick with Aleve for fevers, Bayer for pain, and Midol for menstrual.

A Short Term Solution For women with mild endo ibuprofen can be very helpful, likewise if your endo is mild, you should find equal relief by good diet and moderate exercise and be able to forego the ibuprofen. But as the disease progresses or if you are in advanced stages, taking ibuprofen is like taking nothing. A lot of women take more than the maximum of over-the-counter pain-killers for their endo and this is tremendously damaging to your liver and stomach. If the maximum allowed dosage on the label is not helping you, please go to your doctor, do not simply double the dose yourself. (I speak from experience.)

Will tear up your stomach but helps some The ibuprofen has helped with some of the pain and inflammation and kept me from taking Percocet more frequently...BUT it will start to burn your stomach when you take it every 4-6 hours over a weeks time...even when taking on a full stomach

Advil Migrane LIQUI-GELS Lightning Fast!!!  The gel ones are great, though I find the regular type aren't.  I was unsure at first, but they worked long after Tylenol 3 stopped.  Take 2-3 every six hours, lying down after helps.  About 20 minutes I find until the headache starts to dissipate.  I recommend it to everyone.

Advil works on back pain I attended a school meeting in a preschool classroom where I spent two hours sitting in a very small child's chair.  The pain I felt for about one week afterwards required me to purchase a cane to aid in walking around.  Advil worked better than the heating pad or any of the patches I bought for the affected area.

Better than Prednisone! I use Ibuprofen and aspirin frequently for swelling.  It's amazing how after a dose or two the swelling nearly disappears. I have been taking Prednisone for nearly 7 years now and I despise the drug.  Rather than telling my doctor I'm having Edema (swelling) I just pop a couple of Ibuprofen or aspirins and the problem is taken care of.  Chances are, if my feet and ankles are swollen, I've been standing or walking for a significant amount of time and the swelling is not long term.  But I by far would recommend it for anyone who takes hundreds of dollars worth of medications such as I.  This drug is cheap, and very effective!

medication  review During periods of  extreme pain ibuprofen is not  effective at all.    I am 29  years old and  had my 2nd laporoscopy 3 weeks ago.  My endo was in stage III.  My left thigh is kind of numb and is painful and I  have  nerve damage in my right pelvic area where they made an incision.  My doctor tells me to take Ibuprofen and apply heat. I still have to sleep,  when I can, on my back.  Ibuprofen only works on slight  pain.   I wish doctors would take pain seriously and give medication to us who need it.  Pain causes depression when no one understands.

Ulcers and allergies I developed ulcers while using Advil. It also made my allergies worse, probably because it was contributing to leaky gut problems. It also didn't help much with pain. It seemed to have a rebound effect, where the longer I used it, the worse my pain levels got.

Ibuprofen and vitamin C? 800mg of Ibuprofen only helps with the headaches.  Endo pain is still there.   Doc told me to take 1 200mg Ibu with 1 500mg Vitamin C pill every morning and evening to help with constant bleeding and clotting.  Didn't work.  And was hard to remember to do.  And never did get an explanation as to WHY this would work.

Works every time! Advil always &quot;cures&quot; my headaches.  Even though the active ingredient is ibuprofin, generic doesn't work nearly as well as name brand ADVIL.  It works fast &amp; makes me feel so much better.  I usually take 2 tablets, but if I'm feeling really awful I've been known to pop 3.  Doesn't work for other parts of the body quite as well as it does for noggin pain.

Ibuprofen for pain I took ibuprofen for pain for a long time.  I did not experience any overt stomach/ulcer symptoms, but I did notice that I had to keep upping the dosage and finally it just lowered the pain instead of making it go away.  I quit shortly after I had surgery for chocolate cysts.  I found out several years later that they can be caused by hormone dysregulation due to long-term NSAID use.  I stopped using it because I was using an opiate pain reliever after surgery.  When I switched back to ibuprofen I noticed that there was an increase in the &quot;sick&quot; feeling.  I felt clogged up and yucky.
