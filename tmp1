Expensive, but effective treatment for panic I use this as an adjunct to Klonopin 2mg tid and Lexapro 10mg qAM for panic disorder. The Gabitril works like a charm! When I started it, it literally was like night and day... It can cause a &quot;spacey&quot; feeling, but it is great in calming and preventing spontaneous attacks. As noted below, Gabitril IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE for other remedies -- even as an anti-seizure drug, it is intended to be taken with other drugs. If your doctor prescribes this as a sole treatment or replacement, that is a bad prescription. It is an adjunct -- an enhancement -- and it works.

You might as well buy a six pack Seriouslly, this is either a hit or miss drug. I call it the &quot;big tease&quot; because it works for about 20 days and then stops. Also, I can't seem to find any reason to pay $40 per bottle on these guys when I could buy a six pack to reach the same effects. Origanally I wanted to try this because I had a lot of success with gabbapentin ( which was also a tease, but it worked for two years). Boy was I wrong. This drug just makes you feel wierd, and a little bit parinoid. Who knows, maybe it's good for you, but the risk of seizures assoiated with it and the nast side affects are enough to make me stick with the benzos.

Gabitril will be the savior medication for GAD I took every traditional cocktails of anti-depressants and Tranquillizers for years. ...long story...I ended up at Mayo clinic, who were not yet aware of the success with Gabitril. I spend 3 years and thousands of dollars and was ready to die many times. Then finally almost by accident a doctor asked if I wanted to try Gabitril. &quot;Sure, might as well be able to say I tried everything.&quot;Well, I was much better in 4 days and then felt cured within a month, then with dosage increases I felt totally normal again. As if I'd awken from a coma. It gave me a second chance to live and be happy.

hangover anyone? My doc gave me this to help me stay asleep (still waking up with seroquel at 50mg); it added to the morning hangover and I felt sort of dizzy.  Didn't do much for keeping me asleep either.  I still have some issues with anger, so not sure if it affected that or not. Sex drive? What IS that? Stopped taking it.

Great add-on. I took Gabitril for a couple of years in conjunction with Lithium and Lamictal for rapid cycling Bipolar. It worked great. I never had any side effects and it was easy to take. I finally ended up stopping it merely because between my high dosages of Lithium and Lamictal and medications for allergies and asthma, I was taking too many pills per day. I shut down and stopped taking everything, bad idea! When I was put back on meds I went with a different regime altogether. I would take Gabitril again if I needed it.

Great Sleep Aid I have been taking Gabitril for almost a year and it has been great.  I started with a dose of 4 mg and gradually moved up to a dose of 12 mg. At the time I started, I was using 200 mg. of Trazadone to get a restful night sleep, and was starting to find that it was not enough.  Now I only take 50 mg of Trazadone.  With 12 mg. of Gabitril as part of my nightly cocktail of medicines, my sleep is more restful than it has been in years.  My doctor also thinks it contributes to the reduction in my number and intensity of migraines.  I'm very happy with taking it.  I've never had problems with side effects.

gabitril was working, now not too well I have been on gabitril for about 18 months (8 MG/day).  I have bipolar disorder since I was 16 (30 years).  Severe anxiety has been a hallmark of my illness.  When it is not in check, I get severe headaches up the back of my neck, making it very stiff and hurtful.  Usually when my equilibrium is off it starts here with this symptom.  Over the last month, I have had increasing tension in the neck area.  I am taking Depakote (2000 mg and 300 mg of seroquel.  I have done very well on the 3 meds for a while but I am not doing well now.  Will call psych doc again but she is usually not much help--I usually figure out these things myself.  I was on klonopin for about 10 years (1.5 mg/day) and it did help me but left me pretty tired and sluggish.  I like the regimen I am on right now and thought Gabitril was the last piece in the puzzle.  Now I am not so sure.  Am going up to 12 mg, from 8 to 10 to 12 over 2 weeks.  The extra Gabitril is making me feel sluggish and hasn't helped the runaway anxiety.  I also take benadryl which helps with my stiff neck and loosens it up.  Last night I felt so bad I took 1 mg of klonopin and 5 mg of valium.  Slept for 13 hours and feel a little better today.  Anyone have any ideas on alternative medications for anxiety?  Just write back and email me.  Thanks!

Thank Goodness for Gabitril! About a year ago I had a sleep study done which revealed that I never entered into stage 3 or 4 sleep.  These are the deep stages of sleep, where muscle repair and growth hormone secretion occur.  My failure to enter these sleep stages greatly concerned my doctor at the time, who is one of the nation's top specialists in sleep medication.  He was adamant that I start taking Gabitril along with my other sleep medications because Gabitril is specifically designed to promote stage 4 sleep.  He warned me that it might take a few weeks for me to notice the full effects of Gabitril.  He was correct.  At first, I noticed little difference in my sleep.  However, after a while I began to find that I no longer woke up in the middle of the night.  I go to bed at 11:30, and my stages of deep sleep should kick in around 1-4 a.m.  Since starting Gabitril I NEVER woke up during this time period.  I have no dreams during this time period.  If someone tries to wake me up during this time period, they find it difficult.  All these situations point to the fact that Gabitril is indeed working to help me enter the stages of deep sleep that I had not experienced for so long.After taking the drug for a while, I have also noticed that I wake up feeling refreshed - as if I have truly slept fully.  Previously I would often wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed.  Muscle repair occurs during stage 4 sleep, and I have noticed that my body pain has also decreased since taking the medication.I have trouble discerning whether Gabitril helps me fall asleep, because I take it with several other meds.  I don't necessarily feel it makes me sleep longer either, it simply allows me to sleep more deeply.Ever since starting Gabitril, I know that even on my worst nights I will get at least 3-4 hours of deep sleep.  The medicine seems to ALWAYS work.  Also, I have not felt that its effectiveness has decreased at all over time.I am SO glad that Gab

Thank Goodness for Gabitril! About a year ago I had a sleep study done which revealed that I never entered into stage 3 or 4 sleep.  These are the deep stages of sleep, where muscle repair and growth hormone secretion occur.  My failure to enter these sleep stages greatly concerned my doctor at the time, who is one of the nation's top specialists in sleep medication.  He was adamant that I start taking Gabitril along with my other sleep medications because Gabitril is specifically designed to promote stage 4 sleep.  He warned me that it might take a few weeks for me to notice the full effects of Gabitril.  He was correct.  At first, I noticed little difference in my sleep.  However, after a while I began to find that I no longer woke up in the middle of the night.

Gabitril I started on a 2mg dose and then went up to 4mg. The next jump was to 12mg and it has done wonderfully. The key to Gabitril is to find the minimum dosage that works for you.

Not a Good Choice!! Doctors need to let people know that THIS DRUG CAN CAUSE SEIZURES EVEN IF YOU NEVER HAD ONE, ALSO IT CAN BRING ON WORSE PANIC ATTACKS. Now who would want that, I am tired of being a Human Guinea Pig for the Medical Profession-DO Not Take any drug without talking to the pharmacist and checking it out on the web, geez one disorder is enough to deal with add that to poor advise from a Doctor and wow you can actually get worse~scary at it's best!!!!

A Total Rage-Inducing Drug I HATE this stuff. I was on it for a couple of days, and suddenly, I began getting angry at EVERYone. At one point, I was so ticked off at nothing that I threw a plate into a wall (and I'm not a violent person!). My doc's advice was to increase the dosage. So he did. And I got more and more angry and incredibly sleepy. I couldn't function, and when I tried to, I could do nothing but be extremely angry about everything. So, no, this one isn't on my list of recommendables! But then, this is simply the reaction I had -- others may find it works great. It depends solely on your brain chemistry.

Used Gabitril  until Doctor said it wasnt safe I used Gabitril for about 6 to 8 months and at first it didnt work well at all I was up to 16 mg and would fall asleep with no problem but would wake up at all different times of the night sometimes at 1:00am or 3:00am, 4:30am  and I would have to sit up and watch Tv for about an hour before I was sleepy enough to go back to sleep.  Then after a while I was sleep normally but if I tried to lower the dosage and ween my way off the drug I would be right back at square on of interrupted sleep and I would have to go back to 16mg again and wait for that to start helping me sleep better again.   NOW I am on Klonopin and I feel the best I have felt in years.  But you have to know how to use klonopin. Dont treat it like a sleeping pill like ambien or something like that.  I take the wafers version.

It Almost Had Me Fooled I was put on Gabitril in order to stem side effects from going off Klonopin, as a sort of methadone to Klonopin's heroin. I gradually decreased my Klonopin dosage while increasing the Gabitril. When I finally went off the Klonopin, however, I went into a state of crazy anxiety that had been building the whole time I'd been decreasing. In short, the Gabitril didn't do its job, and now I'm back on the Klonopin, WITH the Gabitril and have to taper off the Gabitril as well! Plus, I'd say it's the Gabitril that's making me listless, inarticulate (I'm a writer, and this is an extreme liability), spacy, generally feeling &quot;confused&quot;--side effects I never thought I'd give credence to, because they seem so weird and nebulous, but I feel like I'm unable to express myself, unable to exercise intention, somehow. It's not pleasant, it doesn't make a good impression. Gabitril hasn't shown me anything really great--and it certainly doesn't help with sleep.Oh! And somehow it's $60/month with my insurance. It's &quot;non-formulary,&quot; which is just another major inconvenience.

Not recommended - Rebound Effect Been on Gabitril for a few months for GAD/PTSD. Having tried several combos of all types of meds, I needed something to control SEVERE anxiety that was worse mid-morning and at night. The dosage I was on (8mg at night, 2mg in the am) seemed to take the edge off and at least allowed me to sleep without additional drugs (YEA!) most of the time. I had been on Neurontin for YEARS and that did NOTHING compared to Gabitril. It didn't help with my depression.  After 5 months of being on this, I began to have like a rebound effect- shaking, scared, crying, depressed, couldn't sleep. The end came when my husband came home and found me on the couch in a sobbing heap shaking and too frightened to move. I had probably the worst anxiety attack In years. Hubby called my doc - the doc said stop the drug.  I am now on Lexapro with an occasional 1mg Ativan, and doing fine.

Gabitril I was given Gabitril to control the pain I had in my spine, neck, and arms. The dosage was 4 pills a day. The last time I used it, I became extremely confused and ended up having several siezures which landed me in the hospital. I had never experienced a siezure before and have not had another after stopping Gabitril. I still have some slight shaking in my arms and hands and now am more prone to headaches.

A Dumb Down drug--awful!!! Don't take this drug if you live alone.  I have been on this drug for 5 days with the following results:  Locked myself out of my car at the grocery store.  Wandered the store looking for dropped keys, then found them in my pocket.  Left home in 32 degree weather, drove 10 miles before realizing I had forgotten my coat.  Left on gas burners on my stove after cooking lunch and went for a walk.  Took my dog for a walk to the river, but halfway there realized I had on a jacket, muffler, gloves and HOUSE SLIPPERS!!!!  It was 30 degrees out.  Found myself sitting and staring at the wall one day, wondering how long I had been there.  This is not normal behavior for me. It's a NIGHTMARE!!!!  I am taking myself off this drug.  Hopefully the fog will lift soon. If you want to try this drug, be sure you take a compass or a friend with you when you leave home.

gabitril works well for sleep I have had little success with sleeping pills except for seroquel which the side effects out weighted the benefits, so I needed to switch to something else. My doctor said that any benzo type sleeping pill wouldn't work because of my high tolerance to benzo due to taking large doses of klonopin and xanax for years to control anxiety, so he suggested I try gabitril.  He started me on 4mg at night and said I could increase the dose until it was effective. I took the 4mg for two nights with no success so I started to increase my dosage until I reached an effective dose of three 12mg pills before bed (36mg). I have been on this dose for around three weeks with very good results. I am able to fall asleep within a hour of taking the pills and usually can sleep throughout the night. This has been the best alternative to seroquel that I have tried. A couple things I noticed when starting this medication is that when I increased the dosage by 12mg each time I would feel off balanced for about two days, but the side effects didn't cross over to the next day and it was not extreme enough to worry about. My doctor told me that people can take 2mg and sleep while others need up to 60 mg so take it easy when you start off by using a small dose and don't get frustrated if you don't see improvements in sleep with your initial dosage just keep increasing your dose until its effective and probably don't try increasing your dose by 12mg because of potential side effects that might occur from that large of an increase in dosage (I have high tolerance for medications and always consult with your doctor before changing dosage).

helpful adjunct Does not -put- me to sleep, but seems to reduce my pain and startle reflex.  Was initially quite miraculous, but after a month or more of use, gave me a &quot;drunk&quot; feeling.Encouraged a companion to substitute gabatril for klonopin; resulted in said companion proceeding from a slightly blissy outlook on life to real meanness; it made them mentally sharper, perhaps, but it brought out a basic personality disorder.

NOT a mood stabilizer i work in the mental health industry and the drug reps for gabitril repeatedly ask clinicians and psychiatrists &quot;PLEASE do not use this medication as a mood stabilizer&quot;however, i am bipolar and have been taking it nightly now for months.while i attribute my mood stabilization to lamictal, i have incredible anxiety and insomnia problems and have found that gabitril helps immensely with these problems.(funny, that's EXACTLY what the drug company says it's for - also marijuana cravings apparently but that was never my problem.)if you are bipolar w/ anxiety and/or insomnia, definitely consider gabby but make sure you are on another tried-and-true mood stabilizer.also, is VERY pricey unless you have good medical insurance.

short term good; long term not so good Gabatril was pretty miraculous to me at first, it made me less &quot;edgy&quot; and relieved some pain.  I increased my dose from 1 to about 4mg/day. Itwas particularly good in being non-sedating to me.After the second month, I started getting this sort-of &quot;drunk&quot; feeling from it.  I still take little bits from time to time.I'm trying some at night to see if it improves my sleep.My S.O. of the time was taking Klonopin for shaking hands and for sleep; with my encouragement, changed to gabatril.  Personality went from sweet and a little dopey to smart and very mean; I had hoped for smarter and livelier, I had not expected the seizure-like anger.

Not much to say I hate to admit this but I don't know that much about Gabitril. I felt I should give it a short mention as it is part of the regime I'm doing so well on. My doc added it at a time when I was experiencing intense anxiety to, as he said, take the edge off. I am on a small dose and have not noted any difficulties. I have thought about dropping it, but I'm doing so well that I'm sticking with the mix I'm on for now.

Gabitril really works for Neuralgia I was on Neurontin 800 mg 4x per day for both FMS and unexplained neuralgia in my lower legs and feet.  This neuralgia got so bad that I would take my sedating meds when the pain got too bad for me to stand without becoming suicidal, so my doc prescribed Lidocaine patches when I took things into my own hands and sprayed Benzocaine along the nerve tracts, but this wasn't enough to quiet the fire in my lower legs.  That's when my doc switched me from Neurontin to Gabitril.The Gabitril actually extinguishes the fire along the nerve tracts and makes it possible for me to walk as much as I do.  I take 3 4mg tiny pills every 6 hours, and when combined with the Lidocaine patches, keeps me from going into suicidal pain levels every night.

An awful drug My husband took this for anxiety for approximately 1 month.  He turned into a complete zombie, staring off into space, barely speaking, taking no interest in anything (kids, work, etc.)  To make it all worse, he paradoxically couldn't sleep because he was still so anxious.  After telling his doctor about all this, he increased the Gabitril dosage and added Lexapro to the mix.  My husband was a complete mess -- he collapsed in the lobby on the way to an appointment to see a different doctor.  After going off the Gabitril, he was back to normal within about 36 hours.  He's still anxious, but no longer catatonic and anxious, which is much better.  He just started Paxil (with no other drugs), so we'll see how that goes.  I would never, ever recommend Gabitril to anyone.  I can't believe this drug is on the market.

This was a miracle for me! My arms and neck were hurting so much I would havea burning sensation all the time. It got so bad Icould not push the double doors at work open. I was crying when I told my rheumatologist how bad things were. I was very skeptical of this medicine but it'sbeen a miracle for me! I don't have any side effects from it other than a little extra sleepiness.If you're in a lot of pain and it's suggested to you by your dr, try it.

A Rather Weak Mood Stabilizer Gabitril was a big dissappointment.  I used it in conjunction with Lithium to treat Bipolar II.  I did not feel that it helped even out of my moods and I am so glad that I didn't rely on it without Lithium.  I got really bad vertigo and I always felt dizzy standing up.  It may be helpful for sleep and anxiety.

Doesn't work for me... Gabatril 8 mg. nightly does make me sleepy, but also very dizzy.  In fact, if I don't take it with food, I become extremely nauseous!  I have given this med a good 2 month trial and it's NOT helping to relieve my severe anxiety and certainly does NOT relieve depression.  It seems to be less effective every day if that's even possible!

Gabitril for bipolar II I have been taking this med for almost 2 years. I also take wellbutrin and celexa. The gabitril has helped my mood to stabilize significantly. I have dealt with depression since age 11, and antidepressants help with that, but taking an antidepressant without something to 'keep the lid on' just doesn't work for me. I also am an incredibly light sleeper. Gabitril has helped with that too. Virtually NO side effects. Once I accidentally took 2x my daily dose and had a very wierd, shaky, seizure-like (but NOT seizure) night.That's it. I'd be interested to hear if anyone else is using this med for dx of bipolar disorder.

SCARY side effect!!! Gabitril did absolutely NOTHING for my chronic IBS pain!  When I had increased the dosage to three pills a day, I started feeling VERY strange, out of it, like I wasn't myself.  Scariest was when I hallucinated in the middle of the night.  Things were crawling on my bed trying to get me!!!!  I felt like I turned into a giant obelisk, I kid you not!!! I stopped it immediately. Beware this drug!!!!!

Almost killed me!! I was directed to take one 4mg tablet twice daily for two weeks, then raise the dosage to 8mg twice daily.  Well, my very first 8mg dose first put me in a non-responsive catatonic state, then I started seizing after about 20 minutes.  I've never had a seizure before this.  Luckily my mother found me and called 911.  They weren't able to stop my seizing and I was in status epilepticus for three hours at the hospital.  They said I was very lucky to have lived.  I don't remember anything from about 20 minutes after taking that fateful dose onward, until I woke up in the hospital confused, sedated, and totaly unaware why I was there.

Am discontinuing use after about a month I originally wrote a good review of Gabitril for treatment of GAD, but after using for about a month have decided to discontinue its use.  The original intent was to taper off of Klonopin and go to Gabitril, but I was not receiving any of the benefits from Gabitril and had strong side effects of dizziness and disorientation.  It also seems to disrupt my sleep rather than help it.  I will either continue the Klonopin or try another anti-anxiety, such as Neurontin, at a later date.

May work when taken longer I took this for four days since Remeron made me gain 20 lbs in a month.  After four days my anxiety was so bad, I gladly went back to the Remeron.  Maybe it would work if I was able to stay on it for a longer period of time and increase the dosage.

I read how people are absolutely ecstatic about it, but I've never, out of trying it a half dozen times over the last couple years, had any results whatsoever...  And what part of the commercial makes any sense?  It shows bubbles being dissolved...  Does anyone other than me realize that you can't see gas disappear??  If the product worked, it would actually create a vacuum, and you definitely can't see a vacuum in a clear tube filled with air...  It just doesn't make any sense.

Gas-X Specifically, I use the store brand, 180mg capsules.  Though I seldom use it, when I do need it I know that I can really count on it.  It works quickly and effectively.  Really amazing, and such a relief!

geodon	Bipolar I disorder	2012-09-04 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	This has been my miracle drug. I would highly recommend it. All my manic episodises have stopped. I take 20 mg in the morn and 120mg at night. I am able to sleep good. I am able to function like a normal human being. I have noticed some weight gain.  This drug gave me my life back.
geodon	Schizoaffective disorder	2012-08-16 00:00:00		3.0	5.0	1.5	0.5	I was 114. When I started this med and now I'm up to 205 .you have to eat 500 cal with it or it won't work...I was taking it twice a day 80 mg...I had no side effects expect the weight gain...it also made me really lazy and just oI'm OFFDF and now and am pleased and waiting to loose the weight from this drug....I WOULD ONLY TAKE IT IF U HAVE A HIGH METABOLISM RATE...ALSO WHILE TAKING THIS MED I'M NOW ON LIPTOR AND HAVE BEEN FOUND BOARDER LINE DIBATIC TWICE...
geodon	Bipolar Disorder	2012-05-27 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	I was only taking Geodon for 3 weeks (tapered up to 60mg), and one evening I was sitting in front of my computer and experienced the worst panic attack of my life (also my first panic attack).  I was admitted to the ER that day.  I felt like I was about to have a drug induced psychosis.  My pdoc instructed me to stop taking it immediately.  The withdrawal was an absolute nightmare.  I experienced over 30 different symptoms (anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, paranoia, nausea, crawling skin, heart palpitations, chills, &amp; tingling just to name a few).  It has been almost 2 months and I am still stuggling with anxiety.  It is not getting better.  I was recently diagnosed with GAD &amp; panic disorder thanks to Geodon.  This is a dangerous drug.  Stay away from it!!  Now I am probably going to have to take a benzo for the rest of my life.
geodon	Bipolar Disorder	2012-05-25 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	4.0	5.0	I have tried many medications for bipolar disorder.  All had to be discontinued due to side effects.  Then I finally tried Geodon.  I have been on it for about a month.  This has been the best tolerated and effective drug for me so far.  It really stabilizes my mood shifts.  And I tolerate it well.  The major side effects for me are restlessness, anorexia (a welcome side effect!), a little anxiety, and morning drowsiness.  I went from taking this medication 40 mg twice a day to just 80 mg at night, and my morning drowsiness subsided.  I am glad I tried Geodon.  I hope its positive effects continue.
geodon	Bipolar Disorder	2012-05-16 00:00:00		2.5	0.5	3.5	0.5	these meds are horrible. I've gained so much weight and noneof it is coming off I have facial twitches and parkinsonian symtpoms I have to drink so my hands don't shake. Not worth it
geodon	Schizoaffective disorder	2012-04-19 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	2.0	5.0	this geodon drug was working really well at first when I was taking it with risperdal and paxil and lamictal but I remember feeling really bad at night back then. now I take 400mgs of lamictal and 180mgs of geodon at night and I feel a lot better usually but I can't remember anything from before I was in the hospital and maybe I was doing better back then and I got along with my friends and everyone all the time I'm pretty sure and never had a problem finding anything to talk about. but I go to university and haven't been eating almost anything for a year because this geodon gives me lack of appetite usually and so I'm too crazy now and really not feeling well and feel like I'm about to die soon or that something really bad might happen but maybe I'll add abilify and I might feel better. I can't even exercise cause I'm too tired but I'm 125 lbs now and I was 166 before taking geodon.
geodon	Bipolar Disorder	2012-04-04 00:00:00		1.0	1.0	5.0	1.0	Hi all, I want to share my horrible experience with Geodon.  I was hospitalized after a week at 60mg nightly.  I was having severe anxiety attacks, shaking/tingly hands and feet, a numb brain, intense paranoia that someone was out to &quot;get&quot; me, flu-like chills, an altered state of consciousness, and the feeling that I was going to absolutely lose my mind.  I also recall a few minor audible hallucinations.  This drug was an absolute nightmare for me.  These symptoms always happened when I needed my next dose.  I would not recommend this drug to anyone.  I decided to quit cold turkey on 60mg and I actually felt a lot better on day 1 after I stopped taking it.  This drug may be helpful to some, but it did not work for me.

geodon	Bipolar II disorder	2011-09-03 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	It took 15 years to find the right combination of drugs and stopping Wellbutrin and adding Geodon to a regimen of anti-depressants finally turned the trick. No manic episodes in the last 7 years. I take 160 mg at night with Elavil &amp; Abilify. I've not had a problem with my sleep although I see some people do. I highly recommend talking with your Dr. about Geodon. You will need insurance as cash cost is $739.00 at CVS. It took me a while to convince insurance company this was medically necessary but I'm glad I did!Side note: I had breast cancer and Geodon taken with Tamoxifen can be lethal. Fortunately there are other anti-cancer drugs available. It was suggested to me by the Oncologist that I discontinue Geodon but my Psychiatrist agreed with me that stopping Geodon would be worse than using other drugs to treat the re-occurrence issue of cancer.
geodon	Schizophrenia	2011-08-14 00:00:00		1.0	1.0	1.0	0.5	i have suicidal thoughts and a history of liver disease
geodon	Acute Psychosis	2010-10-17 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	5.0	I have had severe psychotic thoughts that make me cry so badly.  The Geodon makes it all stay away.  I'm on 180 mg a day.
geodon	Schizophrenia	2010-09-20 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	This drug works wonders for me. I take it twice a day, and am able to go to college. There's a little drowsiness but coffee sorts that out for me. When my hands are resting they give a little twitch, but other than that no side effects. Treats all my symptoms wonderfully. Watch your sugar intake because if I'm not mistaken it can cause diabetes later in life.
geodon	Bipolar Disorder	2010-06-11 00:00:00		4.0	3.0	5.0	5.0	when i first started on the drug it took awhile to work.  But after a couple months it turned out to be a life saver for 3 years.  the worst side effect i had was intolerable drowsiness with inability to sleep.  I tried going to class after taking one in the morning and couldn't concentrate at all because i was so somnolent.  I ended up taking 160mg at bedtime due to the drowsiness and this helped.  I did have difficulty sleeping for which i was put on many different sleep meds, but finally found a keeper with a combo of klonopin 1mg and melatonin (OTC) 3mg. I did have an exacerbation that came out of left field just last fall semester and was hospitalized for 3 days.  I had horrible hallucinations and felt possessed.  The only thing that took me out of it was persistent prayer to Jehovah in Christs name.  I had been paranoid when i had my first break down, but with prayer the paranoia vanished never to return.  God has proven to be my lifesaver.
geodon	Bipolar Disorder	2010-05-31 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	I have been on geodon for a little over 2 years.  It has really helped with my manic episodes.  I tried various antidepessants and mood stabilers before finding the right combo with geodon.  I take 120mg twice a day.
geodon	Bipolar I disorder	2010-05-06 00:00:00		1.5	1.0	2.5	1.0	Geodon did not work out for me. I was trying to get off Seroquel due to sedation and weight gain. My doctor quickly tapered me off Seroquel and on to Geodon, first 40 mg/day x 1 wk then 80/day. On the 40 I felt like it was nice to have my mind back and be more alert, and also my appetite seemed decreased, but on the 80 mg I felt absolutely completely knocked out; I could NOT keep my eyes open and had huge problems at work as a result. If I took it at night I could not sleep. Weird. I was told to stop it. When I did I had what I think was withdrawal--shakes, nausea, severe anxiety, headaches, etc. My doctor didn't think it was withdrawal but a Kaiser nurse did. Geodon robbed me of 8 days of my life. A friend of mine got manic on it. I don't think it's a good drug for bipolar.
geodon	Bipolar Disorder	2010-05-02 00:00:00		4.5	2.0	5.0	5.0	I suffered from 2 years of extreme depression.  I couldn't get up in the morning, hated my job and life in general.  I was both depressed and stressed out severely (anxiety).  My doctor had tried everything.  Nothing worked.  Finally I stormed into his office one morning and said, &quot;I've given you 2 years to address this issue and you've done nothing but let me suffer!  Every day is a chore to do anything!  I have no interest in anything, am a nervous wreck, am beginning to have health problems, and what have you done but take my money and sit back, trying this or that.  I know help is available and I should not have to suffer.  Either come up with a solution or I'm outta here.&quot;  He rolled his eyes back and finally said, &quot;Geodon has recently been approved for bipolar disorder.&quot;  He gave me a prescription (I now take 60 mg AM and 60 mg at noon -- I can't take it at night because it interferes with my sleep).  I've experienced an amazing transformation ... I enjoy life again.
geodon	Bipolar Disorder	2010-04-13 00:00:00		4.5	4.5	4.0	5.0	Geodon has changed my life for the better.  I expoerence some tierdness at times but it is worth it knowing that I can function like a normal person again.

I've had Tourette's syndrome comorbid with panic disorder since as long as I can medically remember. I am a 24 year old male and have recently decided to be more proactive about dealing with TS since my tics have become increasingly more intrusive in my life (specifically referring to motor tics while driving, almost getting into accidents.) My first line treatment was originally Seroquel 25mg, which did a fantastic job with the tics and it actually displayed some other effects that were positive - increased job focused, more even moods, etcetera. The only problem is that within 2 weeks, I had gained 6 pounds. I then switched to Geodon 20mg; it's pretty much even with the Seroquel in terms of treating the tics, although the side effect profile is quite different. I feel a bit more anxious while on this, but it's significantly less sedating than while I was on Seroquel.

For me, geodon was awful in one dose. Oh, was it horrid. In just one dose, I could tell it was horrid enough to go off. I had strange vision changes, which included light sensitivity, and everything seeming darker and hard to look at. I had severe akathesia, which is an inner sense of restlessness and need to move, and it made me so agitated that all I could do was sit on the floor and write in agony. It also made my legs start twitching of their own accord. It was so bizarre that I took two xanax to knock myself out and went to bed hours earlier just so I could stop feeling these symptoms. Thank goodness it had a short half life.I've heard equal parts horror stories and wonderful stories about this med, so it really is to each their own.So really, it might work fabulously for you, but it was rather disastrous for me.

Loved geodon while i was on it.  i took my does too late one night because i forgot to take it and remembered when i couldn't fall asleep.  took it at 1:00 am and the alarm went off at 6:00.  I took a shower and was getting ready to blow out my hair when i  passed out.  my husband took me to a cardiologist and they said to stop geodon asap as it was causing my ekg to be irregular.  Stopped taking it and experienced the worst hell of my life for six weeks:  insomnia, aggitation, sweats, headache, severe daily vomiting!!!!! the good news was that i lost 35 lbs in 5 weeks.  i have never been so sick and had to miss a lot of work and almost got fired.  DO NOT TAKE GEODON!

Loved geodon while i was on it.  i took my does too late one night because i forgot to take it and remembered when i couldn't fall asleep.  took it at 1:00 am and the alarm went off at 6:00.  I took a shower and was getting ready to blow out my hair when i  passed out.  my husband took me to a cardiologist and they said to stop geodon asap as it was causing my ekg to be irregular.  Stopped taking it and experienced the worst hell of my life for six weeks:  insomnia, aggitation, sweats, headache, severe daily vomiting!!!!! the good news was that i lost 35 lbs in 5 weeks.  i have never been so sick and had to miss a lot of work and almost got fired.  DO NOT TAKE GEODON!

Nope don't like it. It did not agree with me at all, not to say it might be a wonder drug for other people. Within 2 days of stopping, I feel calmer and much better. The problem began when I was screaming at my partner for no reason. It agitated the heck out of me, I saw a dark and scary side of myself. I slept way too much and felt impaired behind the wheel. Made me feel like I drank a pot of coffee and I couldn't concentrate. Kept salivating and makes you hungry all the time.

I casually mentioned to the doctor I saw occasionally for my ADD medication that I also suffered from clinical depression (sometimes diagnosed with bipolar disorder instead) and he did me the &quot;favor&quot; of adding an Rx for Geodon, which he told me would really do the trick.  I had been on Prozac, with pretty good results.My experience, on the very first dose, was a very negative one. That night, after taking the med, I felt unlike myself and vulnerable, was depressed, and was totally unable to function.  It felt like this state would persist forever.  Luckily I managed to hang in there for maybe eight hours until the effects wore off, and I was back to my usual self.  My guess is that if the effects had lasted for two or three days, I would have been suicidal.  This seemed like a total mindf**k, and I wondered if the physician--for some reason--had had it in for me.  .

This is the first medication I took after being diagnosed as Bipolar II. I was rapid cycling and had suicidal depression. My mood picked up and stabilized immediately, but after 2 days I started feeling very strange .. by the third day I felt like I had a stomach virus. I couldn't even drink water without vomiting that day. I would throw up at least a couple times a day for the couple of weeks I was taking it. The symptoms stopped immediately after stopping the medication. Might be better for others as this is a rare side effect, but for me it was obviously a deal breaker for this medication.

At first, I was not able to tolerate Geodon because I was taking an 80mg dose both morning and night. This made me too tired to function during the day. Then, I got my doctor to switch me to 20mg in the morning and 80mg at night, and that problem disappeared. Now, I take the nighttime dose 3 hours before I want to sleep and I always go to sleep right on time. Also (this was not true until after 4 weeks of treatment) I wake up feeling revitalized and ready to go. This regimen completely eliminates my bipolar mania and depression, my anxiety, and my occasional insomnia. Others often disparage Geodon, but they have not tried such a regimen as I am on. If you are bipolar, you owe it to yourself to give it a try. The only drawback is the massive cost, but luckily my insurance covers most of the cost.

I was in a hospital for suicidal depression  with some paranoia and delusions.  In the hospital, I took Ambien, and hallucinated.   Woke up, walls were breathing, unusual patterns in ordinary objects, auditory distortions, intense paranoia and delusions accompanied by feelings of unreality.   Put me on Geodon, had a complete removal of psychotic symptoms.  No hallucinations, intense paranoia, or feelings of unreality.  I am 99% stable, with no symptoms.  After your mood disturbance, your psychotic symptoms are supposed to stop.  Well, Im not experiencing any mood symptoms whatsoever, and if I skip a dose , I will get psychotic.  Im am worried about this, because, on Geodon, my psychotic symptoms are being &quot;controlled but not reversed.&quot; Recommend this medication for anyone whos dealing with psychosis, but be weary, I has an extremely short half life so you might want to take it two or three times a day, to avoid the peaks and troughs.

My son was 4 when the dr recomended Geodon for his aggression and irritability.  He did very  well on the medication, He was on 60mg for a while and is now decreased to 40mgs at night only.  We also put it in milk, a liquid would be good for children.  I would like to get him off of it even though it is working very well, the side effects and permanent side effects are very dangerous.

From day one all the way to month six I couldn't get out of bed in the morning. Slowed/slurred my speech for a few hours after I woke up. Made my movements and everything around me seem sluggish. Has a short half life, so I had to keep taking with food every six hours. The effects wore off quicker and quicker, and I was forced to take 300mg/day just to avoid the withdrawl symptoms. Eventually, it caused panic attacks and hypomania, and I had to be checked into the hospital to come off of it. Expensive too, would not recommend AT ALL. :(

I have been on Geodon for 2 years at a dosage of 320mg per day. I personally have had no side affects from this medication. It has helped with my obsessive thoughts in that it gives me the ability to stop the thoughts instead of going over them over and over in my head. I take this dosage 80 mg at 5pm then the rest at bedtime. I do this because I have more obsessive thoughts at 6pm to 7pm.

To be honest, my experience with Geodon was plain awful.  I was on it for about two weeks, and my Bipolar I symptoms became VERY pronounced.  The drug combination of Effexor XR and Neurontin I have been on for the last five years has had excellent results.  My psychiatrist about four years ago decided to take me off this combination and put me on Geodon because I was complaining about sleeplessness (that was before the addition of Trazodone to the combination).  I finally had enough, called the office to call in my old scripts, and fired that psychiatrist.  A later psychiatrist added the Trazadone for my sleeplessness and I have been happy ever since.  I'm glad Geodon works for others, but it made me MUCH worse.

I was given Geodon after a severe akathisia reaction to Abilify. Geodon caused the same awful reaction; it was so horrible words can't describe. It's a restlessness coupled with a sense of dread that is so terrible you wish you were dead so you can get relief.  I later found out I have the same reaction to all atypical antipsychotics except Seroquel. I guess Geodon is a miracle drug for some people; but for me it was a nightmare.

I take the PTSD Cocktail. Propranolol (10 mg), Vistaril (25 mg), Geodon (20mg). Geodon was the key to making the other two meds work. I am losing the weight I gained on antidepressants. Antidepressants made my PTSD worse.My support group mentioned Geodon. It blocks 2 of the 3 catecholamines - norepinephrine &amp; dopamine. I take these meds twice a day &amp; my symptoms have decreased - no nightmares, shaking, sweating, anger, flashbacks, suicidal thoughts &amp; less isolation. It takes a *LOT* to make me trigger now.I started it at night. I felt &quot;wired&quot; for about a week. That went away. I've never felt tired because of the medicine - just normal.I saw a research study that showed Geodon has 89% effectiveness on PTSD. I wonder what the rate would be for the cocktail? I think everyone should *try* Geodon for PTSD. It works in DAYS! Never been happier since I got sick! :)

I was prescribed 80mg per day, at night, for Bipolar Disorder.  At the time I was suffering from depression and the Pdoc decided that based on the 10 minute session I should be on an antipsychotic.  Shortly afterwards I noticed that I was becoming anxious, less motivated, paranoid, and my sex drive was starting to diminish.  Each visit to the Pdoc I would complain that I did not feel right and he would just add another drug to the cocktail.  Eventually he had me on Cymbalta, Effexor, Remeron and the Geodon.  I finally had to check into a hospital and was taken off this horrible drug.  It was 8 weeks of living hell!

I have ADHD, bipolar 2/ chronic major depressive disorder. I have tried every class of meds with little or no success for over 20 years (for the bad depression.) The only thing that worked at all was Lithium, however after about a year I couldn't take the flat affect and blah feeling any more.Two months in, Geodon is almost a miracle drug. Side effects were annoying but tolerable at first. I still have lingering jaw and muscle tension and insomnia and may be bordering on hypomanic which is better than the black death of major depression.Was started on 40mg bid, then up to 80mg BID. My meds review is in 3 weeks and I will ask about titrating down to 60mg because of the mild agitation and insomnia.So far this has given me my mind back, so I will tolerate the side effects for as long as I need to.

Geodon has been extremely effective in preventing mania and psychotic episodes. Unfortunately it has caused my hair to fall out.

I have been on Geodon for 5 days.  My dr started me out on 80mg. at night for 3 nights then 80 in the morning and 80 at night.  I felt sick to my stomach, the worst headache and today I was very manic.  SomethingI havent seen in a long time.  I switched ti Geodon because I was gaining to much weight on lithium, but I think it did a lot better job for me so far.  I'll give this a chance because I have been on so many different drugs I figure why not give it a shot.....so wish me luck:)

This one I was given to try during a depressive episode, and it didn't work well for me!  I took it as directed with my last large meal of the day, and then slept for approximately 12 hours.  When I finally woke up, I was WIDE AWAKE, and happier than ever.  That was the first day, at 80 mg.  I took it the next night, doubling the dose to 160 mg (doc was pushing the titration to avoid excessive sleepiness), and had the same comatose sleep, but woke up ready to jump out of my skin with discomfort.  The same amount of energy as the previous day,  but very negative.  I gave it one more day, but found it to be very unpleasant again.  When I checked in with the doc about it, he said this was not uncommon.  Obviously, it works for some, but definitely not for me!

I have taken Geodan for two years.  It has completely irradicated my mania(extreme anxiety). It has also caused me to lose 100 lbs and caused a mild case of tartive dyskenesia.  It is not supposed to cause the latter, which is one of the reasons my psychiatrist recommended it for me.

I have been on this medicine for 6 days and it has been incredibily effective.  To those that get too sleepy, my pdoc said if it made me sleepy, take entire daily dose in pm.  If it kept me awake, take entire daily dose in the am.  I'm still experimenting with this medicine regarding when to take it, but you can be sure, I will continue this medicine.  The benefits are tremendous.  My disorders are:Bipolar llCFSGADADDPTSDOCDThis medicine has helped:Extreme fatigue...gonePain throughout body...goneVery happy and affectionate with loved onesMy vision has gotten so much betterSo many others have not reported their vision got worse.  Mine was terrible and now I can almost see without my glasses.  My head WAS so heavy with depression!  I feel like a totally different person.  My prayers are with everyone of you searching for the right medicine.  Good luck and God Bless!!!

First off, there are no instructions for this, but you need to take this drug with food.  If you don't then it will only be 50% absorbed. I take 80mg, 3 times a day.I could not live without this drug.  If I forget to take my pills, I go manic within a day.  I did have problems with sleepiness when I first started on this, but that went away within the first couple of weeks.I have been taking this drug for about 6 years.

I tried one pill and I woke up six hours later with ongoing panic attacks.  I would suffer attacks back to back that gradually diminished over the next 45 days.  What fun from taking one pill (80mg).

I must agree...Geodon sent me straight to the hospital!! After about two days, I became EXTREMELY paranoid, jittery, and anxious. It was aweful. I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one!

Geodon was an absolute disaster for me!  After going five years without any major bipolar issues and eleven years with only a small episode which was handled in outpatient fashion.  I was asked to cut over to Geodon due to the medicines relatively low side effects (i.e. low weight gain profile, good long term therapy).  Within eight months of being on Geodon I was hospitalized and out on disability for over five months.  Went back to work still on the Geodon therapy and within two months was hospitalized a second time.  After going back to a higher dosage of my original medicine I am very hopeful and thankful that I had a fall back therapy.  I found this therapy for bipolar disorder to be absolutely disastrous.  I would be very interested if anyone had similar experiences with this medicine?
