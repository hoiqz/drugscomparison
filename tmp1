Puny attempt at help I've had chronic headaches for about 25 years.  When aspirin became passe, I went through the tylenol phase. That didn't do anything either. Then these NSAIDS came out (ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.)  I guess my headaches were so bad that nothing OTC touched them.  Or maybe I took so many that I became immune to them.  All I know is that I still have chronic headaches, a combination of tension and migraine, I'm told, although I can certainly feel a difference in the headache patterns and I get tension HAs far more often.  Nothing but narcotics REALLY gets rid of the pain and even that is limited in duration.  My headaches just seem to have to &quot;wind themselves down&quot; and I just clench my teeth and hold my head in the meantime.  I do use cold packs and muscle relaxers too.

Placebo effect I used to take ibuprofen as an all-around pain reliever: headaches, arthritis pain, toothache, etc. Then I developed a worsening of my heartburn problems and my doctor diagnosed GERD.  She said to avoid NSAIDS as much as possible because of the effect they had on my stomach.  Now that I think back on the time I WAS using it, I realize now that it wasn't doing anything to relieve the physical pain, it was just giving me a psychological &quot;boost&quot; and that made me FEEL like it was helping.

Advil/Ibuprofen I took up to 3200 mg ibuprofen daily for about 2 years.  Although it was quite effective in controlling symptoms, it had two important side effects:  (1) it caused gastric bleeding  and (2) it caused my kidneys to lose their effectiveness in eliminating excess water.

Worked for my RA for years In Australia and New Zealand Ibuprofen is available over the counter as 100mg tablets.  Standard adult dose is two 100mg tablets every 4 hours, though I found just 200mg per day was usually enough.  This dosage suppressed my RA inflamation for about 10 years.  Over the last few years I've needed up to 800mg per day which is a hassle to take every 4 hours.  I changed from Nurofen to Brufen which is a prescription-only slow-release 800mg tablet taken once or twice daily.  Both forms have given me no side effects provided they are taken with a good amount of food.  If I miss the food I get intestinal pain and diarroea for several hours afterwards - so if I forget the tablet I have to eat another small meal.  Unfortunately my arthritis has become quite severe and ibuprofen is no longer enough though it still provides some relief.  Several other NSAIDS have also helped me, such as Feldine and Naproxen (Naprosyn) - I'm unsure of the US brand names.

When there's nothing else Ibuprofen does little if anything for migraine. Occasionally I will get a pressure headache and it helps that kind of headache. Of course if I am out of my prescription meds, I will pump myself full of ibuprofen in hopes of obtaining some modicum of relief.

OTC NSAIDs I take only 200 mg Plaquenil daily (took 400 mg for 1-1/3 years before reducing the dosage).  Everything has been better on it EXCEPT the ongoing pain along shins, lower arms, and vrs. joints.  Vioxx and Celebrex didn't help so much, so I turned back to Advil and Aleve (not simultaneously, of course!)  I prefer Advil, taking it at least several times a week, depending on the pain level.  It helps &quot;some&quot;.  I can manage with this level of pain creeping through, so far, and will not seek other choices unless it becomes un-doable (I'm not big on medications, due to concern about digestive impact).

Ibuprofen Ibu works well for most headaches when taken at the first signs.  For migraines it will sometimes get rid of them but usually just dulls the pain, which is good because it can get you through the day.  Have to take it early, often, and in 600-800 mg doses to keep a migraine at bay.  Taking an Anacin (asprin + caffeine) with Ibu seems to be more effective on tougher headaches.  Little to no side effects.  Cheap.  Has not lost its effectiveness over the years.  Little to no stomach upset.

Great OTC I have used this for years and it is better than Tylenol, Advil, etc.  It works great for headaches, muscular pain, fever, you name it.  I used to work in a dental office and we prescribed it before it was over the counter for dental pain.  It works well on back pain too.  It did not, however, even touch a migraine for me.  I keep it on hand for other pain needs and for other members of my home, but not for migraines.  It can be harsh on the stomach as well...needs to be taken with food, and sparingly.

Advil I have found that the generic ibuprofen just hasn't worked for me.  I use Advil because the prescribed drugs like Vicodin do work for me.  Advil is cheaper and there aren't any side effects other than possible stomach upset or ulcer.  In seven years I have never had any problems with it. I can't say the same thing about prescription pain meds.  I either sleep all day or do not get any relief.Make sure to take the Advil on a full stomach or at least with food.  I never take any on an empty stomach, just to be on the safe side.

ibuprofen I used to get severe migraines but now I usually just get bad headaches. The only over the counter drug that has ever worked for me was ibuprofen. My doctor, a headache specialist, told me to just go ahead and take 800mg as soon as the pain started so that the pain arc of the headache would be cut off significantly. He also wrote me a prescription for the 800mg tablets, which cost $1 for 100 pills on my insurance plan. Way cheaper than advil or anything for that purpose. Hope it helps. Norco has been the best pain reliever that I've found though. Hydrocodone with something else. You can take it and still function because it doesn't knock you out, just kind of relaxed my tense muscles and head. Hope this helps someone, I've lived through hell!

Ibuprofen 800 I've been taking this strength for over a year after a back injury that was worsened by arthritis. They are somewhat effective, taking off the edge so I can function, but since I have adverse reactions to all narcotic type drugs I haven't found anything else that helps. They do upset my stomach and I take Prilosec to protect it but now I'm anemic and wondering if they are causing that.

Anti Inflammatories Since when nonsteroidal anti innflamatories become the miracle drug?  Anyone who truly has migraine knows that the only one that works is aspirin. Further I am very angry that the companies that make these drugs are marketing them as &quot;migraine&quot; drugs.  If you will read the label, you'll note that there is no difference between the regular drug and the &quot;migraine&quot; drug,  but there is a difference in price.

Bought the generic formula. Decongestants in pill forms were not effective in relieving my severe congestion. Afrin works in a matter of minutes. Only downside is sensitivity of mucous membranes in the nose as well as dryness. Unfortunately, you can't use it more frequently than every 12 hours and my congestion often comes back after 7-8 hours. Great product overall. I didn't think you could get so much relief from a nasal spray!

FDA should take off of market! Afrin (or any other OTC spray containing oxymetazoline HcL WILL decongest you fast. BUT about a day later you will suffer from the &quot;rebound effect&quot;: WORSE CONGESTION than before you started!It is so powerful that it destroys the mucus membrane lining cells in your nose that self-repair. It's not &quot;chemically&quot; addicting, but because of the heavy congestion when it wears off, people feel the need to use it more. Each consecutive use provides instant relief but actually damages the lining of your nasal passages.I'd never recommend to anybody. FDA should take off of market. I have had excellent results for nasal congestion with 2 other sprays: Nasalcrom (non-Rx) or Rhinocort (Rx) which do not work as quickly, but are MUCH safer. I'd rate Afrin/oxymetazoline a 10 for effectively clearing  your nose, but since it causes  rebound congestion of its own, I gave a 5.

Afrin use with no rebound congestion I know about the risk of rebound congestion that comes with Afrin use.  I have long used it to treat chronic bedtime nasal congestion when laying horizontally, a condition that requires me to breath through my mouth and causes me to awake frequently.  After warnings from my MD, I have gone weeks without Afrin use but find that the bedtime congestion does not ease.  When I resume Afrin use, I also find no need to increase use beyond the once per day before bedtime.  This tells me that I am not having the dreaded rebound congestion.I have tried nasal steroid spray and nasal antihistamine spray, separately, at my MD's direction.  Neither of those treatments reduce my bedtime congestion.  I only occasionally experience seasonal allergy symptoms, at which time I use an inexpensive, OTC 12-hour antihistamine.  I do take 4 mg of generic &quot;Chlor-Trimeton&quot; every night to cope with the likely underlying allergy condition.  With this approach, I rarely have nasal congestion during the daytime and my bedtime condition is sucessfully controlled.

Afrin for Short Term Use Unfortunately, I LOVE Afrin! When I take Afrin, I breathe better than any other time in my life. I wish it were a maintenance drug. In the past, I would tend to use it too often, in which case it does have the rebound effect and I must always make myself &quot;de-addict&quot; from it. Once I even had to go to the doctor in order to treat myself for overuse. Now I am wise enough to save it for only those times when I need it the most--like when I have terrible congestion from a cold, or am having an extremely stuffy nose night and cannot sleep.  I limit myself to 3, 4 or 5 days at the most, and try mainly to just take it at bedtime to get a decent night's sleep.  It works beautifully and I love how it makes me breathe! Even after 3-5 nights, it's still very difficult to continue on without it, especially in the winter when my heater is going and there is lots of dry heat.

Once a day Its the only thing that I've found that works.  I only take it once a day (at bedtime) and have had no problems with side effects or rebound, even after a fairly long period of use.I've tried other things (both prescription and non) and nothing even comes close to providing the relief this affords.

Only Thing That Worked After trying oral decongestants at night, breath right strips, steroid sprays, I decided to try a generic form of this that I purchased at Wal-Mart for $1/bottle.  Immediately I could sleep through the night.  I use this only before going to bed, one spray per nostril in the summer and I alternate nostrils in the winter, sleeping on the medicated side.  This has been going on for 3 years now.  During the day I take a claritin and 12 hour oral decongestant.  It may be bad, but I am able to sleep at night.  Today I was given a prescription to Singulair in hopes that it will allow me to stop taking other decongestants...we'll see!!!

Family Dollar Nasal Spray with Oxymetazoline HCI 0 I am floored at the results of this generic nasal spray with Oxymetazoline 0.05. The truth is, I have gone for several years with clogged passages, blowing my nose around the clock, and feeling that nasty, stuffy, infamed with infection feeling. It was so bad I bagun to wonder if I didn't have a more serious disease. I naturally suffer from sinusitisitis, however with the discomfort of a congested nose daily I begun to feel uncomfortable in my surroundings 99% of the time. I know this sounds like a bizarre story, but its true. A few days ago, browsing at the dollar store, I figured anything is worth trying, and so I bought the family dollar nasal spray. And to my chagrin, this product the rid me of all the nasal problems of nasty congestion both my throat the nose that I have been suffering from for years. I can feel myself breathing better and my sense of smell is much more acute. I feel like I have been blind for so long, but now I can see; and it is the most remarkable experience ever. I have used it for about two days, starting in the evening prior to bed, with the next use approximately 12 hours apart. I just don't understand what a difference this product has made. Sorry to be so long winded.Diane

Follow the Directions It always amazes me how people misuse nasal sprays. (Before I knew better, I was guilty of this myself.) They sporadically use the steroid sprays (see my review of Flonase) and wonder why they don't work as well as they claim.  Then they overuse an OTC spray that clearly states on the bottle not to use for more than 3 days. You will get rebound congestion if you use Afrin for more than 3 days in a row.  Save Afrin for really bad allergy days or when you get a cold or sinus infection.  My doctor also told me that you can use it for 3 days skip 3 days and then use it 3 more days.  But if you're still severely congested after that, you need to see your doctor! PS If you want a spray you can use everyday to relieve stuffiness get Entsol spray. It's a saliene spray developed by an ENT.  It's aerosol so it gets in deep.  You can get it at any drugstore, but you have to ask for it.  It's non prescription, but for some reason they keep it behind the counter.

Always use as directed I used this medication many years ago for  treating my hayfever.... I found that without realizing it overtime was using it more frequently. Discusion with my a friend who was a Resident MD revealed I was addicted.. yes addicted.. not somethng I thought possible with an Over the counter medication.The addiction took the form of increase sinus congestion if I did not  use the Drug and I found I was actually using it every 2-3 hours some times more....just to get my sinus open enough to breath.My first attempt to get off was to  dilute the Afrin with sterile saline.. this did not work... My nasal congestion was so severe.. I  was having headaches and mouth breathing all the time  I ended up on Oral steriods for 2-3 weeks and a steriodal nasal spray to get off Afrin and get my Sinus congestion under control.Personally I will never use Afrin or any of the over the counter nasal sprays.I recommend that any one who does use Afrin  use it only  as directed and if the problem lasts for longer that 7 days or gets worse see your doctor immediately..Do not try to self treat. Do not make the same mistake  I did .  This Medication in my opinion is not meant for long term extended use.
