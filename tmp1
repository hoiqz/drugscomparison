Horrible side effects! My two experiences with haldol resulted in severe dystonic/dysplasic side effects where I couldn't move my jaw to speak and ground my teeth together with such force that I chipped my molars. On both occasions, (I am bipolar) I had a manic episode where the doctor thought the haldol would calm me. Ativan works much better at this, IMO. Additionally, both circumstances resulted in my receiving an intramuscular shot (yes, in the buttocks) of Cogentin to mitigate the horrible side effects.

Against Anti-Psychotics for severe MDD Patients For relevance here, I suffer from severe major depressive disorder, anorexia nervosa, and PTSD. I was taken forcibly to the local (small town hospital) ER after a mangled suicide attempt (&gt;24 hours later) that left me with the residual effect of ( the potentially fatal infection) cellulitis in one of my arms.   The police were extremely rough with me, repeatedly grabbing the painfully infected arm as they forced me into (buckled) 4-point restraints, and after voicing this a number of times I bit the officer working on that hand.  (Note that these physical restraints are meant to be used when all other options, including &quot;chemical restraints&quot; have been exhausted.) But in BFE they got everything backwards. *First* they provoked the extreme anxiety by ripping my clothes off, *then* they tied me down spread-eagled, and last-- they grabbed the syringe. Didn't drop a beat. Just to keep the rhythm going, I asked what it was that they planned to administer to &quot;calm (me) down.&quot;  I had previously been administered IV ativan in ERs when considered &quot;agitated,&quot; so I reported this instantly when I heard they were coming with Haldol. They argued this would work faster. (It didn't) I told them of my horrible reactions to even novel anti-psychotics (the 36 hour physical and (detri)mental hangover). I voiced my objections to tardive dyskinesia. I tried to move my hips fast enough to break the needle before it could be administered. Unfortunately, all this failed, and I kept demanding that they bring in my next of kin and ranting about their violations of the &quot;Patients' Legal Rights and Responsibilities.&quot; Eventually I did fall asleep. I'm assuming that they were smart enough to have utilized only the 50mg syringe, owing to my size. But perhaps I give them too much credit. When they awoke me for a transfer to the hospital, my BP was 80/55. Of course, I wasn't much up for chatting once I arrived and went straight to bed

Haldol Not a good med for the Bi-Polar in my experience anyway. All I wanted to do was curl up in a corner and sleep. It leaves quite a hangover also.

waking nightmare I was put on Haloperidol in the hosp a few months ago. I'd taken it before for as one off doses for anxiety etc. i was also injected with it a couple of times involuntarily. the first time i was so stiff the next day i was extremely uncomfortable. when they put me on it regularly earlier this year i'd been on it a couple of days and i didn't really get zombied out or anything i just found that i couldn't stop moving. i was lying in bed dying to get some sleep but i just couldn't keep my legs still. It was so awful i cried my eyes out all night. I will never go near that stuff again! Absolutely awful!

Straight Jacket  Took this on several occassions before I knew that drugs have side effects. After afew days on this i would be all tensed up, could hardly walk/shave, all i could do was lie down in bed- it was like being in a straight jacket 24hrs a day. However i have met people on it and it seems to help if you don't get these symptoms and as it is non-sedating it's a possible but BEWARE!

John Gray I was given this drug while in Shock Trauma with a serious head injury. As a rule I am an easy going fun loving person. I like to make people laugh and I'm usually good at it. This drug was supposed to relax me for a long CAT scan. It turned me into a violent monster. I beat up nurses and anyone who tried to get near me. Its a horrible, horrible drug! I would never hit a woman ever, but on this drug I didn't care! I pulled tubes out of my body, and did all sorts of thing I can't remember. Its a pure junk drug to me.

Helpful in the short run if you can tolerate it I took this medicine due to an acute mixed episode.  None of my meds which included Seroquel and Lithium were helping.  Haldol calmed me and brought me down to a safer place where hospitalization was no longer a concern.  However, the akathesia was horrendous.  I was restless and constantly moving.  Haldol did not work out long term.

&quot;I'm sorry, Mom...I just can't wake up&quot; &quot;I'm so tired and brain-dead that my eyes won't even open!!&quot;And that was me after a 2.5mg injection of Haldol. I had the worst side effects ever and I don't know if it's because of my low body weight or my unstable health, but I slept for literally twenty-four hours straight which doesn't help my already dehydrated state OR my malnourished body...and the awful twitching i got before going to bed was the worst feeling in the world....as if you can't stop moving your legs and you're sooooo agitated by it....omg!! It was soooo terrible..please don't take Haldol or let anyone give it to you unless you are psychotic or something...those of us with eating disorders need a drug a little ummmm, well a LOT, less strong than Haldol...No anti-psychotics for me every again.

Good, helped me Haldol helped me a lot to come out of my psychotic states. But i wish it had fewer side effects. Sedation is the greatest side effect. I don't know if this was due to haloperidol alone because i was also taking valproate and oxcarbazepine along with it.alex

Did nothing I got this in the hospital when I was manic. It kept doing nothing and they kept escalating the dose. I did not feel sedated nor did it help with the mania in any way. I couldn't even tell I was taking it.  Then they gave me zyprexa which slowed me down.

Bad side effects...but it does work Been taking Haldol for some 16 years. At first, the side effects are horrible. Stopped taking a couple times, but within 6 months back to hospital. The side effects do become tolerable. I tried Navane and prolixin, but they didn't work. Learned to live with the side effects after a few years, overall it makes you feel bad, but it does keep me well and out of the hospital... living a fairly normal life.

Involuntary Haloperidol Hell Frequency prescribed was once per day, not two, but there was no option for this.I became unable to sit still, I had to be moving all the time.  A minute seemed like hours.  The condition is called &quot;Tardive dyskinesia.&quot;I would also rather die than be forced to take this again! This involuntary committment business is hell.  Mental illness is NOT scientific!  They don't do any testing.  Doctors just start giving you drugs.  It will never stop unless we start sueing!!!!

Haldol is a Nightmare I was given this over a decade ago, so I may have the dosage wrong, but I will never forget how horrible this drug was. It made me feel like a zombie; like I was trapped in my body and I wanted to scream for help but I couldn't do anything much but drool.  The doctor had actually assured me that it would make me feel &quot;like a normal person&quot;.  I wish the doctors would try some of these antipsychotics for themselves just ONCE, so they would know what they are really doing to patients.  Haldol was like living death.

Haloperidol was HELL The worst time in my life was when they gave me Haloperidol. My body stopped responding, I could almost not move at all; even shallow my food was a difficult process. And mentally I felt worse than before the treatment. Even when my body was almost paralyzed, I was completely alert, but I had an overwhelming feeling of despair and sadness that didn't go away al day. At night, I could not sleep, but was awake in my bed feeling miserable. I don't know if it was the drug, but all the time I was under its effects, I felt incredibly depressed; everything I saw or hear looked and sounded incredibly sad to me, it was like my mind was full of sorrow all the time. It was like that horrible feeling you get when you receive the news someone loved have died, but imagine that feeling is 24 hours a day inside you, for weeks and months without any logical reason, just the bad feeling in your head all the time, and it wont go away whatever you do. That was Haloperidol to me. I was unable to even speak, my tong felt like numb and swollen inside my mouth, and I couldn't help drool all over myself. I just wanted to die, but my almost paralyzed body didn't allow me to take action about it. If one day I have for some reason to choose between taking this drug and die, I would choose death without any hesitation.

If one day I have for some reason to choose between taking this drug and die, I would choose death without any hesitation.

The Worst Not sure of the dosage; long time ago (1978)when initially diagnosed as affective schizophrenic. Administered in hospital setting (involuntary) for six weeks; taken for several weeks after that until correctly diagnosed manic-depressive at clinic.  Hair fell out, lost focus of my eyes (couldn't read!), slept all the time yet constantly tired.  Very effective in shutting me down--completely.  Not effective for a life of any kind.  Probably pretty costly as well. (don't know - my parents paid)

Heparin, Lidocaine, and Sodium Bicarbonate Instills Work For Me I started doing these instills at home myself several years ago, and don't want to stop!  While the supplies can get a bit expensive, and the technique takes a few tries to perfect, the benefit has been worth it for me.These instills are great for numbing up the bladder when it won't let me sleep due to spasms and frequency, they're good for non-narcotic pain control as long as my pain hasn't gotten out of control, and they are great to use to numb the bladder and urethra before sexual activity -- great flare preventer!I really recommend this type of instillation.

getting blood to flow Before anticoagulant therapy, my blood clotted so much, when I had blood drawn, it would clot before it would fill the tube. Anticoagulants by themselves did not make the pain stop. For several months I gave myself heparin shots. Now I use NOW Nattokinase and Vitalzyme pills. Nattokinase is less expensive. The pills work as well as a shot.

Installations did not help long term When I first started, I felt immediate relief and would have an installation once a week.  After a couple of months, it was no longer effective and it caused a couple of UTIs probably due to just having the tube installed and leaves you suseptable to infection.

Mixing of the brew Because of such severe bladder spasms and living several hours away from my Urologist I was given a prescription for Heparin and Marcaine and sterile water to do instillations at home.My biggest problem was that my urethra would go into horrible spasms whenever I tried to insert a catheter. Sometimes it would even clamp shut or collapse as some would call it. Then the dr. had me put a numbing gel or cream around my urethra. This did help some. Another difficult thing was trying to hold the medicine in my bladder, especially when it was already irritated, agitated and raw.I also had to use the clear, short catheters that are usually used on men. I am allergic to latex and the red rubber catheters are not latex free.

Works well for me so far My Neur-Urologist started me on Heparin instillations in Oct 2005.  I have had 4 more in 2006 so far. He also combines its with sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, 2 5mg Ditropan pills mashed up, Gentymycin.I have had instant relief -hold it in for 30 minutes. Can't urinate it out so the Dr. catheterizes it out of my bladder before I leave.I can buy 10 vials for about $1.00/vial at Wal-Mart's discount distributer in DC so I can afford it.Sincerely, Diane

Weekly instillations I use a heparin resuce mixture with macurocaine, lidocaine gel, and sodium bicarb,and it works really well when i am having a lot of pain and spasms. This really helps the spasms. I am male with IC Dx in June 2002. Started this resuce solutions and have been on them for 4 years. They leave the foley in to hold the solution longer, At first it was out before I left the office but now I can keep the catheter in for an hour or so and I think this really helps with the dosage to the bladder.drgumble@insightbb.com

Less painful than DMSO I found that trying Heparin was much easier than DMSO...the treatments have been pretty easy on me...I learned to them at home which I did after 2 treatments.  That is much easier on me since car rides are painful.  I believe it is still helping me since if I do the treatment a day late I miss it.  Doing so at home allows for doing treatments more often in the future.  One negative is the risk of infection (I am on antibiotics so this doesn't affect me but it is important for others to consider).  Every time you use a catheter there is that risk.   After sometime the catheder was hard on my urethra...there is some info at ICN to help with this, but was enough that I chose to do so less often.

very good experience I use a heparin combo mixture with Liduid lidocaine, lidocaine gel, and sodium bicarb,and it works really well when i am having a lot of pain and spasms.  Unfortunately when I have the hot razor scraping inside my bladder felling it only aggrivates the spasms worse.  I believe that the problem is that I have an infection during the razor pain period and the odctor just had trouble diagnosing it.

Heparin Cocktail I have just started instilling a cocktail of heparin, marcaine, sodium bicarbonate and dexamethasone sodium phosphate. My old urologist retired and he was giving it to me once a week.  I was doing good.  Then I got a new urologist and he cut it back to once a month.  Now that I begged my new Dr. to let me do it at home I am going to do it once a week again. I will see If I gets any better.   Today was my first home installation.  The Dr. told me no more than twice a week so we shall see.  I hope it works because I have been having so many flare ups.  I was giving myself heparin shots but I found out It gave me osteopenia (caused by heparin shots). The shots can also lead to osteoporosis so from now on, no more shots.  I am at my wits end so I hope this works.  Maybe a little formula adjustment here and there, I will have to see.

Heparin is effective but I don't use it alone I use Heparin in conjuction with 4 other meds. which I inject into my bladder through a catheterI am a young woman. These medications bring me tremendous relief, for 1 week. They are known as a &quot;Gillespie&quot; cocktail.(Because Dr. Lauren Gillespie invented this treatment, before she lost her liscence for experiments done with willing participants on her payroll who wanted to help the IC research by offering normal bladder tissue.)These other meds are LIdocaine, marcaine, gentamycin &amp; kennalog.

Heparin worked I did daily heparin instillations for nearly one year. They did help my bladder, but my urethra started to hurt from the frequent catherization.I now do a weekly instillation that includes heparin among other things: marcaine, sodium bicarbonate, tobramycin and depro medrol. This installation works quite well.

Lantus/Humalog combination effective I have been taking 15-20 units of Lantus per day with Humalog with all meals and this combination has worked wonderfully for me.  The above ratings are not very useful for insulin because how easy to rate its use since we have to take it in injections?  The only side effect, of course, would be low blood sugar if you take too much.  Cost effectiveness, who cares as long as it keeps your blood sugar in check?  But this combination has been ver effective in my case.  It keeps a base level of insulin in my system with the Lantus and the Humalog takes care of the spikes from eating.  If you don't eat, you don't take the Humalog and you'll be fine.

Diabetes Humalog is great and very fast acting.  It reacts the minute you take it.  So in my case for having gastroporesis, my stomach takes awhile to digest the food, therefore I take the shot after a meal.  My friend also takes this particular kind of insulin and loves it.

Humalog flexability Humalog has proven to be the most suitable insulin for me to cover my meals.  My schedule is quite irregular and I find the flexability insulin lispro provides to be ideal.  I inject my Humalog just before I eat; no having to anticipate a meal by 30 minutes like Regular insulin requires and then running low three hours later when the meal has digested and Regular is still pulling your glucose down.  The Humalog is pretty much done working after two to two and half hours which leaves me free at that time to engage in strenuous activity (if I do anything very strenuous while it is still in my system I tend to go low).  Should I eat a very low glycemic meal or one that is slow to digest (like pasta or pizza) I find that I cover this sort of meal best by injecting the Humalog 30 to 50 minutes after I have finished eating.  If inject just as I sit down to eat a pizza or pasta dish I tend to go low in the first hour and then run high three hours later.When I initially started on Humalog (the day after I was first diagnosed a Type 1 Diabetic) it made me feel a little queasy, but that passed in a few months as I grew used to it (and as my bg returned to normal levels).  It is likely that some of my discomfort was simply due to growing accustomed to having normal blood glucose levels and perhaps to an insulin that differed from the way my pancreas used to deliver it.

Humalog I find that I need to use Regular insulin along with Humalog. I need the &quot;tail&quot; of the regular insulin to give me coverage, and if I use all Humalog, it comes on too fast and I will get hypoglycemic. I am a type two and still producing some insulin.

Humalog and Migraines As a long term diabetic of 40 year I personally do not prefer the rapid onset of symptoms that accompany the use of Humalog.  After injecting I frequently feel flushed and at times nauseated.  I feel like my body is hypersensitive to the use of Humalog and if I am required to take it during evening hours, I typically wake up in the morning with extremely low blood sugars and I believe this rapid transition to a lower blood sugar is also responsible for the migraines that I have experienced over the past year since starting this medication.

Insulin Not convinced that it's the best way to go.  Exercise and diet work better for me.  I feel better when blood sugars are controled by diet and exercise.  Insulin makes me feel awful and puts on extra weight.  Not the best solution, but sometime you need to use this to control BS.

A1c Dropped Dramatically With Humalog and Low Carb I only wish I had asked for insulin years ago, instead of fighting with oral meds!  Insulin is the most natural treatment for diabetes, and unlike the oral meds, has no side effects if used properly and your body knows exactly what to do with it.  There is NOTHING more effective in lowering blod glucose levels.  I lost 30 pounds and dropped my A1c 2 points by starting Humalog and switching to a low carb diet.  I was on Avandia and Glucophage, and just kept gaining weight, and A1c kept increasing.  I have found insulin to be safe, effective and without side effects.  I still produce insulin, so I use Humalog to lower dawn phenomenon and to keep blood glucose rises to a minimum (I am for no more than a 15 point rise after meals).  I also follow Dr. Richard Bernstein's program of 6-12-12, meaning 6 carbs at breakfast, 12 at lunch and 12 at dinner.  Not easy, but it works very effectively.

Humalog Lispro Insulin I have used Insulin lispro since the day it was available.  Before this I used to be on Velosulin.  Velosulin is a buffered insulin, which prevented clog ups in my pump.  But it took so long to work, and was not as effective in my opinion as the lispro insulin is.  If your blood sugar is high, with Humalog it doesnt take half as long to get it back down.  It works great with the pump, but if youre not on the pump it can stay at room temp for up to 30 days.  Best insulin by far, because of the quick reaction time.

My Experience with Humalog I am a type 2 diabetic.  I was taking Glucophage, but switched to insulin when I became pregnant with my son.  For weeks we struggled to get my levels in control and switched insulin often.  The other insulins we experimented with were Humulin N and R.  We finally maintained the tight control required for pregnancy with a combination of Humalog and NPH.  I am currently taking Humalog and Lantus.  I don't have extensive experience with other similar insulin types, and I have not taken insulin for very long - about 3 years so I don't have much experience for reference.  Bjay, EditorDiabetic Mommy Online Magazinehttp://www.DiabeticMommy.com

In a few months, I was reduced to a total mess... chronically obstructed, in constant pain, unable to stand up straight let alone work, emaciated and racking up hospital bills.  I wrote out my will and started looking for a hospice.Then I started taking Humira.  HUMIRA SAVED MY LIFE.The road back was gradual, but man, this drug totally turned things around for me.  There is no cure for CD, (I've had several surgeries and the disease always cycles around again) and no other combination of medications was able to cool this current attack.Humira did the trick.If you have active Crohn's disease, FIND A WAY TO GET ON THIS DRUG.

My doctor wanted to give my liver a rest and suggested I try Humira, after a drawn out process to find financing and make it affordable for me, we got the ball rolling. I had probably 80% of my body affected, bad nails and stubborn lesions and before I took my second shot I was alread 90% cleared.  IT WAS AMAZING, I haven't been this clear since I first developed it at age 18.  It has been such a life changing experience, I can wear short sleeve, not worry about scalp flaking, my nails don't hurt. Thank God for Caremark or I never would have been able to afford this. I have not had relief since I was 18, 31 years ago!!!!! In my book it's a miracle.

I have quite the complex of autoimmune issues:  ileal and oral crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis w/ pustular psoriasis, HLA-B27.     Basically, ouch ...  anyhow, Humira has made a big, big difference in my life.   I'm clear of psoriasis, my arthritis is tolerable and my crohn's can be managed (in general) with occasional budesonide, or another treatment.    This drug is GREAT.

Recommended for its broad impact.
humira	Crohn's Disease -- Maintenance	2009-02-13 00:00:00		3.5	4.0	3.0	4.5	I have quite the complex of autoimmune issues:  ileal and oral crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis w/ pustular psoriasis, HLA-B27.     Basically, ouch ...  anyhow, Humira has made a big, big difference in my life.   I'm clear of psoriasis, my arthritis is tolerable and my crohn's can be managed (in general) with occasional budesonide, or another treatment.    This drug is GREAT.   I take it weekly by the way.In comparison with other treatments i have used (enbrel, cyclosporine, anti-malarials, sulfasalazine, methotrexate), humira just rocks.

I have Crohn'd Disease, and saw no difference with Remicade.  6mp worked for a while, but I developed balance problems.  The Humira has closed a fistula and I tolerate it pretty well.  I do get a headache after taking it, usually the next day.  i would definitely recommend  this drug .YOu recieve 2 epi pens for the whole month.  You are not tied to a IV for 2.5 hours.  You simply give yourself a shot( Epi-pen) every other week. The medicine is shipped directly to my home. It is better if the medicine is not too cold.

Humira has been very successful in treating my daughters JRA and uveitis. After only 2 doses she has been inflammation free and has sustained that for over a year. No known side effects- blood tested every 2 months and have found out of all the drugs we have tried she has been less prone to infection on Humira. Insurance company payed some but medicine is pricey- Humira offers assistance programs which have been a big help!

I have taken Humira on and off for 3 years now.  I first used all the cox2 inhibiters   When enbrel hit the market, I was immediately put on that, it worked well, but I could not stand the pain or burn. I was then put on Humira. I took it every 2 weeks and the pain was not as bad. Humira has been my miracle drug and I have had very little pain in my body due to this medicine.  Later, for my chronic uveitis, I was placed on Remicade.  I had no side effects or anything except that it would make me dizzy occasionally or tired on the day of the infusion.  The problems that resulted from remicade unfortunately, were more about the cost and time than the actual results of how my body reacted to it.  I did have 3 doses of remicade.  I liked the medicine except for the cost and the time that went into it as well.   The Humira has done the same job, just faster, cheaper.

Humira  40 MG/0.8 ML Syringe was thenext step for me after taking Enbrel(as a study patient) for over 2 years. Humira seems to be a weaker treatment, compared to Enbrel which I found to be more affective.Don't forget that each treatment can react differently.  The key is to get the right medication for your individual needs.Medication is very very costly ($1,500 - $ 1,750 range) for a one month supply--- that's of course, without insurance.  A good Health Ins. is a plus when treated with these types of meds..

It really suppressed my immune system when I first started taking it. I had several strep and staph infections, had to have my tonsils taken out and was on multiple antibiotics. I was still taking Imuran(purenithol) at the time, so my GI took me off of that, and it started to get better. I am still taking doxycycline as a preventative.It has also made my hair fall out (not completely!) but I guess I can deal with that rather than constant diarrhea!The shots are pretty easy, I allow mine to warm up about 15 minutes or so before I give it, otherwise it can sting pretty bad. I've been on it for just over a year now.

No side effects Unlike Enbrel, I've had no side effects from Humira.  Unfortunately, I am not sure it was helping either.  Having tried both the regular injections and the pens, I prefer the injection to the pen.   The pen burns and bruises me worse.  With the injection, I can control how fast I inject the med and have less bruising.  The only reason I don't think Humira is helping is I switched DMARDs (from Arava to Imuran)  after being on Humira for about 4 months. Within days, I was horribly swollen, walking was painful and I was miserable.  2 months later, I begged to go back on Arava and I've gotten better, slowly.  Through all of it, I was on Humira until a few weeks after starting Arava again when I missed due to sinus infections.  And so the process began to get me on Remicade.  My doctor doesn't feel it is helping. Although, this could be due to 23 years of disease that was NOT well treated until the last year.

I love it! I started Humira injections as a treatment for Crohn's disease. I realize it hasn't been approved for that use yet but I highly recommend it.For one, I give myself an injection in the privacy of my bathroom or bedroom. It takes all of one minute and doesn't really hurt that much. Secondly, I have never had a reaction to it. Third, you should see the difference in my colonoscopy pictures! It is like night and day. In the pre-Humira shots, it was a bloody, ulcerated mess. In the most recent shots (November), it was clean and clear of disease. Even the scar tissue appeared to be improving.

Humira I've been using Humira for about 5 months now.  My insurance pays for it 100% since it is a specialty pharmacy.  It does help the pain, not completely but I would say about 40 - 50%.  It seems to help the swelling and stiffness quite abit.  I still have days that I am quite achy.  Sometimes getting up from my desk at work is a chore but I think that all depends on the weather and the amount of physical activity the day before. I take Ibupropin for pain. I don't seem to experience any side effects.  Sometimes my face looks a little puffy but I'm not sure if it is a side effect from the Humira.  Giving yourself injections is not all that bad.  After the first couple time it's a piece of cake. I've been on Ariva and Methotrexate and Humira seems to give me the best relief.

My RA is pretty much in remission due to Humira. The higher risk of cancer is scary but overall Humira has been a miracle drug for me.  My RA symptoms are now very slight, and any pain or stiffness that I get is minor.  I appear to be in near remission. I can forget about my RA and live a normal life now that I am on Humira (methotrexate did not do it for me.) I know I still have RA because if there is a delay in getting my bi-weekly dose, I can have bad flare-ups all over my body.  Which makes me think that if not for the Humira, or some other effective treatment, I would probably be disabled by the disease. As it is, I have a very busy career, a young boy to raise and a marriage to maintain, so I must stay healthy and energetic -- if only to keep my job to pay for the insurance that makes it possible for me to afford this horribly expensive drug on which I am totally dependent. In short, I feel that because of Humira, it is a good time to get RA.

Worked for a period of time I have taken Humira off and on for 3 years.  The only side effects for me are a sore throat, flu like symptoms and diarrhea.  It seemed to work at first, but then I realized it was just a coincidence...I still have flares wether or not I am using the Humira.  The cost is ridiculous.  We pay about $320/co-pay until we meet the deductible of $1500.  Not affordable.  After reading the press about Humira and Remicade increasing your risk for Lymphoma, I decided the risk of cancer was not worth it.  I'd rather be crippled than dead from lymphoma.

Effectiveness I have found Humira, along with Plaquenil to be a very effective solution for my RA. I wouldn't say 100%, but quite good and much better than Methotrexate, (with numerous side effects) Naprysen, Celebrex, Vioxx and Motrin, although Motrin and Plaquenil kept the RA in check for a number of years before giving out, as did Naprysen. With Humira, I do get a short lived headache now and then, but not bad. I have been on Humira for about 7 months now.

It works just give it time I have had RA for 13 yrs. This is the first heavy hitting drug I ever taken. I tried the natural way first had some relief, yet came to find out it seems to fall more into environmental issues when my RA acts up. I went on Humira and low dose 5mg of Prednisone (each night). At about the third month is when I notice that my joint pain and look was better and stop taken Prednisone. I did have to stop taking it for one month because of foot surgery. Doctor recommand 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after surgery to prevent infection. The after effect lasted for a week after first dose stop. When taking this drug I did have a crushing headace the first time I took it, did not get them anymore. Also it will wane close to the time of your next injection 2or 3 days before. This also stop after the third month. How well did I feel good enough to jog which I have stop over 7 years ago.

I followed all the tips to keep it from burning so bad, I left t out to warm up for an hour, made sure the alcohol was dry before injection...injected REALLY slow...it still burned like fire!!  I sat there for over 5 mins trying to hold the syringe hanging out my belly to inject slow...it still hurt and my hands are not too steady.I would not recommend this med...this is med of last resort.

Humira I have been using Humira for almost a year and am still trying to decide if it is any better than Enbril was.  However, I have just moved to one dose a week, instead of one dose every other week.  I think the increased dose is necessary for anyone suffering from reactive arthritis.  It &quot;keeps a lid on the garbage can&quot; so to speak, but it has not yet stopped the progression or the pain at two doses a month, so I will have to see how the maximum dose works out.

It works but? I was diagnosed several years ago and have been battling ever since. I have tried all the drugs. The worst has been arava and I would not recomend to us it. I tried enbrel but nothing. Humira gave me relief in weeks. i could walk again and enjoy life. I have started golfing again. Lately by the time its time to give the shot again I am very soar. Some weeks I feel bad others are great but I don't let it get me down. I don't feel i will be on this medicine much longer because it seems to be working for a shorter period of time. But I don't have very many more options now. Thank you Humira for my life back but keep working because I need something very soon.

Humira I have been on HUMIRA for the past year.  I do my own injections, which I tolerate, but cannot say that it ever &quot;gets easier&quot;.  My SED rate has decreased tremendously, and I am much more comfortable.  Due to my Rheumotoid Arthritis, I have had a total knee replacement and have pins, screws and staples in both feet (triple arthrodesis).  I am a lot more comfortable now, since taking HUMIRA, but do know that I will never really be my old self.

Humira I have been on Humira for 4 months.  This medication is very expensive, but I have been doing pretty well on it.  I still have some pain and stiffness, but I hope I continue to improve over time.  My only complaint, besides cost, is the terrible stinging while injecting the medication.

Humira didn't work for me I took 4 injections of Humira over 8 weeks and it had no effect on me.  It felt like I was injecting battery acid into me.  It felt a little better in my stomach area as opposed to my thighs.  And afterward I found out that if you take it out of the fridge about an hour and a half before you use it and allow it to warm up, it doesn't hurt as bad.

so far so good Effectiveness: 9 Within 24 hours the range of motion in my affected knee, which had been bothering me for months, was considerably improved.  That was the major joint that was flaring for months, very limited rheumatoid symptoms elsewhere.  I am now able to resume my regular activities, however I am not experiencing the higher energy levels touted on the Humira website.Lack of side effects: 10No side effects yet to speak of, however, besides the arthritis, I am an otherwise healthy individual.  Also, I have only been on the Humira for three months.Ease of Use: 10 The syringe comes with an oversized handle, that is easy to remove.  I need to remove this large handle to inject, otherwise the whole syringe is too large to manipulate easily.  The prefilled syringes come with a rather large air bubble inside.  I release this air bubble before injecting, otherwise I find that this causes resistance when pushing on the plunger.Effective After Long Term Use: N/A Not applicable in my situation.  I've only been on it for 3 months.Cost Effectiveness: N/A Not applicable in my situation.  I am participating in a drug trial (free drugs!  Well, I suppose that is effective!)

My humira story  Hi, I am a 29 year old woman who found out that I had RA when I was 23 and had just had my first child. The first year after my son's birth was a tough one. I quit working because of the severe pain in my feet (I was on my feet nonstop at my place of employment.) Then my hands quit working properly. I developed trigger finger and endured cortisone shots and carpal tunnel and took Vioxx and then Celebrex and nothing helped. Eventually and slowly I self improved over the course of 5 YEARS!! Without any thing stronger than Tylenol. Then my husband and I had our daughter and exactly 2 months after she was born my RA went berserk. I could not use my hands, feet, my knees refused to bend. I couldn't care for my daughter and became an invalid myself. I was finally referred to a Rheumatologist and she put me on Humira along with Methotrexate and Bextra and Arava. I again am recovering but now at much faster rate. My daughter is almost 2 and I can completely care for both my children and drive, get in and out of a bathtub by myself and even floss my back teeth. I would definitely recommend this if you have tried others and are not improving or even stabilizing your symptoms. This drug is very expensive unless your blessed with good insurance and there is a real sting when injecting this drug. The only side effect I have noticed is occasional headaches after injecting (same day) and thinning hair which may be the Methotrexate. I am not sure which but I take Folic Acid to help alleviate that problem. I hope my story helps you.

Changed my life I was diagnosed with RA at age 57, though I had it for about a year before.  I started out with methotrexate and Vioxx for the pain.  After a year my pain was increasing and my joints were continuing to deteriorate, especially in my feet.  I could handle the pain but the fatigue was almost totally dibilitating.My doctor told me I would have to be on methotrexate for a year before my insurance company would pay for more advanced drugs.  During that time there was siginificant degeneration in my feet that I will never recover.I have been on Humira now for a year.  After using it for 8 weeks most of my symptoms were significantly reduced and within 12 weeks they were almost unnoticeable.This drug is extremely expensive and I have had to find insurance that would cover it at a reasonable cost.  But I would have paid $15,000 out of pocket to avoid the damage that happened to my feet while we 'tested' methotrexate.  That's why I rated the cost effectiveness a 9.

Humira - not impressed I'm not impressed with this medication.  For what this medication costs (over $15,000 per year) it should work better.  I find it a crap shoot each time I give myself an injection.  Sometimes it's better than others.  I use to take gold shots (Solganol) but they stopped manufacturing it.  Probably because the pharmaceutical companies didn't make enough money on it to continue production.  That drug worked wonders for me.  Kept me pain free for a very long time.  Humira not only comes with a high price tag...it also comes with a large risk for infection as all the other biological drugs do.  My doctor tells me that his other patients on this drug are also unimpressed with the results.
