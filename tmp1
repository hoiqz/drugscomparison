At least it was inexpensive. Sure wasn't for me! I don't know if it would have worked- I wound up in the hospital with dangerously low blood pressure and an extremely low pulse before I could get a chance to stay on the drug long enough to see any results from this drug.

This drug is quite good at what it does. . . which is to mimic the molecular structure of adrenaline, fit into adrenergic receptors, thus blocking it (that is, adrenaline), whilst not delivering the &quot;fight or flight&quot; signal we anxiety sufferers are plagued by.  I have been taking 30 mg. daily (three 10 mg. tablets) since Dec. 13, 2004, and it's been good to me.  Sometimes, admittedly on bad days, I have taken 40 mg., but without any really serious side effects.  On this drug I feel more calm--which of course is exactly what WE NEED as anxiety sufferers.  I harbor no illusions however, as this isn't a miracle drug; it can only accomplish so much.  I am on lexapro in addition to the propranolol.  To the person considering the use of this drug, I give the following advice: 1) Make sure that you don't have abnormally low blood pressure as this drug would exacerbate this condition.  Have it checked before hand  2) Start with a low dose and adjust upwards if necessary.  I started out with 30 mg. daily and I have responded well.  Once I took 50 mg. (five 10 mg. tablets) and I felt pretty fatigued and lightheaded (nothing I couldn't handle though).  3) Be prepared to feel a bit tired and 'run-down,' though you might not necessarily get this sensation  4) Be aware that this drug has been known to give people strange and/or lucid dreams, though I haven't really experienced this (possibly due to my relatively low dosage).All in all, I would recommend to my fellow anxiety sufferers that they seriously consider using this medication as an adjunct to whatever else it is they are taking--supposing of course that they are compatible with one another.  It's fairly cheap as far as meds go, and they really help to keep panic attacks in check (fewer panic attacks, and the ones that you do have will be less severe in intensity), slow the heart rate down, and generally confer a more relaxed state --albeit primarily physiological.

Never knew it was for anxiety! I have been on this for years for palpitations that would start the anxiety-freakout cycle. thought it was for heart palpitations, not specifically for anxiety. having said that, I have recently begun having panic attacks again and Dr. has put me on Lexapro. that is great! however, I would like to sleep all day and that is bad (no pay while sleeping). so now adding Provigil to wake me up. Was looking for drug interactions info when I found a link to this site from Crazymeds. You all are so helpful and it's great to know I'm not insane and that others are in the same boat.Anyone taking propranolol with either lexapro or provigil?

Works for problematic situations This keeps you from having many physical signs of anxiety (rapid heartbeat, shakiness,...).  This is very helpful if you have to give a speech or if you are having a particularly bad day.  It does not do anything for worry (anticipatory anxiety) and it does not diminish inhibitions.  Thus, it is usually used in combination with an antidepressant, benzo (xanax, valium...) or buspar, which help with the worry.Most doctors have no problem writing an Rx for this - it is not addictive (had NO abuse potential) and, for most people, has almost no side effects.  Plus, it is very inexpensive.  Note: this is a secret tool used by many, many public speakers (many doctors take it before they present a paper).

good for reducing the physical symptoms I was put on Inderal back in the late 80s due to high blood pressure and anxiety....( I believe that constant GAD since puberty  brought on the  elevated blood pressure, as my BP goes way up when I am having a panic attack or feeling anxiety)Though it did not get rid of my panic attacks, it keeps the physical symptoms at bay - racing heart/rapid breathing.  I also use a benzo - generic Klonopin on an as needed basis for whne I start to have panicky or racy thoughts.The combination works pretty well for me with minimal side effectsI tried other meds - Zoloft/neurontin and Keppra - see my ratings under each of those -  but overall I do best with Inderal/Klonopin as needed and a lot of walking/deep breathing.  Other things that have helped me are doing charity work - getting outside MYSELF and thinking about others-  prayer/meditation   diet changes (less caffeine - going to try  NO caffeine) and the addition of vitamins and omega 3it is a lifelong journey...bawstngrl

Fantastic SITUATIONAL solution This is not a drug you take regularly. I use it before &quot;difficult&quot; situations for me. (Job interviews, presentations etc) Before I was prescribed this cheap, effective medication, I was a nervous wreck in the time leading up to these situations---sweaty palms, heart pounding, completely unable to think quickly, clearly, process complex info.  I have always had a major issue with what I would call stage fright, but its gotten much worse over the years. This seems to work great at calming me down w/ minimal side effects--only chilly hands and feet.  You need to take it about an hour prior to one of these situations.  Good luck.

Side Effects Not Worth It Inderal did have the desired effect of suppressing most of my migraines..... but my hands were numb half the time, and my brain didn't exactly work the way it had before - it was like functioning with every other brain cell.  Quit and never looked back.  Imitrex for me.

Tried 3 beta blockers for migraines GP started me on Propranolol 10mg/x3 then 4/x/day with plan to 60 mg/once a day, but when I reached that dose I was too fatigued and especially dizzy and blood pressure, low anyway, down too low. Then she tried me on Inderal LA (time-released), 60mg/x1 day, but I was snowed, extremely fatigued, no energy at all. Unfortunately this took place in the humid and hot summertime, and I could't tolerate the heat at all, would get extremely dizzy just going outside from house to car, had difficulty being outside for any length of time at all, and I'm usually someone who has much higher tolerance of heat than most people.  We went back to propanolol and the only dose I could tolerate was 10 mg/x 4/day.  This DID reduce my migraine frequency by about 25% and those I had were more easily controlled with my abortives, (Maxalt works best for me) with only minor dizziness/fatigue/bp problems, but the necessity of having to space out a med four times a day made it impractical, I would easily forget a dose.  She gave up and sent me to a neurologist who began me on Atenolol 25 mgs/ once a day, then up to 25 mgs twice a day at same time in am which I have been taking for almost two months now. The GOOD NEWS is that the side affects are very tolerable - no decrease at all in blood pressure, no fatigue. Dizziness at times and and increase in Raynauds in my fingertips is slightly annoying.  The wierdest and most troublesome side affect is the &quot;vivid dreams&quot; the pharm. sheet warned about - hard to describe but very intense and emotional, especially a few featuring deceased relatives who I felt I was able to see again and tell how much I loved and missed, but woke up crying . . . not especially fun. These were more common the first month and have almost complegely gone away now.Anyway, BAD NEWS is the atenolol did not reduce frequency or intensity of migraines, unfortunately, at all.

as need / essential tremor Have had an essential tremor (probably related to my epilepsy) since childhood (am now 38). Tremor is VERY correlated to social situations. Hands tremble mildly 100% of time but tremor gets very bad whenever I feel self-conscious about people noticing it (ex. I avoid eating soup in a restaurant) or simply when I'm alone but doing work that requires manual dexterity (my work in a molecular biology lab frequently requires very steady hands).Prop-HCL taken 15 min before a situation gives about 80% absolute control of the tremor. The placebo effect is also real and helpful - probably brings control to 95% total.I use it on an as-needed basis in social situations. Rarely more than once or twice/week. I also keep lorazepam/ativan on hand for seizure control. Occasionally have used it for tremor when Prop. is not available, but it does not work as effectively as Prop-HCL.It's covered by insur. and I don't actually know what it costs.

Propranolol changed my life I love it!  I started taking it a month ago for rapid heart rate and heart palpitations brought on by physical anxiety. I was having anxiety about the way my body responded to anxiety, if that makes sense?  If I was in a nervous situation, I was panicing about my sped up heart rate etc and that was just perpetuating the situation.  I was prescribed propranolol in Sept but was too afraid to take it until this last month.  I did a lot of research and decided that it would be very safe to take.  I wish I had started them in Sept!!  I would have saved myself a few months of agony :)I really reccommend this medicine.  It takes all the tension, axiety away and makes me feel very steady and calm without the effects of something like Xanax.

Worked at first, weight gain made d/c necessary Unfortunately like all old antidepressants and old beta blockers propanalol made me gain &amp; retain weight gained. My neuro discontinued this rx when I was diagnosed with MS. For some reason Propanalol is contraindicated with my MS rx or MS dx. we did have to increase the dose over time to continue to prevent migraines. Then switched to Topamax which worked better with  mood stability.skipping #abacavir.page1

Propranolol changed my life I love it!  I started taking it a month ago for rapid heart rate and heart palpitations brought on by physical anxiety. I was having anxiety about the way my body responded to anxiety, if that makes sense?  If I was in a nervous situation, I was panicing about my sped up heart rate etc and that was just perpetuating the situation.  I was prescribed propranolol in Sept but was too afraid to take it until this last month.  I did a lot of research and decided that it would be very safe to take.  I wish I had started them in Sept!!  I would have saved myself a few months of agony :)I really reccommend this medicine.  It takes all the tension, axiety away and makes me feel very steady and calm without the effects of something like Xanax.

Worked at first, weight gain made d/c necessary Unfortunately like all old antidepressants and old beta blockers propanalol made me gain &amp; retain weight gained. My neuro discontinued this rx when I was diagnosed with MS. For some reason Propanalol is contraindicated with my MS rx or MS dx. we did have to increase the dose over time to continue to prevent migraines. Then switched to Topamax which worked better with  mood stability.

Can't I do anything else?? I've been having problems since June 2005.  On Inderal since Sept.  Just diagnosed with FM.  In sept asked my neuro if I could take anything to help my muscle twitches and tremors in my hands.  Also my pulse had been running about 100.  Started inderal and it has helped those issues 99%.

Not recommended for people with depression (MIMS) I stopped taking Inderal about 6 months ago as I was concerned that it may have been exascerbating the depression I was having at the time. Since then I haven't had any migraines or any other ill effects.

It's Worth a Try Propranolol is a migraine preventative.   It is not intended to relieve/abort a current migraine.  I was getting 4-5 migraines per month.  I have been taking propranolol for 6 months, and it is reducing the number of migraines.  Now about 2 per month.  No side effects for me in low doses and very inexpensive.

ZOMBIE TIME! When I used inderal, it completely relieved my Migraines. Completely. Unfortunately, it also stopped my life. Completely. At least with migraines I knew I had good days, with inderal everyday was like a drug induced coma. I couldn't think, I gained weight because I was immobile most of the time, and my IQ dropped about 50 points. I will never take it again.

Possible help with migraine This seems to reduce my headaches by about 20% so I am required to used other drugs. Wonderful blood pressure control however. Lots of side effects - It really causes tiredness and I had to keep reducing the dose. Numerous people can't tolerate the depression it seems to cause so I wouldn't advise it.

Best thing that happened to me so far! I have been taking propranolol for a little over 2 years, I was prescribed it in a time when I was cutting myself, and my nurse practitioner said that it would help anxiety and suppress harmful thoughts. I was skeptical when she prescribed it, because I had never heard of a harmful thought suppressing pill. It's been over two years and I haven't cut myself since. Don't think this is a cure-all drug for cutting, talk to a psychiatrist first. Not only has it helped me in that field, it has reduced a lot of my social anxiety problems, although not all, the ones I do encounter are less intense. If I'm doing something where I may encounter anxiety, my NP told me to take an extra 20MG on top of my 40MG, and it does help a lot.

propranolol This is a medicine which I use in combination with lorazepam or alprazolam (xanax) when I get a panic attack. These attacks occur five times a year in average and most often while driving my car especially on long trips. So I learned to take this medicine before even starting to drive so I give it a little time to kick in. It works well for me, slows down my heart rate and lorazepam keeps the anxiety on an acceptable level. Before I knew about this my life was hell, now it's much better.  My advice though is not to take propranolol on a regular every day basis because it induces the number of beta receptors on your heart and then you will have to increase the dosage and eventually become a slave to this drug. Otherwise it's all right.

Governor! This stuff works amazingly well. It works like a governor (cruise control) on your heart etc. So, when you get panicky it prevents your heart from pounding in your chest as a constant reminder that you are scared to death.This alone can allow you to remaind in the situation and gain the confidence that you need.

not much help I've been taking Inderal LA 80 for about 6 months now. I haven't noticed that it has helped prevent migraines. I still get them and it seems like just as often. My migraine doctor increased me to 2 capsules daily and I really noticed alot of tiredness and maybe depression. Another side effect is the tops of my feet itch. It's been almost the whole time I've been on it... I can't seem to stop frantically itching my feet and then I draw blood... So , since it's not helping my migraines and it's making me tired and I'm tired of my feet itching all the time... I'm gradually going off of it...

Inderal I was taking 20mg 2/day. It worked great after the initial side effects went away after about a week(tired, weak, felt really slowed down). It worked for about 3 months then just stopped, the headaches came back. My Dr. increased the dosage to 40mg 2/day about 2 weeks ago.The headaches are gone again but I still feel weak and tired. I'm a little concerned with weight gain also.It stopped working after about a month. So after afew other medication trials I went back to it for the 3rd time with no luck at all.

My Dr. increased the dosage to 40mg 2/day about 2 weeks ago.The headaches are gone again but I still feel weak and tired. I'm a little concerned with weight gain also.It stopped working after about a month. So after afew other medication trials I went back to it for the 3rd time with no luck at all.

Crap I have Generalised Social Phobia. This drug did nothing for me, but made me more 'slowed down' as time went on and fogged up my mind even more. Simply put - crap.

Works great with clonazepam I find the combination of clonazepam and propanolol works extremely well to quell my attacks and calm my mood.  There is a synergy between them as they are not nearly as effective separately.  I do beleive the effectiveness of clonazepam (as with other benzodiazepines) does wane over time but it seems to be much more logarithmic rather than linear and its rate of effectiveness seems to essentially stabilize after so many months.  The rate of propanolol's effectiveness seems to remain steady.  Good luck.

Made me exercise intolerant This medicine was moderately effective in reducing residual anger, anxiety and rumination.  I had to stop taking it within the first month. Mainly due to a marked decrease in endurance with any form physical activity . It's not like I was a jock to begin with. So I stopped it felt like it  all together. I had been working on the 5th floor of a building and relied on running those stairs for my daily work out(often beat the elevator up). After stopping the med my energy level returned. Anyone else experience this?

I actually WANT to go outside today! After becoming addicted to benzos, (Xanax and Ativan), I thought I'd have to live with anxiety forever. My doc put me on Inderal yesterday for general anxiety and agoraphobia, 20 mg 2 or 3 times a day as needed. 30 minutes after the first dose, I felt the tension and general anxious feeling I've lived with for 15 years melt away. I felt calm, but not &quot;sedated&quot; like other meds make you feel. I am also taking Lamactil, 125mg, and Zoloft 150mg. So far, so good!!!

Propranolol for Migraine Prevention I have always been a migraine sufferer. Over the years i have figured out that they are triggered by being too hungry, thirsty or tired, or at times when hormones peak such as pre-ovulation, pre-menstrual etc. A year ago i started taking an SSRI antidepressant and the migraines became more frequent, severe and prolonged. Because of the risk of using most migraine-relief drugs in combination with the anti-depressant, i soldiered on without treatment until i thought that i would rather die than carry on, knowing i would get another migraine within the next month. My GP suggested i try propranolol. I found that it helps to prevent but not to treat a migraine. I take a very small dose so the side-effects of tiredness, breathlessness etc. do not really bother me much. on a couple of occasions i have felt very nauseous without a headache and i have wondered if i am still having a migraine but the headache is eliminated because of the beta blocker. Whatever it is, my migraines have started to reduce in frequency again and for that i am grateful. Try it...it is really cheap to take a small dose of propranolol generic and relatively harmless, so you've nothing to lose. I still need to work on my triggers though.

Low energy and depression I took Inderal for many years. All through highschool and college I took Inderal I went up and down wiht the dosage and brought it all the way down to 60mg/day when I thought I had no energy with a higher dose. Finally after years of being on it I told the doc, no more. It wasnt helping. When I went off the drug I was amazed how much more energy I had and how upbeat I was. Only a small dose made me depressed and lathargic. Turns out I am super sensitive to side effects. Who knew, everyone probably had the mentality that teenagers are depressed anyway.

Scary if you are allergic I am allergic to Beta Blockers and this drug not only was not effective, but after a few weeks I began to have asthma symptoms from it. And I don't asthsma. This may help some people, but if you feel your chest tighten up, or wheeze when you are breathing or feel out of breathe call your doctor immediately! This allergy can kill if it is not detected quickly enough.

Throbbing The Inderal doesn't decrease the quantity or quality of migraines. It does, however, eliminate the persistent throbbing I experience which amplifies the migraine symptoms. When I'm not experiencing a migraine the pounding can still drive me crazy, especially at night when I lay down to try and sleep.

Very practical alternative to terror! I tried Inderal for the first time last Saturday night when I was singing at a charity event.  I took 10 mg. about one hour before. It worked very well.  My hands didn't shake, my knees didn't knock and I did not experience rushes of anxiety before or during the performance.  It did not seem to diminish my excitement, enjoyment or performance. I was still nervous, just not terrified.  I recommend this drug for people who have strong, physical symptoms of stage fright.Two months later:  I have given two presentations that I normally would have declined during this period, with very little anxiety.  I have found that even a tiny done (5 mg) is effective in taking the edge off my nerves before important meetings.  I have to question the necessity of the huge doses I see mentioned in this forum - 80 to 160 mg.  That seems like overkill based on my experience.

Good for GAD, but not yet for panic I've been the antidepressant route [which I really don't understand for anxiety] and it did nothing or made it worse depending on the Rx.  Propranolol has helped ease up the general anxiety, but [as of yet] has not really helped the panic attacks.

Propranolol/Atenolol I was first prescribed Propranolol along w/Klonopin in 1993 for my anxiety/panic/social phobia. I was 34 at the time. I have a rating for generic Clonazapam under the Anxiety category.I started having anxiety/panic when I was very young when my parents (who constantly fought) had a bad argument. It continued into high school as social phobia (way beyond just being shy). By the time I entered college this disorder, along with my lifelong depression virtually crippled and destroyed any chance of getting through 4 years with a degree. I dropped out in my 3rd year.The panic started causing me chest pains by the time I was in my mid-twenties. I never told any Drs. The only people who knew were my co-workers who witnessed me drop to the floor on the job &amp; double over in pain for as many as 2-3 minutes at a time. I thought I had heart problems or was going to have a heart attack when this happened. There is no history of heart disease/attacks in either side of my family. The other equally distressing symptom I started having from the panic was a irregular, racing heart and also the feeling, `I had something caught in my throat and that I couldn't breath.'The breathing thing even happened at home sometimes when I wasn't even under any apparent stress. I was ready to call 911 many times when I felt like I was going to quit breathing / suffocate. I finally started seeing a Psychiatrist for the first time when I was 34. The first thing that we were able to get under control of all my disorders was the physical symptoms (heart &amp; breathing stuff) with Propranolol. I was so relieved when I found out there was never anything wrong with my Heart and that all these problems were caused by my Panic/Anxiety response to stress. The beta blockers don't do anything for the actual feelings of anxiety/panic without the Klonopin but conversely, without the beta blockers the heart &amp; breathing things which make you feel like you might die are only treated with

Interesting Inderal My doctor put me on this medication in 1995, when I was having migraines nearly every day, and could not function.  The med stopped the frequency of the migraines.  When they did occur, the drug also helped shorten the duration and the severity of the migraine.  However, I could not do heavy exercise, running, fast walking, etc, without my heart racing and banging against my chest, and getting terribly dizzy.  I finally went a year without having a migraine, and so have been taken off this medication.  If you don't do a lot of exercise, this should work wonderfully.  If you do, be careful.

inderal withdrawal   After quitting alcohol in 1998, I have been taking Inderal three times a day (for anxiety, and to keep my pulse down).  Recently after a flu bug, my doctor told me to stop taking it....just like that.  I was stupid not to ask him why I was supposed to stop it after 6 1/2 years.  In a few days I could not function...I felt like I was withdrawing from a narcotic.  I could not sleep, eat, or function. I felt like I was having a nervous breakdown, and ended up in the hospital with the label: depression.  While in the hospital, they put me back on Inderal (the generic actually, Propanolol), and I recovered over a period of 4-7 days.    Please, if you quit taking this drug, stop it gradually and not suddenly.

betablockers for headaches About 3 years ago I started suffering with very intense severe headaches brought on by the fibromyalgia that I have, which was/is causing the muscles and tendons in my shoulders and neck to seize up and inflame.  This in turn brought on intense headaches which without treatment were enough to literally knock me off my feet on occasion.  After about 6mths of this, I was prescribed propranalol which can be used to treat 'migraine type' headaches which is what the headaches I was suffering were labeled as.I take 1 capsule every night at bedtime, and although I don't know how they work, they certainly do, and I'm now virtually free from the headaches.  I certainly no longer get the intense stabbing shooting painful headaches which used to knock me off my feet, and which used to leave me crying and feeling like life really wasn't worth living.  The few 'breakthrough' headaches that I do get now, are treatable with ordinary paracetamol and ibuprofen for the most part (very occasionally I resort to codeine to control them).

inderal	Migraine	2005-03-02 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	4.5	betablockers for headaches About 3 years ago I started suffering with very intense severe headaches brought on by the fibromyalgia that I have, which was/is causing the muscles and tendons in my shoulders and neck to seize up and inflame.  This in turn brought on intense headaches which without treatment were enough to literally knock me off my feet on occasion.  After about 6mths of this, I was prescribed propranalol which can be used to treat 'migraine type' headaches which is what the headaches I was suffering were labeled as.I take 1 capsule every night at bedtime, and although I don't know how they work, they certainly do, and I'm now virtually free from the headaches.  I certainly no longer get the intense stabbing shooting painful headaches which used to knock me off my feet, and which used to leave me crying and feeling like life really wasn't worth living.  The few 'breakthrough' headaches that I do get now, are treatable with ordinary paracetamol and ibuprofen for the most part (very occasionally I resort to codeine to control them).  I'm no longer feeling like I'd happily chop my own head off to control the pain.I don't get any side effects from this drug, and I would not choose to stop taking it as it has made a huge difference to my life and particularly to my quality of life.I have been on the tablets for approx 2.5 yrs and may well be on them for the rest of my life, however I am happy with this if it means I don't have to suffer the intense pain and trauma of the headaches which I was living with before.It took about 3-4 weeks before I began to see an improvement in the headaches, and several months for them to really take effect fully.

I hope this helps...it helped me !! Hi people,SSRI's aren't well tolerated by many people  with anxiety disorder. They can exacerbate the nervous symptoms for weeks and cause panic attacks until the user can adjust to them. I have found that most people can't or won't tolerate them and stop this medication.Benzodiazepines are totally different. They are fast acting with few side effects. I trust the Xanax XR  for many reasons. 1) It is easy to take the pill once a day and forget it. 2) It is released slowly but at a constant dose for 6-8 hours....(with regular xanax...the dose makes you feel great for a shorter time then drops off suddenly). Please keep in mind that this class of drug is highly addictive and should be considered for short term use only unless directed by your physician.A few other drugs you may discuss with your doctor are Serzone (nefazadone) an antidepressant with few side effects and Inderal (Propranolol) a beta blocker that effectively stops the adrenaline rushes that plague so many with anxiety disorders. Reduces heart palpitations and nervousness.A lower carb diet also is a good way to go....as in this lifestyle ...you will be eliminating most sugars. As it is know sugar can affect people with GAD adversely. The highs and lows with sugar levels going up and down can mimic anxiety symptoms and make you feel more nervous. Also ...avoid stimulants....If you smoke........QUIT !!! Avoid coffee and other stimulants found in soft drinks.Deep breathing exercises are very important here.....as they can cause a deep relaxing effect....my favorite method can be found here on Dr. Andrew Weil's site: http://www.drweil.com/u/Article/M116/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can also be very effective in helping you understand what is happening in your body when you have GAD or panic attacks. You can learn not to overreact to the symptoms and let them pass without feeding into your fears.There is no magic bullet....no quick cure...but just

A Miracle Drug I overheard two musicians discussing beta blockers for stage fright and thought I could use it public speaking. When I have appellate or supreme court arguments I get quite nervous often can barely speak for the first minute or so.  I tried Inderal for the first time today and simply cannot believe how effective it was--I was perfectly calm and even more clear-headed than usual. I am a little tired coming down but that could be the sub I had for lunch.  Truly fantastic.

Inderal and Migraines I suffered from migraines on an almost daily basis. I had about 4 migraines weekly. I was first diagnosed with migraines when I was 11 years old.  The headaches became more frequent and severe as I entered my twenties up until last year.  The migraines were debilitating.  I could not work when i got a migraine. Nothing helped relieve the pain except sleep and even that didn't take care of it all the time.  The headaches got so bad that they were getting in the way of my daily life.  I saw a neurologist and was started on some medication that did nothing for me.  Last year, I spoke with a doctor who suggested giving Inderal a try.  Since June, 2004 I have had ONE migraine and that was during a 4 day period that I did not taking the Inderal because I didn't get my prescription refilled.  I have since learned that I will NEVER fail to refill my prescription. I am SO grateful to have my life back and love my migraine-free days. If you suffer from migraines, ask your doctor about Inderal...give it a shot! My life is 100% better without migraines!!!!! :) YAY!

inderal- long term, high dosage i have had severe palpitations for as long as i care to remember. Fortunately, my doc put me on inderal 160mg once daily, and they calmed right down. Unfortunately, if i miss a tablet, even by as much as 2 hours, i get terrible headaches, along with awful panic attacks.i dont know if i should stay on inderal (ive been on them for 18 months), or see if i can come off the treatment, and see if i start suffering again (i still have the odd one, so i dont know if im becoming immune!).if that makes sense, then advice would be nicethanks

Inexpensive and partly effective For me, the drug does not cause the mental blocking that the benzos do. If you speak in public, or play a musical instrument, xanax ain't gonna cut it. It is really intersting to have anxious thoughts, but to feel no sympathetic nervous system impairment. You feel the way that other people must feel all of the time! It is nice. The drug can have side effects, so check with your physician carefully. Low blood pressure and possibly depression are more common than some reports suggest.

Saved My Career Today Well, propranalol saved my entire career today. I have been socially phobic about public speaking for years. I FREEZE and have a total inability to speak in presentation mode. Hard for a career person on the fast-track. I've called in sick on presentation days. Avoided everything. I mean... I really couldn't do it at all. I was always overcome by extreme panic, heart rate exceleration, and this wierd surreal sense. Hyperventilation, and huge embarrassment in front of co-workers. A very progressive doctor prescribed me Propranolol for these very situations recently, and today was my first (real life) trial with about 60mg 2 hours in advance. I did also have a small dosage of clonazapam in combination. In any case, for the first time in years, I was able to give a speach to 60 people. And none of the horrendous side effects happened. Nothing. It was amazing. No freezing, no palpatations, no shaking from head to toe, no inability to speak (all those things that have set me so far back in the past). Please try this medication if you have a similar problem. The suffering and limitations of career life that you've felt may disappear like mine did. Don't get me wrong. I was nervous before heading up to the microphone, but once in front of a group of VPs and Vendors, I actually pulled it off so easily. I think the clonazepam worked well in combination though, so maybe, if your doctor agrees to a backup dose of a benzo-d, you might be well served. Anyway... this is a breakthrough for me. I had rave reviews today on the proffessionalism I dispayed. Just watch the levels of Benzo. They have to be very light, or you'll appear to be confused and dim-witted. But don't worry, the beta-blocker seems to carry the biggest part of the problem.

didnt help, made me faint i was given Propranolol for headaches, i was not informed by my doctor that it was a beta blocker so i got off to a bad star because of that, until i read the packaging card when collecting the prescription i assumed i had been given a pain killer, had to call the doc and find out if it was a mistake.i didn't help my headaches at all but did cause a drop in blood pressure which made me feel faint and tired. i was constantly dizzy and unstable because of the low blood pressure. I had to discontinue it because of the blood pressure thing, as it didn't settle, although it did go up slightly when i added hormonal contraception to the equation. I wouldn't recommend this for headache unless they are known to be caused by high blood pressure (vascular migraines?).not worth trying otherwise.

LIFESAVER    I have been trying to find a way to curb my performance anxiety for years (I'm 19).  Last year, about half way through my senior year I discovered this amazing drug.  I experience a very high heart rate and trembling when I need to speak in public or perform in front of a large crowd.  I have played basketball ever since I was a little kid, but when I was a sophomore in high school something terrible happened.  I would tense up when shooting, and if you play basketball, you know this is bad.  This effected my free-throws the most.  I did some research on the internet and found Inderal was used by some athletes and performers for performance anxiety.  As I researched this drug more and learned how it worked, it all started making sense to me.  The beta blocker actually blocked adrenaline, and I thought this could be my problem-I produced too much adrenaline when I needed less.My doctor hadn't prescribed Inderal to anyone for purely anxiety reasons, but I explained to him how I thought it would work and he agreed.  He gave me the 20mg doses.  The first time I tried it out was at a basketball game.  I don't play much, but when I got in, I knew it was working.  My movements and shots were very smooth with no feeling of tenseness.  I was overjoyed.  There is a bad side of taking this for athletics.  It slows your heart rate and you will fatigue more easily and will feel unnatural, but since I didn't play much, this wasn't a concern.Another problem that this drug solved was my fear of public speaking.  Like I mentioned before my heart rate would escalate through the roof and my hands, and even sometimes my head/face would tremble.  When I took 20mg an hour before the speaking I had to do, all of these symptoms totally disappeared.  They didn't just decrease, they vanished.  I was skeptical the first time I used it for speaking, but when I got up in front of everyone, I knew this drug worked.The only side effects that I know I have expe

Fabulous Drug Inderal is absolutely fabulous!  I have been suffering from anxiety since May 2002 with severe heart palpatations, especially before bed.

Worked Well but Made Me Terribly Sleepy I asked my Nurse Practitioner to prescribe me this drug as I saw it on this website. I took 25mg in the morning.  It did a good job relieving my anxiety and did a good job at relaxing me.  Supposedly it relaxes your spinal cord to your brain.  In any case I got really really tired.  I got home that night and slept for 13 hours!!  The sleep felt good but I doubt I will take this again.  If I do I will break open the capsule and try a 1/4 up to a 1/2 of a 25 mg capsule and see how that works. This is what my NP told me to do.  I am very sensitive to drugs so a general person may be able to take a 25mg and be fine I would need to take a very small dose.  I would also recommend a small dose if you are a small to petite person.  I am 5'6 120IBS.

Inderal Is Very Effective For Anxiety Symptoms I give this drug an A+! Though it doesn't take away the anxiety, at least it takes away the pounding heart, the sweating and trembling. Well worth trying.

Inderal for migraines I have been taking inderal la for several weeks.  This medicine has not reduced the number of migraine attacks that I have, but the persistent throbbing headache that I had before this onset of migraines is gone!  The side effects are miserable, and I think I would rather deal with the headaches.  The problem is that I have been playing phone tag with my doctor to four days, and I feel that I should be in contact with them to know how to get off this medicine.  The fatigue and dizziness with this medicine is unbelievable.

Propranolol - Probably Effective Physical Symptoms I have taken 40mg propranolol as required (up to 3x daily) for social anxiety over the last year. My doctor told me it would be effective against the psychological symptoms as well as physical symptoms. I knew he was lying about the psychological symptoms, but what suprised me was that propranolol had no effect at all on my physical symptoms of anxiety. I don't suffer much from physical symptoms; so a beta-blocker was never going to work for me anyway. It may be worth a try, but I'm doubtful of its effectivness on reducing psychological anxiety.

Works well - no side effects, few migraines I have now been on this drug for almost 1 1/2 years and it works very well. I get the migraines only when I don't eat regularly or I am stressed and I used to be very susceptible to them. I know this drug doesn't work for everyone, but it is very inexpensive (the generic is $5/month) and worth a try.

It helped me I have been on inderal for just 2 months but in that time have had only one, extremely mild, migraine.  I take 20 mg twice a day.  Initially I was dizzy and didn't like the way I felt so I halved the dose and built myself up to taking the 20 mg twice a day.  Within 3 weeks I was taking the full dose with minimal side effects.  I do feel more fatigued and some days have no energy but it is better than the anxiety affiliated with will I or won't I get a migraine today!

Inderal gave me headaches for 30 years I never had a headache before.  I took Inderal for blood pressure for a few weeks in 1975 and for the first time in my life I felt a numb scalp and face, which later became an exertional headache.  This exertional headache has plagued me now for 30 years.  It acts up after exertion, or after alcohol, or when bending over.  It ruined my life.  Inderal is &quot;given for relaxation and to prevent skipped beats...very benign.&quot;  Well this 30 year headache (and vertigo) I got after Inderal says: careful!  Don't let it happen to you!!!

Child on Propranolol My son started getting Migraines once a month when he was three years old.  When my son started school, I took him to a pediatric neurologist who put him on liquid Propranolol.  At this point, he gets maybe one Migraine a year, as opposed to 12.  The doctor has not increased the dosage in five years, hoping that as my son grows, he will wean himself off the medicine.  If the migraines come back, the dosage will be increased.  I believe that he is lethargic due to the medicine, and he has gained some weight, but it sure beats having him vomiting due to his Migraines!UPDATE: This summer, Kyles doctor wanted to try weaning him off his Propranolol to see if he had outgrown his headaches.  I was willing to give it a try because I really think he has put some weight on because of the medicine.I started cutting back on Kyles medicine, and we were rejoicing in the fact that he hadnt had any migraines.  That lasted until he had been completely off the medicine for four or five days, and then Kyle had another bad migraine, vomiting and all. I dont know, maybe thats how long it took to get it out of his system, but I felt terrible that he had gotten sick again when it was something that could be prevented.I decided to try to wean him again since I wasnt sure if it Kyle worked himself into a migraine since he knew he was off the medication.  At times it seemed that when was upset or stressing over something, hed get a migraine.  I thought maybe he was dwelling on the fact that he was completely off the medicine.  I decided to start the Propranolol again.  I waited about a month to get it built up in his system, and then I started cutting back again, but this time I didnt tell Kyle what I was doing.  Being busy with all the activities that come with summer vacation, he didnt seem to notice when I skipped the morning doses, and next, when I skipped the evening doses.  Sure enough within five days, he was violently sick again.At that p

The first that worked... Propranolol was the first medication that stopped the physical symptoms of severe panic attacks dead in their tracks, back when I had a complete emotional breakdown in the late 1980's (which included massive and unrelenting panic that dogged me even while sleeping).  It immediately allowed me to begin focusing on the mental aspects of what was happening and start getting my life back together again.  I was started on a dosage of 40 mg. 3 times a day, and gradually decreased it over the years to 5-10mg twice/day (at this point I'm no longer taking it, mostly because I have mild emphysema and it doesn't mix with breathing problems).  Along with antidepressants and (later) clonazepam, it was the primary treatment for me for a long time.  Back then if I had been forced to give up all my meds except for one, I would have kept the propranolol.I believe beta blockers in general are still rather overlooked in the treatment of panic and severe anxiety -- particularly for those people who have major issues with the physical aspects like tachycardia, skipping heartbeats, sweating, hyperventilating and things like that.  It's also a fairly safe drug compared to most of the others, and has no potential for addiction (although it must be tapered when going off).

The nightmare drug This stuff is simply horrible. Supposedly, the side effects diminish after a couple of weeks. I still felt horrible (very lethargic, no energy, lack of concentration) all the time after 2 weeks, with no noticeable reduction in migraines. Needless to say, I stopped taking it.

COULD NOT TOLERATE IT! I took 80mg slow release caps for about six weeks. The first day was the best after that i was dizzy and confused for the following 5 weeks 6 days. My doc said the side effects would go away but they never did. As a anti-anxiety med they were great but i couldn't appreciate them as i was so dizzy and confused that i looked like i had spent the whole day at a bar drinking shots.I think he made a mistake by starting me on 80mg first. I have since heard that with b-blockers its best to start at the lowest possible dose, that being 10mg, and work upwards until you feel you have the right dosage. Maybe if my doc would have done this i would not have wanted to come off them when i did. I think i had too much too soon and as we all know its easier to move up with your dosage than cut back.If you are reading this and are about to go on Propranolol take this advice PLEASE. Also i hear that, as all beta blockers are not the same, which i didn't know at the time, Its best to go with atenolol for anxiety as this beta blocker is completely hydrophilic ie it does not cross the blood brain barrier like propranolol. Because propranolol does cross the blood brain barrier its more likely to cause sleep disturbance, nightmares, hallucinations, nightmares, confusion etc. I wish someone would have written this advice for me when i was about to go on propranolol as i think i would have done more research on the matter and discussed this with my doctor, then maybe i would have not suffered from all the side effects of propranolol and lost my job. GOOD LUCK TO WHOEVER FINDS THIS INFO USEFUL.

Cured my spring restlessness In spring I have a tendency to to become extremely agitated and restless. I tried propranolol this year, and it seems to completely block this. I think I may have akathisia (but apparently not entirely drug-related, this has been happening since well before I started taking antidepressants and so on, which is odd).My episode of spring restlessness last year was extremely acute. I could not keep still, I had to be walking for most of the day, and my mind was constantly racing. My psychiatrist diagnosed me with anxiety (i was already being treated for depression) and tried to treat it with benzodiazapines and antidepressants, with little effect. I lapsed into an extremely severe depression that summer. During the period, I was in constant emotional and physical pain, in a state of continuous panic, became socially withdrawn, and did not want to continue my life.So it would have been rather useful if i had known about this stuff *last* year. I had some difficulty obtaining a prescription for propranolol, my doctors much prefer their benzodiazepines, and at one point I simply refused to leave my GP's consultation room until he gave me some (this actually worked! hmm). Ordering propranolol over the internet might be another option, though I am not sure of the legality of this (but if it's life or death, who cares...).(during spring, i also took modafinil for depression, which may or may not be important)

Migraine headaches I started taking Inderal in December after consulting a neurologist and a primary care physician. My migraines were becoming increasingly worse and more frequent. I had epidural steroid treatments, lidocaine patches and physical therapy. No help. The Inderal has lessened the frequency and severity of the migraines but I still get a screamer when a new front comes through or if I get too stressed out or dehydrated. When the pain gets too bad I resort to the old standby, Fiorinal w/codeine.

No Sweat! I have had debilitating anxiety for much of my life compounded by the fact that when anxious I sweat profusely which just causes more anxiety. I was prescribed Propanolol as an experiment and tried it in a social situation last night and again today for a speaking engagement--two times when I would normally be dripping--and both times were 100% successful. I am so happy to have found this, although I plan on only using it as necessary because I read here about how it can lose effectiveness.

Just what I've been looking for! I recently began taking 80mg Inderal LA (24-hour extended-release form) once a day, and wow!  What a difference!  It was prescribed to me for the physical symptoms of anxiety (heart palpitations, sweating, etc.), performance anxiety, and occasional severe anger that may be indicative of intermittent explosive disorder.  This little pill keeps me outwardly calm all day long... I only wish it also addressed the issues of psychological anxiety.~~~I may have spoken too soon... after several more  weeks, the Inderal gradually began to give me some horrible side effects.  During week six, I began to notice that my hands were always very cold.  I didn't quite know what to make of this, but logically it seemed to me that a drug which decreases blood pressure and pulse could be the catalyst.  I looked propranolol up in my PDR, and sure enough, &quot;cold extremities&quot; was listed as a possible side effect.  But still, it wasn't bothering me that much, so I decided to stick with it.Week seven:  One day out of the blue I woke up feeling unusually lethargic, depressed, weak, and irritable.  I suffer from no form of depression or dysthymia, yet I remained in this awful state throughout the day.  Once again, I thought little of it until the next day when I awoke feeling even worse than the day before.  Maybe the meds were fogging my mind, but not even at that point did I consider that Inderal could be the culprit.  That 'a-ha!' came to me the following day, while I was feeling worse than ever, when I remembered that my step-father had developed the same set of symptoms upon initiation of another beta-blocker, Corgard (nadolol), for migraine prevention.  Even though I pretty much knew for sure what was wrong at this point, I still looked propranolol up once again in the PDR-- depression, fatigue, and lethargy are ALL relatively common side effects.  I abstained from taking the drug for several days and felt 100% better.  I then dug into
inderal	Social phobia (Social anxiety disorder)	2003-08-01 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Just what I've been looking for! I recently began taking 80mg Inderal LA (24-hour extended-release form) once a day, and wow!  What a difference!  It was prescribed to me for the physical symptoms of anxiety (heart palpitations, sweating, etc.), performance anxiety, and occasional severe anger that may be indicative of intermittent explosive disorder.  This little pill keeps me outwardly calm all day long... I only wish it also addressed the issues of psychological anxiety.~~~I may have spoken too soon... after several more  weeks, the Inderal gradually began to give me some horrible side effects.

Inderal for specific situations I have found Inderal to be incredibly helpful for very specific anxiety provoking situations such as public speaking.  It helps to keep me from shaking, having a quivery voice, and sweating, allowing me to stay focused on the task at hand rather than on my fear.  I feel tired and a bit depressed for a day after using it.

beta blocker use Inderal is great for curing anxiety in the short time and has helped me for job interviews etc, but taken long term can have very detrimental side effects, I know from experience. It can make you very depressed, tired and have a very foggy mind so be beware. Taken sparingly it is though very effective. I think the morale of this story is not to let your body get used to it.

This is the first thing that has helped *any*. I've been the antidepressant route [which I really don't understand for anxiety] and it did nothing or made it worse depending on the Rx.  Propranolol has helped ease up the general anxiety, but [as of yet] has not really helped the panic attacks.

Inderal/Propranolol Started taking this medication when I was 25 and have been on them for 6 years.  I have had a total of maybe 4 migraines since then, not as severe as before the medication.  It is helpful for me, but not all obviously.  Once you get past the dizziness, vivid dreams (as I experienced)and different breathing patterns, it works pretty well.

Quite pleased with the results I have taken Propranolol in conjunction with 2 separate medications to control my migraines.  I have suffered from them since my teens and I'm in my early 30's now.  The first year I was prescribed 40mg of Propranolol with 75mg of Amitriptyline.  I had a bad time with the Amitriptyline and switched to Topamax (50mg) with the same dosage of Propranolol. It seems to be working well for me so far.  It was never approached as something that could work alone for me, so I can't comment on that, but I haven't had any side-effects related to that drug, which is the only constant through-out my treatment with my current doctor.I have been quite pleased with the results so far.

Dangerous When I began using Inderal for daily headaches it worked fine, I was fine.  After several months my daily headaches returned.  Much later wen I finally stopped taking Inderal I noticed a change in me everyday. I wasn't tired anymore, I felt alive and human.  Now I know I was spiraling downward in depression.  I am sooo lucky to &quot;think&quot; and stop taking the medicine.  The doctor and pharamacy both told me I would have no side effects and the medicine was harmless (?)

Didn't work that great. I did notice that I was having trouble with short-term memory loss, depression (even though I am taking Welbutrin for depression) and weight gain -about 5 pounds. Cold hands and feet (more than normal) and I still get migraines before, during and after my periods - so why take it? I took myself off it. I am going to try Topiramate if my doctor will agree.

(The doctor said it was a side-effect.)  It took 6-9 months to recover from that, which required other medications with their own side-effects.  I renamed Inderal, &quot;end-it-all&quot;.

Inderal-First Helpful Therapy Inderal was the first migraine preventative that did any good for me.  It definitely reduced both the frequency and severity of the headaches but was not a miracle worker.  This particular period of frequent migraines was caused by perimenopause which I did not realize at the time.  Proper hormone balance might have helped more.

Reduces Panic Symtoms I started taking Inderal and Celexa in August for anxiety and panic.  I had a problem with swallowing and when in certain situations I swallowed excessively to the point I was afraid I would gag in public, puke, etc.  My heart would race and soon I was consumed with fear of doing crazy stuff at work, gagging, puking, etc.  I think the celexa helped to take away my 'want' to swallow excessively, but the inderal took the edge off becoming panicky with no side effects whatsoever.  Definetly helped me!!

Propranolol doesn't work for me I have an new migraine specialist who swears by this med. I have gone up on the dosage over the last months to 80 mg BID. I think that at that dosage, I am having the side effect of disruption of my sleep patterns, although the doctor says that is unlikely. All I know is that when I sleep poorly, my migraines are worse. Since I first wrote this, I have gone off Propranolol, since the sleep disruptions continued. So, for me, this is yet another medication to add to the list of &quot;tried - doesn't work.&quot; Oh, well.

Propranolol has been a solution to my anxiety. Propranolol decreased the worst of my general anxiety, which was symptoms of heart palpitations, feeling like I couldn't breathe (like someone was sitting on my chest) by at least 75%.  I have had absolutely no side effects from it.  I take 40 mg twice a day.  The generic propranolol is VERY inexpensive.  No addictive potential.  Beta blockers really DO WORK!

Inderal LA There wasn't a correct dosage choice here. I took Inderal LA 120 twice a day for six years as a migraine preventive. After a few weeks, the side effect of being tired, dissipated. While it worked for me, it reduced my migraine attacks to only 3 or 4 per year.

indocin	Arthralgia	2011-06-21 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	4.5	5.0	This is the only med. that relieved my pain! I was givenMorphine shots- 3 times- and each time,my pain was not relieved, but each time, Indocin did the job when Morphine,Ibuprofen,or Naproxen did not work at all! If you get in-tolerable pain like I had try Indocin if nothing else works.Great for short term use; would not want to use for longperiods.Ask your Doc for it if you're not getting relief.It will relieve pain and swelling that Ibuprofen wonttouch! My stomach was not much upset;certainly less than abig dose of Ibuprofen would cause.IMPRESSIVE !

After the first time I took it I got diarrhea, but that was a normal side effect. Now I take it every time I have a gout attack with Prednisone. I take it overnight and I am gout free the next morning.

Like Naproxon for me this druf really does not provide much releif during an acute attack not does it shorten the duration of the attack.  There are not many drugs that have I suufer side effects from but more than 1 pill in 24hurs shreds my stomach everytime with this drug.Prednisone is the only medication I have taken that very quickly alleviates the attack and almost clears it up in amtter of a few hours.  This drug does not.

indocin	Arthralgia	2011-06-21 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	4.5	5.0	This is the only med. that relieved my pain! I was givenMorphine shots- 3 times- and each time,my pain was not relieved, but each time, Indocin did the job when Morphine,Ibuprofen,or Naproxen did not work at all! If you get in-tolerable pain like I had try Indocin if nothing else works.Great for short term use; would not want to use for longperiods.Ask your Doc for it if you're not getting relief.It will relieve pain and swelling that Ibuprofen wonttouch! My stomach was not much upset;certainly less than abig dose of Ibuprofen would cause.IMPRESSIVE !

After the first time I took it I got diarrhea, but that was a normal side effect. Now I take it every time I have a gout attack with Prednisone. I take it overnight and I am gout free the next morning.

Like Naproxon for me this druf really does not provide much releif during an acute attack not does it shorten the duration of the attack.  There are not many drugs that have I suufer side effects from but more than 1 pill in 24hurs shreds my stomach everytime with this drug.Prednisone is the only medication I have taken that very quickly alleviates the attack and almost clears it up in amtter of a few hours.  This drug does not.

Just an anti-inflammatory. like Aleve, but seems to be particularly effective for Gout. If you have Gout have some on hand.

Indomethacin for Gout I only take this when gout flares up. There is a short period of a day when the throbbing continues but soon passes. I don't take it long enough to experience some of the side effects associated with longer terms use.

Chronic Paroxysmal Hemicrania I am not sure how I would survive without this medication. Multiple times each day I would have this temple/ocular headache that would travel the trigeminal nerve and be in my upper jaw/tooth, ear, lower jaw and so forth. Over and over again for 20-40 minutes. I tried the indocin and it was incredible! I am now at 75 SR in the morning and 25 at night. Only during some of the &quot;hormone&quot; times of the month I can have a &quot;break through&quot; headache, but I can also go months without them!  Recently I had surgery and they took me off the indocin and I thought I was going to die. Once again, they put me back on it, and the change was incredible. You do have to EAT with this medication!

Indomethacin Took up to 75 mg 4 times per day along with an antacid to minimize damage to my stomach.  It did nothing for the cluster attacks themselves, but did break a constant &quot;shadow&quot; I had had for months.  I think indomethacin should be one of the first meds prescribed in the diagnostic phase to help rule out Paroxysmal Hemicranias (PH) (it is almost 100% effective against PH) and confirm clusters where the effectiveness drops very low.

Indomethacin I tried this to rule out Paroxysmal Hemicrania owing to the number of hits I was having a day. I took it in conjunction with a strong antacid as it can be very harsh on your stomach. Whilst I believe it is up to 80% efective for PH and some CH sufferer's have had success with it.. I wasn't one of them. I do believe though that it was worth a trial.

Indomethacin When I was first diagnosed in the fall of 1997 I was taking 50 mg capsules three times a day. in 2003 my blood work started to show it was affecting my kidney. I was slowly weaned down to two 25 mg capsules per day. I also take a 150 mg tablet of Ratio-Ranitidine with each capsule; I find this aleviates the heartburn and acid reflux I was getting.

Indomethacin Suppositories 100mg They work, but dissolve easily which makes them difficult to use.  Cerebral side effects are not too unpleasant.  Constipation or diarrhoea can occasionally be dire.Please note: I was tried on tablets.  Cessation of peristalsis meant they had no chance of working.  I use the suppositories as required.  I'm not supposed to take more than one a day and I'm glad to say I have only twice needed to disregard that stiulation.

Longtime Indocin Fan I've been using Indocin SR 75mg twice a day for a really long time -- over 10 years now.  When I've had to stop taking it for one reason or another (a medical procedure) I can feel it within 24 hours.  So I know it's doing the job.  I wish it completely relieved my RA symptoms, but that's probably too much to ask.  I haven't had many side effects, though within the first year several liver enzyme tests came back on the high side.  That subsided around Year 3.  (My doc does blood work on me every 6 months.  I should have a spigot installed in my left arm.) I'm careful to take it with food in my stomach so I've never had any digestive issues.

This damaged my stomach permanently After a car accident in 2000, I was adverse to taking Narcotics, so the doctor gave me this stuff and it was good, very good at relieving pain. It helped so much I called the doctor to thank him. A few weeks into using it, I started getting sharp pains under the right side of my rib cage and I thought I had a gall bladder problem. It had me doubling over at points. I went to a gastroenterologist and was scoped, and I discovered that I had one serious case of gastritis (I can only imagine how terrible an actual ulcer is).  Now I'm sorry I ever took the stuff because to this day I can't take any NSAID except a Cox-2 inhibitor like Vioxx or Bextra (which are dangerous and I'm stopping them too, due to cardiovascular side effects now being reported) without having stomach pains within a few days of starting - which has put me in a difficult situation as my back is a near constant issue.

I started on 75mg sr 2 times a day.  After a 2 months the dosage became to much and I went down to taking 2, 25mg in the morning (an hour apart) then at night I take a 50 mg. I have gone 140 days with out a &quot;flare up&quot; of pain.   This is amazing because I was having pain every day before.  I wanted to die.  Now I feel like I have been given back my life!

flu shots I agree they do cause relapses for me or rather I should say worsening of my symptoms.  However, I tried not having one  the year I started with CFS and got the Flu.  I was sure I was going to die.  I could not eat for 6 days as nothing would stay down. I was bed ridden for 15 days total; and a total of 7 weeks trying to recover just from the flu.  I won't even start on the effects the flu had on my CFS symptoms.  Arrg!!!  For me the relapse/worsening of symptoms is preferable to the ravage of the flu.

I'd rather risk the flu than get a shot! I've had fibro 8 years.  On year 2 I got the flu.  From that point on I've been offered a flu shot every year by my GP.  On year 3 I accepted it, and was as ill with the jab as I had been the previous year with the flu.From this point on I have refused the flu jab.  I'd rather take my chances and risk getting the flu and know that ONLY if I catch it will I be ill.  Rather than getting ill every year to supposedly avoid getting ill! With Flu: I was ill with flu for 3 weeks.  but I was lower with the fibro for a further 6-8 weeks.With Flu-Jab: I was ill with flu for 2.5 weeks.  but I was lower with the fibro for a further 8-10 weeks.

keppra	Tonic-clonic Seizures	2012-04-06 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I havent had a siezure since Ive been taking Keppra.Never had any side effects.This is wonderful.
keppra	Epilepsy	2012-03-21 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	I have used Keppra in conjunction with Dilantin to control my seizures since 2004. In 2003 I had two seizures caused by a brain tumor, a meningioma, and it is a great drug.  Since it has become available in generic form I do not believe it is as costly as indicated.My side effects are minimal occasional blurry vision usually mid-afternoon, . I do take Vitamin D supplements in conjunction with Keppra. Since I get my drugs from the VA there is only a nominal cost
keppra	Seizures	2012-01-28 00:00:00		2.5	2.5	5.0	5.0	Hi im Terry. i have tryed a lot of other meds for my seizures nothing worked and all made me sick . The doctor put me on keppra it helps me somewhat . I also think that this medication should be at the top of the list to be used first.
keppra	Seizures	2011-11-17 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	If you have complex partial seizures ask your drs about Keppra along with Vimpat. Vimpat 100mg in am &amp; pmKeppra 500mg which in my case was increased up to 2 1/2 pills in am and pm.  (Keppra by itself did not stop seizures)While I was on Keppra alone I was having small memory loss.Could not remember anything when I came to.  Vimpat changed everything.  While on Keppra alone I was driving to work and ran into the back of someone - had a seizures and kept going.   I had no idea 10 min after the fact what had happened.  The front of my car was bashed in and I had no idea what had happened because I had a full blown complex partial seizure.  Had to hire a lawyer so I would not be given a ticket for Hit &amp; Run.  All charges were dropped because I had all medical records from dr. If you have Complex Partial Seizures do not drive.
keppra	Seizures	2011-11-17 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	For those of you on Keppra ask your drs about Vimpat given along with Keppra.  My husband was diagnosed with Complex Partial Seisures and was put on Keppra 500mg 2 1/2 in morning and 2 1/2 at night along with 100mg in am and 100mg at night He has been himself since the dr added this new drug called Vimpat.  When he was on keppra which we had to have increased several times.  He was still having black outs with his memory.  We were getting scared nothing was going to work.  The last time in with his dr. he added 100 mg in am and pm.  Totally a different person - himself.  Yes he still feels tired at times but thats the trade off.When he was on Keppra by itself he would cry for no reason.Very Emotional.  Vimpat changed all that.  We also went to Emory in Atlanta and they agreed Vimpat was a good choice.I am hoping we can reduce the mg of Keppra and keep Vimpat.That will be our next question to dr.  If you don't have insurance Vimpat is very expensive.  But worth every penny.
keppra	Epilepsy	2011-11-16 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	5.0	When I first started taking Keppra, I became very agitated and drowsy.  My personality changed and I was convinced I hated this medication. Over time my body adjusted and the only side affect that I can see is that I still become very agitated very easily. This is the only drug that helps me that doesn't affect my liver.  That means more than me being a little agitated.
keppra	Seizures	2011-07-10 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	5.0	After four brain surgeries, I had nerve damage, and siezures my Neurosurgeon presribed Keppra and so far I have not had another siezure, been taking for 6 weeks
keppra	Tonic-clonic Seizures	2010-08-28 00:00:00		1.0	1.0	5.0	0.5	I had two tonic-clonic seizures and several partial seizures in a six month time period while on Keppra.  I was placed on this med after my first seizure.  I had a hard time acclimating to it, felt &quot;doped up&quot;, slurring my words, walking slowly, etc.  My family was very worried about me.  Said I was talking funny, not making sense at times.  I have been on Topamax for two years now with no more seizures and tolerating it well.
keppra	Migraine	2010-04-08 00:00:00		5.0	4.5	5.0	5.0	have been having migraines for more than 9 yrs. my neurologist has tried me on every med available. new and old. I was at the end of my rope. got a migraine at one point where I had to take a 10 day leave of absence from work. the pain went from my head to my chest and down to the middle of my back.couldnt even breath.went on the keppra and this until now has been the only med to give me relief. no pain at all.I work in the operating rm and this has been a blessing.I get the generic and works great and not expensive.I take only 1/250mg a day.two was too much as it made me very sleepy.

Made my thinking cloudy and made me aggressive.  Also caused suicidal thoughts.  All of this went away after I stopped taking. I can't remember a lot from when I was on it, but I remember lashing out at my mom over normal everyday things.  It did not help my headache either.

I was put on Keppra after being on trileptal for years and my previous neurologist gave me a hard time so my new neurologist who I asked to change meds from the side effects told me about Keppra.I knew about it and what it does but never tried it.I tried it and I had some side effects dizziness(like one side of the bran was making me dizzy but I felt in the center like in control)but otherwise it works well.My seizures include psychogenic seizures,partial seizures,absence seizure(I hardly get it but once in awhile) and grand mal seizures(unless I am off meds) have made great progress.I also believe that Keppra is as therapeutic for Bipolar.While on trileptal I didn't feel my bipolar was as controlled but with Keppra I feel more level even though I  still have my times.

I have been epileptic for more than 30 years.  In the 6 months while  taking Keppra the biggest plus has been regaining my memory back again.  I feel so &quot;alive&quot; and &quot;alert&quot;.  The negative side effects to Keppra are shakiness (have to hold a cup with 2 hands while taking a drink), Short temper (I have always been a very mild-tempered person), Opinionated (I have an opinion about everything now), Insomnia, and a more aggressive behavior.  The side effects have caused a &quot;depressed&quot; feeling.  I sometimes feel &quot;evil-thoughts&quot; are associated with this medicine.  I have had no grand mal seizures on this medication.

After a horrible experience on Topamax, I thought &quot;hey anything can be better&quot;.  Well, Keppra was better but it caused a whole new array of problems.  While it gave me my short-term memory back and put a halt to the eye pain and insomnia I had experienced on Topamax, it made me severely emotional.  I had read about the &quot;Kepprages&quot; but I also read that taking B-6 would counteract these affects.  They didn't.  I would get angry to the point where I would break things (that's not me at all).  I literally would feel my blood boil.  If I wasn't severely angry, then I was depressed.  I have always been in and out of depression my whole life and I understand that's just one of the joys of living with epilepsy.  But the depression I felt on Keppra was like ten times worse that anything I had experienced.  I was suicidal, I experienced lows that I had never experienced before.  There was no reason in my mind.  I'm glad I'm off it now.

I've been dealing with grand mal seizures for about 4 years.  I never have an idea when they are going to occur and they are very random.  It's very hard to deal with at times and the last thing you want to deal with is a medication that can perform to your standards as well.  I was on Lamictal for the first few years and I became moody and angry and on top of that was getting rashes instantly after taking my medication.  Finally, I seeked out a new doctor who knew that this wasn't the medication for me.  He put me on Keppra and I don't deal with any side effects and so far it's been working.  I would recommend it to anyone.

Horrible, horrible side effects! My son at age 10 was telling me he wanted to die. He was miserable. He had crying jags and feelings of hopelessness. He was aggressive and mean and nasty and extremely volatile. Top it all off with the fact that it didn't even work to stop his seizures! The worst experience of his life. I wouldn't recomend this medicine to ANYONE!!!

NIGHTMARE DRUG This did not help with the clusters at all. It produced intolerable (severe) nightmares. On the other hand, it seemed to also enhance memory skills to an almost photogenic memory level. Weird drug to say the least.

Made my thinking cloudy and made me aggressive.  Also caused suicidal thoughts.  All of this went away after I stopped taking. I can't remember a lot from when I was on it, but I remember lashing out at my mom over normal everyday things.  It did not help my headache either.

I was put on Keppra after being on trileptal for years and my previous neurologist gave me a hard time so my new neurologist who I asked to change meds from the side effects told me about Keppra.I knew about it and what it does but never tried it.I tried it and I had some side effects dizziness(like one side of the bran was making me dizzy but I felt in the center like in control)but otherwise it works well.My seizures include psychogenic seizures,partial seizures,absence seizure(I hardly get it but once in awhile) and grand mal seizures(unless I am off meds) have made great progress.I also believe that Keppra is as therapeutic for Bipolar.While on trileptal I didn't feel my bipolar was as controlled but with Keppra I feel more level even though I  still have my times.

I have been epileptic for more than 30 years.  In the 6 months while  taking Keppra the biggest plus has been regaining my memory back again.  I feel so &quot;alive&quot; and &quot;alert&quot;.  The negative side effects to Keppra are shakiness (have to hold a cup with 2 hands while taking a drink), Short temper (I have always been a very mild-tempered person), Opinionated (I have an opinion about everything now), Insomnia, and a more aggressive behavior.  The side effects have caused a &quot;depressed&quot; feeling.  I sometimes feel &quot;evil-thoughts&quot; are associated with this medicine.  I have had no grand mal seizures on this medication.

After a horrible experience on Topamax, I thought &quot;hey anything can be better&quot;.  Well, Keppra was better but it caused a whole new array of problems.  While it gave me my short-term memory back and put a halt to the eye pain and insomnia I had experienced on Topamax, it made me severely emotional.  I had read about the &quot;Kepprages&quot; but I also read that taking B-6 would counteract these affects.  They didn't.  I would get angry to the point where I would break things (that's not me at all).  I literally would feel my blood boil.  If I wasn't severely angry, then I was depressed.  I have always been in and out of depression my whole life and I understand that's just one of the joys of living with epilepsy.  But the depression I felt on Keppra was like ten times worse that anything I had experienced.  I was suicidal, I experienced lows that I had never experienced before.  There was no reason in my mind.  I'm glad I'm off it now.

I've been dealing with grand mal seizures for about 4 years.  I never have an idea when they are going to occur and they are very random.  It's very hard to deal with at times and the last thing you want to deal with is a medication that can perform to your standards as well.  I was on Lamictal for the first few years and I became moody and angry and on top of that was getting rashes instantly after taking my medication.  Finally, I seeked out a new doctor who knew that this wasn't the medication for me.  He put me on Keppra and I don't deal with any side effects and so far it's been working.  I would recommend it to anyone.

Horrible, horrible side effects! My son at age 10 was telling me he wanted to die. He was miserable. He had crying jags and feelings of hopelessness. He was aggressive and mean and nasty and extremely volatile. Top it all off with the fact that it didn't even work to stop his seizures! The worst experience of his life. I wouldn't recomend this medicine to ANYONE!!!

NIGHTMARE DRUG This did not help with the clusters at all. It produced intolerable (severe) nightmares. On the other hand, it seemed to also enhance memory skills to an almost photogenic memory level. Weird drug to say the least.

Does not like other drugs. When i was first introduced to Keppra it was trial and error. I had been on Carbamazipine and Ethosuximide for years and was stable. After the birth of my son i decided to try other medications. I was first introduced to Lamotrigine and the side effects were awful. At this stage i was then introduced to Keppra and was told to remain on the full dosage of the other medication until i reached 1500mg Keppra. I have never been so ill. It is difficult to state what the effects from the Keppra and the interactions. After struggling to reach the required 1500mg i became very ill. It started with a sore throat and an inability to move. I lost two stone in two weeks. Now the middle of summer light began to hurt my eyes. After going to the doctor to discuss my meds and drop the Lamotrigin i started developing blisters all over. I went straight back to the doctor and diagnosed Polymorphic light eruption. The blisters then turned into Psorisis - i was in crisis. I insisted on dropping all the lamotrogine also carbamazipine and bringing ethosuximide to a minimum dose. My doctor agreed this was the best way forward as we needed to alliminate side effects through trial. When i eventually got to 1500mg and 250mg Ethosuximide it was decided the Keppra was above my tolerence. I have since moved down to 1250mg a day. My control is still not as stable as when i was on the Carbamazipine and Ethosuximide but if you dont try these things you will never know. My side effects from the Keppra are lack of motivation. Tired. Pins and needles especially in the evening when my meds are due. It is a finicky drug. It requires scheduled times not just morning and night. You cannot have so much as a sip of Alcohol as you feel effects immediatly. At least with the others i could have a glass of wine on a special occasion. Not that that bothers me, it is not advisable to have a single glass with these meds. I dont bother for my own sake. Since the allimination of the other d

Nice prophylaxis Definitely has reduced frequency, intensity, and duration of migraine episodes.Side effects are only apparent with dosage changes, or forgetting a dose; otherwise no adverse effects.  Balance is key to success with this medication.  Split doses 12 hours apart, titrate to success, and maintain consistent use.WAY too expensive!

severe anxiety, agressive, hopelessness, depressio I have tumors in my right temporal lobe, which causes gran mal seizures and auras.I began on Tegretol two years ago, this made me a zombie, but I had not seizures.I switched to Keppra 500 mg twice a day, the first months it was great I actually had energy and was no longer a walking zombie, this no doubt from being off the Tegretol. Than I began to become anxious, aggressive,and a feeling like my world was falling in. I became overwhelmed with the smallest problem and felt like I could not deal with every day life. This was not me, I am a &quot;fixer&quot;, I do not run from a fight or problem I plan and execute that plan and &quot;fix&quot; life's troubles. I became ineffective in every aspect of my life, and it was a big deal to even sit down and pay my bills! After 6 months on Keppra I starting having the &quot;auras&quot; again, so my dose was changed from 1000mg a day to 1250mg a day, I had two gran mal's even on that dose, not to mention a complete emotional breakdown, total despair feeling.I am in the process of getting off Keppra, and just started on Trileptal, have taken first dose last night,this morning I feel nauseaus and very drugged, just like I felt on tegretol. So I do not know where to go from here, there is such a thing as quality of life, that is the most important thing to me, it will do no good to be seizure free if I am psycotic or a zombie. I was only having 4 or so gran mal's per year before I began meds, perhaps I can deal with ghose and not deal with the side effects. All of my seixures over 30 years have been while I was asleep. Any feed back will be appreciated.

A Good Start and a Frightful Fizzle I was given Keppra by a psychiatrist who was seeing me for free as I had no insurance at the time.He told me I had a &quot;cyclic mood disorder&quot; which I came to find out was what he told everyone they had..  I officially have GAD..Anyways,  the first thing I noticed about Keppra was that it made me sleep like crazy!  I could fall asleep anywhere at any time of day.  It wasn't dangerous as I didn't drive but it kept me from doing anything for a while.  Though it was also a blessing of course as I got plenty of rest.  Kind of scared me though because I usually wake up if I need to for some reason but this stuff knocked me out so hard that my roommates could do crazy stuff without waking me up (and I have pictures to prove it.)After about a week I noticed that I was starting to do things that I was always too depressed or anxious to do.. Little things like clean my room or fix something that had been broken for months..So things were looking good.But pretty soon it got to where I was popping a few over the course of the day.  The psychiatrist had recommended that to me as I had commented that I started feeling worse later in the day.And after perhaps a month or two it stopped helping me get to sleep.Somewhere around this time it came to my attention that there were serious holes in my short term memory.  I had done things that I had no recollection of, even if clues were right in front of me.  Nothing bad thankfully but it scared me so bad that I stopped taking it right away.

HORRID I have been an epileptic since the age of 13. Varying degrees of seizures - Initially diagnosed as &quot;Petit Mal&quot;. Have been on Epilim, Topamax, Trileptal, Rivotril and now on Keppra. I have been &quot;seizure free&quot; since April 2005. The side-effects of both the Topomax (stupomax as I call it) and Trileptal were (I was on both of them at the same time) unbearable! I underwent EEG Monitoring for 3 days and have now been diagnosed as having &quot;Primary Generalised Epilepsy&quot; which is inoperable. So far I find the side-effects of the Keppra to be insomnia,aggression, emotional (overly so),depressive thoughts etc. I have only been on my full dose for 1 month - I hope it gets better.It is now October 2006 and the Keppra turned me into an emotional, weepy, bitchy, suicidal wreck!!!!! I tapered down to 250mg Keppra and 100mg Topamax - Normality reigns!!! This past Monday I suffered a Grand Mal seizure at work. I had missed a dose of the Keppra on Sunday and Monday. I now understand from my neurologist that because I am on such a low threshhold (meds) in order to maintain an even keel in my lifestyle I cannot afford to miss a single dose. Fair deal. Since coming off the high dose of Keppra though I feel much better. If you have any tendencies towards depression - stay clear of Keppra. Believe me I did not see myself as a &quot;depressed&quot; person and yes there are other factors to consider such as hormones etc, which I am looking into but be very careful. I have a very supporting husband and great daughter - but there were many days when I would quite happily have taken that rollercoaster ride to nowhere.

Much Improved Keppra cut back the amount of partial seizures that I had. My only complaint was being tired.  For the seizures that I continued to have, it changed the length of them, so that they would last only 5 to 10 seconds.  By the time they ended, I was just realizing that I was having one. I'm already on Tegretol and Neurontin, so I didn't know how many more options I would have before considering VNS.  I would suggest Keppra to others.

Holding breath, but it's still working! It's been a year and my son is still seeing success with the Keppra.  He is still taking Lamictal as well, but not sure how long it will be before the doctor decides to take him off that.  Just a note:  Keppra can cause major mood issues.  The doctor recommended extra B6-magnesium to help with this side effect, and it really does help.  The days my son doesn't have the supplements are the days he is most aggressive.

keep on keeping on Keppra did wonders for my 8 yr old son. He has myoclonic seizures since 1 yrs old and Keppra has helped the best.He was also taking Lamictal along with the Keppra, but we think the Lamictal was giving him some bad side effects. We weened him off the Lamictal and he's doing alot better in school. If you can get past the side effects(if any)than it's definitely worth taking.

Kepp-blessed if supervised Switched from lamictal/dilantin to lamictal/keppra 3 years ago. Had been having petit mals several times a week with GM's every few months in the 18 months prior to going on Keppra. Have been GM-free w/Keppra and minor episodes and fuzzy-mindedness are very well controlled. Have now been seizure-free on Keppra/Lamictal combination for 3 years, mostly on 1500 mg/day &amp; 450 mg/day respectively.My most pronounced side-effect has been a complete loss of a day-to-day biological clock. Some days I sleep 3 hours. Most days I sleep six. Periodically, the sleeplessness catches up and I go for up to 11+ hours. This happens about one out of every nine days. The erratic sleep schedule can interfere with work performance, but seizures are much worse for job-performance.I had been on 3,000 mg per day for 18 months. Keppra did not 'inspire' negative moods or feelings of aggression. However it definitely amplified negative moods originating from other circumstances of life. Doctor switched me to 1500mg/day after feelings of aggression towards a particularly problematic individual started getting serious enough for me to spontaneously seek psychiatric observation. On the lowered dose, I have felt comfortabley in control around this person who I work closely with.Keppra has no effect on my ability to enjoy life with friends nor does it detract from normally pleasant life experiences. It's psychological effect for me is very dependent on the context of my life within several days of present time. Generally, I am very glad to have it. I just wish it were cheaper.

4 Yr. on Keppra since 1 yr old. At first keppra worked on my son, though we have had to continuously raised his dosage. Now a couple yrs later seizures are breaking through. We have tried to add Trleptal, Had to dis continue almost immediately. Now dr's are talking possible surgey? My son does seem to have sensitive eyes, alot of aggression ( vit B-6 added ). Will continue to watch for other downsides to med. Have had no problem using this med.

best medication used yet The hardest thing about Keppra was getting onto it. I was previously on Tegretol and was having increasingly frequent complex partial siezures. But I found I became very depressed in the first six weeks I was getting used to Keppra. It was only because I was warned that changing onto the drug would have its difficulties that I persisted and have found it satisfactory since.

So far, so good -zero side effects &amp; good control I was put on Keppra as a cautionary move after developing kidney stones while taking Zonegran.  I do not take it in conjunction with any other medications.As far as preventing or lessening the onset of seizures, Keppra has been nearly as effective for me as Zonegran.  After six months on Keppra, I experienced two complex partial seizures the same morning - something that had never happened to me.  I was more surprised than anything, having been being essentially seizure free on Zonegran and Keppra respectively up to that point.So I'm noting things going forward.  At my next follow up visit, I expect the recommendation will be a hike in dosage.  Aside from that, I've not experienced noticeable side effects and have been pleased in general.This is my fourth medication in 10 years, so I'm interested in the comparable effectiveness, incidence of side effects, etc.  This site has taught me a great deal about the diversity of experiences people have with the same medication, so I strive to carefully observe things I experience.From the number of reviews, it looks as though this has been either effective, or at least tried a lot lately.

Keeping the hounds away My five year old daughter has intractable seizures.  She is status post a frontal lobectomy to remove two tumors due to her Tuberous Sclerosis.  Keppra is her 12th AED.  She currently also takes Vigabatrin and Depakote.  She has complex partial and generalized seizures with a history of infantile spasms.  Since starting the Keppra we saw a huge reduction in generalized seizures.  Recently the generalized seizures have returned however are greatly reduced in length and level of intervention necessary to stop them.  Since starting the Keppra we have only had to give her Diastat twice and that is within the last 2 months so I fear other issues are occuring.  All in all we have had no side effects with the Keppra, she tolerates it very well, takes it very well and we have been pleased with it's results given the battles we face with seizures.

Easy switch from Tegretol I am switching to Keppra from Tegretol and have found the change to be much easier than expected.  I do feel tired and weak sometimes, but of course I felt that way on Tegretol as well.  So far, so good...

Good, but there are side effects!  Try B6 I've only had 3 seizures (except one febrile seizure as an infant), the first one less than a year ago.  We're still trying to determine if there's a cause - or even if it might be convulsive syncope.  Since I've gone months between seizures, this isn't easy.  But, just in case, I've been taking Keppra.  And the side effects have been much worse than I anticipated.  I've always had an excellent memory, but now I can't remember things, events I was at, words I need, spellings, etc.  The mood swings, irritation and rage over small things, and depression have been bad.  Tingling and twitching in mouth, lips, fingers, and toes were bad, but as my dosage increased, I began getting sores on my tongue and mouth, especially in the corners of my lips.  Dizziness, uncoordination, a feeling like motion sickness or that feeling you get when you read in the car - this is frequent. Sometimes I have no energy - can't make myself get off the couch. I've also suddenly developed an allergy to certain metals - I can't wear my watches anymore, and ibuprofin now gives me a severe rash.  It especially makes it hard to put up with, because we don't know yet if the keppra is even doing anything to help me.  To help with the depression and mood swings, I started taking Noni.  It helped a lot.  I no longer had crying fits from frustration and depression every afternoon, and I was able to control the anger at little things.  But it didn't help the other side effects.  Then I got a tip to try 100 mg of B6.  Funny thing, a lot of the side effects I was getting were the same as the symptoms of a B6 deficiency.  It took several days, but I have seen an improvement since I started the B6.  The sores in my mouth are almost gone, and most of the other symptoms are improved - but not gone.  My memory still betrays me, though, and I haven't tested the metal allergy or ibuprofin.  My doctor had never heard of using B6.  He said it wouldn't hurt, but doubted it

Turning point in my life I was already taking Epilim (2000mg a day) and clobazam (20mg a day) but seizures were as bad as ever. Since Keppra was added to my meds at 2000mg a day I have been seizure free since day one, the first thing I noticed was how clear my mind felt and if anything my memory has improved. There has been none of the side effects that I have read about with other peoples experiences with Keppra. I still suffer from occasional depression but I do suffer from clinical depression and even that has improved due in part to the fact that I'm seizure free. The only thing i can't comment on is cost because i get my meds free on the NHS. I don't mean to sound Evangelical about it but the title of the review says it all.

Works well with side effects Had my first seizures in April at age 37, 2 grand mals back to back then was started on Keppra 500mg 2x daily.  Didn't have anymore grand mals but had petit mals about every other day for over a month then dose was upped to 750mg 2x daily and have been on that dose for about 1 month.  I have had 2 or 3 brief petit mals since then which is a major improvement but have felt worn out and tired for the past few weeks and don't seem to sleep very well even though I'm getting 8 hours or more daily.

Lost My Appetite, Lost My Energy, Wanted To Die Keppra never controlled my seizures, but I didn't focus much on that. More and more, I felt -everything- was hopeless. I lost my appetite and didn't even care about getting out of bed. I was too zombified to drive, and didn't want to talk to friends or family, who grew increasingly and rightly concerned about me.One night I found myself suddenly not wanting to take a sleeping pill because it would deplete my supply and I thought I shouldn't do that &quot;just in case&quot;. The thought seemed to come out of nowhere and terrified me so much I burst into tears. I realized I could never do &quot;that&quot;, hated myself for being &quot;a coward&quot;, and cried more. Once the depression started, I cried nearly every day I was on Keppra. Since the night I didn't take that sleeping pill, I thought about death every day. The suicidal thoughts and depression went away once I stopped the Keppra. I had hoped if I &quot;stuck it out&quot; for a few weeks, maybe 5 weeks, all the horrible side effects would go away... If I could just be strong enough, maybe it would be worth it... I also had consistent ear pain after a couple weeks on Keppra. Soon after stopping the medicine, I found myself with a high fever, a bleeding ear, throwing up. An ear infection, another &quot;gift&quot; from Keppra, I believe its third most common side effect.

AMAZING GRANTED, I HAVE ONLY BEEN ON KEPPRA FOR 2MONTHS, BUT FROM BEING ON DEPAKOTE FOR 12YRS, IM SO GLAD FOR THE CHANGE. PLEASE DONT GET ME WRONG DEPAKOTE WAS A BLESSING, CONSIDERING ME AND MY MOTHER NEVER EVEN KNEW WHAT A SEIZURE WAS UNTIL I HAD MY FIRST ONE. IT CONTROLLED MY SERZURES COMPLETLY UNTIL I AS A REBELIOUS CHILD TOOK THE INITIATIVE TO TAKE MYSELF OFF THE MED, WHICH LED TO HAVING ANOTHER SEIZURE. NOW, WHAT BROUGHT ALONG THE CHANGE IN MEDS WAS THE AGE FACTOR, CONSIDERING THAT I AM GETTING TO THE CHILD BEARING YRS, AND MY DOCTOR FELT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO CHANGE MEDS DUE TO THE BIRTH DEFECTS CAUSED BY DEPAKOTE. MAY 5TH 2006 I HAD MULTIPLE SEIZURES OVER A COURSE OF AT LEAST 12HRS THAT THEY KNOW OF DUE TO STOPPING THE DEPAKOTE AGAIN. AT THAT TIME MY DOCTOR DECIDED TO MAKE THIS CHANGE IN MEDS. ATLEAST FIVE YRS EARLIER I HAD STARTED FEELING &quot;NOT MYSELF&quot; BUT SINCE I NEVER REALLY KNEW THE BASE OF WHAT MYSELF WAS I DIDNT KNOW ANY DIFFERENT TO TELL THE DOC ABOUT IT. BUT WHEN I CHANGED TO KEPPRA, IT JUST HAS MADE ME FEEL QUICKER, HAPPIER, MORE AWARE, ALERT, ALMOST (AND DONT LAUGH WHEN I SAY THIS) EVEN SMARTER, AS THOUGH IT HAS CLEARED MY MIND. IM SO GLAD OF THIS CHANGE IN MEDS. IVE ALSO STARTED TAKING DILATIN ALONG WITH IT, BUT DR SAYS JUST FOR TEMP TIME. SO I REALLY DONT KNOW IF ITS THE KEPPRA OR THE DILANTIN. HOPFULLY THE KEPPRA, SINCE THE DILANTIN IS ONLY TEMP.

New dose is great i've been on K alone for over a year and i can honestly give you all advice on it. If you just started, you will feel fruity for 2 to 4 weeks. The lowest dose i was on was 1000mg daily. After the first few weeks, I had no sz and No side effects. Life went on and I had a few breakthroughs and they were worse than any sz i'd had but i only had maybe 2. My dose was upped to 2000 mgs daily. At this level i began to have the awful side effects, depression which led to night terrors and insomnia. A little bit of trazodone helped. At this level of medication, i  began using vitmin supps and had more sz than I had since before I started K. In nov. 2005 i had my dosage upped to a max of 3000 mgs daily and I feel great. I see my neuro later this month June, and i'll see what she says. I've only had a few while on the new dose but I feel better than ever.

Life went on and I had a few breakthroughs and they were worse than any sz i'd had but i only had maybe 2. My dose was upped to 2000 mgs daily. At this level i began to have the awful side effects, depression which led to night terrors and insomnia. A little bit of trazodone helped. At this level of medication, i  began using vitmin supps and had more sz than I had since before I started K. In nov. 2005 i had my dosage upped to a max of 3000 mgs daily and I feel great. I see my neuro later this month June, and i'll see what she says. I've only had a few while on the new dose but I feel better than ever.

Great !!!!!! I was wounded in Iraq, traumatic brain injury do to metal from a car bomb.I had one seizure while in transit to germany one day after the injury and went 6 months THEN had a grand mal. The restarted me oh Dilantin, and it is good.But then I had one aqain and they put me on KEPPRA. I have no side effects other then my speach impairments and I stay up late.But when I ran out and didnt have time to go get some more, on the second day I had another grand mal and was concious.I can tell when im not on it, I get more pettys. I have only had one small side effect twice, and it was swollen gums.I did allot of due diligence into Keppra and Dilantin and they cause you vitamin levels to be off and taking TOO much of ONE vitamin is not a good idea.I found that the POWER BARS (trademark) ARE IDEAL!!!!!!  They give you EXACTLY the right vitamins and the right amount. Since I have taken one a day I can tell. The side effects are DRAMATICALLY LESS and I feel better.I am luckey because I have a &quot;dented can&quot; store that sells them by the bags, assorted for 4 bucks and they sold my wife TWO huge cases for 10 bucks, there were like, 400 bars in it.So, if you can get them for cheap, good on ya, but if you cant, I would buy individual vitamins (on the back of the power bars) and mimic those.This is a GREAT website for nutritional needs on keppra and dilantin,http://www.providence.org/healthlibrary/contentViewer.aspx?hwid=hn-1082009&amp;serviceArea=generic

like taking a sugar pill Keppra, although I've heard of it working for others...did absolutely nothing for me.  It was supposed to help control my mania, but while on it, I had one of the worst spells since starting treatment.  A few side effects, though nothing bad...but since it totally didn't work for me, I wasn't on it for long.  Not a fan.

Good experience so far I had a single seizure event in January.  EFFECTIVENESS:It is difficult for me to rate the &quot;Effectiveness&quot; of Keppra because I don't know what life would be like without it (i.e., I don't know if I could have another seizure).  Therefore, I have rated the &quot;Effectiveness&quot; of Keppra as a &quot;5&quot; which is a neutral rating.SIDE EFFECTS:I rated this a &quot;9&quot; because, until recently, I haven't suffered from any of the documented side effects.  Perhaps my dosage is low enough to not see side effects at all or right away or perhaps I need to be on the drug longer or perhaps I'm lucky to have found an anti-seizure drug which works for me.  I was originally on Dilantin, which I ended up being allergic to, then I was moved to Trileptal which I ended up being allergic to.  Fingers are crossed that no more drug moves are needed because as we all know, drug transitions are the worst with anti-seizure medication!The one side effect I experienced was increased irritability every day.  My neurologist advised me to take B6.  Within 48 hours of starting 25mg of B6 daily, I no longer experience irritability.  EASE OF USE:Couldn't be any easier!  Take one 500mg pill every 12 hours!EFFECTIVENESS AFTER LONG TERM USE:Same response as &quot;Effectiveness&quot; above.COST EFFECTIVENESS:I have health insurance which covers Keppra as a level 2 prescription so I only have to pay $20 for a three-month prescription thru the mail.  If I picked up my prescription locally at a pharmacy, I would be paying $20/month.

Horrific This drug possibly was geared for men, I don't know. (I have found that is sooo not true with ALL of the E-mails I get!!) But it was the most depressive, psychotic drug ever. I was on Phenobarbital, yes it can be weepy, but this was different. I got curious, you look it up, it states everywhere in side effects suicidal ideations so on and so forth. Several actually committed suicide prior it being FDA approved. Not one for me, nor anyone post partum nor if they were on a high dose of Phenobarbital. I was so depressed and didn't want to stick around. Man was I ever cranky in addition to being so depressed. And even wound up in a psych ward from it, for my neurologist back in Alabama didn't even understand the swift mood change I got from it. I was in there for 5 nights. They didn't realize, you come off of the drug, it is a whole new light! The interesting timing of when I was placed on this drug was I just had my baby in 2001 and was coming off a huge dosing of Phenobarbital I had been placed on. He had tried to bring me down to 360 from 660. I was seizing bad. He kept upping my dose to the &quot;max&quot; dose of Keppra 3000. Then also placed me on Klonopin .5x3. (found to be a depressant for me)Thank God, it didn't control my seizures, nothing did. So, I was pulled off of it. Nonetheless, being post-partum and throw all that in, I had it a bit more hard than the &quot;normal&quot; seizure patient on that drug trial. Just make sure you study what your doctor does before you take it on. If you have a lot going on in your life, this drug probably isn't the wisest decision. You just shouldn't have to be on antidepressants for a drug to control your seizure when there are drugs out there that don't tear your mood down. I always thank God He guided me to my current doctor, or I wonder if I would still be breathing air.I get sooooo many E-mails from all different people that either are on it, have been on it, or have a loved one on it. I truly recommend talking to people who ha

UPDATED I have suffered with anxiety most of my life - some times more severe than others. This was a tough year and I decided I needed a little more help so I went to a psychiatrist. He was hesitant to use benzos on a daily basis ( I have used Xanax and Klonopin in the past)so he prescribed Keppra.  When I checked it out on the internet and saw it was an anti seizure med I was a little apprehensive...BUT it seems to be working..it really does calm down my mind...and it doesn't make me overtiredside effects - the first couple of days I was pretty spacy and very dizzy BUT it passed within a week. Now, about a month into it, I am having some issues with muscle pain/weakness...I feel like I have done a heavy workout...my doc says it could be a side effect but I should wait and see if it passes alsoUPDATE 3/2006The muscle weakness and dizziness did pass after about a month...however...mental clarity/ability to think and handle everyday tasks was impared with continued use. It got hard to do 2 things at once !!With continued daily use, I also started to have some mood swings and out of the blue anger/irritability....I discontinued use after about 6 months

It's too bad it wore off... I loved Keppra. It completely got rid of all of my seizures--partials and generalized... at first. However, in the past year and half or so, my partial seizures increased and were occurring multiple times a month and drs were concerned b/c partials were coming one after another within a day...(however it was almost completely effective for tonic clonic--only one breakthrough about 3 yrs ago. I will miss Keppra dearly. It interacted with no drugs, never made me sleepy, although there was some debate over it increasing my anxiety (I've always been anxious, so not really certain about that). Overall, very effective for me. I took 1500 twice a day. Another weird thing, if you can consider this a side effect, it seemed to make my partial seizure visual hallucinations much more vivid and my  auditory hallucinations a lot more threatening than pre-Keppra seizures--this was definitely not pleasant--before I could sort of fake my way through the seizure--on Keppra I was seriously freaked out and would tell people to shut up and leave me alone.I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was 17--so officially dealing with it for 12 years or so. Just got back from a hospital stay to once and for all put a label on my epilepsy (which was never really done)--I have right temporal lobe epilepsy (we'll see what the MRI says--12 yrs ago--they said there was nothing there--aside from my brain, that is). After I was first diagnosed, I went on Tegretol (very effective), but HATED it, then went to Trileptal, a little better than Tegretol, but Keppra was the best in terms of side effects. Now, I'm back on Tegretol, b/c the drs insist it's the best for TLE, despite my protests that I feel like a drunk zombie when I'm on it. Hopefully, this time around, the side effects will not bother me so much. We shall see. It's been a week and I feel tired, but not sure if it's from the hospital inducing multiple seizures (including an 8 minute tonic clonic (super long for me

Keppra = fatigue An ER neurologist moved me from Lamictal to Dilantin and Keppra.  (I experienced a (very) petite mal and the doc's preference was Dilantin over Lamictal). Regular neurologist moved me off Dilantin because of fatique and saw no need for both.  With 1x750mg Keppra per day I have experienced no events, but fatigue still persists. I'm told my awareness has suffered quite a lot too.  I am attempting to return to Lamictal which was as easy to use.  The event that got me into the ER was shortly after brain surgery.

It's OK, but watch your mood/emotions while on it I take this drug in addition to Lamictal for treatment of focal seizures. I was on Lamictal alone for awhile, which eliminated my complex partial seizures and slightly reduced the frequency of my simple partial seizures. My doctor added Keppra, and I immediately noticed a big improvement in control of my seizures, but after several months, the simple partial seizures increased in frequency again. I was put on a higher dose and things leveled off for awhile...but then picked up again. I'm now on an even higher dose and the simple partial seizures are sporadic. If you take this drug, you should watch your emotions and overall mood carefully. I'm more irritable than I was before (and I'm normally a bit irritable as it is). I've also been depressed off and on for the past several months and most recently, extremely depressed sometimes. I've even had some passing thoughts of suicide which are becoming rather frequent. I can't say with 100% certainty that this drug is the culprit...it could be something altogether different, because I'm having some other difficulties in my life at the moment. I find that having epilepsy itself is a bit depressing. But in hindsight, these big changes in my overall mood seem to have started a few months after first taking it, and I started to &quot;connect the dots&quot; after researching this drug some more. Maybe it's just a coincidence. But please, if you take this drug (or any other AED for that matter), watch yourself. And have close friends or relatives watch you too, because a drug might negatively affect your emotions and you may not even realize it yourself. I'll be talking to my doctor soon to see if I can go on a lower dose or stop it to see if my mood changes.Here's an update since I posted this review: I cut back a little on the dosage of Keppra at my doctor's suggestion (I was at 2500mg a day, now down to the regular 2000mg/day).

My neurologist then switched my meds to Lamictal, but I suffered from too many side effects; Zepakote, but I had too many side effects; so she has now switched me to Keppra. I have been taking this medication for 4 days, and so far so good. I have few side effects, emotionaly, mentally and physically, and have not had a seizure.

Keppra- EXPENSIVE! As a single young woman with no health insurance, I find it very difficult to keep up with my medical bills and prescription costs. The Keppra seems to be working fairly well to control my seizure (I've only had 1 break-through seizure in 3 months), but I'm spending close to $400.00 per month for my 500mg 2 tabs BID dosage. I wish there was a better way.... also, I had to be put on a low-dose of Xanax to treat the severe anxiety that I experieced after I started the Keppra, but that seems to be working out just fine now.

emotional rollercoaster Probably helped the seizures some, but I wasn't paying as much attention to that as to the occasional suicidal depression. That or the general moodiness. Good thing I was sleeping 12 hours a night  and more in the day, and didn't notice as much as I might. This in spite of my neuro prescribing more Provigil than my insurance allowed.

tough to use My medication level had been 1000 mg/day Dilantin, 1200 mg/day Lamictal, 600 mg/day Zonegran and still was experiencing seizures. So it was decided to begin using Keppra with a gradual increase from 1000 mg/day to 3500 mg/day and hopefully eliminate one or two of the others. I just could not handle the Keppra. I found myself so tired I could hardly stay awake during the day. NOW for gosh sakes I still take the same dosages of Lamictal, Zonegran and Dilantin plus 2000 mg/day of Keppra. Total cost oe medication per month about $1,500.00

Keppra what to expect Was started on Keppra 500mg X 2 and had to cut the dose in half due to high anxiety and severe confusion.Had been on Dilantin plus Mysolin for over 20 yrs and was weend off both medications.Had a major seizure that landed me in the hospital and was started on Keppra.Had tried Keppra before with no real benefit, still had the absence seizures every 30 days.What I have noticed is severe mood swings things that would not make me irritable now will send me through the roof. I have also noticed severe problems with concentration and keeping my train of thought. I talked to the Neuro and he cut the medication in half one 500mg divided into 2 (250mg X 2) presume that he will up the doze. But to be honest, preferred the old method Dilantin and Mysoline. And will try to get that back. I knew my limitations and there were no mood swings that I or my family could see.

Mood Swings!! Keppra has been a lifesaver for me; I not only have Epilepsy, Migraines, but Neuropathy (painful). The Keppra has helped with the pain from the neuropathy. But the mood swings are awful. I see my doctor again in 2 days and will discuss this with her, as a single mother of 2 teen daughters its very hard not to yell and get upset over the little things, but I've never been this way so for them its very hard. Alot of the side effects are so close to the neuropathy I can't tell if its the medication. At first I thought it was the vicodin that was making me so angry, but after stopping the pain medication I now know its the Keppra. I keep a day planner and use that often... it helps me remember things that I no longer can. Any help w/depression medication would be great. UPDATE!! I talked with my Epileptologist (A neurologist with specialty training in epilepsy) she had no problem taking me off Keppra however, I will have to continue it for 5 more weeks. Heather started me on Lamictal yesterday; the only downside to starting this drug is you start at a low dose and gradually work up to the therapeutic dose. That will take 3 months. Shes hopeful that the Phenobarbital will carry me through without any seizures. The side effects of the Keppra were unbelievable. I was putting cotton in my ears to lower the noise in my head, the anger had gotten worse, I havent had any peace and quite in my head for over a month and now Ive started to have nightmares. Keppra however, did reduce the burning in my hands and feet from the Neuropathy I have.

Keppra I have a tendancy to have a wider range of mood swings than I had before using Keppra.  The lows seem to be lower than normal.  Also have had trouble focusing at times, especially if I am the least bit fatigued.

Keppra Experience Keppra has been one of the best medications I have ever used.  This, in combination with the VNS has cut my seizures from more than 200 seizures per year to less than ten in a year.  In fact, for the first time in 20 years, I am making it 6 months seizure free!

Keppra?  YESSS!!! After being on Depakote for yrs and dealing its side effects I think Keppra is wonderful.  I used to have migrane headaches before my period each month, since I have been on keppra, I rarely even get a headache of any sort.  Don't know of any problems other than possibly sinus irritation?  As for moodiness and rage, I manage it very well by continually lashing out (in whatever&amp;$*#$y way)  when the opportunity arises on people who treated me like dirt when I was taking depakote, still having seizures and my overall apperance was terrible.  Anyway, normally I just channel any neg. energy into situations where it can be transformed to positive use. Being treated w/ Keppra  rather than Depakote helped me crawl out of the deep dark depression I was for years.

leviteracetam (levipill) i used levipill by sun pharmaceuticals for a short duration of about 4-5 months off 250mg twice a day.but after that i was advised by the neurologist to switch over to tegretol(carbamazepine)but i preferred to continue with levipill but reduced its frequency as once a day, and tegetol 100- 1 tablet twice a day. the combination is working good, levipill being a good supportive medicine.

Pretty Good I really liked Keppra.  Unfortunately, my doctor has said that I am still  having too many break through seizures.  I am currently in the process of being weaned off.  Here I come Zonegran/Lamictal combo!  While on Keppra, I noticed few side affects. The biggest being word finding difficulty, balance issues and possible hair loss.At my peak, 4,000mgs a day.  You are really supposed to take no more than 3,000mg a day, but they wanted to see if more would help.I had problems with sudden hair loss. They say that hair loss &quot;just sometimes happens&quot; and its not related to the medicine... yeah, sure it does.  Why does it just sometimes happen right after I started Keppra?I liked this medicine.  The side effects were pretty easy to deal with especially at the lower doses (if you pretend the hair is unrelated).  The biggest daily pain was swallowing the huge horse pills. I just wished it worked for me.

Not Impressed I have epilepsy but have very few siezures (e.g. 1 every 4 years or so), but my Doctor suggested Keppra nonetheless.  I started taking it 3 days ago, and WOW, what a difference some drugs make.  Not only am I completely exhausted, but I can't remember anything, am clumsy as hell, dizzy, unmotivated, agitated, and feel sort of sick all the time.  I've only been taking 1/2 of the recommended dose (1500 out of 3000mg) for 3 days, and I can't function at all.  School, work, and even laundry or dishes are all incredibly difficult to accomplish with any level of success.  The benefits of this drug definitely do not balance the side-effects, and I will be taking myself off of this ASAP.Update:  Off of the Keppra for 4 days now, and still recovering from the effects.  I'm still having trouble remembering things, and keeping a train of thought is very difficult.

Keppra effective but OW the cost My daughter is 17 and has been on Keppra and Trileptal since 2003.  I am a nurse in a doctors office that does not provide health or prescription insurance. OUCH!  The medications are working great and she has been seizure free for 2 years now but geez the cost of both meds are unbelievable.  It is all I can do to make ends meet and purchase the amount of each she requires each month. Unfortunately we do make too much to qualify for prescription assistance. So I suppose as long as these meds continue to be working I will continue to shell out the $500/month to pay for them.  Anyone out there know of any mail order pharmacies that may be cheaper and still of the same high quality?

Please give any advise on Keppra I have been on keppra for approx. 2 months for partial seizures. I have also been on dilantin 250/day for ten years. I have noticed by family and friends that I am more hostile toward simple things. My biggest problem is the migrane headaches I have and the sickness of my stomach. Could this be Keppra? I also seem more depressed than I should be.

USE WITH CAUTION!!!!!!!!!! My husbands seizure control has been attributed to Keppra.  However, the &quot;price&quot; (&amp; I don't mean money) of taking this drug nearly cost us everything.  Thank God, the medicine was reduced to 750 mg. x3/day &amp; there has been a definite change for the better.  BEWARE OF THIS DRUG!!!  Watch for signs of depression, withdrawal, anger issues, sleeping.  The medication was increased to max. for more complete seizure control about 1 yr. after initiating.  Hindsight being 20/20, I began putting 2 &amp; 2 together after I visited this website.  I learned a lot about the drug that we didn't know before.  I read testimonies regarding the seeming &quot;blackness&quot; that Keppra could put you in.  We had gone a whole year just thinking it was &quot;us&quot;....it wasn't.  He has driving privileges back after 10 yrs because of the Keppra....he was not willing to accept that the medication could be a factor.  Finally, he agreed to decrease although I believe it was just to prove to me that I was wrong.  After 3 wks. there began to be a change in attitude.  And now, 4 mo. later, I'm finally getting my beautiful husband back....smiles, hugs, talks....things are a world better.  Just use extreme caution with this drug....the person taking it &quot;can't see&quot;  the way they are &amp; are not likely to admit &quot;there's a problem&quot; so it requires the other to be very aware of changes &amp; willing to act quickly.

Finally, he agreed to decrease although I believe it was just to prove to me that I was wrong.  After 3 wks. there began to be a change in attitude.  And now, 4 mo. later, I'm finally getting my beautiful husband back....smiles, hugs, talks....things are a world better.  Just use extreme caution with this drug....the person taking it &quot;can't see&quot;  the way they are &amp; are not likely to admit &quot;there's a problem&quot; so it requires the other to be very aware of changes &amp; willing to act quickly.

Keppra I began feeling depressed and having suicidal thoughts about two weeks after stopping my tegretol (I was on both for a month). Now my dose is down, but the side effects are still present. I hope to change medications soon.

Hey, what's a seizure, again? Hope I'm not jinxing myself by saying that, but after getting a more or less stable level of Keppra in my system (took it for two weeks, went back to clonazepam for a week because the Keppra didn't seem to be doing anything - don't judge it until at least a month if you have no horrible side effects! - back on the Keppra for another week, then a week where for various reasons I only ended up taking about one pill a day, then it took 4 or 5 more days of taking my pills breakfast-and-dinner-like-clockwork for me to feel normal), I've had fewer partial seizures than you can count on the fingers of one hand, and it's been two and a half or so that I've taken the pills without missing any.  Which is quite a change from a few simple partials a day and unknown occurrences of complex partials (haven't had a *confirmed* one of those since I've been on it), so I'm pretty happy.Only thing that sucks is the feeling stoned out of my mind the week I first started it (not when I restarted after the clonazepam) and when I was forgetting a lot of pills, (curiously enough, having a single alcoholic drink one night seemed to snap me back into reality temporarily), and the bit of depression the first week I was on it (this didn't come back anytime after the first week, even when I wasn't being good with my meds!).  Also, even with my living in Canada and having a drug plan, it's still expensive (relatively), so while I'm thinking 3x a day dosing might be better since it seems to leave your system so quickly, I haven't mentioned it to my doctor yet because of the cost.Having only been on it four months total (including the on-off time), I'm not going to rate long term effectiveness, but at the moment, I'm about as happy as you can get on this med (with the apparent hardcore antimanic properties it has - I'm not bipolar, though)!

Who Is This Man That I Married 32 Years Ago?? My husband was the victim of an mugging almost two years ago.  He was put on Keppra several months later for headaches. (had no seizures)At first, his headaches did get better. Then over the next year, he started to have terrible mood swings, depression, dizziness and double vision.He became very clumsy and his speech slurred. Then he had what they called a seizure and had to be air lifted to a hospital and was in rehab for weeks. He had loss of motion on left side, vision loss, memory loss and severe pain.All tests done have shown no abnormality and he has been referred to a psychiatrist. I was told that Keppra would not do this, I am so happy I found this site.We do not have any answers yet and he still has these episodes everyday but I will do alot of checking now on this so called wonder drug that the doctors refuse to believe could be causing the problem.BTW, he still takes it.

Totally Worthless for me This med did absolutely nothing for me at all.  It was prescribed as an adjunct mood-stabilizer for Bipolar Disorder, but had absolutely no effect on me whatsoever.  No effects, no side effects, nothing.  It was like taking a giant sugar pill.   Exactly the same as Neurontin for me.

Asking about keppra? Wow, I've been seeing some of you, and I can understand how some meds can do that. But keppra didn't do that to me. I'm sorry if it did. But see, I see a theripist and I go on a med. call lexapro for depression. Maybe that can help. Try it. I know I had to see a 'shrink' after I had my seizures, and I still have them for 12yrs!!

The Jury is Still Out I've only been on keppra a few months.  This is the third AED I've tried to control my simple and complex partial seizures.  (Trileptal acutally increased my seizure frequency from 5-8 a month to 10-20 a day.)  The side effects are not as pronounced as trileptal.  At first, I felt a bit drunk about 1/2 hour to 1 hour after taking the pill, but this only lasted about a week.  I also had no appetite for about 2 weeks.  I have brief encounters with depression, but fewer than I had with trileptal.  I do feel physically lethargic, but more mentally alert than with trileptal.  I had one simple partial yesterday and four today, but four is better than 20.

nightmare.. seriously My keppra experience began after having two grand mal seizures this year.  My first reaction was that 4-5 hurs after I had taken it, I would become aggro or irritated at small things.  Since then the daily frustration has gone away but has turned into nightime disasters.Waking up in a rage and pushing my girlfriend was one of these episodes.  During the night I am hitting the wall and waking up very mean. Does this happen to anyone else?

Keppra I've been on Keppra for complex partial seizures for several years and have been very pleased with results.  I do feel my get-up-and-go has gotten-up-and-gone, I'm not nearly as active as I once was and little things set me off faster than normal.  My seizures are 99.9 percent controlled...If I have anything, it is a short spell as I'm falling to sleep the night before my period begins.  I like it better than the dilantin I was once on....3 hour naps tend to interfer with ones life, plus on dilantin I lost any interest in food, as soon as I was weaned off dilantin and onto keppra, I discovered something called eating.

3 year old on Keppra My daughter was diagnosed with myoclonic seizure at 15 months.  She was having about 15 - 20 &quot;jerks&quot; a day.  After the 3rd day on Keppra, the jerks stopped and it has been 1 year and 9 months!  We have no side affects at all!  Her development it on target.  We have insurance that pays the for it.  I am curious now about taking her off.  Her seizures showed as generalized and the Dr. has told me that sometimes they have a stronger tendency to start back - any information would help. - beckygay@alltel.net.

Please Help My 9yr old daughter hads been taking Keppra for about three years. She currently takes 2500 mg/day. I believe this is a bit much for a 57 lbs little girl, but I am reasured but the Neuro-oncologist this is a safe level. I have read from several site there should be no more then 60mg/kg/day, she is at 97mg/kg/day. She has extreme mood swing ( which I am told is due to her being a little girl). She will fall asleep at anytime. She has recently began felling tingling in her leggs. Could some one please let me know anything about these side effects. We are losing trust in our doctor!!!

Keppra - Why it affects memory Keppra stimulates &quot;the actions of a natural brain chemical, GABA&quot;. I googled GABA and found the following in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA):&quot;With regard to the human brain, it has been asserted that GABA signals interfere with the registration and consolidation stages of memory formation. This is thought to be possible because the GABA system is found in the hippocampus, an area of brain which has been implicated in memory formation.&quot; Just wanted to share this. I know it doesn't make much of a difference, but it is still interesting!I have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and started taking Keppra approx. a year ago, following a failed attempt to rely solely on Lamictal (changed to Lamictal from Depakote, because I wanted to have a child). Anyway, I can only say that I have managed to keep my seizures under control, granted that I follow the strict schedule of med. intake, since Keppra has such a short half-life (hence, no delaying dosages). As for the side-effects, I suffer from poor memory (I thought I was going senile, and I am only 30!), temper tantrums and mood swings, however the latter I try to keep to a minimum by taking deep breaths and taking a philosophical outlook on life. That doesn't always work though.In a way the side effects that have come with Keppra are better than those I had when taking Depakote. I would have a strange feeling, as if walking around in a glass bell (it is difficult to describe), and horrible stomach problems. My med of preference was Lamictal, with which I noticed no side-effects (possibly linked to its not working??).On a final note, I'd like to say that I was relieved to read about others in a similar situation as mine and that many of you have experienced similar side effects. I have told my neurologist about these and he tries to dismiss any critique of Keppra (he's writing a paper on it and is a big proponent of it).

IM NOT NUTS!!!!! IT WAS KEPPRA Keppra was awful. At first when I started taking it after a few weeks I had MAJOR mood swings and layed on my couch. ( IM OCD ) active, running in the yard with my kid and it made me not want to do nothing. I cried, I screamed, then I was I was calm, then It started all over again. Then I couldn't remember after a month. The memory loss got really bad. Keppra was also interfering with my other meds and making my levels tremendously low. Then because of my memory, I had to write down everything and I started forgetting tooooo many things. Then I went to the ER cause Neuro WOULD NOT call me back, all they said was go to the ER. The ER thought I was nuts but I left the hospital cause they were trying to transfer me to the psyche ward. What was going on was what I had what is called an Adverse side effect. An overdose is when you take something and it works but you took to much of it. An adverse side effect is when it don't work and reacts. Keppra reacted badly. Depressed, mood swings, memory loss and at first could not sleep. after a few weeks, you couldn't wake me up. I had a seizure in my sleep and nobody could wake me up. I know it did NOT control my seizures, In FACT it made them worse. Had over 30 grand mals in less than 4 days. HELLO DOCTORS.....everyone was telling them it was the drug Keppra but they wouldn't listen. Now I have been off of the Keppra for over a week and am getting back to normal. Well, I always say even though I have seizures I am still normal ( to an extent&gt;...) and I love me. Do your research on his medicine especially if you take other meds.  BEWARE OF KEPPRA.....and like someone said that I read on their comment,...If they try to give you Keppra then ask them if they even care bout you. FDA CRAZY.

I had a seizure in my sleep and nobody could wake me up. I know it did NOT control my seizures, In FACT it made them worse. Had over 30 grand mals in less than 4 days. HELLO DOCTORS.....everyone was telling them it was the drug Keppra but they wouldn't listen. Now I have been off of the Keppra for over a week and am getting back to normal. Well, I always say even though I have seizures I am still normal ( to an extent&gt;...) and I love me. Do your research on his medicine especially if you take other meds.  BEWARE OF KEPPRA.....and like someone said that I read on their comment,...If they try to give you Keppra then ask them if they even care bout you. FDA CRAZY.

Keppra is EVIL I'm a 45 year old with Grand Mal. One week ago I was watching a movie and woke up in the ICU of St.Agnes Hospital. Had a bunch of Grand Mals. I suffered a bad closed head injury 20 years ago on a motorcycle. I have only had 4 attacks of Grand Mal. This time I was put on Keppra. Its no good! I can't walk, can't talk, and cain't think. I'm an emotional wreck now. Panic attacks are my life. These go beyound panic to stark fear. This drug is evil, and I will stop taking it. Oh I forgot to mention that it has torn my stomach up, and I'm &quot;Buck Crazy&quot; from it. Its no good at all. Please don't try it. 80% of the time I now feel the need to kill someone, and the other 20% of the time I wish they'd kill me.

Keppra I have taken Keppra for 11 mos. My beginning dose was 500 mg. 2x's a day. I began getting so depressed that I didn't want to take a shower, go anywhere, and lay around. I cut the dose by myself and told the doctor. I experienced, (on that dose), depression, slurred speech, I was very unsteady on my feet. I had very little coordination in hands and feet. My hands were becoming numb, memory was and is bad. I was told I had general epilepsy, when I got epilepsy, I was 15 yrs. old. I was told I had  a part of my brain that had damage. I could write more but don't have the time.

Love this one! Aside from the sedation, my life has improved 100%. This med was added to my cocktail of Lamictal/Zonegran/Mirapex and seems to be doing the trick. Recently increased PM dose to 1000mg to help with sleep and notice that the sleepiness during the day has tapered off. I really like how this drug has helped stabilize my bipolar.

depression Keppra made me severely depressed. I couldn't stop crying for more than 10 minutes for a whole month. I lost about 15 pounds and tried to kill myself twice before my doctor took me off of it.  If you feel ANY of these symptoms MAKE your doctor take you off of it.

I'm glad to know I am not alone I have been on Keppra for about 5 weeks now. The side effects are horrendous! I am usually very calm and easy going. On Keppra I have had mood swings from one extreme to the other. I have been very irritable and aggressive and sometimes very hostile. From all the things I have read from other sources, I was beginning to feel like I was the only one having these kinds of reactions, or that there was something else was wrong with me. I have also been extremely tired and sometimes shaky.

At least somebody else thinks it works Of all the drugs that I have been put on, I would say that Keppra was the one that made me the most depressed and tearful.  I wasn't feeling like myself and, although it was helping with seizure control, I didn't give a damn because I was too depressed to care.  I was glad to get off of it and move on to something else.

effectiveness of Keppra Hello. All of my experiences with epilepsy must be seen in relevance to the fact that I also have a brain tumor.  Sometimes it is hard to know which factor causes the side effects. Although keppra, along with depakote er, has kept me seizure free for 18 months, my temper and ability to deal with daily life are not so good. Newest plan is to wean off Keppra and try trileptal with the depakote er.  I'd love some feed back on trileptal.

IT DOES MAGIC! For me. I am taking a combination of Keppra and Dilantin.Doctor prescribed 6x500mg pills per day. I actually take 3 per day, about 4 times a week. Since I've started taking Keppra I haven't had a single seizure. At least so far. I've been taking it for about 5 years. As for side effects, it's hard to tell. There aren't any physical side effects, unless my organs are being effected. In terms of aggression and agitation, it's hard to tell. How would anyone know? If a person was aggressive to start out with, they can't blame keppra. It seems that it actually calms me down. No one knows.

Keppra My experience with Keppra has been different than many others I read here. I am a 30 year old male and am extremely sensitive to medicine. I take 125mg ( break the 250mg) in half, on occasion and it works wonders for the pain in my head. I have a very unusual headache. The only problem is the medicine makes me more irritable so I cannot take very often. But I can say this stuff works wonders for the pain in my head. Its worth a try especially if you have unusual head pain.

Keppra I am so relieved l am not the only one who feels like this. I have been so irritable and literally have felt awful and has stopped me going out a few times. It is also not controlling my seizures, l have petit mal, l was on lamictal and eplim for years and they stopped working, l am now combining all three and just don't understand why it is not helping.

Keppra--the wonder drug??? Keppra--I take 3-500 mg (twice daily). So, this drug makes me VERY tired. and it's very expensive. I still have seizures on top of it. It also is known to cause depression, so an anti-depression medication has been added to my treatment plan. that brings me to 3000mg KEPPRA&lt; 1000mgTEGRETOLXR&lt;  400mgTOPAMAX&lt; AND 20mgPROZAC daily! And I wonder why I'm tired!! :-)

Keppra Thank god I found this site, thought it was just me going mental on keppra, feel like throwing stuff at people for no apparent reason and have been severly depressed.....my doc still seems to think it's the best option though! Am using it with Epilim Chrono (sodium valproate) though have been told its not a good idea to be on epilim if you're a woman of child bearing age. Does anyone have any info or experience of that? NOt controlling my absence seizures and feel a bit of a zombie, very tired but I'll try anything at this point!

new to this one, will be updating later First impression of Keppra was &quot;make it STOP!&quot; I went to a new neuro, having been happy on phenobarbital for 5 years now, complaining that the phenobarb was being hindered a bit by a new (unrelated) drug I started taking, as I was forewarned it might... well, he said, since I'm 25 now and phenobarb can oftentimes stop being &quot;as&quot; effective as you get older, he wanted to put me on a new drug to supplement... that being Keppra. First 2 weeks, it felt like someone was taking an ice pick to my forehead from the inside. For from around 30-60 minutes after taking it to about 3 hours after, I laid in bed with a pillow on my head crying because it just hurt SO bad... worse than my worst migraines had ever been. I had to keep telling myself &quot;side effects go away, they can go away....&quot; and after a week, they lessened, after 2 weeks, no more headaches... whew, relief...As for what it's doing for me, so far, I can't really say--my seizures haven't lessened from it that I can tell, but I'm also on that very low dosage still of 500 a day. Good thing I'm still on phenobarbital. I do, though, appreciate the honesty of those 5% or so of trial patients that reported suicidal ideation--it really felt like something that, were I depressed by nature, would tip me over the edge and make me just want to jump off a cliff. Frankly, even in my heavy process of rationalization, I wanted to at least toss that bottle over one. so the side effects can get better, I wouldn't give up so quick, but if a doc starts you off high, I'd see another doc to be totally frank, as 250 at a time is quite enough adjustment to start.

Simply great My neurologist gave me Keppra for my movement disorder initially (dystonia). It worked not only for this but for OCD, migraine-cluster, anxiety, back pain, and especially for the bouts of uncontrolable energy of mania/mixed state and hostility. I have not ANY side-effect! I wish to push the dose at 3g/d. Along with lamotrigine, moclobemide and pizotifen, it is the best cocktail I've ever had.

Hard Pill to Swallow but doing better Being on Wellbutrin and Lexapro wasn't helping my extreme irritability and irrational/emotional anger and depression and lack of sleep. Doc took me off Lexapro and put me on Keppra, 250mg up to 1000mg over a series of days. I was VERY dizzy for the first weeks, but since unemployed i was in no danger of hurting myself. We dropped down to 750mg and I now take it at night. It's really helped mellow me out. Although it is not the only drug I take, and it's hard to take 3 little pills every night along with the wellbutrin and the 300mg seroquel, i'm getting used to it. i'm remembering being 14, 13, and how i really should have been on something back then.

It was the worst ever! Keppra did no good to our son. In the first 2 days, he went almost catatonic (he's 2 1/2 years old), lost all his strength, was trembling like crazy and could not bring himself on all 4 anymore! The myoclonic jerks did not stop or decrease. As soon as we stopped, he regained all his tonus. We completely lost our time with this Keppra.

My husband's worst nightmare My husband was on Keppra for approximately 5 months &amp; they were the worse months of his &amp; my life. It worked well in the beginning &amp; as the dose increased became much worse. Several trips to the ER by spouse &amp; ambulance &amp; all they did was increase the Keppra which made things worse. He had a constant aura feeling like he was going to have a seizure as well as numerous seizures aproximately every 15-30 minutes &amp; a grand maul in his sleep. Finally they listened to me &amp; took him off the Keppra &amp; he started feeling better within a week of stopping the drug. I personally feel the drug was killing my husband slowly &amp; think the FDA should ban this drug immediately.

3 year old on Keppra Hayven [my 3 yr old] has been taking Keppra for 18 months!! It seems to have just lost some of its effectiveness as we are seeing more breakthrough seizures. On the up side, as soon as Hayven started taking the Keppra, her mood improved, her attention span increased, and she became a much more tolerable child to be around [before this med, she was very whiny, needed to be held ALL THE TIME! and did NOT ever want to be on the floor alone]. She is now starting to have more seizure activity, so we are trying other meds too, but over-all Keppra had no noticable side effects and was very effective for quite some time for her.

keppra lousy side effects for 1st few weeks, but settled down.  Now been on keppra/tegretol combination 8 months &amp; been completely seizure free - previously had complex partials approx 3-4 weeks apart.  Cost not a problem here in the UK - it's free!  Previously been on epilim, lamictal, gabapentin &amp; tegretol alone.  Never had this level of control before.

Keppra for kids My 14 year old daughter takes Keppra for mood change caused by depression and anxiety. I have noticed that after 3 weeks of taking this medication she has shifted from being sad and upset to angry and violent. She feels the world is against her, including me. My daughter has always respected me and now it's like someone took my daughter and replaced her with an angry monster. I believe that Keppra is the cause. I don't think that children her age should be taking this medicine.

Horrible side effects I have simple partial seizures that were not controlled at all on Keppra.  This is the worst medication at controlling my seizures that I have used, and I  have tried three others.  But the worst part was the side effects for me.  I became fatigued, weak, had frequent headaches, didn't care about anything and developed depression.  I kept on it thinking that I would develop a tolerance like the other meds but this never happened.  In fact all of these symptoms got worse and worse. I was on a spiral down. After 2 months I was ready to die. I also hit my husband in the head with a cereal box for no apparent reason! We were just talking casually and he turned and I felt compelled to do this.  I was not mad at him and have never hit him before in my life! There was loss of cognitive function as well.  I couldn't think anything through.

Keppra - No help as stand alone drug I used Keppra alone for three months and it was totally ineffective. It did almost nothing to control my seizures. The only other drug I have taken that was less effective was Depakote, which didn't control my seizures at all.What I did find out though, is that Keppra does have a benefit as a &quot;booster&quot; for Felbatol. By taking Keppra in combination with Felbatol, I was able to reduce the dosage of Felbatol I had to take and the side effects of Keppra offset those of Felbatol (except aplastic anemia, which you either do or don't get with Felbatol... if you go six months without your liver being damaged, odds are you won't ever have a problem with it at all).One other point. The normal dosage of Keppra is every 12 hours. When used as a &quot;booster&quot; for Felbatol, taking it every eight hours works better. When taking it every 12 hours, the booster effect fell off after about 10 hours. So I take the combination every eight hours, with a dosage of 1000 MG each time, for 3000 MG per day. At first it was 4500 MG per day, but I was able to reduce it to 3000 after going to the 3 times a day dosage instead of twice a day since there is almost no fall off in the first 8 hours.

Keppra and mania I was prescribed Keppra at the end of a hospital period of extreme mania.  the side effects: I was dizzy, couldn't walk properly, and I felt very bad.  Keppra was effective for bringing down the mania.  I stopped taking it then.  now I am on Lamictal monotherapy for depression.  the Keppra will be used if I have a manic episode. for me the side effects from Keppra would be intolerable for a long period.

Hope you have good insurance! Keppra alone costs us about 500 - 700 a month and that's with a tiny bit of insurance kicking in.  it's difficult to say whether or not it is making any difference as our 7 yr. old is now on 3 meds (lamictal, keppra and zonegran) and they've been adjusting all three of them.  She quite definitely is not herself and is extraordinarily moody.  We'll hopefully be getting off the medication mess soon ... her doctors don't really seem to do anything other than react by increasing a medication dosage.

Keppra I have been on Keppra for roughly 3 months after the onset of seizure disorder that had been under control for 12 years by taking Tegretol.  I knew Tegretol was no longer working when I started having strange auras then a grand mal seizure.  Keppra was horrible at first with side effects for me.  Ranging from mood swings to insomnia to intolerance of food items.  I have finally overcome all of the side effects except insomnia.  This is what I am currently struggling with.  My auras are gone and I have been seizure free since I have been on it.  Since my health insurance has recently changed - it is an expensive medication!

Keppra- Combination headaches After 1 week of use, Keppra only seems to be causing headaches upon waking. My doctor said it is not from the Keppra. I did my own 'study.' After 2 consecutive days of not taking it, and waking with no headache, I am assuming it is a side effect of Keppra. I will try it again to see if same results occur. I hope everyone taking it knows that in clinical trials it caused suicidal tendencies, with several attempted suicides and one which was successful.

Super &amp; Expensive! I've had epilepsy for over 30 years, and have tried at least a dozen different anti-seizure medications, going from brand to brand, combinations, amounts, frequency--all depending on advice offered by neurologists who've known me for little more than 30 minutes.  I've always been one to provide well-worded word processed versions of what's been happening to me neurologically since last seeing my doctor.  Ideal patient, I guess.  One who's even served as a &quot;lab rat&quot; in national try-outs of pills that manufacturers were hoping to get NFDA approval.  However, nothing better has come into my neurological tale than Keppra!  My seizures are about 75% better controlled, and milder than ever before, and I myself have gotten at least a couple-dozen friends with epilepsy to inquire about Keppra.  Problem is, Keppra's cost!  It's insane.  And being produced by an American corporation, we're going to have to wait another six or seven years before an affordable generic version can be created and is easily available.  Why must we Americans have to face such crafty corporate pricing?  Maybe if Keppra were more affordable, more people would purchase it...and seizures less common.  Love you, Keppra, but please rethink the price tags on those bottles!

Keppra I have had complex partial seizures since 1985. These went misdaignosed until my grand mal in 1997.  From anti depressants to anti covulsants wsa not a good experience. I tried Dilantin with bad results, a then &quot;Study Drug&quot; Zonegran with seizures still occuring, and then Tegretol was added to the Zonegran, I still was having as many as 10 Complex partials a day.  Then they added Keppra and the seizures stopped. The only time I would have a seizure would be if I missed a dose. Unfortunately, while on Keppra I became very depressed. I tried to jump out of moving cars, and I was hospitalized for fear of suicide twice.  Additionaly I became an ogre at home. Screaming at my wife about the littlest things. One time I even called a friend and told him my wife was trying to kill me. Eventually I called the doctor to question these outbursts and in her absence a nurse I had never met called me back.  I explained to her my cycle of rage and depression.  She ASKED ME if I was on Keppra. Apparently between Keppra and Zonegran, this stuff happens all the time.  Under medical supervision I have been off of Keppra since last March. Two months after my front temporal lobectomy.  I haven't had any seizures since. And I don't jump out of cars any more.

Does your doctor really care? Shame on the fda. After 25 years of letting my doctors talk me into trying something new, she almost did me in by talking me into Keppra. I couldn't walk. I couldn't talk. My behavior became totally different, not in a positive way. This is not a good medication. If your doctor asks you to try K E P P R A, you may want to ask your doctor if they really care about you at all.

My behavior became totally different, not in a positive way. This is not a good medication. If your doctor asks you to try K E P P R A, you may want to ask your doctor if they really care about you at all.

evil keppra I want to kill myself about 80% of the day... the other 20% I want to kill someone else. Even the Prozac I have to take w/ it, doesn't help.I am more miserable on the Keppra than off- the only &quot;plus&quot; is that I don't have as many  seizure episodes. I wish I would be prescribed something else.

Keppra Keppra does an excellent job of controlling my son's seizures, but after taking it for 3 months he started to have trouble walking and problems with his depth perception. At times he can't even walk across a threshold, he is afraid of falling.And getting up steps is almost impossible. Now after nearly 2 years we are to the point where we don't know what is worse the seizures or the side effect!!!!

teacher Keppra has been the only medicine to control my frontal lobe seizures in twelve years.  However, I've now been on this for seven months and am experiencing side effects that are being considered a result of the Keppra.  These include severe muscle twitching, spasms, pain, restlessness, and a definite change in mood including lack of concern.

Great drug with low side effects I started Kineret when plaquenil and sulfasalzine were no longer working for me.  I had avoided methotrexate because of the reported side effects.  Kineret really strengthened my wrists and took away daily knee, elbow, and ankle pain.  but I must add that I have only suffered from moderate RA since January 2002 and seem to eb pretty well off.  I eventually added methotrexate to help with ercurring ankle pain, but for me the side effects (nausea, depression, malaise) were so bad they were affecting my quality of life.  I have to say my joints were a ltitle better on Kineret+Methotrexate but I ahve remained pretty stable without the meth.  I also am on kineret because I am afaraid of reports of MS occuring in some patients that take the TNF inhibitors.  MS and RA would be really hard.

Didn''t work for me  I faithfully injected myself, once a day, for almost 6 months with, Kineret.In that time I didn't experience any improvement.I had heart failure and then pneumonia before the experiment was over. I was being a tourist in the Phillipines when I was hit with those two things.  I spent 6 weeks in a Manila hospital.  The doctor's, staff and nurses there were incredibly diligent and kind. Needless to say, Kineret was stopped. Arlene

Good/then Bad worked great I used it in combo with Methotrexate.but after a couple of months I started having severe pain that started at shoulders and ran down my arms always in the morning. would last about 20min moving around would make it slowly go away then it would start up again the next morning. I stopped the shots told my Dr. and he said it was a rare side effect involving the nerves took a few weeks for pain to completly go away. If you take tnf's always take notice if you feel pain or more often tingling or numbness could be a rare nerve side effect I have had these symptoms with other meds.

Kineret put my RA into 100% remission When combined with methotrexate (once a week). I am able to exercise with weights, ride a bike, and no longer use a cane or wheelchair. It is very expensive ($1400 a month), but I am in a long term drug study, and only have to pay $25 a month copay with my provincial drug plan.  It has given me back my life.  I just have some old damage in my feet hands and knees which don't hurt much but curtail my walking.  I am strong and healthy again.  I hope it lasts forever. I literally have no RA nodules left anywhere in my body, and NO RA pain left, and I used to be severe RA.I used to get local site injection reactions, but even that is gone now.  Just one poke a day for normal living.

Kineret Just awful: while I am a long-term, severe arthritis and know that TNFs do not work well with old disease, I found Kineret to be very ineffective and needlessly painful. The injection was painful--almost like a hammered shot into a muscular area. I did not have a daily injection but needed to select it for this rating to be accepted.

Kineret is the answer for me I have been in a Kineret study for 12 months. I was dx with RA moderate to severe. I had red welts and itching at the injection site (5 days after starting Kineret). I used extra strength Benadryl cream for two days, the welts and itching went away. I have only a slight redness now after the injection. Sometimes the injection hurts for a minute or two. I find if I let the Kineret warm up for an hour or so it doesn't hurt. Kineret has slowed my swelling (hands, fingers, wrist, knees, ankles, a lot.) It took about 4 months for it to start working. Plus it has helped me get off the Predisone and stay off!! I still go through some bad flares (they also, have lessened). I would take 3 injections a day of Kineret if I had to, that is how much of a difference it has made in my battle with RA. I still get tired easily but Kineret has allowed me to rest for an hour or two and then I regain some energy. Before using Kineret I was so tired, worn out, I could hardly do much of anything.  My hands, fingers and knees would swell so much I could not bend them. I still have some swelling but not to the point where I can't bend them. I have no side effects from the Kineret and it's been 12 months.

Finally seeing results after 6 months I've been using this for 6 months, finally seeing some results.  Easy to use, but disappointed it took so long for results.  Hopefully these results will continue for a long time.  Thankfully this drug is covered by my insurance because it is very expensive.

Not working so far - 7 weeks Doesn't seem to be working so far.  I started Antibiotic therapy about 3 weeks ago and that seems to be working a tiny bit.  I've heard antibiotic therapy works well but takes a long time for it to kick in (several months).  Kineret:  had injection site reactions about 2 weeks in but only lasted about a week.  Site became itchy and a red welt developed for about 2 days.  Wasn't too bad and now I don't have a reaction at all.  The injection burns a little but not as bad as Humira.  I'll give it a few more weeks.  If it doesn't feel markedly better I'm going to quit the Kineret but will give the antibiotics several months.

It was great while it lasted! Had 3 good years on Kineret, but unfortunately it just faded out...Effectiveness: 7I felt great right away.  The first night I was actually able to fall asleep in minutes!  In the next few weeks, my arthritis symptoms steadily improved.  I was back on my bike and jogging (!).  Lack of Side effects: 9Okay, so I did get the horrible, purple, angry welts on day 10 of therapy.  A couple of weeks later they were cleared up, and I had no additional side effects from the medication.  I am admittedly a healthy person, aside from the rheumatoid arthritis.  In the three and a half years I was on Kineret, I had no head colds, flus, etc at all.Ease of Use: 10After the initial requisite heebie-jeebies of self-injection, the daily dosing was a breeze.  I found the easiest time of day to inject was right before bed, so that I wasn't rushed and could just relax in some loose-fitting pjs afterwards.  Effective after long term use: 7After my second year on Kineret, I could feel it starting to fade (i.e., my knee would get stiff, fluid-filled).  A shot of cortisone in that joint got me over that hump, however, the same thing happened the same time next year.  This time the cortisone didn't help.  (Now on Humira)Cost effectiveness: 6I was in a drug study for many months, a real benefit.  When Kineret was approved, my health plan added it to their formulary right away.  After the health plan coverage, I was still owing almost $300.  Luckily, Amgen has an assistance program.  They covered most of the $300, leaving me to pay $60 a month.

Better with Kineret than without it. I have a lot else going on - significant OA and five damaged disks in my lower back; some cervical spine involvement too. I've been on Kineret 16 months. Initially, after several months, it really was working. Last spring, at right about the one year point, I had to stop it for a month (infection) and noticed some return of RA symptoms, even in that short time. When I went back on the Kineret, it got better again.Some days are better than others, of course. But, overall, I'm more than pleased with the Kineret.As retirement approaches though, I have concerns about the cost and whether my insurance will continue at the same level as now. I'll deal with it if I have to. Right now, I give a generally &quot;positive&quot; rating to Kineret.

Kineret injection I have been on kineret for 1 1/2 yrs-yes it is hard at times to do the injection but if you warm it to body temp. before injection it is not to bad. I also had injection site reactions-red and painful for about 1 mo-used rx-cyclocort cream which took it right away in about an hour - works great!!!!!! I am unwilling to go on the other drugs due to problems with infections on them-will use kineret as long as possible. I still experience occasional flares but not nearly as bad as they were. I think it is VERY important to keep your head up and get plenty of rest and exercise to keep it all together with this disease---it must not win!!

Wonder Drugs and Side Effects Kineret gave me my life back!  Within a month after beginning Kineret injections, my stiffness and swelling were greatly reduced.  For the 1st time in 5 years I was able to crochet again, and do other fine work with my hands.  The injection site reactions in the first month were no picnic, but new users just need to stick with it, and in a few weeks the rash, itching, and bruising go away forever.  Unfortunately, after 20 months of use, Kineret has not put my RA in remission or stopped the progression of my joint destruction.  However, it - in combination with my other medications including Imuran, Celebrex, and low-dose prednisone - has made my daily life a lot more bearable.  I have been on virtually every other RA drug and drug combination, and nothing has worked this well.  Remicade nearly killed me, giving me the full-blown Lupus syndrome.  Methotrexate damaged my liver, so I have been taking Imuran (Azathioprine) in lieu of Methotrexate with the Kineret.  However, I just spent 17 days in the hospital with acute pancreatitis, which was most likely caused by the Imuran. (The agonizing pancreatitis pain made the pain of 25 aching RA joints seem minor in comparison.)  So, I will never take the Imuran again, and I'm not sure what I will be taking in combination with the Kineret.  By the way, I have no prescription coverage, and can't afford this medication, so Kineret has been provided to me at no cost through the &quot;Safety Net Foundation&quot;.

Within a month after beginning Kineret injections, my stiffness and swelling were greatly reduced.  For the 1st time in 5 years I was able to crochet again, and do other fine work with my hands.  The injection site reactions in the first month were no picnic, but new users just need to stick with it, and in a few weeks the rash, itching, and bruising go away forever.  Unfortunately, after 20 months of use, Kineret has not put my RA in remission or stopped the progression of my joint destruction.  However, it - in combination with my other medications including Imuran, Celebrex, and low-dose prednisone - has made my daily life a lot more bearable.  I have been on virtually every other RA drug and drug combination, and nothing has worked this well.  Remicade nearly killed me, giving me the full-blown Lupus syndrome.  Methotrexate damaged my liver, so I have been taking Imuran (Azathioprine) in lieu of Methotrexate with the Kineret.  However, I just spent 17 days in the hospital with acute pancreatitis, which was most likely caused by the Imuran. (The agonizing pancreatitis pain made the pain of 25 aching RA joints seem minor in comparison.)  So, I will never take the Imuran again, and I'm not sure what I will be taking in combination with the Kineret.  By the way, I have no prescription coverage, and can't afford this medication, so Kineret has been provided to me at no cost through the &quot;Safety Net Foundation&quot;.  My Rheumatologist provided me with the simple application form.

Kineret I was in a research study for three years and have been on Kineret for another year which was paid for by my husband's insurance.  The year has ended and hopefully our  insurance will cover me for another year.  I have been very pleased with Kineret even though I don't enjoy the daily injections.  My husband gives them to me.  I take small dosages of methotrexate as my doctor feels that it will make the Kineret more effective. Since being on Kineret I have felt much better even though I am not pain free. Joyce A

Kineret I didn't think the combo of Kineret and Humira was working for me. When I had an infection I had to stop both. I went through tremendous pain during that time. When it was over and I went back on Kineret/Humira within 24 hours the majority of the pain was gone.GONE! I guess it has been effective! I am drug tolerant, have been on EVERY DMARD and Biological. None have worked till now. I guess that says something for Kineret!

So far it's working.......... After both Enbrel and Remicade lost effectiveness for me, I switched to Kineret 5 months ago.  So far it's working for me (along with a variety of other things - Methotrexate, Vioxx and low dose Pred)!  After about 3 weeks I went through a period of horrible injection site reactions (welts, itching, dark purple blotches).  Once those cleared up I haven't had any problems - except for occasional bruise due to poor injection technique.

Is Amgen Honest? Have completed 3 weeks of Kineret.  I have had some lousy, painful, cellulitis type of site reactions in my arms &amp; thighs.  My backside &amp; abdomen are OK so far.  I was pretty sick with the Lupus Syndrome from Remicade when I started taking this drug so it is hard to judge the effectiveness.  I am having minor flare-ups in my knees &amp; hands.  Right now it is 4 AM &amp; I have been sleeping poorly for the last week for no apparent reason.  Usually I sleep like a log.  Also, for the first time ever I am having numbness, tingling, &amp; burning in my feet.  It is especially bad at night &amp; I had to take 2 Ultram to relieve some of it last night.  I have found nothing in the Kineret literature that names side effects of this type but at the Amgen/Kineret web site it lists &quot;26% other&quot; under side effects &amp; very few of these &quot;others&quot; can be found in their diatribe.  Sad state of affairs in Healthcare when advertisements are the only real information available to consumers.  Guess I'll just wait until the next new drug comes along &amp; hope it helps.  I am really undecided about Kineret!

Kineret  I am a 50 yr old female who has had RA for 14 yrs. I took Kineret for 6 months and I can honestly say they were the worst 6 months of my life.  The injections (medicine) were painful and left red patches and bruises.  I only had a slight relief from pain.  My immune system went down the tubes and caused me to end up in the hospital with a case of viral pneumonia.  This happened 3 times.  I, like many of you get so excited thinking this drug will help, so far nothing is working.  I just started Gold shots this week.  I hope this helps.

Infection Problems When I first started on Kineret, after failing Remicade, MXT and on Arava I had wonderful results within about 15 shots or so. After nearly 90 days on it I got Cellulitus and had to stop for about 10 days, and it never really helped after that!  I continued to take it for another 4 mos or so, and the only thing i got was injection site reactions that were really very uncomfortable.  Stopped after about 8 mos total on Kineret!  Read about the infection rate before starting.

research side effects first before trying Was on study for drug from Jan 99 till December 99, placebo for 1st 6 months. When started drug had large welts, itching at injection sites, then bruising. After 5 months on drug, felt no difference in RA, so quit study.  At the time that I quit, my toes started feeling numb.  At 3 years after I stopped drug, now have nerve damage in feet and the numbness is going up my legs.  Neurologist thinks toxic reaction to medication and there's nothing that can be done except to exercise to keep muscles working, which as you know with RA is difficult enough. Have been diagnosed with small fiber nerve damage, or neuropathy in feet.  Wish I'd never tried anakinra...

So far, so good. I was diagnosed with RA when I was 18. Now at 34, trying everything else, Kineret is a blessing. I have much more energy than before and the pain is gradually decreasing. I did experiencing site reactions during week 2 but now they are gone. I am keeping my fingers crossed that I continue to improve!

Kineret Kineret is a miracle drug, as far as I'm concerned.  Within 2 weeks of beginning treatment my pain and swelling were greatly improved.  When I began Kineret 3 months ago, I was disabled.  I had been unable to work for the previous 18 months.  I am now able to return to work and enjoy a normal life.  I even go dancing!!!

long time user! I have been part of a drug study for nearly 3 years. I found the Kineret to be very effective in that I have no more low grade fevers and the fatigue is much reduced. I had to go off Methotrexate and the Kineret alone is keeping me well. I had a little redness and itchiness the first few weeks, but nothing since. My cost will be going up a great deal next year, however.

Is Amgen Honest? Have completed 3 weeks of Kineret.  I have had some lousy, painful, cellulitis type of site reactions in my arms &amp; thighs.  My backside &amp; abdomen are OK so far.  I was pretty sick with the Lupus Syndrome from Remicade when I started taking this drug so it is hard to judge the effectiveness.  I am having minor flare-ups in my knees &amp; hands.  Right now it is 4 AM &amp; I have been sleeping poorly for the last week for no apparent reason.  Usually I sleep like a log.  Also, for the first time ever I am having numbness, tingling, &amp; burning in my feet.  It is especially bad at night &amp; I had to take 2 Ultram to relieve some of it last night.  I have found nothing in the Kineret literature that names side effects of this type but at the Amgen/Kineret web site it lists &quot;26% other&quot; under side effects &amp; very few of these &quot;others&quot; can be found in their diatribe.  Sad state of affairs in Healthcare when advertisements are the only real information available to consumers.  Guess I'll just wait until the next new drug comes along &amp; hope it helps.  I am really undecided about Kineret!

Kineret  I am a 50 yr old female who has had RA for 14 yrs. I took Kineret for 6 months and I can honestly say they were the worst 6 months of my life.  The injections (medicine) were painful and left red patches and bruises.  I only had a slight relief from pain.  My immune system went down the tubes and caused me to end up in the hospital with a case of viral pneumonia.  This happened 3 times.  I, like many of you get so excited thinking this drug will help, so far nothing is working.  I just started Gold shots this week.  I hope this helps.

Infection Problems When I first started on Kineret, after failing Remicade, MXT and on Arava I had wonderful results within about 15 shots or so. After nearly 90 days on it I got Cellulitus and had to stop for about 10 days, and it never really helped after that!  I continued to take it for another 4 mos or so, and the only thing i got was injection site reactions that were really very uncomfortable.  Stopped after about 8 mos total on Kineret!  Read about the infection rate before starting.

research side effects first before trying Was on study for drug from Jan 99 till December 99, placebo for 1st 6 months. When started drug had large welts, itching at injection sites, then bruising. After 5 months on drug, felt no difference in RA, so quit study.  At the time that I quit, my toes started feeling numb.  At 3 years after I stopped drug, now have nerve damage in feet and the numbness is going up my legs.  Neurologist thinks toxic reaction to medication and there's nothing that can be done except to exercise to keep muscles working, which as you know with RA is difficult enough. Have been diagnosed with small fiber nerve damage, or neuropathy in feet.  Wish I'd never tried anakinra...

So far, so good. I was diagnosed with RA when I was 18. Now at 34, trying everything else, Kineret is a blessing. I have much more energy than before and the pain is gradually decreasing. I did experiencing site reactions during week 2 but now they are gone. I am keeping my fingers crossed that I continue to improve!

Kineret Kineret is a miracle drug, as far as I'm concerned.  Within 2 weeks of beginning treatment my pain and swelling were greatly improved.  When I began Kineret 3 months ago, I was disabled.  I had been unable to work for the previous 18 months.  I am now able to return to work and enjoy a normal life.  I even go dancing!!!

long time user! I have been part of a drug study for nearly 3 years. I found the Kineret to be very effective in that I have no more low grade fevers and the fatigue is much reduced. I had to go off Methotrexate and the Kineret alone is keeping me well. I had a little redness and itchiness the first few weeks, but nothing since. My cost will be going up a great deal next year, however.

Hopeful My doctor said it would take a least three months before she can determine its effectiveness.  I felt better after starting treatment.  However, about a week ago I had to increase steriods do to weeks of rain.  Blisters at site of injection was only side effect after ten days on medication.  No longer any blistering at injection site.

Anakinra I have been on ankinra for over 2 yrs... On a trial. I have had a few flare ups but over all it was good until the middle of June/02.  Both my hands are pretty painful &amp; a few of my fingers are starting to bend out of place &amp; are extra painful. (I have a 9 yr old and just holding hands or putting her hair in a pony tail is pretty painful ) I still have until Jan to finish my 3 yr study &amp; as of right now I don't plan on using it.  Maybe it's not as effective after long use... I do not know.  It will be interesting to see. (but as the saying goes what's good for me may not be good for you!) You don't know until you try it yourself.  Plus I hear the cost is very great, &amp; we do not have a drug plan.  Hopefully I'm just having a LONG flare up!!

Expensive Stuff After 1 week of injections on Kineret, I began to have the &quot;injection site irritations&quot; the company refers to. Only it is much more intense and painful. Burning, itching, huge welts, changing into bruises, then peeling and itching until they fade to a pale pink swatches. After six weeks of use still no change in sight, except the horrible injection site reactions.   I look like the victim of major bee stings, with welts at every possible injection. They down play this reaction, as they downplay how long they think it will take to see results.  I have had no improvement in RA symptoms with the Kineret.  Balanced against the side effects, my new doctor and I have decided that Kineret is not going to be working for me.

It has really worked for me. I am a female of 31 years and have four children. I have been on Kineret for one week now. After the first shot, on the first day, I noticed a dramatic improvement on the way I felt.  I did not hurt anywhere, nor was I swollen.  I do not like giving myself the shots, but seeing that it has helped me, I'll give myself the shot.  The first weekend after starting Kineret, I was able to use an oar on a 10 mile canoe trip with my children and did not have any pain during or after the trip.  I am thankful that something has finally worked for me.  I have tried everything else to no avail.  I can't afford the $1036 price of the Kineret, so my rheumatologist has sent the company a patient assistance form where I may be able to receive the medicine free because I am disabled.

Kineret UPDATE:  I have now been on this medication almost 6 months now and continue to improve.    I no longer have any site injection problems or rashes, in fact the rashes went away  after 3-4 weeks and never came back.  Overall, I have been feeling much better,  although sometimes in the evening, it seems the medication starts to wear off  a little and I get some achiness and joint stiffness and pain, which I take ibuprofen,  if needed.  But compared to how I felt before taking the medication, it is like night and day.  I am not &quot;cured&quot;, but feel this medicine has allowed me to live a normal life with much less pain and stiffness.  As far as the daily injections, the &quot;Simpleject&quot;  system makes it much easier for arthritis sufferers to give themselves the injection daily.  To tell you the truth, if I didn't use the device, I might not be able to  give myself the injections, as the dexterity in my finger and hands is very bad,  especially in the morning, prior to injecting my daily dose.  With that device, it is  very easy. I don't have any side effects that I'm aware of that are attributed to this medication.   I know I must sound like I work for the company, but this is really how it is.ORIGINAL RATING: I've been on Kineret for about 4 weeks.  I'm starting to feel noticeable improvements in my RA - much less stiffness and swelling - general overall feeling MUCH better. I was very hesitant at first - hated the idea of daily injections, did experience the site reactions, but if you get through the first 2 weeks it gets better each time.  Using the Simple Ject system, I'm doing really well with the daily injections - it has become part of my morning routine.  Don't get me wrong, would rather not have to do injections, but if finally feeling good is the payback - I will endure those injections.Suggestion to those in power at Kineret....why don't you start working on a &quot;Patch&quot; that we can use instead of injections?

What a Pain I've been on Kineret for 3 weeks and have had to force myself to continue to this point. Tonight I decided to quit it. Site reactions are severe on butt and arms and there is no good place for additional injections. I know I have not been on it long enough for it to help, but I'm not going through this any more.

klonopin	Epilepsy	2012-11-12 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	4.0	3.0	I finally don't have seizures like I was having. I can sleep better too because I am not having seizures in the middle of the night.
klonopin	Anxiety	2012-10-14 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	I have been on this medication for 17 years and the doctor suddenly wanted me off of 4 mg a day, and they detoxed me off it in 5 days. It was totally wrong and inadequate treatment. Every single medication they are trying to replace it with is causing terrible side effects. The medication worked on the same dose for a long time and although did not totally remove manic episodes and anxiety it reduced them a lot. The major tranquilizer replacement caused liver damage and now liver cirrhosis, and I am seriously ill. Then the liver damage from seroquel caused malignant cells to be dumped into my lymph nodes and started lymphoma. Wake up doctors and stop replacing liver safe medications with non-liver safe medications and feel the risk is worth it. It is not worth it. The hospital is being sued.
klonopin	Anxiety	2012-10-14 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	I'm writing this review for my son who is no longer alive. This drug along with a couple others his doctor gave him killed him.The other drugs was ambien,and hydrocodone I just want others to be aware they can be harmful as well.
klonopin	Anxiety	2012-10-02 00:00:00		5.0	0.5	5.0	5.0	i have been taking this drug for 15 years or more they have tryed me on them all not one of them help this one has but now the laws are so bad that at any giving time they can kill me my blood pressure will not go down on blood pressure medicines racing mind not able to drive a long list i have not miss used this medicine can't find away get past the side effects was off of them a year did not recover doctors put me back on them and at any time they could cut me off this drug works if any doctor sees this please send me someway to getting off them and not suffer phoenix.dragon8@yahoo.com because this medicine works.   i will die because of Klonopin i have lost trust in doctors so please and thank you.
klonopin	Bipolar I disorder	2012-09-19 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	5.0	4.5	My psych dr gave me every drug besides this one to start. I spent 3-4 years trying different medications. Depakote gave me a constant throbbing headache. This works. As im reviewing this, i have a headache after taking the med....but it works. 4.5/5.
klonopin	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2012-07-08 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	5.0	this treatment helped me tremendosly, before this i would have 2 panic atacks a day along with a racing heart and cold sweats, it also took away my urge to smoke cigs which was very nice. in my point of view clonazapam(klonopin) was a miracle, the only drug ive been prescribed that actually works for me. i was on citalopram (celexa)for two years and that did absolutly nothing except make my insomnia worse. alprazolam (xanax)was far too sedating and maid me sleep all day, it works but too many side effects.
klonopin	Anxiety	2012-06-17 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	This drug in conjunction w Zoloft and Neurotin has saved my life. I take 1.5mg 3x a day and I do not get tired.  My anxiety was extreme, based on childhood trauma.  I suffered from debilitating GAD, Agoraphobia, Depression, sweating, and terrible physical symptoms like  complex migraines with visual hallucinations way beyond aura, and stomach aches.  As I child I took librium, but it was not enough.  Valium made me sleepy.  I am allowed to reduce my dosage if I become sleepy, but I usually stick with my prescribed dosage.This drug is not for everyone.  my doctor told me it was nobody's business how much I needed to take after I got some negative feedback from a family member.  Without my drug combination, I would have killed myself for certain.  Now, I do not feel drugged, tired, depressed or stressed out. This drug has saved my life. It is not a fast benzo, but is long lasting.
klonopin	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2012-05-08 00:00:00		1.5	2.5	5.0	0.5	Bounced back and forth from Klonopin to Xanax many times. Why K-pin is approved for panic attacks, I don't know. It take too long to work and when it finally does my attacks are gone. Does not stop a panic attack like Xanax does. Xanax is a panic attacks kryptonite. Klonopin just leaves me drowsy, yet I have trouble sleeping on it, (even with added Dalmane). Also doesn't slow my thoughts like Xanax does. My brain never shuts up w/out Xanax. Only good thing about Klonopin is it lasts long so I don't wake up in w/drawals like I do on Xanax. IMO, Klonopin is good only for Generalized Anxiety Disorders.
klonopin	Anxiety	2012-04-07 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	4.5	4.5	I have never felt aggressive or any energy type reaction.  I wish I felt some energy.  I usually feel tired, it slows my mind down and helps me to think more clearly.  It makes me feel so comfortable mentally, I don't have the desire to eat get a glass of water if I wanted one.  I wish it would help my fall asleep and stay asleep.  I know that there is no way I can go out and be social after taking any amount.  I'm too relaxed.  I just want to sit and do nothing.
klonopin	Anxiety	2012-02-21 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	3.0	Very long story short.  i was a depressed child, and suffered greatly from anxiety from a very young age. At the age of 20, i was put on an antidepressant and Librium to control my severe anxiety disorder. i have been known to have six-week-long anxiety episodes, which have nearly killed me.i have also an anxiety phobia.  When i was 34, i was diagnosed as an alcoholic/addict, went to treatment, and taken off of all my meds. i suffered for 4 years with nothing, then went on Prozac. Because f sobriety  issues, i tried to avoid the benzos, but my anxiety was so out of control, i was finally put on klonopin, a drug i didn't know.  It is a lifesaver.  Under pressure from AA friends, i had tried to get off it twice, attempted suicide both times, and was sent home from the dual diagnosis nut ward with a giant bottle. i am 63 years old, and i don't care what anyone thinks about it, it is saving my life. i have never abused it, it has no euphoric effect, and i will never stop taking it again.

klonopin	Panic Disorder	2011-09-29 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I have been taking clonazapam for almost 20 years. I had extreme panic/anxiety and didn't want to go out unless I sat near an exit. For about 2 years I didn't take anything. I was a waitress and would have to run into the bathroom and wash my face and neck with cool water. It was hard to get through the day. I had them constantly. finally I was put on clonazapam. I take 0.5 in am, 1.0 in afternoon and 0.5 at night and it helps me so much....I was tired when I started but not now.
klonopin	Anxiety	2011-09-26 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Been taking clonazapam  for 2 yrs. for anxiety.  Am now on 0.5 mg. as needed.  Has worked perfectly for me.  Would like to know the criteria people use to gauge &quot;ease of use&quot;.  Put pill in mouth, follow by water, swallow. Noticed in reviews some rated drug lower in ease of use and wondered what exactly they meant by this.
klonopin	Social phobia (Social anxiety disorder)	2011-09-07 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I have been taking xanax (first few years) and clonazepam for over 20 years now and it has saved my life. I tried many other drugs to treat severe panic disorder and social anxiety disorder, with limited or no success. With this drug,there is hope for a great life. I have held a fantastic job for 15 years, own a home, have a great wife and kids and feel like I can handle each day now. Life is still very hard with SAD, but clonazepam does take away the anxiety and allows you to move forward with your life rather than living each day in hell. I have been off it now for 6 months with no problem, but I still carry it with me &quot;just in case&quot;.
klonopin	Anxiety	2011-08-26 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	4.5	4.5	have been taking it for 20  years have tourettes and lots of panic .
klonopin	Anxiety	2011-08-22 00:00:00		1.5	5.0	3.0	4.0	Still feel like I don't want to do nothing. Have alot to do because have own buissness. put don't have motivation esp first thing in morning. I want  to do it but can't get  my brain motived to go out
klonopin	Bipolar I disorder	2011-06-13 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	5.0	4.0	I can't take Seroquel or Ambien and my persistent thoughts kept me from sleeping. Klonipin helps me sleep, but I have a bit of a hangover from it the next day (I take 2mg). I was afraid of getting hooked because it is a in the benzediazepam family, but I haven't found this to be the case after over two years on and off of it. Still, I wouldn't just cold turkey stop it neither. It does the job it is supposed to do with few side effects. That's more than can be said about a lot of other psych meds.
klonopin	Anxiety	2011-06-11 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	After 15 years on this pill it still makes me very tired .
klonopin	Anxiety	2011-05-16 00:00:00		1.0	0.5	4.0	2.0	I have been given this medicine to ease the from Prisq onto Celexa I could not take the Prisq due to an extreme increase in my BP. But I have taken 2 pills and cannot tell that I have taken any it is .05 mg is this normal? does it take awhile to get in your system?
klonopin	Epilepsy	2011-04-15 00:00:00		3.5	4.0	4.0	4.0	After getting out of the hospital after a bad seizure I was prescribed 1mg. clonazepam at night. Since that's when I have most of my seizures. But after 1 year of taking 1mg. I think I have built up a tolerance. I'm starting to have seizures at night, wet the bed, and have nightmares that prevent me from sleeping. I've also lost my appetite and will to live. I know I need 2mg. now cause I took 2 of my 1mg's at once one night and woke up the next day never feeling better. So I don't take these things to get off!!! Maybe 2mg's will last 2 or 3 years..
klonopin	Anxiety	2011-03-23 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	4.5	5.0	I have seizures and this helps me with the anxiety. I am very high strung and hyper. With clonazepam I don't get as anxious.I take 0.5 2x a day.

klonopin	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2011-01-17 00:00:00		4.0	3.5	5.0	2.5	I have severe anxiety with panic attacks and agoraphobia. I was put on Klonopin about 7 years ago and it worked wonders at first, amazing decrease in my anxiety. As time went on, it stopped working as well, so my doctor upped my dose. &amp; months ago it just stopped working, so I decided to stop taking it. I ended up in and out of the hospital trying to fight the awful withdrawal... Puking, twitches, muscle spasms, etc... Now I'm Klonopin free for about 4 months :)
klonopin	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2011-01-17 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I have been on Klonopin for over 20 yrs at mainly .5mg three times a day for an over active &quot;fight or flight&quot; response to perceived stress. I would perceive a situation as overwhelming, then stress hormones would dump into my blood stream and cause an inflammatory response. I had almost lost the use of my eye movements as the antibodies would attack my eye muscles. Once I began Klonopin there was a balance, it would help bring me back to normal. I never felt any side effects from it and no tired or sluggish response. Over the years, mainly recent 5 yrs I have had at times needed to increase dosage up to 1mg and most recently 2mg at bedtime as I am going through Trauma therapy for PTSD. My goal is to get back to .5mg which I believe is possible with the help of cognitive therapy. Good communication with your physicians and therapists are crucial to proper team directed care. Every individual reacts differently to meds. My experience has greatly improved my life.
klonopin	Anxiety	2011-01-14 00:00:00		5.0	2.0	5.0	5.0	I started taking Clonazepam 10 years ago when I heard that it was also being used for treating VERTIGO. Vertigo can be debilitating &amp; use to lay me away for 2-3 days of hideous nausea &amp; dizziness. Taking Anti-Vert did nothing for the Vertigo. Once I started the Clonazepam, the episodes STOPPED. It also helps with anxiety, so there is a double benefit to it. I take 1 mg. in AM, and 1 mg. before bedtime. Yes, it does make me sleepy, but don't sleep well anyway, so it helps with that, too. It is a GREAT medication, and I would never consider giving it up.
klonopin	Post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)	2010-10-11 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I've been using Clonazapam along with Xanax 0.25mg (for break through symptoms) for a litle over 3 years now- Just after a traumatic trigger that sent me into a whirlwind.  Was initally taking 0.5 mg Xanax 3 x day. After a week or so was prescribed the klonopin 1 mg 2x day (much longer lasting), After a couple weeks I felt this dose made me to Loopy so only took once a day. I now only take 0.5 (1/2 tab) every morning. Mornings are when I panic,usually while getting ready for work. I rarely need the Xanax 0.25mg. Was taking a whole tab but now have been taking half or (0.125mg)- a couple times a week - more or less often, if needed. Only side effect is dry eyes, but I probably need to drink more H2O also. I would encourage anyone taking this drug to do so with caution, and only the minimal amt neeeded for symptom relief. Therapy is also A MUST!! Meds are for symptoms only. You must also work on addressing the causes and triggers. support groups are great too!
klonopin	Anxiety	2010-10-07 00:00:00		3.5	3.0	5.0	3.0	I am taking this to help with anxiety when going off my zoloft and changing to wellbutrin. The only problem is, I get really tired when I take it and can't really do my normal everyday chores. It just gets me too relaxed. But, it does help with the anxiety.
klonopin	Anxiety	2010-08-29 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	I've been taking Klonopin for a few years now (1.5mg at this time)....finally seeing a psychiatrist who correctly diagnosed my issues.  I take it along with Effexor and finally feel &quot;normal.&quot;  It does bother me a bit that I have to be on it, but the alternative is much less appealing.I didn't have the typical panic attacks that some people have when taking this medicine, but would have an overwhelming sense of out-of-control thoughts and would focus to the point I couldn't function.  Part of this is the OCD too, but combined with the Effexor...amazing.Completely changed my life for the better...only wish I had been correctly diagnosed sooner in life.
klonopin	Panic Disorder	2010-08-15 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	klonopin works!
klonopin	Anxiety	2010-05-25 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	Controls my panic episodes and I have no negative side effects.

have been on this on and off since having panic attacks in 1995, helps with sleep, makes life easier and I feel more normal but there is the memory issue which is not minor. Getting worse so I can't tell if its age related or drug related so coming off the drug very slowly, down to .375 mg/day, I divide the .5 mg in half then half again, take .125 early in day and rest at night, sounds complicated but I have had to go this slowly due to intolerable insomnia and anxiety with faster withdrawal. Also taking very small does of Remeron, .75 mgs, doc said it would help me withdraw and it does, helps with sleep and probably with depression although as long as I can sleep I really am not depressed. Basically Klonopin is great just hell to stop it.

Amazing how many people are afraid of the new buzz-word, &quot;addiction.&quot; How many people are willing to give me 14 years worth of lost earnings while I was housebound from panic?   I lost those years because I had no clue that Klonopin worked for anxiety for many people.   Once I took it, it still took me 3 years to gradually face agoraphobia. I still am mildly agoraphobic and will probably be so. SSRIs don't touch panic for me. Not all panic is serotonin-based. Klonopin works on the GABA system, where my panic stems from. If a med did not work for you, or if you would rather suffer from crippling anxiety and suicidal thoughts to avoid an &quot;addiction,&quot; then so be it. Don't let the rest of us be dictated to. Stevie Nicks said that Klonopin ruined her life but she *didn't* have panic disorder. She was also brain-damaged from years of cocaine use.

Keep in in mind that if this drug does not work for you it takes a very short time for you to get addicted to it and withdrawal it pure hell - period. Also even it does work, over time, since it is a benzo, your body will build up a tolerance to it and you will soon get to a level that you will be needed to get off and you will experence the withdrawal anyway. Stevie Nicks in her autobio said that it was easier to get off coke then it was klonopin. Do your research before taking this drug.

I was prescribed this drug for an anxiety disorder relating to insomnia. I have never been a good sleeper and it maifested into a full blown anxiety disorder when I went 3 days with no sleep. I admitted myself into a psychiatric ward b/c I couldnt take it anymore. I was given seroquel 200mg and 1 mg klonopin. The drug worked immediately for me. I slept great had no hangover effect it was beautiful. Until recently my husband and I want to get pregnant and this drug is a no no through pregnancy (sadly.) My battle to wean off has been rough. Please TAPER do not stop taking this cold turkey (I made the mistake) I now take 100 mg of trazodone for sleep which I am still getting used to. It's not as good as the klonopin but I'm trying to battle through it because I would like to get pregnant sometime in the future. Great drug to take when you are desparate but awful to get off of. STAY STRONG!!

I was first prescribed 2 mg a day for my panic attacks and social phobia and clonazepam (klonopin) has been a godsend. I don't feel as inhibited as before, I am able to be assertive, jocular, social and actually happy. I believe this medication has some beneficial antidepressant effects. I had no side effects whatsoever. I do realize people say this is the second most addictive benzodiazepine, but I haven't felt any &quot;addiction&quot; yet or any compulsion to abuse the drug. I am now on 1.5 mg in the morning and 1 mg in the afternoon. Alprazolam (xanax) is more addictive and I used that before for an extreme panic attack but clonazepam has a lower drug-like feeling. Alprazolam is pretty much like a very clean drunk. I would recommend it to anyone suffering from debilitating anxiety, social phobia or panic attacks. It's short acting and long lasting. I have been taking clonazepam for about 4 months now.

I'm a 25 year old male. Klonopin has been a miracle drug for me. I take .5 mg as needed.  On days where I know I won't do anything social I will not take any in an attempt to reduce any tolerance I might develop. I would highly recommend this drug, even over other benzos like xanax which left me feeling like a zombie.Pros- Instant relief from social anxiety. -Not as strong as Xanax (in a good way.)Cons- I've read Klonopin is habit forming (although after 3 months I've yet to need an increased dose.) -My libido has decreased slightly as has my ability to orgasm.-I've noticed some days I wake up with a mild headache..I've read this is fairly common with benzos.-This isn't a &quot;real&quot; cure, that is, it doesn't treat the underlying cause of my social anxiety, whatever that might be.

Klonopin helped my anxiety and helped me to sleep better, but it was a NIGHTMARE to stop taking because the withdrawals were terrible.  I was extremely irritable, felt like I was jumping out of my skin, paranoid.  It took me 4 very long months to taper off this drug, and I will never take it again.

Works fantastically w/ Effexor.  I take .5 twice a day (for 2 years). Works wonders.  Just be careful not to abuse it so you don't build up a tolerance to it.  Works much better than Xanax or Serax.  Longer lasting and less side effects.

I was put on this for tension headaches/ head pain due to arthritis in my jaw and wooow. I dunno why I was put on this (I was 16) but yeah, I was seeing things, falling over, grumpy, sleeping during class, etc. etc. It was TERRIBLE. I do NOT recommend this for any small person or young person. It was bad. I also began to crave it, which is not good. So yeah, I wouldn't recommend it.

It took me a month to figure out what dose would actually begin to help.  I started out on .5 mg for three days then .5 mg  twice a day for three days then .5 mg three times a day for the remainder of the month.   I had to stop taking the medication this way because .5 mg at one time was too much and would literally knock me out!  Now, I am taking half of a .5 mg tablet four times but spacing it out daily until my next appointment and it seems to be working better.

Will stop a panic attack dead in it's tracks. I take it as needed (once a week at most,) because it is addictive and the withdrawl is horrible. Taken as a backup to an antidepressant. It's a great safety net and the generic is cheap.

I was suffering from insomnia/nightly anxiety to the point where I was depressed and desperate for sleep. I was reluctant when my doctor prescribed .5 Klonopin nightly, but I have to say that it has given me my life back.  There have been no side effects.  I take the med, then start reading a book with a a soft book-light.  I'm usually sleeping in 20 minutes.  When I awaken,I drink a full bottle of water and feel great.  It's very important to drink the water to flush the med out of your system. I try to skip the med on the weekends, so not to build a tolerance.  No other med had worked until Klonopin.  But I've discovered that it is useless if you don't read with a soft light.  Also, for those with anxiety/insomnia, I don't mean to embarrass anyone, but there is a natural thing that you can do to yourself that seems to help if you do it a few hours before bed (I'm sure you can figure out what I'm referring to).  It's a great anxiety reducer.

Ok, the thing abouat Klonopin, is it helps calm me down but does not put me to sleep.  I was diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder about 5 years ago.  I have difficulty taking my meds, but I know when I need Klonopin.  It eventually calms me down, but I would like to have something to make me sleep.  I have take Klonopin for about 5 years, and now, I have to take 3mg of it for it to calm me down.  But still no sleep.  I do reccomend this to patients, because everybody reacts differently to meds.  I hope it works well for ya'll!

My diagnosis is bipolar II. I was on .5 mg. Klonopin for 8 years. Then I decided to titrate off. This took a year and not being on the med was horrific. I had horrible vivid nightmares and suicidal ideations. My sleep also decreased from 10-12 hours a night to 6. My other med, Depakote 1375 mg. did not change. After 6 months of being off, I decided to slowly go back on. I have been on .25 mg for the past two years. I do not feel the peace that I used to on .5 mg. but my sleeping is 7-9 hours now. I have more energy.

I take Klonepin very occasionally for anxiety, to sleep if I'm hypomanic, or to tame a hypomania. I do not take a whole pill (.5mg.) as this more or less puts me to sleep and leaves me groggy and depressed afterwards. I take a quarter of a pill (.125 mg) and this takes the edge off the anxiety enough to cope. I find this very effective and have taken it off and on for 10 years. It can be addictive so I would not recommend anyone with addiction problems take it. If you are able to use it responsibly it is an excellent med.

Klonopin was given to me many years ago by my psychiatrist for anxiety/panic disorder.  I only take 1mg every 2 days.  Only when I feel anxious and my other coping skills just aren't working.  The only big downside (and it is a big one) is that I have been on it for so long that it has been hard for me to try to get off of it.  I have tried twice now (under my doctor's supervision).  A few days into it...I feel as if I am jumping out of my skin!  Anyway, I would recommend this for short term treatment until another medication (e.g. Zoloft, etc.) can be put on board.

Klonopin has not helped my RLS at all.  Even 4-6 mg.  I could probably double the dose and it would still feel like I'm &quot;peeing in the ocean to raise the tide.&quot;  I know Klonopin has VERY nasty withdrawal effects.  This is the only reason I am still taking it; I'm hooked.  Just to feel &quot;normal,&quot; whatever that means.  One contraindication may be that I also take Oxycontin for chronic pain, and the RLS especially sets in as a withdrawal symptom in case I run out of my pain medication.  So perhaps I'm not EXACTLY an RLS sufferer; but definitely I am an iatrogenic one.  It really drives a person nuts.

I've been taking Klonipin for panic attacks for about 6-8 months now. I started with .25mg a day which brely seemed to make a dent but now I'm on 1-2.5mg a day which has been working great!I would get the panic attacks that would be so bad I couldn't breather, and would sometimes even pass out. Klonipin has rescused me, and givin me my life back! It's an amazing drug but I would recommend trying other methods first because it is a heavy duty addictive medicine

I've beeen sick for several years with a serious brain disorder, which I have been cured of  with many surgeries, but once I finally got off pain medcine  I started to get terrible RLS. I also began to have daily sevre panic attacks.My docter perscribed Mirapex first which helped the RLS to an extent, but I still couldnt sleep due to the axietity.When she put me on 1.5mg of Klonipin at night for both I've been doing get. I  can now sleep through the night without the sudden involintary jerking movemnts, and crazy feeling other RLS suffers would understand.The only downfall would have to be the addictivness it has terruble withdraw symtoms, but I do think it's worth it because of the great results just be careful not to abuse it!

I have been taking klonopin for 3 years for panic disorder. It has helped me so much... I take it at night before bed because I had the majority of my panic attacks in the middle of the night. I take it during the day as needed. It has been great for me. People talk about it being habit forming but I really just see it as a great medication that has helped make my life easier.

Works on some levels. Saved me out of a downward spiral at first diagnosis over 3yrs ago. Weened off of it no problem as I plateaued with Lexapro complementing at 20mg daily. That caused a sever crash and jumped right back on it at 2mg - 3mg daily and it just does what it does behind the scenes of my daily regiment Effexor XR, Xanax and Capaxone for MS - RRMS.

I have been on Klonopin for nearly 2 decades, weaned from Xanax. It works very well, but there is a tolerance in me, and there are nights where I cant rally tell it is working. The Klonopin has a longer half life about 8 hours, to Xanax 4 hours. The drug is very effective, but when a full blown panic attack is imminent, I found Xanax to stop it dead in its tracks within minutes. I am going to try the L-Theonine and see if it will help me in the day with my anxiety. Will update.

Extremely effective medication for anxiety/panic/insomnia.  Also helps with muscle pain/jerks/stiffness.  Unfortunately, it loses some of it's effectiveness, and withdrawal is horrible!  It took me a long time to get off of this drug.  Would absolutely not recommend it to be taken everyday.  However, on occasion, this drug is perfect for high stress/anxiety situations, or difficulty sleeping.

This medication works well when you need it, but I couldn't stay on it or use it every day because my body got used to it too fast and I had to take more of it. It might not be that way for you though, and it is certainly a great choice if you only need to use it a few times a week. Then it is not addictive at all, and you can take it long term because your body doesn't get used to it. The only thing you have to watch out for is that you may not be able to drive as it can make you sleepy or stupid. Otherwise, no other side effects, and it wears off just fine.

Klonopin is a horrible drug, in my opinion and experience. I notice a few users mention the withdrawal symptoms which they avoid by continuing the use of this evil drug. I went through hell very soon after starting, and two years late had myself admitted to a psych ward to be medically 'detoxed'. Well, the doctors don't have a clue about addiction and depression. Cold-turkeyed me in 3 days with phenobarbital. After discharge my real hell began, and lasted three years!! Anyone suffering should go to benzo.org.uk to see for themselves the ravges of benzodiazapines. Only those who are suffering can uderstand the horror of drugs like this.

Klonopin pretty much savd my life. I had been in a state of extreme social anxiety in which my psyydoc reluctantly gave me klonopin. after taking it , wthin 24 hours I went from rock bottom to feeling great. You have to be really cautious taking this drug. Its easy to build a tolerance over a pro longed period of time. I would suggest lowering your dosage from time to time even if your symptoms resurface, its a great way to avoid building a tolerance. I took 1 mg a day for a few months then went up to 2 mgs a day. My docter suggested lowering the dose for 2 weeks, afterwards it was much more effective and actually I didnt need to take 2 mgs a day anymore. The 2 weeks were very difficult but it was worht it. Overall its a great drug

The best drug for general anxiety, social anxiety, and panic attacks.  Also works well for sleep and for fibromyalgia symptoms.  Virtually a life saver.  Only drawback is you can develop a big physical dependence to it.  Although, there is little or no psychological addiction.  I used to use it everyday.  I since, have tapered off of it which can take some time.  No I use it on an as needed basis.  There is no need to suffer panic attacks and wicked anxiety and insomnia when this drug is available.

Also works well for sleep and for fibromyalgia symptoms.  Virtually a life saver.  Only drawback is you can develop a big physical dependence to it.

I have been suffering from occipital neuralgia for the last 2 yrs. I am a 30 yr old female who had been seeing a neurologist for the condition. I have tried nortriptyline , amitriptyline, tegretol, oxycodone and lyrica. None of these medications worked. Also tried skelaxin for severe muscle twitches and spasms,  which only caused me to break out in hives and also did not work.  My symptoms would range from mild to severe burnig on the right side and lower back of my head around the base. A month ago I started to see a new dr and after listening to my medical history  he put me on klonopin. It has amazed me how one little pill (klonopin) has almost made my migraines and occipital neuralgia go away almost  completely ( without side  effects). It has also caused me to have less muscle twitches. I still can feel a little twinge of burning in my head sometimes, but compared to the severity of the pain before, klonopin has changed my life for the better (its amazing).

Helpful for mania when I couldn't sleep, but left me tired and groggy in the depressed phase.  I used it off and on for about two years, and then my doctor started me with Seroquel for acute mania instead.

I was on 1mg twice daily.  The medication worked great at first-for about 5 days maybe and than all of a sudden when I took it, it was like I didn't take it at all.  My doctor insists that I am not giving it a chance and is still keeping me on it.  I take it like I am supposed to, but it doesn't take my anxiety away anymore.

Klonopin is more addictive than crack and harder to get off of than heroin.  Klonopin is a brain damaging neurotoxic drug.  If your doctor tells you that klonopin is safe and non-addictive, report him to the medical board and immediately find another doctor.  Consider yourself lucky if you make it off of klonopin alive and without permanent brain damage.

My daughter was on this for depression.  Every time she called me she sounded worse on the phone.   i finally had to drive out of state to get her.  She was crying, overly sensitive, paranoid.   I told her she was to stop taking that medicine and I took her to my house to stay.  She was fine in a few days and back to her normal self.   I wouldn't trust this medicine to help anyone who is depressed.

This definitely helped my sleeping problems, but I wasn't informed before I started it that Klonopin is also a very long-acting anti-anxiety medication, meaning that it's also in your system in the daytime even if you're only taking it at night. I think it's probably compounded some energy issues I've had (I'm also a depression patient), and further, if you ever want to stop using it, going off anti-anxiety medication could be difficult even if you didn't have diagnosed anxiety in the first place. I'm pretty upset that no one warned me about this.

Helpful for mania when I couldn't sleep, but left me tired and groggy in the depressed phase.  I used it off and on for about two years, and then my doctor started me with Seroquel for acute mania instead.

I was on 1mg twice daily.  The medication worked great at first-for about 5 days maybe and than all of a sudden when I took it, it was like I didn't take it at all.  My doctor insists that I am not giving it a chance and is still keeping me on it.  I take it like I am supposed to, but it doesn't take my anxiety away anymore.

Klonopin is more addictive than crack and harder to get off of than heroin.  Klonopin is a brain damaging neurotoxic drug.  If your doctor tells you that klonopin is safe and non-addictive, report him to the medical board and immediately find another doctor.  Consider yourself lucky if you make it off of klonopin alive and without permanent brain damage.

My daughter was on this for depression.  Every time she called me she sounded worse on the phone.   i finally had to drive out of state to get her.  She was crying, overly sensitive, paranoid.   I told her she was to stop taking that medicine and I took her to my house to stay.  She was fine in a few days and back to her normal self.   I wouldn't trust this medicine to help anyone who is depressed.

This definitely helped my sleeping problems, but I wasn't informed before I started it that Klonopin is also a very long-acting anti-anxiety medication, meaning that it's also in your system in the daytime even if you're only taking it at night. I think it's probably compounded some energy issues I've had (I'm also a depression patient), and further, if you ever want to stop using it, going off anti-anxiety medication could be difficult even if you didn't have diagnosed anxiety in the first place. I'm pretty upset that no one warned me about this.

This stuff really scares me due to it's controlled nature and such. I was diagnosed OCD and ADD- needed this med to travel. While traveling, had a car accident and husband and daughter were killed- so here comes a big bout of Panic Disorder, PTSD, and Traumatic Grief. I should be taking this regularly but it really scares me that I might get hooked on something or come to rely on it. Finally, my Dr. said that I must allow it to be used for its purpose - so I can sleep more than an hour or two a night. Doing so has allowed me to function the next day. Still- it scares me....

This medication has helped me immensly with anxiety issues.  It has helped me remain calm when in front of people and has also relaxed me when alone.   I currently take 1/2 tab in the morning along with my other medications and another 1/2 tab in the evening.  I sometimes need to take one whole  (1 mg)tablet in order to get through some ordeal or another.  Recently I had surgery and this medicine helped me to not  panic with my recovery.  I was able to stay calm enough to allow my body to recuperate.  I also am currently able to use this medicine effectively along with my other medicines so that there is a nice complimentary balance.   The only thing that bothers me about this medication is that my insurance only covers a portion of it so I am out of pocket a little bit of money, but it is well worth it.

I was prescribed Klonopin in 1994 after suffering from depression and panic/anxiety disorders since I was 8 years old.  I tried counseling, imagery, exercise and every other thing the health professionals suggested.  My general doctor after 13 years finally went with me to a reputable psychiatrist, (thank god) and I take an antidepressant, Effexor XR, and a .5 Klonopin each day.  It gave me back my life, my personality, and I have been able to help several people over the years as they are shocked that I take medication because I am so lively and full of zest for life.  Don't give up no matter what.  It was a true miracle for me...

My doctor perscribed it for anxeity and related insomnia.. Worked at 1mg a night for the insomnia, for 2 weeks, then stoped working.. I continued to take it for another 2 weeks until i started to have memory problems, ex: forgeting names, unable to complete sentances (right word) and forgeting pieces of my day. Withdrawing from it was hell, i had to step down at 1/8th a mg every 4-8 days. Leaving me confused, feeling stoned, and shaking from muscle tremors. It works great for short term use only, like a week MAX.

My psychiatrist recently urged me to take it regularly, instead of as needed, which I had done for years. She recommends it for my anxiety and sleeplessness, for which I was also taking Ambien CR. Clonazepam makes me very sleepy, already a natural component of my long-term, treatment resistant depression. So I find that side effect really difficult. I must remember to take it at about 6 pm, because if I take it too late, then it will still be affecting me by the next morning, and lately I am finding it very difficult to wake up. I found I can now fall asleep without Ambien CR; I am plenty sleepy! I only take .5 mg of Clonazepam per day. I will try this for a while and see if my sleepiness abates and if it still helps my anxiety, which maybe it does a little.

I don't know it after 12 years of not really knowing  what was happening to me and making so many crazy things I tend to be nervous at social gatherings specially with coworkers and people not very close to me.  Is funny though, I am Bipolar and I used to go out a lot, Lets say that before I marry 3 years ago, I used to party almost every day.  Still, I can go in a pub and feel ok.

King Klon I find this drug to be very useful for insomnia and anxiety.  So far I have not experienced a panic attack that klon could not stop dead in its tracks.  I have learned a lot of coping mechanisms for panic but on those rare occasions when I can't control it--klon is a lifesaver and I use it as needed.I also use it to help me get to sleep and for that use I have become a fairly regular user.  However I am down to .25 mg every other day and it hasn't really been all that hard coming down from 2mg a day to ~.15mg a day.  You just have to take it slowly.I am kinda irritated that my shrink wants to get me on an SSRI instead of klon.  The last SSRI I tried made me depressed and suicidal.  Hello...why play with that kind of fire when I have something I'm clearly not abusing and works really well for me?

I have only found little increase in my tolerance level during this time going from 1 mg daily to something closer to 1.5 mg when there's no depression to 2.5 as part of a complex cocktail given my reisistance to SSRI and SNRI anti-dperessants in deeloping an anti-depressive remedy.

Clonazepam I was on Clonazepam many years ago and I remember it not working for me. I have recently been put back on it and there are up sides and down.  First the up:  My anxiety level drops way down when I take it.  I take 1mg 2x a day.  Now the down:  I have had really bad side effects.  I lose my balance and sometimes fall for no reason; I sometimes slurr my words; sometimes my mouth moves faster than my brain or vice versa, I haven't figured that one out yet.  But, the dosage was lowered and then taken up again and now I'm OK.  I'm not crazy about needing it, but unfortunately I do, so I take it.  Hope that helped.

Good for Anxiety and Sleep Along with anxiety/bipolar disorder, my fibro and interstitial cystitis flares can produce anxiety and difficulty sleeping.  Using Klonopin eases anxiety induced by flares and my job and eases me into sleep.  It has a gentle muscle relaxant property too, so I often take it in the daytime instead of Zanaflex to ease fibro symptoms like muscle cramps and soreness.  It makes me sleepy, but much less sleepy than the Zanaflex, so daytime use is acceptable.  Definitely a good med to try, especially if your flares make you anxious and/or upset.

Klonopin I've been taking 8mgs/d of Klonopin for the past several years now and I believe I am immune to it now,also I am a patient at a local Methadone Clinic and they drug test me every month and Klonopin (Benzos) never shows up in the test results so that would make me believe that I am immune to it plus I still have seroius and severe anxiety all day and I continue to self-mutilate. I think I need to be put on a stronger Benzo like Xanax or Valium. If anyone has any advise please do not hesitate to e-mail me at RIPNicka@aol.comThank You For Your Time

What to do? I have essential tremors... they have tried every drug there is, I think, to control them. The first one I took was propranolol, after 5 years I started having adverse reactions to it. So, they switched me to another beta blocker (that I can't think of the name of right now). I took that one for about 18 years. I got athsma while I was on it. I went to a neurologist in 2005 who was amazed that I was on that medication when I had athsma. He said I had to go off it emediately! So he tried a bunch of different medications to replace it. I had reactions to all of them. Things like extremely blurry vision and memory loss. Finally he gave me Clonazapam and I was very sensative to it too. So I have to cut the pills in half and suffer with some tremors. I still have a little blurry vision from it and some memory problems... but what can I do???

K-Pin has helped my FMS a lot. Klonopin has been great. Those with FMS and CFS we have what's called excitory neurotoxicity. Klonopin shifts you more toward the healing state, or more toward coma on the seizure continuim. This works great for my social anxiety and helps me sleep in combination with Trazodone 200mg. I have 3mg daily of K-pin and it really does the trick. 2mg at bedtime and 1mg in the day. If you take to much, however, you will notice major sedation and confusion. Try to find the highest possible dose that doesn't make you drowsy. Great medication for all sorts of uses such as CFS/FMS/GAD/SAD/etc.

Restless Leg Syndrome After three weeks I became so groggy in the mornings that I could not function safely.  My PCP switched me to another medication.I wonder if the dose was too large for my age--72 at the time.

temporal usage only I found it very useful to decrease the symptoms of my SP and reducing my anxiety. But my doctor said that it's only for temporary usage and isn't proper for long term usage such that you may force to increase dosage permanently to keep it's effect. Also it is mentioned somewhere that long term usage of klonopin may lead to weakness of memory.

It works! When taken as directed, and waiting 15-20 minutes after talking the medication before going to bed, Klonopin stops the symptoms of RLS that are keeping you awake.  I awake feeling refreshed, as though I had a deep and restful sleep.  For me, it is 100 times better than Ambien, which left me feeling exhausted when I awoke, and I struggled to get past the leg symptoms in order to fall asleep.  It's also better than Requip and Sinemet, which offered me little, or no relief.  I have no side effects and it has helped relieve the fatigue and pain of Fibromyalgia, too.

Clonazepam is the perfect medication for social an Clonazepam, the generic name for Klonopin and Rivotril, has been very effective for me. I have social anxiety disorder which manifested itself in excessive sweating in professional situations. As a lawyer, it's not good to have my dress shirt covered with sweat and my face dripping wet. This would often happen to me in professional situations with other lawyers, in court, or meetings with new clients. Not good. Would you want a lawyer who is sweating all over the place? I was desparate. I did the talk therapy which did absolutely nothing for me. My career was in jeoprardy, so I did my research, went on line and bought two medications: Clonazepam (2 mgs) to address the psychological issues and a beta blocker called Inderal (40 mgs) for the physical issues. This drug combination works EVERY time. An hour and a half before I have to be in Court or some high pressure meeting or some other public performance event, I pop my two pills and I'm ready to go. There's no more sweating and I have my career back. It's a good feeling knowing I can stay cool under fire. I don't take these meds every day, but only when I have to be in Court or some big meeting, etc. One can build up a tolerance to the clonazepam, so don't use it except when you need it. The little sucker works fast, and you can take it one or two hours before the event and you're golden. If you sweat in social or professional settings this drug combo will stop the problem fast, no doubt about it. I get a little tired about 6 or 7 hours after taking these meds, but that's no big deal. I've never come close to falling asleep driving or anything like that. Another side effect is once in a while I'll get the hiccups, which is weird, but they last a minute or so and then disappear. Trust me people, I've been there. I've sat at conference tables and sweated like a pig for hours and you can imagine the embrassment and distration of that. I couldn't think straight, and wou

Don''''t mix with alcohol I started clonazepam in March to help with insomnia and anxiety.  My psychiatrist prescribed it because at the time I was not drinking.  Unfortunately, the clonazepam worked so well with my anxiety that I started socializing much more and going out and drinking, a lot.  I ended up in some embarrassing situations while drunk and my psychiatrist took me off of the clonazepam because of it.  I feel more lucid off of it but I do so miss the nightly therapeutic effects of it and now I am back to my anti-social behavior.

Still Not Sure About Klonopin I am taking this twice a day due to significant anxiety and shakiness as I raised doseage of Prozac to 80 mgs.It does calm. However, it seems to put me in a funk for a few hours. Doesn't help my OCD. Seems to increase the ruminations.On the other hand, it does calm me and puts me out like a light at bedtime.I tried ativan a few times before going to Klonopin. Seemed to treat me better. My PDoc first suggested Xanax and I asked for Klonopin due to reading of addictive qualities of Xanax. However, I only plan to use the benzos until kick in of Prozac so I may go to Xanax as needed. I have nagged my Shrink about addiction rates to these drugs. He swears that concern is overrated. Says if you are responsible. Follow his prescription and are not an addictive personality, there should be no problem.UpdateAfter about a month I've found Klonopin to be a very good aid in reaching a steady state on ssri. I just switched from Prozac to Lexapro. I am glad Klonopin is available. Occasionally, I believe it can be paradoxical. Actually increase anxiety. But, that is rare. Most of the time a soothing friend.After two months I appreciate Klonopin even more. I have switched from Prozac (80mgs) to 20 mgs of Lexapro. Still have yet to have Lexapro kick in. Thus, still using Klonopin. I split a .5 mg pill and take that twice a day. Few instances of paradoxical anxiety. Find little need to up the dose. Helps me sleep like a baby. Love Klonopin.I'm going to ween off. More paradoxical episodes. Actually increases anxiety levels. Rapid heartbeat etc. I am also of the belief it creates depression. I take it before bed. Sleep well. But hate waking up. As the day goes along I feel better and better. I feel better (not fully there yet) with Lexapro alone.

A Godsend! I usually start feeling anxious when the sun goes down.  Weird, I know, but hey, what about me isn't? It completely stopped my nighttime panic attacks, I no longer feel &quot;jumpy&quot; when I'm in a room alone, it's been wonderful.  I also have Bipolar II Disorder and PTSD and it really helped for the PTSD.  I no longer think that there are people waiting for me to get in the shower to hurt me and my family.  I used to be afraid to have doors in the house that were half open because it made me feel like someone was inside watching me.  Now, it doesn't bother me at all.  For the Bipolar II Disorder, it's helped calm my mania when my meds stop working.  It calms me down until my new med can have a chance to take effect.The only side effects were when I first started taking them, it made me feel drunk.  Sometimes it's sedating enough to put me to sleep, which is fine as well because I also have insomnia.  My entire med cocktail includes Wellbutrin XL, Lamictal, Topamax and Klonopin.I love this stuff! The only thing I've noticed is that it's lost a little of it's effectiveness over time.  When I first started taking it, I was only taking 1/2 of a .50 mg tablet.  Now I'm up to a full .50 mg tablet + 1/2 tablet.  But I wouldn't trade this stuff for the world!

Poops out after long-term use 11/06 update: I can take 5mgs and not notice much of an effect! I take 2mgs at the same time just to take the edge off when I'm out in crowds, or it's Christmas-time and there's a lot going on that makes me a nervous wreck, lol. But they aren't doing a lot for me anymore. Of course, if I told my pdoc I EVER took 5 at a time, she'd have my head. I'm going to just stop taking them for a while and see if I can get any effect from them. If nothing, I'm going to ask for a different med. I'd advise to NOT take them very often - certainly not for sleeping. Just take them for those stressful or nerve-wracking times when you absolutely have to have them. Of course, meds have always pooped out of me.11/5/5-update: Because of anxiety, I am now taking 0.5mg up to 3x daily. I was in a near-miss car accident and that really messed me up. This year my son has more after-school activities, so I can't just come home. I find that makes me more anxious, so I need to take a klonopin to handle all the changes (I'm very schedule-oriented). So far, it is working fine. Of course, I'd like to take a larger dosage and feel numb, but I realize that isn't a good idea - it's just me liking to be over-medicated. However, I do recommend klonopin for anxiety - it works great. (I use the date started for when I began using 2x daily - prior to that, I used xanax.)I like this med for calming effect, however overuse can be addictive. I use it for manic episodes and during depressive episodes when I'm anxious. I also use it when I can't sleep. It's really a wonderful med, but you can easily like it too much and want to find excuses to take it every day. If you do, it will be less effective and you will need a larger dosage for it to be effective. I did that with xanax and that is why my pdoc put me on klonopin. Cost effectiveness is great as this drug runs under $10 for a month's worth - figures the addictive ones are the cheapest!

I'm going to just stop taking them for a while and see if I can get any effect from them. If nothing, I'm going to ask for a different med. I'd advise to NOT take them very often - certainly not for sleeping. Just take them for those stressful or nerve-wracking times when you absolutely have to have them. Of course, meds have always pooped out of me.11/5/5-update: Because of anxiety, I am now taking 0.5mg up to 3x daily. I was in a near-miss car accident and that really messed me up. This year my son has more after-school activities, so I can't just come home. I find that makes me more anxious, so I need to take a klonopin to handle all the changes (I'm very schedule-oriented). So far, it is working fine. Of course, I'd like to take a larger dosage and feel numb, but I realize that isn't a good idea - it's just me liking to be over-medicated. However, I do recommend klonopin for anxiety - it works great. (I use the date started for when I began using 2x daily - prior to that, I used xanax.)I like this med for calming effect, however overuse can be addictive. I use it for manic episodes and during depressive episodes when I'm anxious. I also use it when I can't sleep. It's really a wonderful med, but you can easily like it too much and want to find excuses to take it every day. If you do, it will be less effective and you will need a larger dosage for it to be effective. I did that with xanax and that is why my pdoc put me on klonopin. Cost effectiveness is great as this drug runs under $10 for a month's worth - figures the addictive ones are the cheapest!

Doctor Originally Prescribed Halcion, but I.... My doctor originally offered me Halcion for insomnia, but I had already done some research and found that Klonopin's third indication of use was insomia. Plus I have heard some crazy things in the news about Halcion. I chose Klonopin because I was also curious to see if it would help with my social and general anxiety. He agreed to prescribe this instead. It has worked well for me and hasn't been habit forming at all. I do need to dedicate 7-8 hour of sleep after taking or I'll be too sleepy to function for work etc. I believe this is the case with traditional sleeping medications as well.With the dose I am taking to achieve sleep, I find its' effects last long enough in my system that I feel less anxious the next day.  My mind races less while I am getting ready and driving to work, which is usually a problem. I am also able to deal with people a lot better.I do reccomend the brand name over generic. One time, after 6 months use, there was mistake filling the prescription and I had to take the generic. It was definitely less effective.  The only side effect to note for me is diarreah. That usually only occurs after I have skipped taking it for a few days and started again.If you have Blue Cross Blue Shield and you want the brand name covered, you will have to ask your doctor to petition your insurnace to cover it. This usually only takes a few days. The co-pay may be the hightest tiered, but you can get a 90-day supply through Blue Cross Mail Service Prescription Program with a single co-pay. So, instead of refilling monthly =($45 for me), I get a 3 monthly supply for $45.Feel free to drop me a note.

I''''d kiss the feet of the people who found this! I first took Klonopin early in my diagnosis and treatment, in my mid 20's.  With all my memory problems, I can still remember my response to my first does - I was in outpatient treatment, and not too long after taking it, I burst out &quot;My brain has shut up!&quot;  I used to have those constant cycling anxieties where my brain couldn't focus on one thing, because I'd get worried about 50 other things, related and non related.  It is the only medicine that never stopped working for me.  I tale .5 mg morning and night, and my Doctor prescribes more for me to use on an as needed basis.  Usually, when I have a bad panic attack (particularly my social phobia) or something just happened that will start off an attack, I take two pills, and wait 1/2 hour.  I'm either much better, or I take a 3rd pill, and that pretty much does the trick.  I've never become resistant to it, or dependant on it, and it also helps with my ubelievably bad insomnia.  I've been on more psych meds that I can remember (including ativan, which didn't do crap for me), and this is still my wonder drug.  The only problem I've ever had was not being able to take it the night or morning before ECT treatments, but I'd just take it in the early evening in the day before, and right after my treatments in the morning.  I swear by this stuff!!!As for social phobia, I often have it so bad that I can't even talk on the phone, except with my husband or mother, and not always even then, and I have gone weeks without leaving home at all.  I also have a symptom where I can't stand to be touched - it it physically repulsive to me, and can't even have people to close to me - this is particular hard on my 10 year old daughter.  But, a little PRN Klonopin usually does the trick, at least lowering my symptoms.  I would recommend this to every- and any-one!

Weird cold/ringing noise when I move my eyes about I have used klonapin before and it has always been good for me, it is smoother that xanax. Valium is much more mellow and relaxing however.Odd thing is that the 2 times over the past 2 years I get a weird ringing AND VERY annoying sensation when I move my eyes about. Try reading from word to word on a page and each time you dart your eyes over you get a ringing noise with a cold chill that feels like a frozen dog tag chain being dragged quickly around your head. It is driving me nutz, so I gave all my klonopin to another person with a prescription.It stinks cuz I have a lot of anxiety right now. Xanax has been kinder and I usually hated the couding effect of xanax. I don't know if this effect of the ringing is being caused by the klonopin but considering it started occuring when I woke up the day after taking my first pill...... I am also on lamictal and 5htp and somtimes SAM-e. But the first time I got this sensation a few years back I was on none of these. It is a yucking experiance that makes you want to just smash things. Oh and driving? all the eye work and movements? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!Oh well I hope it wear soff soon. This is just so odd cuz I never get this sesation at all unless I use a med like this. Usually I am just fine with it. I only take it maybe 1 month a year.

Not bad at all I have tried Zoloft and Xanax for my anxiety.  THe zoloft did nothing and the Xanax is too habit forming.  The Klonopin was the best for effectiveness because it lasted much longer and I didn't have to take as much.

Changed my life I take two with one wellbutrin in the morning and two before bed at night.I have never felt better but it's scary to think of the side effects of going off them and I don't want to be on meds all of my life.  Also, agree, I started with only one a day and only 2 months later I need at least 4 so thank god for insurance!

Clonazepam has worked for me Clonazepam has been very effective for me.  I have panic disorder all my life and didn't know what it was.  It is nice to feel the sky is the limit with no fear.  I do take 20 ml of Lexapro but I don't think it would work as well without the benzo.

Excellent Yes it works for me at bedtime and there are no side effects as long as I have at least 6 hours of sleep.  What I like is that they are chewable, therefore get into your system faster and I can get to sleep faster.

Wish it still worked as well as it used to... I was started on this after a bad mix of Lexapro and Valium. Great drug, it made the panic completely stop for awhile. No real side effects, some dizziness and sleepiness to begin with. May or may not have increased my depression. It has been four months now and in that time I've panicked out maybe twice a month. &quot;Normal&quot; anxiety has started to return. *sigh*

Good med but be very careful of addiction! Despite my past history with abusing pain meds a psyc I started seeing in New Orleans started me on Clonazepam 1mg at night. This was less than a month before Hurricane Katrina destroyed our house and most of our possesitions. My wife and I were living with my mother for months afterward and I tricked an Internist into 3mg/day prescription which I was on for eight months. In hindsight, memory goes down the drain at this dosage...at least for me and I am 6&quot;-2&quot; and 230 lbs. I was on this dosage when my new psyc said it was not good for long term use.

klonopin	Bipolar I disorder	2006-11-16 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	4.0	4.5	Good med but be very careful of addiction! Despite my past history with abusing pain meds a psyc I started seeing in New Orleans started me on Clonazepam 1mg at night. This was less than a month before Hurricane Katrina destroyed our house and most of our possesitions. My wife and I were living with my mother for months afterward and I tricked an Internist into 3mg/day prescription which I was on for eight months. In hindsight, memory goes down the drain at this dosage...at least for me and I am 6&quot;-2&quot; and 230 lbs. I was on this dosage when my new psyc said it was not good for long term use.

Good short term OCD stablizer For extreme OCD attacks this drug does the trick by greatly calming down the mind and anxiety levels. However, this drug wont help OCD long term that much but great little clean drug for those emergency momements.

Klonopin and Weight Gain I take .75 mg. of Klonopin a day for panic attacks.  I also take Zyprexa and Lithium for Bipolar I disorder.  I had also taken Prozac for a year.  The Klonopin definitely helped my panic attacks as they have ceased.  However, I am still working on my highway phobia which is where the panic attacks would appear.  I almost have the phobia conquered.  I gained 54 pounds being on all of the above-mentioned drugs, so it's hard to pinpoint the culprit or it could be a combination of drugs.  In any event, I am happy to report that I've lost 40 of the 54 pounds that I had gained.  I still take Klonopin and I've been able to lose the weight through diet and exercise.

i love this med Klonopin--I swear by.  I've been taking .5 mg Klonopin for about 3 years now to help me sleep.  Only thing is after time you have to take a little more here and there for there to be any reduction in anxiety.  Now i'm up to 1 mg three times a day, still prescribed in  .5 mg tablets b/c my pdoc doesn't want to increase the mg dosage.  It does make me a little drowsy but something I welcome b/c I can become so hyper w/o it.  I can tell when its wearing off b/c my body gets so cold and my hands and feet feel like ice.  I get inner restlessness and I just start talking up a storm, chattering on about anything.  Even though Klonopin can reduce impulse control, says my pdoc, he lets me on it b/c its worked for my anxiety (and its probably one of the only drugs i haven't complained about!).  I don't have a dependency on it and I don't abuse it.  I guess there is no addictive personality here.  I can see how it can be abused so I would recommend if anyone has any addictive issues to stay away from Klonopin, but that's just my opinion.  My hat is off to the inventor of Klonopin--its stuck by me for this long! **update**I've had my dosage increased to 4mg. a day.  I'm supposed to take 2mg at bedtime but usually take 1.5mg in case I need an extra .5mg somewhere in the day for anxiety.  Did overdose on it once and went to the ER.  Took 10mg. which wouldn't have killed me but the ER doc said that b/c my pulse reached 39 I could have &quot;coded&quot;.  I was so afraid my pdoc would take me off this med b/c of the od.  He didn't and I have a greater appreciation for not overdosing on a medication that works when the other 23 I've tried haven't!!

Rarely need Klonopin anymore Another update!!I have seen a wonderful doctor in New York and with her help, I have been able to reduce my Lexapro intake to 2.5 mgs!!!!  WOW is all I can say.  After 7 years of being on antidepressants, I am so happy that I am almost off of this synthetic, toxic drug!! This Dr ran a few tests on me and discovered my thyroid, adrenal glands, and cerebellum were all not working properly; these all play a major function in controlling the nervous system and thus, I was suffering from severe anxiety.  Blood tests never showed any of this as your blood is the last area of the body for symptoms of diseases to present themselves.  I now am taking food supplements which has helped TREMENDOUSLY - more than antidepressants or benzos ever could!!!  The premise behind this school of thought is that our bodies our continuing to suffer from nutritional deficiecies due to an increase in environemental toxins, consumption of fast food, highly processed food, and non organic food, along with the use of ANY synthetic drugs.  Yes, it souns almost too simple, but that is the way it should be.  The answer isn't that complicated - instead of giving my body a drug to mask symptoms, I actually take supplements that treat the symptoms.  The brand is Standard Process and can only be purchased through a licensed health care provider.   For those of you out there who are interested in treating anxiety without drugs, this is possible.  I had tried several times to get off of the SSRI's and each time, I would &quot;relapse&quot; with extreme anxiety and panic attacks and had to up the dose back to normal.  Now I am almost off of SSRI's and feel great!!  Also, for those of you who don't know this, when you are told that your neurotransmitters including seratonin, dopamine, and neuropenephrine are low and that is causing your anxiety, please remember that this is only a THEORY and has NEVER been proven.

IN ''04 COMBINED W/ WELLBUTRIN WORKS OKAY. I have found that I am now house-bound once again. Even though I'm on medication.

My younger brother was so supportive,and held my hand and hugged me when I needed it the most.Then October, my dog, well, she is 12 yrs old now. very old for a Boxer.And got very sick while I was gone in late August. Now, I find myself listening to her eyes and hugging her more than ever. It helps me so much to know that we have 12 happy yrs together and i hope and pray for another 6 months. I hope! We still go for small walks and she is my &quot;Happy, Happy Baby Boxer&quot; when we come in for a cookie. She smiles at me and prances her front feet 3 times &amp; then lies down for a nap. I snuggle on the floor next to her and wait for her to start snoring. She seems to like me snuggling with her,even if I am on part of her bed. My daughter's cat and I have become better friends when she moved out late October. That one hurt too. But, children grow up and off to college, just like I did. So I'm trying very hard to except it.

VERY effective Benzo 4 SP Clonazepam is a life saver for Social Phobia &amp; GAD, compared to Alprazolam,Diazepam. I take it twice daily &amp; prn when needed the initial drowsiness wears off after about 2 weeks. I find the dispersable/wafers best because the effects happen within 5-10 mins. With Nardil at No.1 for SP, Clonazepam comes close 2nd. Yeah I have read about adiction / tolerance but it doesnt have any negative side effects ! If you want more information do a Google search for &quot;Social Fear&quot; &amp; have a read what the experts say. Peronally I think its great......

Make me feel depressed...SOLIAN is much better ! I used Clonazepam for several months but it increase depression and felt very drowsy. I didn't like it at all.I started SOLIAN (Amisulpride) 50mg for my dystimia and social phobia disorder. It works great. I feel calmed, my mild depression has been diminished 90%, feel motivated and most of my symptoms went away. After trying many treatments SOLIAN finally works for me. Almost no side effects. I am complementing with Lamictal 50mg to get better antidepresant results with no side effects as I used to get with SSRI's and Klonopin.It can be ordered overseas at pharmacia Cerati in Italy (info@farmaciacerati.it). Unfortunally is not approved by the FDA...

Best used as needed. After begging my neurologist to prescribe Klonazepam, upon hearing from the National CFIDS Foundation that it was one of the more effective treatments for many Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients, the doctor finally wrote me a prescription. He did warn me, however, to not take the medication if I felt I could fall asleep naturally, such as when extremely tired. Klonazepam allowed me to get the best sleep since I have contracted Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, but upon learning that a tolerance is built up eventually, I have restricted myself to take the medication only when absolutely necessary - as in when I simply cannot fall asleep after a few hours in bed. My current plan is to take it on an as-needed basis, such as before I have to make a critical presentation in front of people.

My current plan is to take it on an as-needed basis, such as before I have to make a critical presentation in front of people.

Helpful I don't have any side effects og this medication, which I take with my antideppression med Effexor 450 mg a day. I take it at night. But I still at times have panic attacks. I just deal with them because I'm already taking a over amount of antidepressant and 1 mg of Klonopin. I don't want to add anymore. It works most the time and I'm happy with that.

FINALLY. It rids me of my agoraphobia, panic attacks, and depersonalization. The effects on the depersonalization were subtle, I didn't notice an improvement the first time I took it, but as I take it (One tablet at night, one half in the day) my depersonalization is, for the most part, gone.The main side effect I have noticed is constipation, which seems to be improving. I have also been getting dizzy in the evenings, but I am not sure if this is attributed to Klonopin.This along with Geodon has allowed me to feel like myself again.

VERY effective Benzo 4 SP Clonazepam is a life saver for Social Phobia &amp; GAD, compared to Alprazolam,Diazepam. I take it twice daily &amp; prn when needed the initial drowsiness wears off after about 2 weeks. I find the dispersable/wafers best because the effects happen within 5-10 mins. With Nardil at No.1 for SP, Clonazepam comes close 2nd. Yeah I have read about adiction / tolerance but it doesnt have any negative side effects ! If you want more information do a Google search for &quot;Social Fear&quot; &amp; have a read what the experts say. Peronally I think its great......

Make me feel depressed...SOLIAN is much better ! I used Clonazepam for several months but it increase depression and felt very drowsy. I didn't like it at all.I started SOLIAN (Amisulpride) 50mg for my dystimia and social phobia disorder. It works great. I feel calmed, my mild depression has been diminished 90%, feel motivated and most of my symptoms went away. After trying many treatments SOLIAN finally works for me. Almost no side effects. I am complementing with Lamictal 50mg to get better antidepresant results with no side effects as I used to get with SSRI's and Klonopin.It can be ordered overseas at pharmacia Cerati in Italy (info@farmaciacerati.it). Unfortunally is not approved by the FDA...

Best used as needed. After begging my neurologist to prescribe Klonazepam, upon hearing from the National CFIDS Foundation that it was one of the more effective treatments for many Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients, the doctor finally wrote me a prescription. He did warn me, however, to not take the medication if I felt I could fall asleep naturally, such as when extremely tired. Klonazepam allowed me to get the best sleep since I have contracted Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, but upon learning that a tolerance is built up eventually, I have restricted myself to take the medication only when absolutely necessary - as in when I simply cannot fall asleep after a few hours in bed. My current plan is to take it on an as-needed basis, such as before I have to make a critical presentation in front of people.

Helpful I don't have any side effects og this medication, which I take with my antideppression med Effexor 450 mg a day. I take it at night. But I still at times have panic attacks. I just deal with them because I'm already taking a over amount of antidepressant and 1 mg of Klonopin. I don't want to add anymore. It works most the time and I'm happy with that.

FINALLY. It rids me of my agoraphobia, panic attacks, and depersonalization. The effects on the depersonalization were subtle, I didn't notice an improvement the first time I took it, but as I take it (One tablet at night, one half in the day) my depersonalization is, for the most part, gone.The main side effect I have noticed is constipation, which seems to be improving. I have also been getting dizzy in the evenings, but I am not sure if this is attributed to Klonopin.This along with Geodon has allowed me to feel like myself again.

Works excellent for general panic Clonezepam works very well for me. I have taken it for years and am not worried about addiction because I'll take it for the rest of my life, although I cannot go to county mental health agencies for my bipolar meds because they will not prescribe clonezepam. I still can't speak in front of groups and I still have somewhat of a social phobia, but those are part of me and I accept that they will never go away. Clonezepam has helped me make my life more stable.

very effective, but physically addictive Xanax knocked me out, but clonazepam has reduced anxiety significantly without making me drowsy.  I've read that a person can develop a tolerance, but I've taken this for 2 years without having to up my dosage.  When I have an important court case, a full .5 mg is enough to keep my anxiety from flaring too high (or 1.0 if it's a really big case).  Those are actually low doses.  However, about a year ago, I tried to taper off clonazepam over the course of about 6 weeks.  This was not nearly long enough, apparently, as I experienced intense anxiety to the point where I felt like I was coming apart.  I finally just re-continued my normal treatment, which I wanted to do anyway (it was my psychiatrist who thought I might discontinue it).  So, despite being very helpful for me, I'm not looking forward to the day I discontinue this drug.  I've read that discontinuance can take months of tapering off.

It Works Well, but at the Cost of Other Things I have been taking Klonopin for a while now. It helped my social/general Anxiety a lot. Taking it before bed is nice because of the deep sleep I got.  There are some very bothersome side effects though:-Decreased ability to remember things-Decreased sexual performance/drive-Respitory issues (I cough a lot because of trapped mucous in my throat)-Feeling colder than normal-More likely to partake in a negative activityIt works well for the Anxiety, but at a cost. The side effects are bothersome and it is additive over time.

Helped anxiety but ANNOYING witdawl symptoms I was instructed to take 1mg every night before bed to help me sleep better and to control anxiety.  I found that at the beginning (first week), that I was a bit groggy in the morning and also a bit uncoordinated (clumsy legs, offbalance like I was drunk).  I DID sleep like a baby though.Aftet the first week, the drug doesn't really help me with sleep by making me drowsy but I feel relaxed and fall asleep more readily.During the days, I find that I am SUPER productive at work now that I'm on Clonazepam.  Work was the main source of stress (I'm a grad student) and now that I have my anxiety under control, my work is running smoothly (which in turn lowers my anxiety further).  I anticipate being weaned off the drug in about a month or so slowly (I'll half the dosage and then quarter it...).  Hopefully by that time I will be functioning NORMALLY at work without the need for Clonazepam.  It's getting me through some tougher times right now............NEW:  I've weaned myself down from 1mg/eve down to 0.5mg/eve + 0.5mg/day, down to 0.5mg eve only, down to 0.25mg/eve + 0.25mg/day, down to 0.25mg/eve and finally I am totally off of it.HOWEVER:  It's been about 4 days since I've been off of Clonazepam and I have blurry vision, tense muscles and tension headaches as side effects of withdrawl and I was CAREFUL with the weaning process!!  I can only imagine what this would be like if I had simply just stopped taking the pills at the end of my perscription!!  (also, my Dr. didn't even warn me of the possible pitfalls of stopping the medication too quickly!).  The most ANNOYING withdrawl symptom is that I have non-painful muscle spasms all over my body if I am in a relaxed position (not walking or doing something).I'd just like to send out the following message to those considering Clonazepam:1.  It works for general anxiety but weigh your options.  Ask yourself if you can get through this tough time WI

Helpful for short term, worried about addiction I didn't want to use this, but it is assisting me in facing certain situations and my startle response has decreased enormously too. My concern is with addiction, so I'm hoping that one of the SSRIs will help and I can come off clonazepam. Currrently using it in conjunction with Prozac and am feeling better than I have in two years.

it was a godsend i have panic disorder as well as periodic depression.  the panic disorder came on suddenly and severely 20 years ago; i had every symptom in the book, and no amount of therapy changed it.  my psych doc had me on xanax for about 8 months, but i kept plateauing and we had to stop upping the dose.   she then put me on the old antidepressant desipramine (this was 1985), which was a long and absolute horror show to get on (much worse before i was better), but it did help a lot, for a few years.   too many bad side effects, though.   after that, nothing really helped and i continued to suffer bad attacks until a new psych doc put me on klonopin.  what a relief!!!   it has controlled the panic like nothing else -- it really changed my life.   occasionally i try to go off of it, but the panic returns, and so i pretty much think at this point that i'm a lifer.   that's ok with me, because i have no attacks.   i know it's sedating (that's the point), so i had to adjust to having a bit less energy, but i've accepted it and work with that in other ways (such as exercise/walking). the cost is definitely right; it costs practically nothing at my medical center's pharmacy (other pharmacies are making a killing off this drug -- they charge way more because it's cheap to begin with and they can get away with it).  anyway, i don't know where i'd be without this med.   i feel very lucky to have it.

Works GREAT, ALWAYS!! This is truly a miracle drug.  I take it twice a day, as needed (which is less and less, as it clears my head enough to work through the anxiety).  It helped with agoraphobia, shyness, claustrophobia, nervousness, and irritablity, as well as my inability to sleep due to panic worsening at night.  I am guaranteed to function if I take this medication 40 minutes prior to the event I need help getting through, and it even calms me down if I start freaking out, or flipping out on my spouse or in a social situation.  Just knowing I have them helps me function.

This drug worked great for me.. But watch out!! This drug worked great for my insomnia, and actually gave me peace in life again thanks to some much needed sleep. However I really didn't know what I was in for when I was tapering off this medication. I tapered slower than recommended and began a 6 month long battle to get off this medication. Had to be hospitalized in a detox center, and thats when I found out that this medication is more addicting than heroin (GO FIGURE). I wish I was told about this before going on it, because I actually ended up right back where I started because there is no way you can sleep through the withdrawals. Nothing like being at work and you have the &quot;junky itch.&quot; This drug also never worked for me again after I came off of it, which I was told is the case usually with long term use. I never built a tolerance to it, my life had evened out and was ready to live life without sleeping medication. It's a great medication if you need it, but plan on tapering over a year period of time otherwise start doing research on detox centers.

side effects the next morning outweigh benefits   I had been suffering from RLS for many years before I sought treatment.  I noticed that the problem seemed to worsen with stress/anxiety.  I finally mentioned what was happening to me at night when I was trying to sleep to my psychiatrist.  She diagnosed it as RLS, which I had never heard of before!  All along I thought is was either a potassium or calcium deficiency.  Not only were my nights total hell with the constant need to move or massage my legs to alleviate the pain, but I was keeping my boyfriend awake as well because of all the commotion!  My psychiatrist prescribed a low dose of Klonopin, to take at night as needed.  The Klonopin completely relieved the burning, crampy, electric-shock type pain in my calves and feet immediately and put me to sleep through the night!  However, the next day I felt profoundly groggy and fatigued and was almost unable to get out of bed!  So, I only took the Klonopin when I absolutely had to get relief and rest.  I only ended up taking it for about a month and a half, never finished the bottle of 10 pills!  We also tried Xanax, which I had for when traveling by airplane.  It worked well for a few hours at night, but still felt groggy the next morning.  I was prescribed Mirapex by my internist, which knocked me out for about two days!  No thanks.  Bummer.

However, the next day I felt profoundly groggy and fatigued and was almost unable to get out of bed!  So, I only took the Klonopin when I absolutely had to get relief and rest.  I only ended up taking it for about a month and a half, never finished the bottle of 10 pills!  We also tried Xanax, which I had for when traveling by airplane.  It worked well for a few hours at night, but still felt groggy the next morning.  I was prescribed Mirapex by my internist, which knocked me out for about two days!  No thanks.  Bummer.

side effects the next morning outweigh benefits   I had been suffering from RLS for many years before I sought treatment.  I noticed that the problem seemed to worsen with stress/anxiety.  I finally mentioned what was happening to me at night when I was trying to sleep to my psychiatrist.  She diagnosed it as RLS, which I had never heard of before!  All along I thought is was either a potassium or calcium deficiency.  Not only were my nights total hell with the constant need to move or massage my legs to alleviate the pain, but I was keeping my boyfriend awake as well because of all the commotion!

life saver I have been suffering for a couple of years with major anxiety. I take cipralex for my depression and it works great but, the anxiety has been quite unmanagable. I tried ativan for a while but, when it ran out I didn't bother getting it again. About 3 months went by and I finally went back to my physician and she recommended Klonopin. I have to say that this drug, so far, has given me my life back. One may not know from the outside that I suffer so badly from anxiety but, on the inside, normally, my mind is in constant worry state. This drug has stopped that. I feel like I have my creativity and thought and overall quality of &quot;inner life&quot; back. The other good side effect is that now that I have reduced &quot;inner anxiety&quot;, my sex drive has come back! YAY!

Klonopin works great. I use it only for a sleep aid at bedtime and it also helps with anxiety during the daytime. I only take it at night so it must have a long half life. A little sleepy in the mornings but not too bad.

I Hate It!!! I have had weight gain, palpitations, and all kinds of problems.  They have tried to take me off of it several times because I started on Klonopin and I can't come completely off of it without seizures.  Now doctor wants to raise the level again but scared and sick and tired of it all! I hate the drug!!!!

Takes the anxiety off almost like magic I use 0.5 to 1 mg before bedtime once in a while, especially when I have something stressfull to do the following morning, like teaching a difficult university class or presenting research results in congresses and so on. It takes the anxiety off like magic. I got used to it and don't feel sleepy or groggy anymore. What I like the most about it is I don't have to use it everyday like antidepressants. Only downside is it causes dependance and shouldnt be used everyday for more than a few months.

Improves general anxiety and improves productivity I was instructed to take 1mg every night before bed to help me sleep better and to control anxiety.  I found that at the beginning (first week), that I was a bit groggy in the morning and also a bit uncoordinated (clumsy legs, offbalance like I was drunk).  I DID sleep like a baby though.Aftet the first week, the drug doesn't really help me with sleep by making me drowsy but I feel relaxed and fall asleep more readily.During the days, I find that I am SUPER productive at work now that I'm on Clonazepam.  Work was the main source of stress (I'm a grad student) and now that I have my anxiety under control, my work is running smoothly (which in turn lowers my anxiety further).  I anticipate being weaned off the drug in about a month or so slowly (I'll half the dosage and then quarter it...).  Hopefully by that time I will be functioning NORMALLY at work without the need for Clonazepam.  It's getting me through some tougher times right now...

No Detectable Effect I've been prescribed Klonopin several times.  I don't bother arguing with the doctor anymore as they simply refuse to believe that I find it has no effect at all.  I might as well be taking a sugar tablet--actually, sugar might have more of an effect.I know research shows this is an effective medication, so it must work for many people.  Alas, I'm not one of them.  Xanax, on the other hand, actually does work for me--and it works extremely well (better even than it's supposed to, I think).  I don't get 'high', but my anxiety is relieved.  And while I also never have a withdrawal problem with either Klonopin or Xanax, since my doctors both refuse to prescribe Xanax and are suspicious of anyone who asks for it, I'm left basically to wait for time to bring about an improvement.  Fortunately it does, but I endure months of distress.  I should perhaps look for other doctors, if only to find other options, but, well, that's another story.Since it does work for some; definitely try it.  But don't think it's all in your head if it doesn't work for you.

Makes me feel calm and happy at times... Klonipin is an interesting drug.  When I first started taking it, the drug would actually not only decrease depression, it would help with all forms of anxiety, and even make me feel kind of jocular.  In other words, it made me want to joke around, be playful and have fun with friends.  These feelings would last for about 12 hours or so.  I did notice that taking the drug every day would eventually cause it to lose its effectiveness and I would have to increase the dose to 1 mg per day.  I didn't want to go that route; the last thing I want is to develop an addiction.  I would stop taking klonipin for a week or two and then use it again.  This seemed to work reasonably well.  Klonipin is one of those drugs that has immediate effects and with many of these types of drugs you need to use them cautiously and perhaps even take a break from them for awhile.  For me, Klonipin at .5mg helps with anxiety, some forms of depression and OCD.

The best for anxiety I have tried Xanax, Ativan, and Klonopin for anxiety. Xanax makes ya feel pretty damn good but for only a short period of time and u need to keep popping them. Also seem to be very easy to build up a tolerance to. Good drug if u just want to unwind for a short period of time on occasion. Ativan was not as effective as Xanax but was longer lasting. Klonopin is excellent beacuse it relaxes you and u don't have to keep popping pills all the time. Keeps you stable without ups nad downs if u are going through an extended period of stress/anxiety. Definitly the way to go for chronic sufferers of anxiety. I hope to stop taking this relatively soon once my life is more stable.Still effective and still loving it!

Pretty Good - sorry for format and grammar I tried Ativan at first for my anxiety but it only lasted about 4 or 5 hours, so i switched to Klonopin from reading reviews on this website. I admite it knocked me out the first month i took it, not so much that i was about to fall asleep but if i wanted to i could fall asleep in about 2 minutes, but was really effective for my anxiety, the first few days i tried it i acted kind of goofy around my friends and laughed a lot like i was high but got used to it fast. I went to a clinic and the doc gave it to me, after completing a program there i went back to the doc i was seeing which i had only seen twice and when i asked her to up my dosage to 2mg a day she protested and by the way I was started on 1mg once a day, which I got used to in the first month. Well long story short, she wanted me to be on zoloft with it no matter what, she said i would get addicted because i was already on it for 2 months. I explained to her after the clinic i didnt take the med for 2 weeks because i wanted the previous doc to change the dosage to 2mg but she was on vacaction. Anyway she wouldnt listen so we fought and i told her i wasnt coming back to see her. When i told her i didnt want the sexual side effects of SSRI's, she told me &quot;well theres always viagra&quot;.... I was like umm im 20 years old, are you nuts? Anyway I love this stuff but i get used to meds fast, so in the mean time im getting my stepfather to write the presciption for me until i see a new doc. Right now i feel like the 2mg isnt enough for me and isnt lasting 10 hours like it did before. Sigh, i hate developing tolerance. I go to school with spaced out classes so I really do need something longer than 10 hours i think or maybe 2mg twice a day, i just dont want to become addicted even though i know im not right now, i just keep reading the BS that people say even though ive read its not true. Well see.

It helps some It helped for awhile.  Then I needed to add another medication.  If I don't take both of them, I can't sleep.

positive I take it with lexapro. I've recently stepped up from 1mg to 1.5mg. Sleep is better. My daily work is with data input requiring consentration. I also arbitrate issues between car dealers buying wholesale cars online.  This produces anxiety in me and clonazepam is a life saver. I am a little sleepy but able to push through it.  The increased ability to focus is well worth drowsyness.  Anyway, after years of anxiety, I find it a nice change.

Sugar pills Klonopin, a drug that is sometimes prescribed for mania, is a long-acting benzodiazepine.  I was hopeful that it would help my anxiety.  However 0.5mg did absolutely nothing, and did not even make me tired.  I tried 1 mg and it did absolutely nothing for my anxiety, but did make it hard for me to keep my balance while standing and walking.

Clonazepam saved my sanity Clonazepam works for me within 10-15 minutes.  A whole tablet (.5 mg.) doesn't zonk me out unless I'm extremely tired to begin with.  Most of the time, a half tablet (.25 mg.) is all I need.  I take it about 30 minutes before going to bed every night because the anxiety affects me most when I try to fall asleep.  It does make it harder to get up in the morning, but I don't have to be up with my kids at 6:00 any more.  I make sure to carry several half tablets in my purse just in case the anxiety hits during the day, which it sometimes does.  Clonazepam doesn't make me loopy or otherwise prevent me from driving, but everyone is different.

Perfect! Panic disorder along with General anxiety I started having anxiety problems in my late teens. For many years we never heard of GAD or panic attacks. I finally read a book called from SAD To GLAD by pioneer Psychopharmocolgist Nathan Kline MD. It was mainly about depression and its treatment in its beginning and up to that present time (1970or so). 2 medications seemed most helpful up that time. They were imipramine and Phenelzine a MAOI. Nardil(phenelzine is still probably the most effective of all treatment for panic disorder along with its precipitory anxiety. But side effects were abundunt.Bigtime weight gain, drowziness, and insomnia. Also being a MAOI you were somewhat restricted as far as food types and especially had to be careful with drug interactions that could be lethat.Klonipin which is the strongist of all long acting benzoazipens works smoothly . Just drowziness which you adjust to quickly. I have been taking it for 20 years and all things being said it is the single most important med I take. I am no anxious anymore unless there is good reason to be. Isn't that what we are looking for? Along with low side effect profile I would imagine it will be a very popular medication for a long time to come.Jasper91

Effective for deep anxiety and panic I use on an as needed basis to supplement Lexapro which I take on a daily basis. I use Klonopin probably once or twice every  6 months. It is very effective for anxiety for me, even the panic attacks that I experienced before starting Lexapro. Other than dry mouth, I have not noticed any side effects.

i like taking it - it eases the anxiety attacks. but only after using for 5 months, i have grown very tolerent of this medication and my doctor has to up my dosage and the strength of it.  He wants to add lexapro, I am afraid of taking another medication.  I really dont think i will take the lexapro. As far as the clonazepam, I have no side effects at all.

Excellent!!!!! Whoever said that klonopin doesnt help depression doesnt know what they were talking about. I was on this from 1997-2005 with no known side effects.  Recently I had another bout with clinical depression in May of 2006.  I was put on klonopin again and once again it helped me immensely.  I highly recommend this medication.  I know that klonopin is an anti seziure drug but it also helps clinical depression and anxiety. I believe this will help many.

Klonopin Works Great!!! I started taking Klonopin to not only help me with anxiety, but also to get to sleep at night.

Works for me - but you may also use a bar of soap Klonopin works fine for me with minimal side effects - just don't take after midnight if you must get up before 11 AM.  I entered a treatment suggestion for those interested in the treatment suggestion place.  It is a plain everyday bar of soap down around your legs in bed with you at night.  Once you stop laughing, get up your nerve and try it.  It WORKS!  I found, unlike others I have suggested this to, that after 8 nights my ankles. knees and hips were painful/heavy in the moring, (much more so than usual), and wondered if it had to do with the soap.  Switched back to the Klonopin, in 3 nights all heaviness/pain in ankles, knees, and hips was gone. This pain/heaviness did not occur for others trying the method, only me.  This is a super CHEAP, SAFE way for someone who can not pay for this drug to get help with RLS.  Please before you decide I am just nuts, try it.  Even my pharmacist had to admit it worked - just can't figure out my pain problems with the soap - open to suggestions.  Best of luck.

Not For Regular Use - if you can avoid it I use Klonopin occassionally to help break me from a particularly persistent pattern of interrupted sleep (e.g., I'm waking consistently after 3 hours of sleep and unable to fall back asleep) and also to help relax my muscles (e.g., the other day I had a severe tension headache, which I never get--I actually called the doctor to see if I should be worried over my symptoms) and the Klonopin helped me relax and knock out the tension headache.  I find that if I use it more than once every couple of weeks, it loses its effectiveness as a sleep cycle disrupter (disrupter in a good way).  Also, my doctor once prescribed a very low does of Ativan for sleep and it only took about six months for me to develop a noticeable addiction.  I began having anxiety attacks (something I rarely had back then even though I sometimes experienced general anxiety) at night right before I was supposed to take a dose.  When I figured out that the Ativan was the cause of the anxiety attacks, that freaked me out and I stopped taking it cold turkey (don't do this at home--I didn't know any better at the time and the result could have been disasterous), which was one of the worst three-week periods of my entire life (emotionally speaking).  Also, I found that this class of drugs heightened (or is that lowered) the depression I felt with PMS...if fact, I felt suicidal right before my period, which had never been the case before.  At any rate, being sensitive to drugs, this class of drugs is not a daily solution for sleep difficulties for me nor is it a long-term solution to generalized anxiety (which I now experience).

klonopin	Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)	2006-09-04 00:00:00		2.0	0.0	3.5	2.0	Not For Regular Use - if you can avoid it I use Klonopin occassionally to help break me from a particularly persistent pattern of interrupted sleep (e.g., I'm waking consistently after 3 hours of sleep and unable to fall back asleep) and also to help relax my muscles (e.g., the other day I had a severe tension headache, which I never get--I actually called the doctor to see if I should be worried over my symptoms) and the Klonopin helped me relax and knock out the tension headache.  I find that if I use it more than once every couple of weeks, it loses its effectiveness as a sleep cycle disrupter (disrupter in a good way).  Also, my doctor once prescribed a very low does of Ativan for sleep and it only took about six months for me to develop a noticeable addiction.

Long time with this drug Well,Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine and you are not supposed to use those for more than three months because you get addicted but when i started taking it, it was like i was reborn . Beore that i suffered from anxiety which was manifested as  fast heartbeat, apetite problems, strange pressure in my head and somewhat of a depression. The minute i started taking this drug everything was gone. I was happy again, living normally just like everyone else. Sedation is a problem at first but it goes away after a while. As much as i hate this drug now cuase i'm addicted to it, i must say that it helps me lead a normal life. The problem is tolerance, which means that after a while you have to increase the dosage to get the desired effect. At first i was on 1mg divided into 2 daily doses, now it just dont cut it although i try not to increase the dosage. If you're getting off this drug dont do it quick cause you may suffer convulsions. Cut down the doasages gradually untill you dont feel the need to take it anymore.

Perfect! Panic disorder along with General anxiety I started having anxiety problems in my late teens. For many years we never heard of GAD or panic attacks. I finally read a book called from SAD To GLAD by pioneer Psychopharmocolgist Nathan Kline MD. It was mainly about depression and its treatment in its beginning and up to that present time (1970or so). 2 medications seemed most helpful up that time. They were imipramine and Phenelzine a MAOI. Nardil(phenelzine is still probably the most effective of all treatment for panic disorder along with its precipitory anxiety. But side effects were abundunt.Bigtime weight gain, drowziness, and insomnia. Also being a MAOI you were somewhat restricted as far as food types and especially had to be careful with drug interactions that could be lethat.Klonipin which is the strongist of all long acting benzoazipens works smoothly . Just drowziness which you adjust to quickly. I have been taking it for 20 years and all things being said it is the single most important med I take. I am no anxious anymore unless there is good reason to be. Isn't that what we are looking for? Along with low side effect profile I would imagine it will be a very popular medication for a long time to come.Jasper91

Klonopin a sugar pill Klonopin was 100% ineffective in treating my GAD and also, a very dangerous med because of a fine line of an overdose. Also, Klonopin has a very narrow range of dosage options.The only effective treatment in studies going back in 1997(UK) and my experience to date is Tranxene(benzo)as the most effective treatment for GAD. I have been on it for at least 15 years and found no other medication effective beside Tranxene, despite the USA's belief it is addictive(wrong)and considered an &quot;old school&quot; med which is irrelevant because &quot;old school&quot; meds are still considered meds and still available and going back to the old days might be more of an option for patients and instead of falling into the realm that I consider with all psychiatrist,,,for every psychiatrist there is a different opinion, and getting stuck with docs that rely only on the newer meds which in my experience has been ineffective for me as a patient. My best doctors have been those that still use all available meds including &quot;old school&quot; meds(eg. the tricyclics) and not falling into the trap of the newer meds as the best.

Discontinuing klonopin feels like heroin would. I've never used illegal drugs, but my doctor(s) gave me vicodin, then oxycontin, then methadone and xanax, then i had to go find buprenorphine myself to get off the methadone, then they put me on tramadol and ambien and klonopin and cymbalta and then lexapro, then why i tried to get off the klonopin they gave me provigil and a bunch of other weird drugs.  one day after discontinuing the klonopin i started having hallucinations so badly that i couldn't speak normally to people, hearing started to go, vision was off, sensory perception in general felt like i was in a tunnel.  it was horrible.  what's so bad about being on klonopin for long term use when you're dealing with PTSD, chronic fatigue syndrom, depression, physical, mental and sexual abuse as a child and debilitating neck and back injuries, and five or six suicidal attempts?  Seems harmless to me considering all the other options.

Finally able to live life again The effects are instantaneous. I've found that it's important to take it either as soon as you start to feel anxious, or when you anticipate that you will feel anxious (facing one of your usual triggers). If I take it mid-panic attack, it doesn't have much of an effect for me. The only drawback I've had is some moderate drowsiness.

Only thing that really helps! This is the second time I have used this drug to control the physical symptoms of my anxiety. It works very well without the &quot;high&quot; feeling I have gotten from xanax. It's also long acting so you don't go up and down all the time. I only take 1mg at bedtime but I used to take a lot more after a severe crisis led me to the hospital. It was easy to wean down as I haven't been on it that long and I use other medications that work with the klonopin.

The wafers seem better than tablets I was taking Ativan .5 mg as needed and it didn't seem to do much - the only time it did was when I was in ER for panic attack and had an IV of Ativan.  So Psych put me on the klopopin wafer and I think it seems a lot more effective than the regular tablets.  I usually take .5 mg at night which is plenty unless I am having severe panic and then take 1mg.  I am fine during the day (working, gym, and wherever else I may be) unless there is the occasional break through panic.  I have taken this med bf and I remember not having any panic/anxiety so I stopped taking it for a while and did not notice any withdrawal symptoms.  It helps tremendously with panicwill update if anything changes.

Very effective (especially in combin w. Inderal) When facing a stressful social or a performance situation my &quot;strategy&quot; goes like this:  I start taking it 2-3 days in advance, slightly increasing dosage (1 up to 3 times/day 0.5mg) to build up a solid level in my psychophysiological system. Lastly, I combine it with Inderal. That really keeps the anxiety far away without clouding your alertness.Sometimes I wish I could use this highly effective cocktail more often or even continuously, but I prefer not to, b/c I do not want to develop dependance.

made me more social and less avoidant worked very well, especially for my sleep.  the first time i took it (2mg) it made me dizzy, fell right to sleep. wonderful sleep! Then i noticed as i kept taking it at night (still good sleep) that during the day I felt less shy, didn't over think things.  As time has passed, only about 20 days of being on it, sleep is not as good, not bad, just a  little bit lighter sleep.  I'm not sure if it is something that will keep working?  or maybe i just think its too good to be true?

Helps control anxiety My 19 year-old son has Aspergers, OCD, Tourettes and ADHD, but anxiety is his biggest problem.  Clonazepam has been a life saver.  It's very effective in reducing and controlling anxiety.  It also helps him get to sleep.  Both falling asleep and staying asleep were big problems before Clonazepam.  Now, they're not.  When he first started taking it, it was sometimes hard to wake him in the morning.  After awhile, that wasn't a problem.  He takes it one hour before sleep.

Helps control anxiety My 19 year-old son has Aspergers, OCD, Tourettes and ADHD, but anxiety is his biggest problem.  Clonazepam has been a life saver.  It's very effective in reducing and controlling anxiety.  It also helps him get to sleep.  Both falling asleep and staying asleep were big problems before Clonazepam.  Now, they're not.  When he first started taking it, it was sometimes hard to wake him in the morning.  After awhile, that wasn't a problem.  He takes it one hour before sleep.

Worked well, for a few weeks. This is one of the few medicines that had any affect on my insomnia. I felt pleasantly sleepy and could lay down and pass out. Sleep was deeper. Unfortunately this wonderful effect lasted only 3 weeks. After that it didn't quite help as much. It no longer helped with sleep at all after a few months.Side fx while on it: shaking hands, facial muscles shook a bit which was disconcerting.Withdrawal: After 2 years I went off it. I immediately had rebound insomnia, worse hand shaking, and was less calm. I think it took me a year just to taper off it n 1/8th mg increments. Every time I dropped 1/8mg I could feel the withdrawal. If you are suicidal from the severe sleep deprivation that comes with insomnia and anxiety, this med is worth a shot. But it's only a short term solution. (I stayed on it for 2 years because of its anti-seizure properties.)

Works great This med is a Godsend, but the only downside is that for me I think it causes me to get angry very fast, now I don't know if it's the klonopin alone bc I also take 900mg's of lithium, but I do not feel shy at all when on this med I love it the only problem is that I think my body is building a tolorance to it

Not xanax, but effective This medication, taken in the same dose as xanax, is slightly less effective in controlling panic. I use it as part of a coctail, and my frequent panic attacks (3+ per day have all but disappeared. Note: I have undergone CBT twice in order to recognize and fend off the onset of panic. However, I still used to have attacks frequently until I started taking either xanax or klonopin.

Great! I was frequently tired, however, putting that aside, it treated my anxiety quite effectively. I was very satisfied with it. The only problem that came about was the fact that it could potentially be addicting and I was told to stop taking it.

Works, but has next day drowsiness. It works, but usually only combined with alcohol. Also, sometimes two doses are required. Then the next day will be rough, with drowsiness all day.

Clonazepam: Could Have Been A Wonder Drug The first time I took Clonazepam, in 1987, it cut off 99% of my anxiety like a gangrenous limb. Gone. Levelled. It worked at 1.5mg/day for nearly two years, with absolutely no side effects. Then began the slow but steady increase as I developed tolerance such that I was *prescribed* 19mg/day.I was able to taper to 3.5mg by taking increasing amounts of neurontin (all by prescription). I've been on 3.5mg since 2004 and think it unlikely that I will attempt to taper offit entirely.

Need to cycle or it loses effectiveness This has been great fpr periodic limb movement and sleep. This also had the positive side effect of reducing the occurance of migranes and depression.I never would have thought I was missing so muh sleep.The problem is that over time the effect of this drug diminishes. There are a couple ways to handle this. One is not take it on weekends. The other is to take a month out of the year to cut back. I cut back by .25mg steps for 2 weeks per step. Try to get completely off. Then slowly start back up again. I have gone as hign as 1.5mg.

Working for me so far Had a terrible bout of insomnia starting in March of 2006. Previous to that, never had any sleeping problems at all.My regular Dr. prescribed the popular sleep aids- Lunesta and Ambien. They did nothing for me.  He basically gave up and told me to hang in there and it would pass.  After many weeks of sleeping 2-3 hours per night, I finally went to a Psych Dr. and she immediately put me on .5 mg of Clonazepam combined with 15 mg of Remeron.From the first night, I slept great.  I have been taking this combination since then and I get 6-7 hours of solid sleep each night.  I have noticed that I sleep much deeper than I ever have before- she thinks this is because of the Remeron.The only side effect I have is slight nausea once in a while during the day.  No hangover at all, and I feel quite rested.Went back to my regular Dr. and he said he never prescribes benzos because &quot;they turn people into drug addicts.&quot;  Needless to say, I'll be finding a new Dr. soon!

Wow, a world outside my room. Klonopin's efficcy is a given, but along with it comes potential addiction. I DON'T CARE!!! doctors please stop giving bipolars ssri's for the accompanying anxiety that seems to go hand in hand with bp disorder. Benzodiazepines are more effective with minimal side effects. patients, if you know you are going to abuse this drug dont take it, otherwise say goodbye to crippling anxiety and horrible mood swings and accept that you have to take a medicine  with potential for addiction. my life is drastically better today because of klonopin, lamictal and seroquel, theoretically i am addicted to all of these medications. PeriodTaking: Klonopin 1 Mg 2 times dailyLamictal 100 Mg morning Seroquel 300 mg night

Pretty good in short courses I was prescribed this to help with sleep and reduce racing thoughts and agitation/anxietyI take it when I am &quot;extreme&quot; as I have other meds for day to day use. I also take it if I have something extremely stressful coming up to help me keep on top of things.Usually I take a dose at night almost immediately before bed and do that for up to 3 nights at a time. It doesn't help me get to sleep but once I fall asleep I find that it usually allows me to sleep for longer periods of about 6 hours. Most mornings I wake feeling okay. On some occasions I don't sleep well. I toss all night and wake up feeling like crap - but hey I useually feel like crap when I wake so nothing lost!!!

IN ''93 COMBINED W/ ZOLOFT WORKED GREAT; BUT NOW? I've been on Clonazepam  so long now, i don't even know if it works any more. Well, I KNOW it is not working. I am also taking Wellbrutrin and I am still so drepressed, I have to pretend to be happy around my 19 yr old daughter. I mean really PRETEND!! I am sick of pretending. I have so many different suicide thoughts and ways of ..........I could write a book. But if i tell my Dr.s they will put me in the hospital and I do not want to go there again. I cry so easily, it makes me sick to my stomach . I have to be really careful when I'm talking to a new neighbor, that I just don't loose it when a few words can trigger any type of thought that I have had before.

Clonazepam reveiw I was put on this for social anxiety/. Prior to this I was taking Wellbutrin (antidepressant-400 mg./daily) that HELPED my depression better than anything ever has. My doctor added clonazpam because I'm kind of crowd shy/uncomfortable, to the point where I will avoid things that have people. This medicine helps me. My dose is 2 mg. 3/daily as needed. Most days I do take 3. No noticeable side effects except it helps me sleep better. No dizziness or uncomfortable side effects.  So, in concluding, the Wellbutrin helps my depression, and the clonazapam lessens my big-time anxiety

Klonopin saved my life It can make you tired, but it's worth it if you suffer from panic disorder like I did for years before being in a study that combined desiprimine and klonopin, 18 years ago, and I still take the same amount of both!  I never believed anything could work for what I was going thru daily at school and social events (didn't go by the end).  Now I generally can do all the &quot;normal&quot; things, aside from one phobia that has developed over the past few years.

very good Oh yes it worked all right. Anything habit forming works the best for me. Having a tendency years ago of drinking the pond helps me appreciate the real good pills. Oh how I miss that pond!hehe Anyway, as long as I don't eat the pills like m&amp;m's I'm ok. Thay do exactly what they were meant to. I cut them in 2 if I feel like it depending in what direction the wind is blowing and either sleep well or clean well. whatever is more needed. I would be extra careful if you're expected to speak clearly. I've been accused of falling off the wagon. I usually tell them I dove!! It's really no big deal. when did I ever behave perfectly?

clonazepam has many negative side-effects While nominally effective in mood and anxiety control, clonazepam caused the following side effects, even at a relatively low dose:1. severe and progressive memory impairment that tooks months to clear after discontinuation2. severe and progressive impairment of mental acuity and clarity that took months to clear after discontinuation3. severe digestive disruption that resolved with discontinuationI was switched to daily use of this medication because I complained of next-day fragility and mood lability from as-neeed ativan use. Huge mistake with unintended and far-reaching conquences. Serious research recommended before using this drug - very difficult to go off even following accepted protocols, big kick-back, and side-effects are profound and did not in my case justify the slight benefit. I regret ever having taken this medication.

A long-term disappointment They sort of brush over the fact that your body builds up a tlerance to this drug for social anxiety by saying it's &quot;habit-forming&quot; instead of fully explaining that it's not meant for long-term treatment.  In other words, the first 5 or 6 months, at half the dose I'm on now (.5 instead of 1 mg, 3x daily,) were pretty good.  It got rid of my nightly panic attacks, did a decent job of stifiling the symptoms of my social anxiety and allowed me to be more open and myself just a little more, which improved my self-esteem a lot.     The flip side is that now most of that is gone with my self-esteem as the medication no longer works as well at 1 mg 3x daily.  I had 2 very brief panic attacks over the weekend to punctuate this declining situation.  My social anxiety is almost back where it was before I started and if I stop the med (as when I ran out, without tapering off) I get REALLY anxious.  My question is, as a bipolar II with adverse reactions to anti-depressants, what am I supposed to do, jump from one benzodiazepine to another for long-term symptom treatment as I work on this social anxiety in therapy??  These benzos are a disappointment, sooner or later, to anyone with moderate to severe social phobia, especially when you finally realize your body is addicted to them.

Thank God for Klonopin ! Many of the drugs I have taken caused many a sleepless night. For a while I was operating on less than three hours of sleep for almost four weeks. I was prescribed EVERYTHING! Nothing worked. I was at my wits ends - crying all the time and almost ended up in a traffic accident. Klonopin helped me tremendously. Since so many of the antidepressants either didn't work or caused hyomania before the suicidal ideation, the klonopin helped to bring me down to normal. I was told that I could take from 1 pill to 4 depending on how I feel. If I'm up too high, usually 2 pills bring me back(although I haven't needed the Klonopin for that for some time). I still use Klonopin from time to time when insomnia sets in. I usually take 2 pills but on occasion I've needed 3.The only down side I find is that in the morning it takes awhile to really wake up. I'll take that ANY DAY over not sleeping.

Helps with those awful anxiety moments Daily I seem to have anxiety in the morning and late afternoon. Within 15 minutes after taking  it I start to calm down and can continue my day.  without Klonopin I was regularly stressed and in tears much of the day.  I also take Lamictal. As far as I am concerned I never want to be without my Klonopin!!!!

Smooth    I started taking clonazepam when Ativan didn't work out for me. As a longer acting benzodiazepine, the effect is much smoother that Atavan in my experience. I take it at night to facilitate sleep, and its effect carries over into the next day to ease my anxiety.    I do worry about tolerance and long-term use, but have decided to trust my doctor and see how it goes.

Very Nice Sleeping  Aid I started on a dose of one tablet of Rivotril 2mg (clonazepam) at night and my insomnia disappeared! I slept like a baby. The only side-effect is that I wake up feeling a little high which is ok because I am a quite tense in the morning. I am now taking 1/4 to 1/2 tablet a night depending on how my mind and body feels. There are nights that I can sleep without taking the tablets, like during weekends. So far no problems.

Once infrequent user, now consistant user... I used to use Clonazapem infrequently, as needed remedy for panic attacks since I was 12. It was effective then, but made me a complete zombie. Now a decade later, my OCD and depression reached chronic levels. I went through every SSRI and SNRI and every atypical antipsychotic except Abilify over two and half years, and nothing really worked. The cycle of beginnging a medication then withdraw was almost as trying as my mental illness itself.Then my psychiatrist started to give my Clonazapem regularly, and my OCD, anxiety, and depressive symptoms have significantly improved. That's not to say they have gone away, but they've dropped to a managable level. Clonazapem works like a preemptive medication for me, less symptoms occur, and when they do, they are easier to handle. I experience few side effects when on Clonazapem. No drowsiness or memory issues like some experience. I'm sure I will develop a dependency, and I will have a hard withdraw ahead of me when I go off it. I also worry I'll ahve to increase my dosage in the future to maintain results. That's the price you pay with benzos. Many psychiatrists refuse to give a benzo long term, but if you don't have a history of abuse or addicition, they might be up for it.

so far the only med that has made a difference Have been on it for two months and has worked great for anxiety, nervous-ness and tummy trouble. It works subtly unlike xanax(quick high).  Only side effect in first week was tiredness.  Aware of addiction potential but quality of life more important.  Have tried all SSRI's with major trouble.  Highly recommend klonopin.

so far so good! Have only been taking for a few months but the urgency and accidents are long gone.  This and xanax(when needed) have been the only meds that really helped.  Tried all the SSRI's(mostly)with no improvement.  The only side effect was tiredness the first week and the occasional headache.

Bad behavior I am bipolar and suffered from anxiety along with racing thoughts.My GP olaced me on Klonopin to see whether it would help.I spent the next month in bed trying to decide whther it would be better to hang myself or take a long swim. It was horrible, all I could do was lay in bed and want to die. All the sedatives cause similar reactions with me. Glad to be off it.Unfortunately my brother was not so fortunate. He was placed on Klonopin and two weeks later took his life. He already had suicidal tendancies but this type drug put him over the edge.Watch out for profound depression and behavioral changes!

Keeps me sane This is the only drug that has ever helped my anxiety/panic disorder/paranoia.  Without it I am unable to even leave the house and at 40 years of age that's pretty bad.  I take 3 .5's  in a.m. &amp; 3 in p.m. Also take lexapro 10 mg , vistaril as needed, methodone for pain, &amp; seroquel at night.  Have begun having muscle contractions in hands/fingers.  Don't know why.

Use it. Use it. Use it. This was an early defense against a breakdown, agitated (suicidal) depression. It got me through some real traumas and is a powerful tool to have in the toolbox. I've gone from 2mg/day to 6mg/day (2mg 3x) depending on what was going on with me. Now w/ a new bipolar II diagnosis I think the Klonipin was an effective agent against the severe agitation and anxiety. I'm still on it and imagine I will always be on it. It's a serious drug, but with serious anxiety problems, it's a must-try defense - long 1/2 life and effective for long term use (in my 5th year). Truly a drug of the gods.

Smoother than Xanax - less rebound I used this med 20 yrs ago for panic/agoraphobia - made me a zombie then...Now, I use more as needed...Usually .5 mg twice a day - and for sleep.    A bit difficult to wake up if I take 1 mg for sleep but after a coffee and shower, ok.  Excellent sleep med, excellent anxiety med.  Xanax was tops for panic - still is, and I always have some in my purse if needed for its immediate action....Haven't needed one since starting klonopin.  Smooth med, Klonopin - watch you dosage and tweak it, if need be.  Hope to all those out there with panic/anxiety/agoraphobia: after having child in 1996 things have improved.  Don't give up.  Oh I take Lexapro, too and klonopin is necessary to round out the edges from Lex.

Its a 50/50 trade   Lets face it, there is addiction to these drugs. What I find is the trade, as my anxiety is not well tolorated by me or my wife. How she deals with me I may never know, but she can certainly tell me to take one.   I prefer valium because it cost less but I have to take a high dose of 25mg compared to the 1-2mg of clonazapam. Go figure that one?    The first drug to treat my anxiety issues was valium and it also was treat my Bi-Polar, though valium was abused ot the levels of above 80mg a day. Funny thing was I could function, so there is a tolarence to these drugs.

Another &quot;benzo,&quot; need I say more? As I said in reference to Ativan, the &quot;benzos&quot; just don't work overall. When I take them I usually fall asleep and of course forget why I am anxious. The problem is that it does not work for the long-term and it is addictive also.

Good for short term relief from anxiety I find this helpful when I am going into a situation I know will create anxiety. Originally, I was taking up to two pills a day as needed, now I am taking two a day at on a regular basis, and an additional one if I find myself getting panicky. Side effects of drowsiness though.

Clonazepam rocks me to sleep It works 90% of the time within a 1/2 of taking. My condition has gotton so bad that prior to this drug, I went 6 days without sleep without feeling a thing. I have bipolar disease. I was on 10 drugs at the time and had become resistant to medication. I had to undergo ECT as a last ditch effort. I'm now on 3 meds and sleep like a baby once I take the clonazepam. No side effects and wake up refreshed.

bad experience I used ashwagandha and had an awesome effect from that.  Then I took clonazepam and got bad sensations of anxiety and paranoia.

Quite the Surprise UPDATE!Well, the occipital nerve block proved to be more or less useless, but the Klonopin continues to do a good job.  I'm now up to 1mg, twice a day, and plan on going up to 2mg twice a day in the near future.So far, this is the only thing that's worked for me. And the side effects are MUCH better than those of Topamax or similar.  Klonopin makes me sleepy and relaxed....not so bad.  Topamax made me into a moody, forgetful zombie who couldn't string two words together.Am I pain free?  No.  Am I much better than I was? You bet.  I only wish I had tried this drug earlier, it might have saved me months of suffering.  I highly recommend it, it's much easier on the system than any of the other anti-convulsant drugs out there for headaches.After taking methadone for my migraines/occipital neuralgia with highly unpleasant side effects, my doctor prescribed Klonopin to help with the anxiety I was feeling.  To my immense surprise, it has not only reduced my anxiety, but radically reduced my pain as well.  My muscles have loosened up, and the crushing ache I had been feeling in the back of my head and neck have now been reduced to minor discomfort.  At times, I've even pain free, and it's been a long time since I was able to say that.  I no longer take the methadone or any of the narcotic pain meds I was prescribed, because since starting the Klonopin I haven't needed them.Side effects?  Yeah, there have been a few.  I find that I feel somewhat &quot;apathetic&quot; and have very little motivation.  My short term memory is a little less reliable, and I sometimes have to search my brain for words that used to come easily. I also feel like I have a bit of dry mouth. However, this is a walk in the park compared to what happened while on opiates.I would strongly recommend those with severe headaches or occipital neuralgia give this a try.  Had I only been given this sooner, I might have been spared months of pain and suffering.  As it's also an

Relaxed AND depressed, what a combo! I'm sorry to say that clonazepam was not a good drug for me. While it was anxiolytic, I felt very depressed on it. After two months of brain fog, dark moods and unhappy results, I asked my psychiatrist to switch me to diazepam (Valium), and he did. And I've never looked back.

Works well but side effect of tiredness This drug makes me too drowsy so I use this when I really need it like flying on a plane. I cant really function well on this as I usually have to go to sleep after an hour or so. Sometimes after prolonged use, I break through the medicine if the anxiety is aggrevated by a stressfull situation.

It does work, but also builds tolerance. This drug has helped me with my social anxiety.  You do develop tolerance, though.  Every psychiatrist I've seen has said so.  But you can't keep going higher and higher on the dosage.  It has significantly helped me with my social phobia, but in some isolated cases it has not, which is still troublesome for me.  The tolerance issue was a disappointment.  And I feel it's so obvious you develop tolerance.  The first time I took it, I was so calm and had no problem talking to anyone.  Now it's just part of my daily regimen.  Don't get me wrong, I still do think it helps.  You just stop feeling it working because 1) it loses it's drug feeling effect (i.e. tolerance - your system recognizes it as something you need each day) and 2) it reverts into making you feel that you're normal and better as opposed to feeling somewhat drugged up (which is how I felt initially when I first started taking it), and this may be where you can find the tolerance helpful.  Because we shouldn't feel drugged up, but rather feel normal and better with our anxiety symtoms subsided....at least some of them.  This drug has definitely done that for me.  At least that's my experience and what I think about it.  I think any doctor knows that the drug builds tolerance.  He/She may just not want you to keep going up on the doses.  Also, my doctors have always preferred I take .5 mgs before bed and .5 mgs when I wake up. So same time everyday.  I admit once in a while I will take an extra in the middle of the day.  Those finding it to cause excessive sleepiness should lower their dose.  I've learned from doctors that it's not a good idea to just take it when you need it because you end up needing it more and more frequently in some cases.  However, it depends on how bad or S.A.D. is.  And it really does depend on each person individually.  Good luck everyone!

Good The Klonopin worked great for the first few weeks. I use it to slow my mind so that I can sleep. The only  issue I have is its not working as effectivly anymore. I may need to have my dose upped. Other than that, its worked great.

Warning Please stay off Klonopin! I was given Klonopin for my sleep disorder and fibromyalgia. It worked great for relaxing muscles, and my sleep and anxiety issues. I never abused it or increased my dose. I used it for 10 years. I even asked my doc about potential withdrawals and he assured me I would be on it the rest of my life. No need for me to worry. It is not meant for long term use. It should only be used for about 2 weeks. Doctors have been warned about this. After a while it did just the opposite of what it did in the beginning. It increased my anxiety, fear, confusion,and insomnia. After age 50 benzos can cause dementia like symptoms! The withdrawals were awful and it took me a total of 10 months to gradually get off of it. I so wish I had never taken it. If you want to come off Klonopin do it very gradually so the withdrawals are minimized. Check out Dr. Heather Ashtons website for a slow taper schedule. Doctors are very irresponsible when handing out benzodiazipines.

It helps my anxiety Klonopin has helped my anxiety better than Ativan.  I am much calmer and less stressed at work/school.  I haven't been on it long enough to judge side effects.

I am so happy to have something that works! I was having really bad palpitations which produced a lot of anxiety.  Actually, it was the anxiety that brought on the palpitations.  I know that now :)I was having bad palpitations at night and then throughout the day.  Everything I did, gave me palpitations.  I finally couldn't take it anymore, so I found a doctor who would prescribe Chlonazapam and not a Beta Blocker.  I felt better almost instantly.  The next night I had maybe one palpitation.  After that, I was sleeping much better and have only had 2 bouts of palps that bothered me and that's over a 2 month period. Before the Chlonazapam, I was having 100's of palps a day!As for side effects, the pill made me sleepy about an hour after I took it, but that only lasted 2 nights.I am really pleased I found something that works!

Refer to my profile, user name Joadja Yes it does work for me, however it is important to understand that the body does build tolerance and to resist increasing the dosage, it is a good idea to occasionally reduce dosage or omit dosage for one night. I learned this through trial and error. I had taken Rivitol for three years back between 1995 and 1998 and did not apply this management plan and found it was no longer as affective and I increased the dosage. My body had build tolerance. After tracking this information through a Pharmacist friend I decided to go cold turkey, not a good idea, would have been better to gradually reduce the dosage as I would not have suffered the consequences!! I had such a bad experience that I did not consider the drug for several years and then was desperate and when I went back to taking the Rivitrol I did things differently! It is all a learning curve.

Longer, deeper sleep Klonopin, in combination with other meds, has definitely helped me sleep better. In addition, it is good for the crippling pain and fatigue caused by Fibromyalgia and CFS. It helps reduce their intensity. For me, Klonopin is better than Xanax in this department. Nevertheless, I take .5 mg of Xanax to help me fall asleep and 1 mg of Klonopin to help me stay asleep longer and sleep deeper. Neurontin (small dose) is another good one for sleep and pain.

AVOID! I was first prescribed Klonopin in early 2002 to treat an anxiety disorder and have used it daily ever since, despite repeated attempts to discontinue treatment.  Klonopin (clonazepam) and other benzodiazepines have always been considerably more effective than other medications, as I imagine they are for most people, but the potential for dependence and frequent, protracted withdrawal syndrome are much too serious to warrant long term use under any circumstance.  After taking Klonopin for 3 years without ever increasing the dose, I attempted to stop taking it altogether and within a few days had developed severe withdrawal symptoms, such as: panic-attacks, aggression, extreme anxiety/irritability, insomnia, headaches, neck and back pain, muscle stiffness/rigidity, tics/muscle spasms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pains, tingling/numbness, sensations of heat, chills, palpitations, rapid heart rate, hypersensitivity to light, hypersensitivity to sound, hyperreflexivity, loss of appetite, weight loss, nightmares, tremor, jumpiness, restlessness, sweating, vertigo, and more.  Many of these symptoms would last for several weeks, until they became so unbearable that I had to restart treatment.  From what I understand, some symptoms can continue for several months, even years.  I would advise anyone who has been prescribed this medication to take extreme caution, and to never take it for more than 7-14 days, or less than once a week.  My dependence on this drug has caused a great deal of distress in my life, and has had a considerably negative impact on my career and social life.  Please be careful.

AVOID! I was first prescribed Klonopin in early 2002 to treat an anxiety disorder and have used it daily ever since, despite repeated attempts to discontinue treatment.  Klonopin (clonazepam) and other benzodiazepines have always been considerably more effective than other medications, as I imagine they are for most people, but the potential for dependence and frequent, protracted withdrawal syndrome are much too serious to warrant long term use under any circumstance.  After taking Klonopin for 3 years without ever increasing the dose, I attempted to stop taking it altogether and within a few days had developed severe withdrawal symptoms, such as: panic-attacks, aggression, extreme anxiety/irritability, insomnia, headaches, neck and back pain, muscle stiffness/rigidity, tics/muscle spasms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pains, tingling/numbness, sensations of heat, chills, palpitations, rapid heart rate, hypersensitivity to light, hypersensitivity to sound, hyperreflexivity, loss of appetite, weight loss, nightmares, tremor, jumpiness, restlessness, sweating, vertigo, and more.  Many of these symptoms would last for several weeks, until they became so unbearable that I had to restart treatment.  From what I understand, some symptoms can continue for several months, even years.  I would advise anyone who has been prescribed this medication to take extreme caution, and to never take it for more than 7-14 days, or less than once a week.  My dependence on this drug has caused a great deal of distress in my life, and has had a considerably negative impact on my career and social life.  Please be careful.

Warning Klonopin Works great, horror story!! I was given Klonopin for my sleep disorder. It worked great for relaxing muscles, and my sleep and anxiety issues. I never abused it or increased my dose. I used it faithfully for 10 years. It is not meant for long term use. Doctors have been warned about this. After a while it does the opposite of what it does in the beginning. It increases anxiety, fear, confusion. After age 50 benzos can cause dementia! The withdrawals were awful and it took me a total of 10 months to gradually get off of it. I so wish I had never taken it. Go to beat the benzos website to read the horrors of klonopin. Sure it's working for you right now but you are messing with your life. If I hadn't had my family to help me during the withdrawals I would not be here today! I am joining the fight to get that drug off the market. Since I'm off of it, I've never been better!

Good It seemed to help me more with my &quot;fear&quot; and &quot;anticipatory anxiety&quot;, but it did make me sleepy. At one point I needed a dosage adjustment because it pulled my blood pressure down too low. I feel that it helped me more than my current medication of Xanax.

So far so good I started taking Clonazepam a week ago after 4 months of insomnia and trying 3 different drugs that did not work (ambien CR, lunesta 3mg, and Trazadone).  I have also tried Valerian Root and Melanin.  Doubling the lunesta worked but I ran out of pills half way thru my prescription.  My doctor suggested Clonazepam since I am having trouble turning off my brain and night and initiating sleep.  So far, the drug has allowed me to get a peaceful nights sleep for the entire week.  I wake up a tiny bit sleepy but am getting 8 hours of sleep a night and having some great dreams as well.  So far i give it an A.  I just hope I don't have to keep taking it much longer.

I have also tried Valerian Root and Melanin.  Doubling the lunesta worked but I ran out of pills half way thru my prescription.

Klonopin Wafers .25mg. I have taken Klonopin and Xanax when I have a lot of anxiety and panic.

cut down to clonazapam from xanax so not as strong the medicine works but it does not work as good as xanax but i was on xanax for 6 years and every time i tried to cut back major withdrawal so i went a little weaker so if i can ever get off it will be a little easier but i would rather take xanax if they had no withdrawal because i could take more but doc. won't write more not understanding drug tolerance after being on so long sometimes i wish i never changed but there cutting back somewhat of the panic but do not help the sleep problems at all like xanax i can function working while driving also so they make life tolerable hard to come by doctors who will use benzodiazapams now there so afraid of the regulations or whoever checks on them they would rathr write the newer pills with much more side effects like heart attacks and such as so many law suits but they still write those new drugs like crazy for fear of addiction but the new drugs also have addiction because you cannot stop taking them at once either so i call that dependent to so hard to get treated these days thank God for my doc. even though he has cut back much for same reasons big brother

Wonderful medication for reducing anxiety It is extremely good for panic attacks and anxiety of all kinds.  It is also better than Ativan or Xanax, since it stays in the body longer (has a longer half-life than the other two meds), and one does not have to keep &quot;popping pills&quot; to make it through a nerve-wracking situation.  It is especially effective for those diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, since the medication effects last for a while.  However, as with all benzodiazepines, with time, the body tends to &quot;get used&quot; to the Klonopin/ Clonazepam, and more will be needed to maintain the same effects.  One may also become psychologically (not only physically) dependent on it.

Say Good Bye to anxiety! My doc started me on this for insomnia after Lunesta was not only ridiculously expensive (in comparison) but also gave me crippling headaches!  I was also put on Lexapro, which gave me a bit of anxiety, but the anxiety could also be attributed to beginning talk therapy and opening up a warehouse of issues.  Anyway, clonazepam has saved the day many times for me.  .5 helps me sleep.  .25-.5 for anxiety, depending on how bad it is.  I never leave home without it anymore, to be honest.  It kicks in pretty quickly and just makes me feel better.  It's a nice drug to have around, and I have no side effects with it.

Klonopin works well for me I've been using Klonopin for a couple years now, and it works very well to control my anxiety, insomnia, and nightmares. Initially, I took it daily, but was concerned about the possibility of addiction. So for the past year or so I've been taking it only as needed, which ends up being perhaps once or twice each month, only when my anxiety seems particularly severe or my sleep becomes seriously disturbed, and it always helps me deal with these accute situations. I've found that using Klonopin in this occasional manner has no side-effects for me, and no addictive danger. For someone with other addictions, Klonopin might be a poor choice because of its addictive potential, but it works great for me as an occasional help.

The best med. for anxiety &amp; panic attacks This is been the most effective medication I have taken. I can actually feel reducing my panic attacks and anxiety within minutes. Ive been prescribed of 15 different medications for anxiety, agoraphobia, and panic attacks during the last 6 years. I have found that clonazepam to be the most effective anxiety med if evenly taken during the day. I am now taking this in combination with Provigil for anxiety &amp; depression &amp; Rozerem &amp; Sonata for sleep disorder

Solved the RLS problem but too many side effects Worked in that it allowed me to go to sleep but didn't stop the tremours.  Side effects were sleeping too much (on 0.5 mg) and inability to go to sleep without it.  Very habit forming.  Definite personality changes that were unacceptible.  Would never take it again.

Does the job This is the second time I have been prescribed Klonopin for panic attacks and horrible anxiety.My attacks are the worst when I lay down to go to sleep. This made sleep impossible, and resulted in a nervous breakdown. I am also taking a sleep aid now in addition to the Klonopin. The first time I went off the medication I tapered slow and it went fine. I was only on it about 6 months. But gradually the sleep problem returned and eventually the anxiety built up and the panic attacks started again. That took about 4 months to happen. I am considering an SSRI but after trying Zoloft and Remeron the side effects were just too unbearable. I might try Celexa. I really am afraid of the AD's, there are so many negative things about them. In my mind they are no more addictive than a benzo like Klonopin.

Used for Panic Disorder Without Clonazepam, my panic is so bad I cannot get out of the house and many days, I can't get out of bed due to the terrible fears that seem to come over me.  My doctors want to take me off of it because I am an addict (street drugs) because they say it makes me crave other drugs, but I do not feel that is so.  I have to have it solely for the panic disorder I have had since age 16.  I have been tried on everything but nothing else works.

Alright for GAD, less so for SP Klonopin hasn't done much for my social anxiety directly. But it does helps with my baseline GAD. The problem is that I think that is traded off against small increase in depression. So I'm less wound up and fearful, but I feel a little worse about myself. On net, maybe a small improvement in social situations.After a year, I've become pretty acclimatized too the drug. So trying to lower my dose even by 0.125 mg has been very hard. But, this might be better once I've found a good mood stabilizer. (I'm also BPII.)

a bit of a mind numb-er this medication has gome a long way in mediating the side effects of my resperidol but, it has it's side effects. I am a student. my major is mathematics. and I have to think critically on a daily basis. this medication is very detrimental in this respect. it makes me forget things and not know to do things is math that normally came quite easily to me. it deffinitly causes cognitive imparement. but if you do not have such thought intensive tasks on your plate then I would suggest this med to anyone who is experiencing many of the common symptoms of schizophrenia and/or wants to mediate the side-effects of an antipsychotic

It has saved my life!! I take 3 pills every night and have never slept so soundly. I've had cfids for 10 years and I feel like my ole' self since I started using this med.! I've lost 24 pounds, I am 42 AND I teach full time. I also have a family and am soooo thankful I finally tried this drug. It has changed my life! I have tried everything under the sun, but nothing helped until my Mom died a year ago and I couldn't sleep at all and BEGGED my Dr. to try this. I've been reading about Klonopin since I 1st caught mono, that turned into cfids, but no Dr. was willing to try this. It took my mother dying for me to hit rock bottom and I never thought I'd feel like myself again! I am a very positive person and refuse to let cfids rule my life, but it did!  Good luck!!

Good stuff! This is one of the few psych drugs that has agreed with me so far. It definitely calms me down, even at a low dose. The only drawback is that I'll get an increase in fatigue if I take it more than a few days in a row. Therefore, I try to take it only when I really need it. So far, so good!

less anxiety, more depression! strange medicine.  after one week I was so relaxed and actually started chatting easily with people, without my usual self-consciousness.After three weeks, I was so relaxed about being suicidal.  What a relief to get it over with, it seemed.  Got myself off that drug pronto.  It also made me completely impotent, after just one dose.

Good for GAD and social phobia I started taking Klonopin in January 2006. I find it to be very effective for GAD and social phobia. Best so far. Down side: libido killer, dry mouth and dry skin! For sleep: so-so. Up side: dampens appetite and easier to maintain body weight than any other AD or anti-psychotic I've tried.

My magic pill turned into a nightmare! When I first started using Klonopin I felt as though I found My Magic Pill! My anxiety went down and the panic attacks decreased. It worked well for about a year or so and with out noticing I was needing to take it sooner. I have been taking it since 1999 and worked hard at not becoming addicted...as so I thought! It helped me to get out of my home and do things again and I wouldn't go any place with it. I carried it in my purse at all times. I didn't realize over a period of time my personality changed. I was hurrying to do things so I get home and take my Klonopin and chill out! In the spring of 2005 I found myself freaking out, paranoid, feeling very sick to my stomach, unable to eat, shaking like a leaf, very agoraphobic, very depressed, very scared, weak, phobias of all kinds, smoking like a train, very bad memory loss, cold chills, hot flashes, very sound sensitive, breaking out in sweats, feeling cold, very scared, heart beating at the rate of 110 beats per minute and the list can go on and on!I am now taking medication to lower my heart rate. I have been living this night mare for a year now. My dosage has been increased but still having very bad symptoms it's like my body eats it up fast! I tried to decrease it and went thru hell so bad that I had to up it again! Now I'm taking klonopin and xanax WOW I'm a Benzo addict! I ended up in the hospital 4 times already and to my surprise Klonopin was never looked at as being something that could be causing me such hell! After, a year of going thru this hell my Doc is trying to find a rehab center for me with little success unless you happen to be rich and can afford $25,000 or more!Where does that leave me? Where does that leave you? I'm scared to go off this drug and scared to stay on it! I have tried other meds for anxiety but they don't help me any. Where do i go from here? I have lost so much of myself, not to mention my loss with my family and what to look fo

Klonopin rounds out the other medications It was prescribed for me in addition to the Wellbutrin and Effexor because I couldn't sleep at night.  I would just lay away and worry about things.  Also, I was still experiencing panic attacks during the day.  In all, I'd say it works well.  The label clearly states that one should use caution if driving or &quot;operating dangerous machinery.&quot;  So the last thing I do before going to bed is take this medication- and it doesn't have any side effects by the time I wake up.

Uninhibited 10yo bipolar child Klonopin has reduced my son's anxiety, but this has also backfired because now he is more &quot;in our face&quot; than ever because he's not worried about consequences.  His teacher reports that he is hanging out with peers more - he suffers from a large amount of social anxiety.  But with the new uninhibitedness he is taking more risks, which has even caused a school suspension.  We are looking to remove the drug and use a different approach to his anxiety on our next doc visit.

Great at first, but long term use was a disaster Clonazepam was prescribed to me by the VA for high blood pressure, and a sleep aid, (I had been using melatonin for sleep).  It felt great at first,(1mg.) and I thought I was on a legal high!  As my blood pressure failed to stay low enough, my doctor insisted I increase my use after the first year to 1.5 or 2mg.  All was fine, but I seemed to be loosing my memory some. As time went by, I also began to notice some cognative skills loss.  Then my first mishap, the drug was interupted by a mix-up at the VA, and I went 6 days without!!  That was when I experianced my first Panic attack (I thought I was having a heart attack!)  Then I knew I was hooked.  Tried, with little help (at first) from the VA, to quit, even the 28 day taper (reccomended by the VA) failed to get me off it. I tried a more gradual 2 month taper, still had attacks. I turned to this site, and a prior user to get a 6 month taper, that finally took 8 months+ to get off, and another 8 months to gain some of my lost cognative skills. I could not use Saran Wrap without giving up in total frustration at one point, but I diegress.With the help of therapy from the (now aware) VA, I have managed to stay off of it for 8 months now, and will NEVER GO BACK on ANY benzodiazepam.  I'm also getting help from my county mental health services in dealing with the lingering various types of panic attacks that come up,(agoraphobia, PTSD, Social anxiety, etc.).  Keep in mind, I never experianced a Panic attack,, or recall ever having one before this whole experience!!  Now I'm still working on getting back to normal with counseling and meditation.  For some enlightning info on benzodiazepams refer to: benzo.org/uk   The VA had not heard of any serious problems with this type of drug, until I informed them of this site.

I have had no side effects, my child was born completely normal, and I can get out and do everything that I used to be frightened of.

Great Med Wow, I thought I was the only one that thought this drug did wonders for depression as well as anxiety. I am also on Prozac and Lamictal for Bipolar II. I also find it makes me giddy sometimes and very talkative. But I can already see a tolerance building. It's great for sleep. If you can stop for awhile, that would be good. I don't want to get addicted either. I was on Xanax and got VERY dependent on it. I could feel withdrawals within 2 days of not taking it. Just a note- don't try to do rehab to get off Xanax. I tried that and it was a nightmare. All they gave me was phenobarbital and I was crawling out of my skin! I felt so awful. (depressed, anxious, could not sleep!) Please ask your doctor to taper you. And make sure he knows what he is doing. Klonopin is longer acting than Xanax so it's a better drug to withdrawal from. It is also not as potent.

Helps with Bipolar and Insomnia I use 2mg of clonazepam everynight to get to sleep. It works very well for this purpose. Due to it's long half life its effect carries onto the next day and eases my anxiety.Out of all the benzos I've tried it is the quickest to make me depressed if I'm not on adequate Lamictal and an antidepressant. I would not like to take to it on its own.

i love this med Klonopin--I swear by.  I've been taking .5 mg Klonopin for about 3 years now to help me sleep.  Only thing is after time you have to take a little more here and there for there to be any reduction in anxiety.  Now i'm up to 1 mg three times a day, still prescribed in  .5 mg tablets b/c my pdoc doesn't want to increase the mg dosage.  It does make me a little drowsy but something I welcome b/c I can become so hyper w/o it.  I can tell when its wearing off b/c my body gets so cold and my hands and feet feel like ice.  I get inner restlessness and I just start talking up a storm, chattering on about anything.  Even though Klonopin can reduce impulse control, says my pdoc, he lets me on it b/c its worked for my anxiety (and its probably one of the only drugs i haven't complained about!).  I don't have a dependency on it and I don't abuse it.  I guess there is no addictive personality here.  I can see how it can be abused so I would recommend if anyone has any addictive issues to stay away from Klonopin, but that's just my opinion.  My hat is off to the inventor of Klonopin--its stuck by me for this long!

Klonopin Improved My Quality of Life Made me a little drowsy in the daytime at first and that went away in a week. My panic attacks decreased and overall anxiety lowered.I have been on it for over a year and combined with therapy, I am getting more to the root of the anxiety. It has been the best anxiety med yet for me. The generic is not too expensive. Overall great and consistent improvement!! Thank you Roche.

Mood stabilizer and anxiety relief with Klonopin I use this with a combination of Lamictal &amp; Equetro to treat Bi-Polar II. Klonopin improved my quality of life and if it helps I don't care if it is addictive-my health is more important than a stigma on a medication. Getting and staying healthy are the only things that matter with this illness.The side effects were easily tolerated, if it makes me sleepy then the dr. instructed to take at night. This drug works for me and is carefully monitored by my doctor because it is addictive, but the treatment is working with no negative side effects so far.

This one is a winner and very effective...... low cost-few side effects, drowsiness at first, but that went away after a month!!! No scary drug interactions and I was/am now having fewer panic attacks and they occur less severely on a consistent basis. I have/had (does it ever really go away??Please if you find out let me know, strength and love to all that read this)agor. and SEVERE panic attacks as far back as I can remember. I am being treated for bipolar II also. I took xanax, I know the quick(but temporary)fix it has for anxiety. I  spent 3 yrs with xanax as my life coach.

I can leave the house more than before and  really deal better with the anxiety that causes the intensity of the attacks, when they do happen.
klonopin	Panic disorder / agoraphobia	2006-04-05 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	This one is a winner and very effective...... low cost-few side effects, drowsiness at first, but that went away after a month!!! No scary drug interactions and I was/am now having fewer panic attacks and they occur less severely on a consistent basis. I have/had (does it ever really go away??Please if you find out let me know, strength and love to all that read this)agor. and SEVERE panic attacks as far back as I can remember. I am being treated for bipolar II also. I took xanax, I know the quick(but temporary)fix it has for anxiety. I  spent 3 yrs with xanax as my life coach.

Have your doctor monitor and it will be fine 1st of all everyone has different chemistry. My dose was 3mg daily and I tryed cold turkey. This was a bad idea, soon nausea, vertigo,...and other upleasant physical symptoms persisted 5 days, that was enough.  I called my doctor, he fussed, and rightfully so. We set up a plan and I weaned off of it for a while until stressors in my life caused it to be an addition to my med. shelf once again. If I have to discontinue use again doctor will absolutely lead me through process.

A great add on drug for tx of Bipolar disease I have been using the generic form of Klonopin at  bedtime for about two weeks.  The only side effect that is bothersome is a feeling residual drowsiness in the morning that lasts only about an hour after waking up. I imagine that this effect will go away with time.  Since taking this, I have experienced less anxiety during the day, the ability to get a full night of sleep complete with normal dreaming and together with Abilify am doing great!

Only thing that has worked for me! I tried Requip but had no relief from the leg pain and spontaneous movements.  Also, I had the weird side effect of insomnia.  I thought it would help me sleep...NOT!  The clonazepam did the trick.  I sleep all night for the first time in months, maybe years.  I was a little hung-over the next morning but as soon as my coffee kicked in, I was good to go.  This has been a lifesaver for me, personally!

Helps me feel calmer and sometimes happier... Klonipin is an interesting drug. When I first started taking it, the drug would actually not only decrease depression, it would help with all forms of anxiety, and even make me feel kind of jocular. In other words, it made me want to joke around, be playful and have fun with friends. These feelings would last for about 12 hours or so. I did notice that taking the drug everyday would eventually cause it to lose it's effectiveness and I would have to increase the dose to 1 mg per day. I didn't want to go that route; the last thing I want is to develop an addiction. I would stop taking klonipin for a week or two and then use it again. This seemed to work reasonably well. Klonipin is one of those drugs that has immediate effects and with many of these types of drugs you need to use them cautiously and perhaps even take a break from them for awhile. For me, Klonipin at .5mg helps with anxiety, some forms of depression and OCD.

Best of Benzos After suffering from untreated PD for a few years I tried several SSRI's (none worked, in fact they seem to make it worse), ativan &amp; then klonopin.  Klonopin works great, the only side effect that is a bother is it is psysiologically addictive--but other than ativan, it is the only thing that has worked for me, so the benefits outweigh the addictive quality for me.  I couldn't live normally without it, after suffering for years I was so relieved to find that treatment was so easy, provided you find a good psychiatrist.

It helps, but...side effects... I wish I could get off of it.  CFS and/or anxiety isn't due to a Klonopin or clonazepam deficiency.  Restless legs are often due to an iron deficiency and the additives &quot;mono and diglycerides&quot; found in many pre-packaged foods.  In fact, in theory, it could eventually make RLS worse due to little known side effects like anemia, thrombocytopenia (low white cell counts) etc..  I did some high-dose probiotics and three-lac a few years ago which lowered my anxiety so much I thought I could quit the &quot;K&quot; cold turkey.  But they were expensive so i had to quit the probiotics instead.  One day I hope to repeat that anti-candida probiotic regimen and get off the clonazepam for good.  Just my two cents

great I hate taking any drug but when I can't sleep I can't work so it's a necessity. My insomnia has been slowly improving so I only use it about 2 or 3 nights a week. It's feels great to know it's there when I need it and the only side effect is that I feel a little low energy but that could be from the lack of sleep when I don't take it.

It can be the best benzo for GAD I started out with .5mg two times a day, but was later increased.  It has a very long half life so dealt with my GAD very well.  There was only one problem with it. It gave me quite a bit of gas, so I was switched to valium 15mgs a day which wasn't enough.  My Doctor doubled the dose and added lexapro 10mgs and once the lexapro kicked in I barely need any now!

Klonipin for Insomnia and Restless Leg Well I have been on many pain medicines, and anti depressants, nerve medicine, I have Fibromyalgia and CFS with Rest Leg Syndrome. I notice first symptoms was not sleeping with knee pain, I would lay in bed tired, but couldnt keep my legs from hurting, this went on years, I was on Valium, and Effexor Xr. In a short two years I went to 450 Mg on Effexor, Yes very high to high does and Valium 10 mg a day this was in 1999 to 2002, Well the night mare was so bad, it was like the movie the Exorcisist happening in my dreams every night, I would wake up screaming. I couldnt get my doctor to take me off of them at this time, so I slowly took myself off this two medicine. I then a month later called every night to get in his office I hadnt sleep in almost 5 days, I was having psychotic episode to do not sleeping, he finally worked me in, My anxiety was on the edge, to where I was afraid of my own self and others. He then told me I had Restless leg Syndrome, so he said the best medicine even though in the same class as Valium show to help the nerve like pain in my upper and lower knee pain. I also was very depressed so I went on Paxil Cr , well in a year ended up going to 45 mg on paxil and 3 mg on Klonipin the name brand. I did pretty good for 3 years on this, I didnt tell my doctors I only took 1 mg of the Klonipin, because I was afraid of the bad dreams/ Night Terrors. Well I had terrible pain, now all over my body, I felt like I was bruised from the inside out. I like I had been beat up badly, but in the inside, without bruises. I finally go to go to a a specialist on Fibromyalgia and have that too. My medicine didnt change though, I didnt get any pain medicine, but that was my choice, I dont like the addictions I had in the past coming off them.  Well I guess I went into remission last Jan 2005 I went off all my medicine meaning the Paxil Cr, Slowly under a doctor order, and only had to take Generic (insurance changed) Klono

Clonazepam For Tension Headaches I find this old and inexpensive drug very effective, particularly when combined with naproxen sodium (Alene).  I have never needed to take it daily for long periods of time so I have built up very little tolerance--which is good.  Fortunately, I have a doctor who is not a fear-of-addiction freak.  He thinks some people couldn't be made into addicts if you tried.

Good for the anxiety/dysphoria; hard to taper I've been on Klonopin for over a year now. Originally it was for anxiety, but I've come to recognize that as partially a function of of my BPII. The Klonopin has gotten me through some very stressful times, and acts as a buffer against the worst of the dysphoric manias. (Still looking for a main med in that regard...)I'm currently taking 0.625 mg spread out over the day; cutting up 0.5 mg pills to accomplish this. I was on higher doses in the past, which I think added to the depressive side of my bipolar and which might have led to minor cognitive side effects.Tapering down was EXTREMELY difficult. I don't know if this is because the dysphoria still hasn't been adequately addressed otherwise or if it's because of tolerance.Either way, Klonopin is definitely going to stay in my cocktail for the indefinite future.

Probably hooked, but a necessary evil Update - 3/21 So it looks like I'm officially Bipolar II. I do think I'm &quot;hooked&quot; in some way.But it really does have some mood-stabilizing properties and has served as a good buffer against the worst of the dysphoric manias.Original review-Klonopin might have helped me get through one of the most anxiety-provoking periods in my life. I don't know if I could have done it without Klonopin, but I wish I'd tried.The thing is that Klonopin ratchets up my permanent dysthymia one step closer to depression. It also dulls my thought processes. So, while it helps keep me from going off the deep end with anxiety, it also led me to feel worse about myself in a number of ways.And now, with the rough patch largely behind, I want to go off Klonopin. And it is so painful. I basically tolerated to 1 mg/day. After 4 months I've managed to get down almost to 0.5 mg/day, but each step is more and more hellacious. I really resent having gone on Klonopin now. There were some life changes I could have made instead, and I feel like I'm paying for having tried to take what I saw as the easy route.

KLONOPIN Very effective for sleep recuperation qualities!  I've always been a constent dreamer while I sleep and was not getting the deep REM sleep that I needed; my mind would be active all night, even while I slept.  The KLONOPIN allowed me to fall asleep quickly, to stay asleep, and I would not dream - or at least remember any dreams - the entire night.  I awoke rested and less fatigued then without it.  However, my therapist told me some disturbing things about KLONOPIN that made me want to stop taking it long term.  I'm on AMBIEN now and it worked well for about 8 months, but now is not working as well.  Just this week I am considering going back on the KLONOPIN as it has been the absolute best remedy for a good nights rest!

Klonopin UPDATE TO PREVIOUS RATING:  I took Klonopin for over a year and then I had trouble staying awake in the daytime.  When my sleep doctor gave me a prescription for medicine to stay awake, it hit me like a bolt of lightning that I was becoming dependent on drugs to sleep and stay awake!  So I made a decision to get off both drugs and I did.  I suffered from restless leg syndrome until I eventually found out about a whole food supplement of fresh fruits and vegetables called Juice Plus+.  I started taking it for nutritional purposes, not even thinking about Restless Leg Syndrome.  I took it over a year and a lot of my health problems stopped, including restless legs.  I stopped taking it for 10 days while I was on vacation and I realized my restless leg syndrome had come back!  I started taking it again when I got back home and the restless legs stopped!  If you are interested, go to juiceplus.com and find out for yourself.  Since taking Juice Plus+ I don't take any other vitamins because they are contained in the Juice Plus+ formula.  The answer to most dietary deficiencies is getting enough fresh fruits and vegetables and this is an easy way.  The antioxidants fight free radicals and produce better health.I have Obstructive Sleep Disorder with Restless Legs Syndrome.  My sleep doctor first tried Mirapex 0.125 mg but it actually seemed to make my Restless Leg twitching worse!  It did nothing for my insomnia.  I've been using a CPAP (Resmed with nasal pillows and humidifier) for about 3 months very successfully.  My only remaining problem was that I would lie awake tense and twitching for an hour or two before dropping off to sleep.  I simply couldn't relax enough to go to sleep.  I quit taking the Mirapex and he started me on Klonopin 0.5 mg 30 minutes before bedtime.  It has worked very effectively from the first dose.  I did seem to need a stronger dose after a few nights so doubled the dose (per doctor's instructions).  Since I'm doing so well, I'm goin

I stopped taking it for 10 days while I was on vacation and I realized my restless leg syndrome had come back!  I started taking it again when I got back home and the restless legs stopped!  If you are interested, go to juiceplus.com and find out for yourself.  Since taking Juice Plus+ I don't take any other vitamins because they are contained in the Juice Plus+ formula.

Klonopin UPDATE TO PREVIOUS RATING:  I took Klonopin for over a year and then I had trouble staying awake in the daytime.  When my sleep doctor gave me a prescription for medicine to stay awake, it hit me like a bolt of lightning that I was becoming dependent on drugs to sleep and stay awake!  So I made a decision to get off both drugs and I did.

Great, but big downsides I had general anxiety and terrific performance anxiety, and clonazepam had an immediate and dramatic positive effect for me.  I still take it daily, but partly because I can't get off it!  I eventually experience great panic and withdrawal symptoms when I try to wean myself off it, even very slowly.  I suppose I should terminate it on my next vacation, so that process doesn't drive me crazy at the workplace.  The other negative things are sleepiness and trouble getting up.  Ultimately, I think these things actually contribute to my anxiety because I end up being late and in a fog (which makes me feel dull and unprepared).  And then I &quot;need&quot; another dose.  So I think it needs to be taken very carefully.

Klonapin My insurance wouldn't pay for Ambien so my doctor switched me to Klonapin.  It takes longer to work than Ambien but I get a much better, restful sleep and my pain has been reduced significantly.  I have some slight morning grogginess but it is not as bad as the way I felt when I wasn't sleeping.  It is also cheaper than Ambien.  Most days I can get away with only taking 1/2 tablet.

Klonopin Never experienced the severe suicidal depression as when I was on the Klonopin. Scared the daylights out of me...and didn't help sleep at all - just grogginess! Flushed the rest of the bottle after I contemplated jumping overboard on a cruise!!!!!!!! Too scary for ME!

Anxiety rules my life Klonopin keeps my anxiety in check. I am taking 2mg/day right now, and it seems to work, hit or miss. sometimes I still get real bad anxiety like just as I am typing this, so I don't really know how effective it is long term or overall. I gave it a hesitant 7 for effectiveness.I think my body is adjusting to the amount that I take and wants more. I dread having to come off this drug as my doc says we're going to do in a couple months. And I think it blurs my vision a little. Ugh ... Anxiety rules my life...UPDATE: I got upped to 3mg / day now. Hopefully that will help me out a little more. And I got off the geodon and onto risperdal. We'll see how that works. Should be able to rate it in a couple days or so.

Works for REM Disorder but NOT for PANIC I originally was put on Klonopin for my 2 REM disorders. When the wafers came out, my psychiatrist told me to take 1mg wafer for panic attacks. (My current doseage was NOT what it was then. I take 2 2mg wafers at bedtime now and I would only take 1 2mg wafer as needed. I discovered they do not work at all on my panic attacks. I DO attribute this partially to taking 4 mg of wafers everyyy single night. I assume my body is used to that dose and that comes into play. However, even when I do take a bedtime dose for panic, I just end up feeling drugged and still having a panic attack. The best thing-this is almost a NO-FAILURE trick for breaking a panic attack for me. LAUGHTER. It never fails and stops the panic attack instantly. I will actually skip through my house and try really hard to keep a straight face..you can't do it. I end up giggling and the panic attack just dissipates. The movement also is what breaks it up. Ok done rambling!

Doing great! I suffer from panic attacks and agoraphobia for 12 years and several doctors had me on all kinds of cocktails with the worst side effects and very little benefit. I went to a psych who took me off everything save for .75 mg Klonopin 3 times a day. I don't take it as needed and I see a cognitive therapist but I would say my current treatment has me 75% cured. I don't think there is such thing as 100% so I am quite pleased.

Klonopin for Social Phobia Klonopin is remarkably (miraculously) effective until tolerance develops.  Dosage increases help, but my psychiatrist denies that tolerance is an issue when using Klonopin to treat anxiety/phobia and thus is unwilling to increase my dosage beyond 3 mg. per day...  Now I recieve no benefit from the klonopin.  I shall slowly taper off and reassess my options.  I suspect that PRN at a much lower dose may be more suited to my circumstance, but my psychiatrist is resistant.  If it is well established that tolerance is a serious issue when klonopin is used to treat seizure disorders, why is there any question that tolerance IS an issue when klonopin is used to treat anxiety?  We are in the dark ages with regard to the understanding of brain chemistry.

Working OK so far My MD recently prescribed Klonopin for me for persistent anxiety attacks.  I had taken Xanax in the past for the same symptoms but my new MD suggested the Klonopin instead.  I admit that it does get rid of my anxiety/panic attacks and the mental &quot;spinning&quot; in my head but it also makes you feel like you are devoid of any emotion.  I will begin taking Wellbutrin for my depression and combined with the Klonpin I hope I will finally find the right combination.  The only concern I have is with the addictive qualities of this drug...anybody have any info on that?

Finally something that Works! This is simply a miracle.  I have tried so many different medication to sleep (anti-depressants, sleeping pills) and nothing worked.  I had horrible side effects and I still couldn't sleep.I have been using clonazepam for only 3 days but it's been wonderful.  I sleep like a baby ... I wake up with full of energy.  I have been completely exhausted for the past 2 years before I started taking clonazepam.  I even stepped on my treadmill first thing in the morning.  This is a blessing ... hope it last!

Side effects are a bit scary I switch from Xanax to Klonipin and overall I am pretty impressed with the drug as far as it working. Side affects were pretty scary,(at least for me) I felt like my heart was a cement mixer and my GF said she heard it skipping beats multiple times. As far as benzo's go, this is pretty good stuff. I had some nasty side effects but overall it did it's job. BE WARNED: DO NOT MIX THIS DRUG WITH ALCHOL. seriouslly, if you ever pick a time to read the warning labels, this is a good one to read. Unless you want to feel like your a complete zombie and aren't worried about your heart stopping than avoid alchol at all costs on this one. Works best for panic attacks but does a good job on GAD, too. Despite the side effects, it is one of the better anti-anxiety treatments available.

Great for complex PTSD/Bipolar I have found this to greatly relieve my anxiety in relationship to both my complex PTSD and Bipolar (plus a potential diagnosis of Borderline PD).I do take a lot of the stuff. I take 2mg to sleep at night in relation to the disorders, and 0.5 during the day in order to control the anxiety.I know it's habit forming, and was addicted to Imovane for over 3 years with a brutal withdrawal, but at this point I'm willing to make any sacrifices I need in order to stay sane.

Clonazepam for BP insomnia/anxiety I was using Clonazepam during the day for anxiety for my BPD, but having recently having been tapered off Seroquel for sleep (huge weight gain along with Epival), 2 weeks ago I began using Clonazepam as my sole sleeping aid.As opposed to Seroquel, which makes you sleep 12 hours and groggy during your waking hours, Clonazepam makes me fall asleep immediately and wake up alert (now with a combo of Lamotrigine (mood stabilizer) and Wellbutrin (low dose so no manic episodes).I've tried a number of drugs for insomnia, one of which I was addicted to fo over 3 years (Imovane) and had to continue raising the dosage to 15mg/day.   The withdrawal was hell.    I know benzodiazapines have the same potential for addiction/dependency as hypnotics, but I feel it's a lifesaver at the moment and will not be giving it up any time soon.

Does it work with Lexapro? Hi, I think this drug has been great so far. It has eased my anxiety, although I still feel panicked with  my phobia. It has only been two days and will be getting counseling for anxiety/phobia next week. Wanted to know if anyone has used this with Lexapro? I'm scared to use the Lexapro because of the effects. Thanks for any help.

Clonazepam (generic) Update:Since going off Seroquel, I've needed a sleeping aid, and have been taking 2mg of Clonazepam at night for the past 2 weeks.  Absolutley NOTHING has worked before (except Imovane) to help me sleep, and with Clonazepam as a sleep aid, I wake up feeling alert and can begin my day.  Definitely NOT like Seroquel.However, I was hooked on Imovane for over 3 years and needed to increase up to 15mg over time, and the withdrawal was horrible, especially the rebound insomnia.  I have the same worries about Clonazepam for it's addictive qualities, but right now it's working for me far better than anything else for both sleep and anxiety.I am also taking 0.5mg during the day for anxiety, for a total of 2.5mg/day.Initial comment:I've been using this for BPII, 1mg/2x a day, AS NEEDED, and I find it helps for the anxiety and sleep related to this disorder.  Gained MASSIVE amount of weight on Epival(Depakote) and Seroquel, and am hoping a new combo of Lamotrigine (Lamictal) and Wellbutrin will do the trick.

Effectiveness of Klonopin I've used Xanax, Atavan, Vistiril, Valium and Klonopin for panic/anxiety disorder associated with PTSD.Xanas and Klonopin were the most effective for my panic symptoms by far.  I much prefer the Klonopin over Xanax as I feel the same almost immediate relief without as much sedation.

Still not sure... I have been using Klonopin for almost a month. I still feel a bit anxious at times and I do find myself feeling sleepy alot. I am also taking Wellbutrin XL for depression. I have weird dreams, which I know are side effects of both. I have alot of bad dreams, but unfortunatley I am getting used to it because I've been having them for long before starting the medicine. I just switched to these meds from Zoloft. I do feel better since the switch. Still waiting to see if any huge changes take place.

Thank God for Klonipin I have been using this medication for quite some time.  It has been a god send in heading off anxiety as well as stopping an attack fairly quickly.  No dosage changes have been required.  I am quite concerned however that my current Psy MD is inclined to decrease and eliminate usage.

Works for anxiety, but does cause drowsiness I used Klonopin to get a handle on severe anxiety caused by a major depressive episode.  I also used it to help with insomnia caused by Paxil and depression.  It was effective for both.  1 mg was the optimal dosage for me and I tried to only use the Klonopin every 2 or 3 days to avoid tolerance and addiction.  So far just using it a few times a week has worked for me to allow me to sleep well when I take it and keep the anxiety at bay.  Klonopin does cause lots of drowsiness for me at doses higher than 1 mg and this can last for up to 24 hours.  At 1 mg dosage it causes tolerable drowsiness and makes me less anxious in social and general situations.  Now that I have my anxiety under control after several months on Paxil and therapy I find that I don't want the Klonopin so much and will probably discontinue it.  I use Benadryl a couple times a week now for sleeping problems instead of the Klonopin.  (Note:  Don't take Benadryl on a daily basis or it will stop working for insomnia after a few months in many cases)  Taking Klonopin at this point helps me sleep, but I don't get that warm fuzzy &quot;ahhhhh&quot; feeling since my chemistry has probably shifted away from a constant high anxiety state as I went through treatment.

Clonzepam works but only with SSRI Update Feb. 2006- Well, ends up I was suffering from melancholic depression.  That's the reason Klonopin didn't help me fully.  I've added Remeron to the combination below and seem to be doing better.  Check out my rating on Remeron under depression.  I may be dropping Lexapro soon and just trying Remeron, or possibly replacing Lex with wither Effexor or Cymbalta. -------------------------------------------Update Dec. 2005:  Well, I discovered that the problems I was having with Klonopin before were being caused by depression.  Klonopin seemed to be exacerbating my depression.    I discovered that adding Lexapro (10 mg) to Klonopin works better.   I do believe I was on too high a dose of Klonopin before (3 mg a day), as it was making me tired, out of it, unable to concentrate, etc.  I seem to be doing better on a lower dose, usually just 0.5mg in the AM.  Lexapro has diminished the depression that Klonopin was causing.  I tried Lexapro by itself, but it didn't seem to cover the panic/anxiety/agitation well.  It seems like they both work very well together. By the way, I'm back in medical school and doing well. If you can cover your symptoms with just an SSRI, I recommend it.  But adding on a benzo at a LOW dose may help.   Seems like the SSRI also reduced the dose of benzo I needed to stop the panic.   -------------------------Spring 2005: I took Clonazepam for 2 years at a starting dose of 1mg three times a day. It did stop my panic, but it left me feeling like a complete zombie. I couldn't concentrate, and soon I failed a class in medical school, all because of Clonazepam.  I felt tired all of the time and miserably depressed.  Clonazepam only added to this condition.  Withdrawal after so long was hell. I had to decrease very slowly, over a period of one year, and had to take off school to do it.

Not Sure If It's the Best for Long Term I've been struggling with anxiety attacks ever since I moved to New York, about three years now.  I'm currently taking Klonapin along with Prozac and Lamictal.  It's difficult to distinguish between the different meds, but I crave the Klonapin most.  When I wake up in the morning, I can barely finish a cup of coffee before I get that jittery, restless feeling of an anxiety attack, which forces me to take the Klonapin.  I'm in my twenties, so I usually go out with friends on the weekend and have usually been able to handle drinking a few beers.  The next day, however, is tough because as the alcohol leaves my body, I get very tense and get that craving for the Klonapin.  My doctor recently tried to scare me into stopping drinking, threatening that Klonapin along with alcohol is a really bad mix.  Does anyone else have thoughts or experiences with this?

Klonopin Best for GAD and Panic Disorder I have had panic disorder and acute anxiety for most of my life. I have gone throuh treatment with meds like Ativan,Valium, and the dreaded Xanax. Xanax was the worst experience of my life. I just kept increasing the dose until it was out of control. With Klonopin I can take it in the morning and it does not start wearing off until later in the afternoon. Much smoother and does not give you a (high). I strongly recommend it for this disorder. It is also very inexpensive. :)

Klonopin for anxiety/agoraphobia Have been on Lexapro for 3 years 20 mgs. recently went down to 10 mgs.  Have a script for klonopin .125 wafers.  I am leery of taking it daily for fear of addiction.  I know the dose is small but I want to only take as needed if possible.  I need it for travel especially highway distances and have not flown in 10 yrs due to fear of being far from home and panicking and clausterphobia on the plane.  I fear getting stuck in traffic jams on the road.  That is were I had my first panic attack years ago!  Does anyone have experience beating that kind of anxiety with klonopin??? When I have taken it I feel like me again after 20 years of feeling like I could lose it at any time(never have of course!)

Great therapy I cycle my usage as benzodiazapines are addictive and it does lose its effectiveness after time.  I am prescribed 1mg qhs.  once monthly I step down to 1/2mg then give myself about a 5 day drug holiday.

Helpful Sitting in class at school causes me extreme anxiety that I have difficulty controlling.  This medication has helped me to reduce the anxiety and if it occurs I am able to control it and concentrate on my school work.  I am hoping that as the semester continues my grades will improve because of it.  Not a cure all but makes everything a lot more manageable.

Low Dosage is Optimal I cant tolerate high dosages of benzos or ssri....in last several years took .25 mg at night, along with 5 mg prozac....In 1991 when this all started I took 10 mg prozac and .5 mg klonopin....I stopped the klonopin cold turkey in june 2005 and have been ok....i think this is an excellent drug for panic....but am concerned about high dosages...hard to stop, etc.....at .25 mg it gave me confidence but it also enabled me to do other things like excercise,diet, etc that enabled me to have some control on this disorder rather than being overly medicated...it also was easy to come off it....but everyone with panic is differant and you have to do what feels right and works for you..

This might be the one.. I have tried a whole slew of remedies to STAY asleep (getting to sleep is no problem, as I am exhausted every day) including Melatonin, Ativan, Trazodone, Tylenol PM, Ambien, Rozerem, Valium, Xanax, and various other over-the-counter meds. NOTHING WORKED. Generally, I fall asleep quickly, but wake up several times a night, up to 3-4 times, resulting in poor or no real sleep, and exhaustion during the day, and this cycle has been persisting throughout my 20's. I finally got a prescription for Klonopin which I had heard good things about. So far so good. I suspect that it works because it sort of &quot;shuts down&quot; the brain, rather than just &quot;sedating&quot; it. I believe my problem is that my brain just does not enter sleep, and remains active throughout the night, so I'm still consciously thinking to some extent even when I am &quot;asleep.&quot; The result is I end up taking cat-naps throughout a 7 or 8 hour span.I found it has also helped with what I have that doctors call &quot;hypnogogic hallucinations,&quot; where I wake up in the middle of the night thinking I am at work or at a social function and I actually hear and sometimes see details of this. Only when I wake up fully and get out of bed, do these hallucinations subside and / or go away. It is a pretty disturbing phenomenon, when you actually &quot;forget&quot; you're in bed, sleeping. With the Klonopin, I actually have had none of this happen (yet). HOWEVER, there are side effects, at least in my case. Although I feel physically rested, I have not been dreaming at all (or barely), and I wake up a bit groggy and have dizzy spells throughout the day. I'm hoping this will eventually subside, but if it continues throughout the course of treatment, this may be yet another med that's just not worth it. Only time will tell.Wish me luck.

Klonopin/clonazepam Was My Savior! I have had incredible anxiety disorders for as long as I can remember (age 3 is my earliest memory).  Have suffered from PTSD due to child abuse and neglect at early age.  Had my first panic attack when I was 15 or 16 and had thousands of them thereafter. No relief until I started taking Klonopin (then the generic clonazepam) at age 41. Still have serious anxiety problems, but panic attacks all but ceased for a long period of time--getting a bit worse of late, but still &quot;terrific&quot; compared to the hellish attacks I had for most of my life.  Great drug! (Of course this is not the only med I am on, but it is the one that has helped the most with the panic attack portion of my anxiety/PTSD profile).

The horror of Klonopin I gained a lot of weight in a short time with Klonopin, it helped me not at all with my sleep and made me drowsy and depressed.  And of course, since it's a benzodiazopine, you have to stop taking it by reducing it very, very slowly.  An abrupt cessation can cause seizures.

Think I need more I've been in the anxiety and depression club for a little over two years. It came on all of a sudden while driving on the interstate. Blood pressure went off the charts. I was able to make it home but ended up in the hospital the next day for four wonderful days of testing. Sent me home and prescribed Clonazepam at a dose of .5mg twice a day. Did really well until just a couple of months ago. I haven't gone down bigtime yet, but I feel it coming. I have a call into the doctor to increase the medication or possibly add Lexapro to the mix. The fact that it's addictive really doesn't bother me as long as it works. When you lose your life to anxiety and depression, who cares about addiction if the medication allows you to join the human race again? I have little to no side effects other than the empty stomach feeling. So I eat, but haven't gained any weight. Small portions several times a day along with staying active keeps the weight under control.

Rivotril I found this drug very effective as easing my face neuralga.  I have tried to go off it but the side  effects are very bad, so my specialist said that it wasnt worth going off it as i may end up having to take it again. So i just take 1mg of a night.  It still now after all these years makes me tired so i think that it doesnt need increasing.

been on it for 5+ years Klonopin doesn't do much for me with my pain, but it has eliminated my panic attacks.  After 5 or 6 years of taking it, 3mg. per day, It's good FAR outweighs the bad.  This has been the best drug I have ever taken for ELIMINATING panic attacks.  Plus the medication is long acting (12 hrs.) Where as Ativan and Xanax only last about 4 hours.

Klinopine I have been using klinopine for 7 years. It was orginally prescribed for anxiety disorder. I haven't had anxiety in a few years. Im now taking it to help with my moods and sleep. I usually take 1 at night but at times since I have been diagnosed with Bi polar NOS I have to take 2 pills at night(2mg). I don't get any side effects from it accept a good night sleep and it stops the mania. THE DOWN SIDE since I have been on it for so many years if I stop taking it or try to I get really sick. My body is physically depended on it. Other than that I think it works very well.

Withdrawal effects lasted weeks After taking .5 nightly to sleep for 6 months, it stopped working. I've now gone off Klonopin twice. The first time I simply cut the pill in half - within three days, had nausea and vertigo which lasted a couple weeks until I finally went back up to 1 mg. I then tried cutting back by l/4s - that seemed to work although I still had some nausea the first week. The second time I went off I took 3/4 pill alternating with a whole pill for a week; then to 3/4 pill; then 3/4 one day, l/2 the next; and decreased like that for over a month. No side effects!Thanks to all you posters at RemedyFind to clueing me in on the side effects of withdrawal. In March I thought I had food poisoning until I checked this site!

Very Helpful Colazepam has really helped with my anxiety.  I take the minimal amount needed due to my fear of addiction.  It has given me the ability to not walk into a restaurant or mall or movie theater and feel like I want to run out.  It is especially helpful at work where it can be very stressful and bring out my anxiety.  Be careful to not get addicted to the med as that can cause major problems as well.

wipes away your tears In the hospital, nurses gave it to patients just like handing out tylenol.  Frankly, it wipes away people's tears.I used to have a real problem with crying. Every time I spoke about being depressed I'd start choking up. But a Klonopin just... makes me feel normal. And that is a very good thing.  If I'm nervous before speaking to someone about an emotionally sensitive topic...I take a Klonapin and 15 minutes later, I'm ready to talk with very little disruptive emotion that I can notice. No tears, just normal.I also take Klonopin to take care of Restless Legs Syndrome, something that lithium brings on. A nuisance at bedtime, but hardly noticable with just one small Klonopin pill.I find myself smiling to myself recommending it. I sound like a snake-oil saleman in my own mind... but I like it.. and people I've met in the hospital and a few others like it too.  No side effects for me.. but I don't need it very often at all. I take it like I'd take Tylenol for an ache... just once in a while. And it works every time... just 15 minutes.It is addictive to some/many people. I don't seem to have an addiction problem to anything, and not to Klonopin either.  If you ask for a stronger dosage, your Practitioner will likely (and perhaps should) be somewhat concerned.I give it top marks, though I have no idea what it would be like to take every day for months.

Caused weird sleep patterns Klonopin seemed to control anxiety, but it caused me to have weird dreams and sleep patterns. After a few days, I started going pretty psycho and wanting to kill myself. This is not me at all, so we discontinued the medication right away and the weird thought went away within 24 hours (and one good nights sleep I might add!).

Klonopin....just another benzo..??? I find this drug to be usefull...if taken for awhile. It has a better effect if it has a chance to be consistantly in your bloodstream.It is a slower acting benzodiazepine...so if you need a quick fix and are having &quot;out of nowhere attacks&quot; this isn't my first choice. Xanax will stop the attacks faster especially if placed under the tongue for awhile before swallowing.Long term I think it is a more appropriate drug for panic attacks as it is slower to act and stays with you for a longer period of time.This bandaide is better used with an antidepressant.

Lifesavers aren't just candy! I wish I would have known about Klonopin years ago.  I think about how much time I wasted being afraid to fly, thinking I was dying, and worrying about nothing. Klonopin is extremely effective for panic attacks and anti-anxiety of any sort.  I wish more people new about the drug.  It's a lifesaver!

Clonazepam - good drug (use responsibily) I had a terrible time starting back in mid February 2004 - a fear of not being able to fall asleep.  This perpetuated itself into a viscious cycle with a whole host of anxiety issues.  I could hardly work, eat, or function socially.  And sleep?  Forget it!  I literally thought I was going to die!  My general physician tried me on Elavil (for sleep) &amp; Paxil CR 25 mg, Elavil (75mg) &amp; Zoloft (100 mg) - we switched the SSRI at my request.  That didn't work so we tried Buspirone and Elavil.  For me, the side effects of Elavil just outright sucked and then I built up a tolerance.  My body doesn't seem to tolerate SSRI's well (works for like 3 days then turns on me and makes the anxiety worse) and that's where the Buspirone came into play. Finally, she referred me to a psychologist which I already knew personally and he suggested Tofranil PM (similar to Elavil - a tricyclic antidepressant commonly used for sleep disorders.)  That didn't work, so he said OK, let's go for Klonopin (.5mg 3 x daily.)  The result:   I can sleep and don't feel like I'm ready to jump out of my skin!  I also take 15 mg of buspirone (5mg 3 x daily or 7.5mg 2 x daily).  And I'm getting to where I can take it as needed - and less of it.  Yeah, benzos can be addictive - but so is caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and chocolate.  At least two of those can make you nervous and fat along with it!  Clonazepam used responsibly helped save my life and I thank God for it!  If you feel like giving up - don't!  There is a new drug already developed by Sepracor.  The name of this drug is was going to be called Estorra (now renamed Lunesta)  www.sepracor.com.   They will gladly give you info on this promising new treatment for insomnia.  May you all find hope and relief from whatever ails you.  God bless!  ;)

good stuff Out of all the benzos I like this one the best. I started taking it for panic attack a while back and have stuck to it since then, taking it daily instead of Xanax or Ativan PRN. I've actually been able to reduce the dose over time and it still works well to this day. Mainly take it at night to relax before bed (sans martini).

Taking Klonopin This medication was way to strong or too much for me at the time. I don't remember it too well, but my good friend tells me that I acted like I was on drugs. I ran into things, could not think or reason, or stay awake. I tried to drive and they had to make me get out of the drivers seat. I ended up in the hospital afterbeing on this med fora few weeks. I don't think at all that this was the major reason for this, but I am certain that it contributed to it.

Not too bad This little pill has saved my behind a few times when I was extremely manic.The only problem is that when you take it for too long it loses it's effectiveness and me being the ex-druggie that I am would sometimes take more just to get the same effect that I was used too. They work but if you have an &quot;addictive&quot; personality ....take care! And be honest with your Dr about that little point. It does matter in the long run!

my fav. medication HI, I began using Klonopin/clonazapam in 1996 for a neck injury that lead to a condition called cervical dystonia (involuntary neck muscle spasms that are quite severe and very painful). My neurologist prescribed clonazapam and to this day I still take it daily and would not even dream of stopping it.I have not had even one panic attack while on it and really don't even think about it anymore. Now if I should happen to run out of this med, that would be another story altogether! I won't let it happen. All in all an Excelllent medication.****

Restless Leg Syndrome I was on a much higher dose because it was weeks without sleep and I had went into a psychotic like state, before I got treatment. Now after year being on this I only have to take 1 to 2 MG a night to go to sleep. I sometimes stop taking it, dont like do depend on anything but always have to go back on it. Looking back I guess 1 MG is alot less then the 10 Mg I was on years back....oh plus I was on Ambien - hated that, I felt drunk. Oh, note I had to go on the generic a year ago, and it is not as effective as the name brand, told my doctor but he agreed but still my Insurance wouldnt pay for the name brand?...

Works well for me I am among those who have little trouble using Klonopin. It's somewhat sedating (though that's the point), more so if I increase the dose, which I do when I'm having a hypomanic or mixed-states period. It doesn't deepen depression, and does help with depression-associated anxiety.I am dependent on Klonopin, but don't develop tolerance. However, it's not too uncomfortable adjusting the dose - I take a very low dose, 0.25 mg, at bedtime. When I increase it to 1-2 mg during hypomanic episodes, I have no trouble returning to usual dose.Some disruption of sleep if I forget to take a dose, mainly that it seems that I have extended and frequently disturbing dreams, and I feel tense and stressed on awakening.I'd strongly agree that regular monitoring by a psychiatrist or qualified specialist is key to succcessful use.

Not for me I couldn't take it and drive, so had to be home before I could take it.  It did make me sleepy and helped me fall asleep.  My sleep was heavy and drugged, however, and I felt drugged all day the next day.  The drugged feeling was a horrible side effect, my brain was like mud. It wasn't expensive, but since it didn't work well, I didn't think it was cost effective.

Klonopin This drug helped me sleep for about a month.  After that, my FM and other pain got too bad for the Klonopin to be effective, and I took it for another couple months, but it didn't work.  I was always tired.  Then my doctor switched me to Ambien CR 12.5 every night, and now I finally sleep.

Long term usage of Clonazepam for sleep disorders Besides Ambien, Clonazepam has so far been the best choice for me for my sleep disorders, excluding L-trytophan which is no longer available.  My doctor currently has me on a 2mg dosage of 2.5 pills per night, along with 1 Melatonin.  On a bad night, I will take 3-4 Clonazepam and make sure that I have at least 7-8 hours for sleep.  This is the best combination I've had in years.  I would like to try the next Ambien CR or Lunesta, but the doctor said he'd have to take me off Clonazepam if we tried the others and I can't risk losing any sleep trying new meds at this time.  Clonazepam works very well over the long term usage period I've had and don't want to make any changes at this time.  It works so well with the other meds I have to take in Pain Management, that I prefer to stay with it at long as the doctor will give it to me.  I'm in Pain Management for degenerative disc disease in my lower back and have been very successful with the combinations of medications I have to take, and Clonazepam works perfectly for the sleep disorder portion of my conditions.

Klonopin - works great but is highly addictive     I started taking generic Klonopin in May of 2004.  My psychiatrist started me on a dosage of 0.5mg twice a day and had to bump it up to 1mg twice a day after a few months.  I started having to take more pills to get the same calming effect and finally my Dr. upped my prescription to 2mg twice a day.  By then, I was calm, but also feeling like I was &quot;out of it&quot;.  My friends and family told me that I seemed irritable and manicky as I continued the higher doses so I tried to cut down to 1mg twice a day without success.  I ended up checking into a hospital to get off it and spent 14 days in a rehab until my insurance refused to cover more days.  I left the hospital without having finished the taper - I was still on 0.5mg twice a day- and went home feeling miserable.  This is a terribly addictive drug to those of you who are taking it for the first time.  I am now seeing a new psychiatrist who is going to get me tapered to a lower dose because I got back on the Klonopin as soon as I was out of the hospital.     It cuts down on the anxiety but it can also creep up on you and get you hooked. Getting off of it is extremely painful.  I got extremely depressed, anxious, stomach cramps, cold sweats, and muscle aches.

For Insomnia I've had sleeping problems much of my life.  This is the only med so far that works.  I was on 4mg at night but I'm trying to cut down so I take 1mg during the day (PDR says best to keep level amount in blood stream) and 2mg at night for sleep. I do not get much of a hangover effect, just keeps me calmer during the day.  I would like to get off this, all benzos, and try some other sleep med that is not psyicially additive.

I do not get much of a hangover effect, just keeps me calmer during the day.  I would like to get off this, all benzos, and try some other sleep med that is not psyicially additive.

Clonozepam for anxiety I have been taking this for 15? years for anxiety/depression.  It's effect was almostimmediate - I felt calmer, less depressedand more &quot;myself&quot;.  I was taking 1 mg a day initially but was able to cut down to .75 orsometimes, .5/day with the addition of Paxil.I can't go any lower than that without thereturn of old symtoms, so I have stopped tryingto lower it.  I would definitely recommend it.

Worked well for insomnia I started on clonazepam plus 10mg of lexapro for insomnia and depression.  The clonazepam worked great for helping me to get to sleep.  If I woke in the middle of the night I was able to get back to sleep without too much trouble.  I took .5mg of clonazepam right before bed and then when my insomnia was under control went to 1/2 a pill and then tapered off.  I stayed on the lexapro for another 3 months and was still able to sleep, until the side effects of the lexapro (weight gain and night sweats) became too much to bear and I discontinued the lexapro.  3 months later the insomnia is back with a vengence and I am going to try the clonazepam alone.  I'll update in a few weeks and let you know how that works on its own.  I found no side effects with the clonazepam, only the lexapro.

Klonopin I was prescribed Klonopin for my Restless Leg.  I was only on it for about 5 weeks because the side effects were so horrible.  I had no desire to do anything or go anywhere. I had no energy, and to make matters worse, I felt hostile toward everyone.  I wanted everyone to disappear and leave me alone.  The restless leg was only slighly improved on this medication.  And yet I know that this is the drug of choice for RLS and does work well for some people.

Clonazepam works for insomnia and anxiety Clonazepam - is a good drug used responsibly.I had a terrible time starting back in mid February 2004 - a fear of not being able to fall asleep. This perpetuated itself into a viscious cycle with a whole host of anxiety issues. I could hardly work, eat, or function socially. And sleep? Forget it! I literally thought I was going to die! My general physician tried me on Elavil (for sleep) &amp; Paxil CR 25 mg, Elavil (75mg) &amp; Zoloft (100 mg) - we switched the SSRI at my request. That didn't work so we tried Buspirone and Elavil. For me, the side effects of Elavil just outright sucked and then I built up a tolerance. My body doesn't seem to tolerate SSRI's well (works for like 3 days then turns on me and makes the anxiety worse) and that's where the Buspirone came into play used in conjuction with Clonezpam. Finally, she referred me to a psychologist which I already knew personally and he suggested Tofranil PM (similar to Elavil - a tricyclic antidepressant commonly used for sleep disorders.) That didn't do anything because it's in the same class of drugs.  Face it, ppl react differently to meds.  But, I wouldn't knock Clonazepam to the curb so quickly because I don't know what would have happened to me without it.  If all you suffer from is anxiety and sleep issues, try it with 15 - 30 mg Buspirone.  You might just get relief and that's what we're all here looking for right?  :)  Good luck.

Klonopin as part of Seroquel and klonopin are the two major elements of my &quot;drug cocktail&quot;.  I also take a small amount of trazodone.  All these drugs help me sleep.  Klonopin's particular contribution is to keep away 'mixed states' where I get very agitated.  I really only rarely get pure depression,  so all my drugs are anti-mania agents on some level.    Again,  this is a good combination of drugs for someone who has ongoing problems with mania, and the trouble with sleep that usually goes along with it.  Klonopin is helpful,  but not powerful enough for me without seroquel.  The trazodone helps a little,  but only in small doses because it is an anti-depressant, so there is a mania risk at higher doses.    I have taken a lot of drugs that have not worked------  My impression is that klonopin is rarely used long term because of addiction fears.  This keeps some people I believe from getting the help they need.  Yes,  to get off klonopin you must go very slowly,  but it is not like once you are on the drug you crave more and more like with alcohol!   This is a myth for most people,  and since 'mixed states' can drive a person to suicidal ideation,  the medical community better get its act together on this one.     Ativan is also  helpful for many people and is a similiar drug(same category) as klonopin.

Klonopin .5mg Saved Me Klonopin has saved me since my attack in 2002. I have been on it for 3 1/2 years now and went from taking 3 a day to 1/2 - 1 a day.  Tried coming off of it but that was a big mistake. Anxiety worsened and panic attacks daily. If anyone needs information or has any questions you can email me at EaglesFan08201@comcast.net and I am willing to discuss this drug with you. No other medication worked for me.

klonopin a life saver for me This drug was a lifesaver to me. Literally. I was having constant panic attacks, during which I would space out and feel like I was dying.  It felt like my BP was so low, I was going to faint.  My hands would tingle, I felt like I was falling out, and it was unbearable.  After about a year of these symptoms and may visits to my cardio doc (I have an arrythmia) and my GP (read:money money money) my GP finally said, look, take this klonopin, in an hour you will feel fine.  You are suffering from panic.  I snorted, laighed and finally consented, because really I had too much to bear.  If he had prescribed heroin I would have taken it as willingly.  I figured, as long as I am sedated till the cardio docs figure out the &quot;real &quot; problem I will take it. BAM! One hour after taking it I felt fine.  Have felt fine ever since.  I take it roughly 3x per day, but not on any regular schedule.  Some people take benzos to feel high.  I felt high all the time.  I take this drug to not feel high.  When I wake, I wait till I start feeling &quot;high&quot; then I take my klonopin.  Then after it kicks in I feel fine.  I wati until I start feling &quot;high&quot; again, then I take another. Usually mid afternoon.  Then I wait until I start feeling high again, anfd I take my last dose ofthe day.  And i am fine till I go to sleep and wake up the next day. And then we start all over again. I have heard lots of horror stories about this drug. I say, use what works.  And use it acccording to you doc.  They know what they are doing.  This product has savedme from a life of &quot;permastoned&quot; and given me a functional life again.   Try this if youfeel like you live in a dream, if you feel like you are detached, or like you are outside your body.  It works wonders.

clonazepam works extremely well.Still working well. I have started taking this slightly more regularly (six days in a row for the first time ever). Perhaps the change in season has intensified my anxiety. I am slightly nervous about this. Can anyone attest to its long term effectiveness?

Awesome in combo with Luvox This medicene was prescribed to me to ease tension and anxiety when dealing with social anxiety and phobias in relation to my OCD.  Klonopin works within minutes to alleviate most all panic.  Unlike the Ativan, it stays in my system for a great deal of time.  After a time, it feels as though I've built up a resistance, but it is as comforting as a security blanket.  If i don't have it, my body doesn't go crazy or anything, so i don't find it near as addicting as the Ativan.

very helpful this is probably the most helpful medication that has been prescribed for me along with the Wellbutrin.  There are no side effects.  I litterally feel nothing when I take it.  I have built no tolerance, feel no &quot;buzz&quot; from it.  However, I hate the idea of being on a benzo diazapine and continually push my Doc to transition me off to Topamax and Trileptal which do not work as well and have side effects.  i have to get over my mental block.

Contraindicated in MDD My GP prescribed this for excruciating episodes (5 days awake, followed by 3 of narcolepsy) insomnia and anxiety when I came in with a back problem. It did/ sort of/ work for the insomnia- the second day I took .5mg in the morning and 1mg at night- and I got about 2 or 3 hours' sleep. However, Klonopin has a strong tendency to excerbate depression and it definitely did so with me, leading into a life-threatening MD episode.

Does a great job on my panic, as needed For me, I only use it as needed. &quot;As needed&quot; could mean for a week solid or only a few days a month. It just depends on my level of panic and anxiety. I take anywhere from 1/4 to 1/3 of a 1mg tab.I rated it a 9 for effectiveness because I can still feel the worry (if I'm very bad at the time), but I have never had a panic attack on the Klonopin. Life is just managable with it during my panicky times.I gave it a 7 for lack of side effects because if I take it for several days it builds up and I get ever so slightly foggy. Foggy, but not anxious.

My magic bullet *REVISED* I take klonopin not only at bedtime, but also twice during the day. Not only does it allow me to sleep without drugging me until I lose consciousness, it brings my pain levels down from a high seven to a three, when combined with tramadol. We seem to have finally hit upon a medication regimin that actually works for me. The only side effect is a not-at-all unpleasant tranquil feeling. Now instead of constantly screeching at the kids because I'm tired and in pain, I have the patience and wherewithal to be a good mommy to them. I definitely recommend this medication and wouldn't be without it. My doctor says it does have the potential for causing addiction, but since I know FM's rarely get addicted, I'm not worried. Even if I did become addicted, so what? I have to take it for the duration anyway, so stopping will never be an issue. And even if it were, it's worth the price to feel better than I have in nearly ten years. I'm almost back to my old self again.*Update: 11-8-2005*Klonopin was prescribed to help with my insomnia and restless legs that accompany FM, and I continued with it because I also found it helped with my pain when combined with tramadol. In the beginning, it worked wonderfully. Unfortunately, as time passed, the side effect of drowsiness far outweighed the benefits I was getting from it, and the pain-killing benefit wore off over time. I had no trouble stopping this medication, although admittedly that could be because I kept tapering down in dose, trying to find a dose that was effective without making me sleep twenty hours a day. I think this could be a useful medication, just not for me, at least not now. My reaction to meds varies, so I may come back to this one later on.

Moderately effective It works decently well with mild anxiety. If you have moderate stress it is worth taking. On the other hand, if your anxiety is severe, try something else stronger. Careful if you drink, as it magnifies effect of alcohol.

Benzos are Best I am a long time sufferer of severe anxirty with depression and have tried numerous meds; ssris, buspar, tcas with absolutely no avail. was taking xanax .25 twice a day but made me very queasy, so my psych. put me on klonopin 2mg x 2 a day and 4mg at bedtime. This has made a considerable difference with my anxiety and insomnia. It has also helped quite a bit with my depression. Benzodiazepines are the only thing that even made a dent in my symptoms. I highly recommend this drug or any benzo for that matter to anyone suffering from severe anxiety or panic attacks. Hopefully this will be somewhat helpful to someone. :-)

Benzos are Best I am a long time sufferer of severe anxirty with depression and have tried numerous meds; ssris, buspar, tcas with absolutely no avail. was taking xanax .25 twice a day but made me very queasy, so my psych. put me on klonopin 2mg x 2 a day and 4mg at bedtime. This has made a considerable difference with my anxiety and insomnia. It has also helped quite a bit with my depression. Benzodiazepines are the only thing that even made a dent in my symptoms. I highly recommend this drug or any benzo for that matter to anyone suffering from severe anxiety or panic attacks. Hopefully this will be somewhat helpful to someone. :-)

klonopin a life saver for me I have bipolar 1 with severe anxiety. For many years I smoked pot to calm my anxiety.  When I tried to quit I got the worst anxiety headaches.  It wasn't until I was put on Klonopin that they finally stopped and my anxiety melted away.  Beware of tolerance problems.  I know many people have a tendency to need more of these benzos to produce the same effect.  I have been lucky and steadfast in that I stayed on the same dosage (1.5 mg a day).  I went off it for a couple of years when I was put on Depakote and Seroquel but my anxiety soon came roaring back.  I was put on Gabitril which worked for a while but am recently back on Klonopin and feeling much better.  When I renewed treatment I started using the generic Klonopin.  Not as strong but still works for me.

Good stuff so far Besides making me pretty sleepy at night and groggy in the morning, I'm enjoying the benefits of it so far.  My anxiety level is defintely lowered.  I haven't had a &quot;heart attack&quot; in over a week.  My doc has me taking .5 in the morning and .5 at night.  Update: now taking it 3x per day if needed.  I may be building up a tolerance.  I still find it quite helpful.

Clonazepam: Side Effects I am taking Clonazepam to control anxiety and seizure activity. Also it is used to help with my mood swings and anger problems when I seem to get intense or I think about something that makes me angry. The only possible side effect I am experiencing at the Moment are mild to severe dizzy spells and disorientation and sudden blackouts that I don't recall having. I don't know if anybody out there has experienced these things but I would like to hear from someone out there if they have experienced similiar side effects and how long they last and if they go away.

great for sleep but lasts too long klonopin is a great sleep aid. relaxing and keeps me asleep for 7 or so hours. unfortunately, the sedation can last well into the next afternoon due to its long half life. therefore, i cannot use it regularly. also, i don't seem to have many dreams when i use it, which i suspect i should be dremaing some.

relief My anxiety attacks were so bad I was afraid to leave my apartment.  People were an enigma to me and I kept my distance.  Perhaps I have social anxiety disorder in addittion to being bipolor.  Buspar was like taking plecebos for me.  Since being on Klonopin I'm much better, and my doctor closely monitors it so I don't get addicted, though this has never been a problem for me.

Klonopin is like other Benzos I'm a pharmacist and know this the kinetics of these drugs. I've also tried many benzos and hypnotics.  Klonopin tolerance builds to the point where I need 5 mg just to get asleep.  After 2 weeks, I'm relaxed and alert during the day, but it it takes a lot to put me down.  That's why I rotate it with other benzos and hypnotics and antihistamines.  5 days off and I'm back to sleeping with only .5 mg a night for 3 nights.  Long half life mean that it last during the day. It has a decent onset of 3-4 hours for me, so don't expect instant impact.  Luckly it's absorbed throught the stomach so it works even with food.

Klonopin I have been taking this med since August of this year - my Dr perscribed it to go along with my Zoloft for panic disorder, I'm supposed to take it .25mg two times a day(once in the morning,once at night), and then .25mg during the day if needed, but I don't.Benzo's scare me because of the possibility of dependancy and withdrawl symptoms, so I take it on an 'as needed' basis, which is usually once a week ,or once every two weeks. When I do take it, it really helps with the anxiety symptoms, it's a suttle 'take the edge off' and the only side effect that I have had with it is it makes me sleepy. Weighing the risks of becoming dependant on it is something each individual has to do themselves, I am thankful that I do not need this med. as much as it is perscribed for me, but I understand that some people might. Hope this has been helpful, email me anytime if you have any questions !

A True Miracle Starting sometime during the 6th grade, I began to suffer from severe anxiety and insomnia, which often, indirectly, sent me rolling down the mountain of emotions into a ditch of depression.For the longest time, I couldn't figure out why I was unable to communicate with people, and it didn't make sense to me that I knew exactly what I needed to do to succeed in life, yet I couldn't seem to do it!I ended up dropping out of high school, which is ridiculous for somebody like myself, and I'd isolate myself, hiding behind a computer screen.Eventually, I realized that my problem was anxiety.  I was afraid of everything... even the smallest and seemingly most insignificant things caused me to panic.I started forcing myself to face my fears, and it helped to some extent. I still, however, found myself unable to be productive at work.  Hell, I was feeling anxiety about even DOING my work!The sleep problems were really beginning to take a toll on me as well, and I started to feel like there was no point in life.  I was just a little, fairly intelligent ball of consciousness, locked inside of a vault, doomed to wrestle with my paradoxical thoughts for the rest of eternity.Then I, by chance, tried using Clonazepam as a sleep aid.  It worked, which was expected, but that wasn't what caught my attention.  The next day, the world seemed... different.  I was finally able to put all the philosophies I'd believed in all along to use.  I could act without irrational fear.  I could speak to people.  I could actually live!I don't know to describe the impact this drug as had on my immediate life.  I haven't been using it for long, and I'm very careful not to use more than 0.5mg per night.  I just hope it keeps working its wonders long enough to prove to my mind, once and for all, what I've known for years but have been unable to accept-- that the world isn't such a scary place.If this drug were a human being, I'd throw a party in their honor

Klonopin for long term use I have been using klonopin for several years now and I find that it is effective for treating my anxiety.  However, I have also found that after using klonopin steadily for more that 2 weeks makes it less effective.  So instead of simply increasing my dosage to compensate, I stop taking the klonopin for a couple weeks or a month. I don't want to become addicted to high dosage of a drug that I really need and prefer using over other anti-anxiety drugs.  So I suffer through mild anxiety and do CBT as my treatment for those periods of time.

Klonopin I went from taking 3 mg of Xanax to 3 mg of Klonopin.  I like the Klonopin better because it lasts longer, although I always have my Xanax as a backup if I need it.  I don't like taking meds., but I have now come to realize that these are a part of my life and I will probably be on meds. the rest of my life. I still experience anxiety, but have had no panic attacks for a very long time.  I can, however, feel when one is coming on and have taught myself to breath through it. For now, I'm still taking one day at a time and when the stress gets bad, I have to get tough!

klonopin use and withdrawal This med has been very helpful to me. I have been on it for awhile but have only had to cut back on it one time. Use it as you need it but when PTSD quiets down reduce the dosage a bit at a time in conjunction with the doc. When reducing med I went from 2.5 mg/day to just .5 mg a day.  I reduced every three weeks with the fourth week alternating between the new lower dose and the one coming down. There is no magic here, I think its just really important not to rush the titration and the withdrawal effects will be minimal.

Klonopin usage and withdrawal Klonopin had been very, very helpful to me. I eventually got up to 2.5 a day and I had to go on a taper schedule to ween back so it would continue to be effective during times when I needed it. Tapering down was not as difficult as I heard it would be.  It needs to be done very slowly.  My psychiatrist is very, knowlegable. We reduced a half mg every three weeks with a 4th week that alternated between the current dose and the next quarter to half mg. down.  Withdrawal effects very minimal. You can't rush this, but you will do fine.

Klonopin Wafers 0.5 I am a disabled vietnam vet, with a bad case of PTSD, and anxiety disorder.  When I feel the sweats or become shaky, I have found Klonopin to be an excellent way to relieve my symptoms temporarily, by making me forget what set me off in the first place.  I get zero side effects, except sometimes i get very forgetful and feel kind of stupid and slow.  i am not sure if that has anything to do with taking Xanax 2mg long acting every morning to keep me cool and bring down my anxiety level as a propholactic method.

I get zero side effects, except sometimes i get very forgetful and feel kind of stupid and slow.  i am not sure if that has anything to do with taking Xanax 2mg long acting every morning to keep me cool and bring down my anxiety level as a propholactic method.

A WONDERFUL MED FOR PANIC AND ANXIETY Its a wonderful med for panic and anxiety. I have suffered with anxiety and panic attacks for 10 years now, and I have been taking Zoloft for the duration, but I have had my ups and down with it. I have been given xanax and valium for the hard time but nothing has worked like this ! The others had some types of side effects the xanax made me feel giggly drunk,, and the valium made me feel mushy and both didnt have long lasting effects! Dont get me wrong its better than feeling anxious or panicky BUT,,,, the klonopin has brought me to a normal level where I just feel like I used to before all this. It doesnt make me sleepy or groggy nothing !! And it seems to last all day and sometimes even into the next! I fall asleep easy and stay asleep. I love it ! And,,, I dont have to take this one as prescribed 2x a day. It seems like when Im feeling really bad I will take 1 and I feel better for days, weeks, I dont need to take more. I have been taking it for 2 months now as needed and I wouldnt take anything else. Writing a book here I know, but I am the type that is terrified of taking new meds or meds in general but with this one I have NO FEAR, and it makes me feel normal.. ITS GREAT!!!

Temporary This drug is a quick fix. If you can help it don't take it every day. It's easy to build tolerance, so that you need more and more of the drug. Best to complement taking this drug this with therapy, exercise, and meditation.

Good stuff so far Besides making me pretty sleepy at night and groggy in the morning, I'm enjoying the benefits of it so far.  My anxiety level is defintely lowered.  I haven't had a &quot;heart attack&quot; in over a week.  My doc has me taking .5 in the morning and .5 at night.

Panic Disorder Taking clonazepam and alprazalom have allowed me to stop making constant trips to the ER thinking I'm having a heart attack. People who say that benzos are no good obviously have no experience with severe panic attacks.  Steve L

Effective but side effects outweighed benefits After a sleep study four years ago (having my sleep monitored electronically) I was prescribed chlonazepam.  The drug was quickly effective in increasing my REM sleep from about 2% to the low end of the normal range of about 18% (as evidenced in a second sleep study several weeks later).  My sleep disorder involves me having no difficulty sleeping long, but without getting any real rest while I am unconscious.*HOWEVER*, the original dose prescribed (2 of the smallest tablets) taken at 10pm at night turned me into a zombie until about 3pm the next day (I missed a day of work).  I would strongly suggest that anybody trying this for the first time do so on a day when you don't have to go to work in the morning.  Note, also, that I rarely take any other medications, drink alcohol or even drink coffee for that matter so I may be more sensitive than others to drugs in general.After adjusting the dose myself to 1/2 a pill every other day at 10pm, I continued for about 2 months on this regimen.  The medicine did the job it was supposed to do, but I was still experiencing enough residual grogginess and lack of focus in the &quot;drive to work&quot; part of the day to make me decide to cease using the pill entirely.  The &quot;do not operate heavy machinery&quot; warning should definitely be heeded.I experienced no addictive effects of the pill.My &quot;words of wisdom&quot; from this experience are to listen to your own body, and to not be afraid to cut your dosage if you feel your doctor's prescription is too high (even if it means cutting a pill in half or quarters).  Everybody's body is different and your doctor is only making a best guess first time around.  Since your doctor can't monitor you from day-to-day, trust your own instincts.  Obviously, though, you should never increase your dosage without consulting your doctor.

Panic Disorder Klonopin has worked great for my panic disorder and general anxiety. I also use xanax at nighttime before bed, it really helps me not to be so anxious in the early am when I get up.

Depressed instantly I have tried this medication four times in my life. Each time prior I just tried to blame my sad reaction on some crazy part of life I was going through. Whether it was other medication interracting or just after the husband beat me, not even two months after my first brain surgery, or perhaps when I had my first grand mal seizure after a year of control. But no matter how you look at it, it was always just with this drug. And instantly after I took it. I had loss of hair as well. But everytime I used this drug, I instantly got very sad and emotional, and would bet very clumsy with my walk...almost drunk like. Just didn't work wonders with me, as where I am fighting for most drugs to show me their wonders with my complicated case. I am getting there slowly. Perhaps since this second brain surgery I just had, the drug Topamax I just started a few months ago will continue working. It has been 77 days. I will just keep Klonopin out of it.I like to be happy! Sincerely,Heather J Coburn
