Accolate Had Unpleasant side Effects I just felt awful - mentally and physically.  Can't quite describe it.  I will not take this again.  Think it caused some degree of nausea.  Didn't feel there was much benefit.  My husband had a similar bad experience.

Accolate for allergies I found the Acoolate helped reduce the severity of my allergies by dramatically reducing my asthma.  After being on it for only 4 years I had reduced my inhaler use from 10-20 times a day to half a dozen time a year.  Now I am almost asthma free with only the occational flare up during early spring and late fall when my allergies are at their worse.  It can cause problems with your kidney thought so you should have regular check up to amke sure it is not bothering you.

Accolate My pulmonologist didn't want to try me on this because he said it was only truly effective on asthmatics with aspirin sensitivity (which I am not.)  My primary care doctor (Internal Medicine) wanted me to try it at a time that my asthma wasn't being controlled as well as it should.  Main problem, I had to stop my theophylline as accolate can't be taken with it.Accolate wasn't helping much but I don't know whether to blame that on accolate itself or lack of theophylline that I had been on for 30 years.  I took it for 2 weeks and went back on the theophylline.

I took accutane for 5 months during my mid twenties for moderate cystic acne.  I am now 31, and have only had a few breakouts since my treatment.  Accutane completely eliminated my bumps and made my skin glow like never before!!!!!!  I did have terrible dreams, extremely dry and senstitive skin and lips... and it was, at times, a rough 5 months!  But 100% worth the result and the $$$$!  I would recommend to anyone not wanting to become pregnant in the next year or so!!!!!!!!

I was on Accutane 15 years ago.  The side-effects were horrible - every part of my body was incredibly dry and cracked.  I was very depressed but I thought it was due to the acne (I would call in sick because I didn't want anyone to be repulsed by my face) and the dryness I experienced with the medication.  Within a few months, nothing mattered other than that my skin was clearing up.  I was on the Accutane for six months and, since then, I have had less than five flare-ups (meaning a pimple that is gone the next day).  My advice - make sure your dermatologist refers to the iPledge Program and follows the instructions to the letter.  If you are unsure about anything or have any questions/concerns, talk to your doctor before taking the medication!  Depression can be a major complication - and the defects to a fetus can be horrendous and devastating.  With that said, I would take Accutane in a heartbeat if it became necessary again...

Treat yourself I've had acne since I was 25 and was able able to control it with oral antibiotics and differn.  It improvd a lttle as I got older, but never went away.  I finally found a sympatheic Derm who agreed to put me out of my misery and prescibe Sotret.  He calls it a miracle drug and I just hope he's right.  So far things have been good w/ just small, surface pimples that go away quickly and don't scar.  Don't be afraid!!  I had post-partum depression after my second pregnancy, and went through a short period of treatment w/ Paxil.  I felt no signs of depression during Sotret therapy.  My hair looked awesome and my body felt great (I work out a lot).  Just be aware of the worsening.  It was crazy and painful, but it only lasted about 6 weeks.  Just go to your Derm a lot for injections.

good while it lasted I took this drug for a few months, and it pretty much cleared up ALL my acne.  I had tried every cream and treatment before accutane.  I had acne pretty bad, on my chest, face, and back.  The only bad part was having to do blood tests once a week (I think?).  Of course this drug is known to cause bad birth defects so don't take it if you're planning on getting pregnant!  I was going to continue taking this medication but my triglycerides went up a bit too far and so my doctor took me off of it.  So now it's 2 years later and my acne has partially come back...so I think that's because I got off too early.  Also I'm still 18 so I'm still acne prone.  I recommend this medication but be careful with it and don't go off too early if you can avoid that.Also I wanted to mention that this medication made me gain weight (or that weight gain might've been from the birth control I had to take while on the medication).

The long journey with Accutane I started using Accutane my Sophomore year of high school (2001).  Back then, I do not think there was a 6-month limit on dosing.  I have used it on and off, and am now on the last month of my current dosing.  I have probably taken the stuff cumulatively for 3 years.My acne had never reponded to traditional treatments: salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, differin, antibiotics.  Retin-A was somewhat effective.  Each time I took accutane, my face would get worse the first 2 weeks, then gradually get better.  Every time I stopped taking it, 1 month later my acne was back in full swingSide effects were usually noticeable the first week.  The worst of them initally was the CHAPPED LIPS.  I always carry Carmex with me, now.  After stopping treatment my lips stay chapped for a few months, but gradually get better.One day during Freshman year of college (2003-2004) I decided I wanted to increase to 80mg/day.  The doctor said OK.  Within 2 weeks I had blood on the stool.  I immediatley stopped!Currently I am taking 40mg and 80mg, alternating every day.  The risk of rectal bleeding is still there (it happened a few times) but as long as I drink a lot of water and take some milk of magnesia once in a while, it's not usually a problem.  My face, right now, is as clear as it has ever been in my life since I've had facial acne.  My back has cleared up by about 50% (which is a major improvement).  I rarely have breakouts.  However I am about to complete this 6-month period, and wonder what lies in the future.

acne free for 5 years Well Accutane had its side effects.. And like many others have said the cracked lips - bloody noses were probably the worst.  I had a very strange incident with the accutane that I have about an inch and a half long pocket of puss along my cheek area just below the top layer of skin.. it looked absolutely horrific.. My skin was good for about 5 years.  and then it all came back.. They tried to get me to take it again and I refused.  My mother insisted it ruined my skin because of the scarring that was left after the acne.  The cost without insurance is extremely high.  But easy to take twice a day and in the packet as it unfolds lists about 20 side effects and warnings.  This is a very serious drug.  and pregancy is out of the question.  and would consider waiting a long time after treatment to think about having a child.

Expensive but worth every penny The most annoying side effect of accutane was the dry lips.  My lips would chap and split very easily, and I was dilligent about using chapstick.  It helped to dry out my oily skin, and my cystic acne was gone.  The best thing is that it was gone for at least over a year after I took it.  After about a year after stopping, I started getting acne again but nowhere near as severe as I originally had.  I did not experience any depression or suicidal thoughts while on accutane.  I have not had any long term side effects that I have noticed.  I haven't tried to have kids yet, and I don't think it should be a problem, especially since it was so long ago now.  If cystic acne is ruining your life and you've taken antibiotics and tried every cream in the pharmacy, this is the right drug for you.  Unrelated to myself, a girl I went to high school with had such bad acne, her acne had acne.  She tried everything under the sun, and the only thing that worked was a combo of topical treatment plus accutane.  I'd be willing to bet that accutane saved her life, because she was extremely depressed because of her skin condition.  The only thing that stinks about accutane is that it is very expensive, and some insurances won't cover it because they do not consider it medically necessary.  Until a generic comes out, cost is going to be an issue for people trying to choose an acne medication.

Severe Acne treated I had lost hope that I would ever find that medicine that would help me get rid of my acne. I was diagnosed with acne vulgaris, and took three types of antibiotics, and some hormonal pills in hope that the acne would disappear. My doctor finally put me on Accutane, and it has done wonders. Everyone has been shocked at how my face looks now, after only 6 month of being on the drug. Of course I have to deal with the side effects such as continuous dryness of mucous tissue, and being really careful not to get pregnant. However I have not had any new pimples in more than 3 months.

Accutane RUINED my life!!!!! What a MISTAKE I made taking accutane! A few months into treatment I started developing food allergies/wheezing and frequent urination! My doctor kept telling me that there was no way Accutane was causing this! WELL....years after taking it I am still plagued with several food allergies/sensitivities and I have been diagnosed with a very painful disease called interstitial cystitis. The accutane DESTROYED the lining of my bladder and now I live in pain!!! It feels like battery acid was poured on my bladder when I eat basically anything...with a few exceptions. I now am a chronic pain patient with a rare disease that developed during accutane treatment. OH...and I still have acne. Accutane is NOT worth the risks. I have met several people that developed bladder diseases and bladder bleeding while on Accutane.

amazing results This is what cured me of my cystic acne.  It was the last resort, but I have amazing skin now.  I had to stay on it a bit longer than the recommended time, but it worked and I have been acne free for a couple years now.  The only downside was it really dried my skin out as well as my lips.  I was constantly putting on lotion and chapstick.

Accutane also for hydradenittis supportiva Accutane is a very effective medication in spite of all the side effects.  I understand the need for the strict packaging but for an adult with arthritis in my hands, just opening those packages was very difficul and sometimes very frustrating.  My doctor is now refusing to use Accutane due to increased reports of possible liver damage - now she plans to use Cleomyacin instead (a wide spectrum powerful antibiotic) before she prescribed the cleomyacin with the acutane - I am praying that I do not have another attack of hydradenittis supportiva

Accutane-best last resort I'd always had mild acne,  but nothing that was not controlled with over the counter products.  My face progressively got worse through college until my face exploded into severe cystic acne (we're talking cysts on top of cysts here) after I turned 20. I tried various treatments with little to no success--birth control, retin-a, topical and oral antibiotics, etc.  People I didn't even know remarked on how painful my face looked.  It was very inflamed and red and just ick.  Eventually my dermatologist put me on Accutane and it was a miracle.  People were remarking on how clear my face was,  I was in heaven.  I know accutane is very controversial but I never really experienced any severe side effects.  I wasn't depressed,  actually I'd never been happier.  With a good moisturizer and proper skin care regime my face was not too dry.  One drawback to Accutane,  it is very pricey.  Mid-way through my treatment I went off my parents insurance due to age and we paid out of pocket.  It was over $600 for one month of accutane so we ended up ordering it from Canada.  There is a program for low-income people to get accutane,  but I didn't qualify.  3 years later though my face is starting to break out here and there... but I think that is more related to diet and lack of exercise than anything.  If you've tried everything under the sun with no results,  Accutane may be a good option.  Despite its controversial nature,  I would do it again in a heartbeat. For people really disheartened by their acne it can be life changing.

Highly Recommended I started on accutane when I was 16-17 years old.  At the time I was severely depressed by my acne.  I'd have to say that getting on the medicine was the single best thing I had ever done.  In retrospect, I remember that it caused severe dry skin but on the same note, it was this dry skin that allowed me to see that my acne was going away.  For months after I finished the three month treatment, my skin kept getting better and better.  I am now 22 years old and I have a small breakout here and there, but the important thing is that it is always controllable by regular means (before Accutane I dreamed of being one of the lucky ones for whom Stridex and Oxy actually worked.  I'd weight the risks and benefits with a doctor.  If your acne is not that bad, then I would not recommend treatment with accutane.  I tried it again when I was 18 for a breakout, and immediately quit taking it.  I realized that it wasn't bad enough and therefore the side effects were not worth it.  Effective remedies tend to have cons that one must deal with, accutane is no different.

Worked pretty darn well I took Accutane (amnesteem) for 9 months. I started on 30mg 1x a day, then increased to 2x a day. It really cleared up my skin a lot, and I have barely had even one pimple, blackhead, or whitehead since going off of it. My skin is much less oily as well. The negative side of this was the side effects, and they were TERRIBLE. My lips, eyes, face, and inside of my nose were dry for the entire course of the treatment. I had to constantly put vaseline in my nose or eyedrops in my eyes. I also got severely depressed, but then again I have always been depressed so its hard to say which it was. And towards the end of the treatment I started to get a ringing in my ears, which went away once I stopped taking it. All in all it was worth the side effects.

Very effective shame about the side effects. I'm on my second course of roaccutane, having had some spots return 12 months after my first course.  The first month can be tough side effects wise, not just because it can be uncomfortable, sore skin and lips, itchy eyes, but mainly because of the effects on your appearance - very red lips, peeling and flaky skin, red raw areas that are hard to cover with make-up.  But it gets better - after a month the side effects become less severe and with good products you'll be able to disguise the side-effects pretty effectively (see below).The only other major bind is that it increases the toxicity of alcohol by over-working your liver, which means a serious reduction in alcohol tolerance, horrendous hangovers, combined with the stress your giving your liver you need to really restrict your alcohol or cut down altogether.The upside is it works, although spots can come back, they will not be as severe and you can have multiple courses until they disappear for good.To minimize side effects I recommend a good lip balm such as nivea with sunscreen, or lancome juicy tubes for the ladies. Some good quality moisturizer (I recommend decleor aromessence angelique oil followed by their nutri-delice moisturizor), or if you're in the sun Elemis essential day cream has sunscreen in it.  You also need to exfoliate regularly to remove the dead skin, but most bead based exfoliants are too harsh for your hyper-sensitized skin.  I recommend using a muslin cloth to remove your cleanser.  Both Eve Lom, and Liz Earle cleansers are excellent products designed for use with and supplied with muslin cloths.To cover up Prescriptives foundations are the best, as is their Camouflage cream.Isotretinoin is available on the NHS, don't know the cost privately.

Best treatment for my daily headaches Years ago I took T3 once a day and it was great.  Now I need it 2-3 times a day.  I worry about tolerance and rebound.  I'm only 39 and hope for another half a life, so the increase concerns me.  Tylenol and codeine aren't particularly good for the liver and kidneys, either.  Although T3 daily with Maxalt 1-2 times per week work the best for me, I'm concerned about the longterm effects.

Eeehhh...  It's okay. I have used Tylenol III for years as a supplement when I have had little nagging migraines that just wont go away.  Normally the Zonegran takes care of them but occasionally one will leak through.I have had much better luck with Panlor.  It is far and away better that Tylenol III.  It is more expensive since there is no generic. There is some slight chemical difference in the two mostly the Panlor has a bit of caffeine in it.  The codeine is a bit different in some way  hey  Im not a chemist.  I just know its much more effective.  Strange thing is it has less codeine in it.The usual codeine side effects apply to both.  We all know how they feel.

Tylenol with Codeine Before I switched to Lortab, I tried Tylenol #4 (and previously, Tylenol #3 from a few different doctors).  The pain relief was minimal, although it did make me a bit goofy (which helped me feel better, even if I still hurt).  Unfortunately, codeine seems to make me *quite* nauseous, so I wind up having to lie down... so it doesn't help me to function much.I did find it was somewhat less constipating than Lortab/Vicodin, which is a bonus.  However, the effectiveness seems to wear off VERY quickly with this particular drug -- after 2-3 days, it's not working at all anymore.
acetaminophen-codeine	Endometriosis	2004-11-06 00:00:00		3.0	3.0	5.0	3.0	Tylenol with Codeine Before I switched to Lortab, I tried Tylenol #4 (and previously, Tylenol #3 from a few different doctors).  The pain relief was minimal, although it did make me a bit goofy (which helped me feel better, even if I still hurt).  Unfortunately, codeine seems to make me *quite* nauseous, so I wind up having to lie down... so it doesn't help me to function much.I did find it was somewhat less constipating than Lortab/Vicodin, which is a bonus.

it's ok.... it's a little low on my food chain for the pain (behind Percocet and vicodin, but above bayer and tylenol), but sometimes it's just enough.

Tylenol #3 about as effective as Vicodin Tylenol #3 works about as well as Vicodin regular strength. I know that some people are allergic to codeine, a natural product but can tolerate the synthetic Vicodin. I have found that Tylenol #3 at least somewhat helps all but my very worst migraine headaches which include vomiting.

Headaches &amp; aches and pains Tylenol #3 has helped when the pain of head aches and other aches and pains become unbearable. Side effects are damage to your liver and kidneys as well as constipation. Price is reasonable and of course taking a pill is easy.

acetaminophen-hydrocodone	Bone Pain	2012-11-08 00:00:00		4.0	3.0	5.0	3.0	I've been dealing with osteoarthritis for 34 yrs now. This particular medication helps but enough to only take the pain down from a 8 to a 7. Moderate to severe pain is supposed to be relieved? Each person is different, that's true. The only problem with having surgeries as a kid and taking pain meds since then is now a high tolerance to most commonly prescribed medications.  This Norco 7.5/325 just doesnt cut it.
acetaminophen-hydrocodone	Pain	2012-07-22 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	used with gabapentin 400mg for pain associated with celulitus.  my dosage was 650/10mg.  relieved pain with no noticable side affects. only took when gabapentin did not relieve the pain.

acetaminophen-hydrocodone	Pain	2012-04-30 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.5	Works great for pain. And it usually works fast, at least for me.
acetaminophen-hydrocodone	Bone Pain	2011-11-16 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I have been on this for 3 years now along with Topamax, I have Rhuematoid Arthritis and Type 1 Diabetes, the pain that I have is horrible and without these meds, I would be unable to walk most days, I am only 36 yrs old and the mother of 2 young children.  I am seen by a pain specialist monthly and a Rhuematologist as well.  Steroid injections do not work for me because of diabetes, every person is different, but I thank God everyday that I have relief from the pain.
acetaminophen-hydrocodone	Pain	2011-09-26 00:00:00		4.0	0.5	1.0	0.5	I had horrific pain for weeks from a anal fissure and the doctor did a sphincterotomy on me.  Even though the surgery helped me a lot, my pain went from horrific down to terrible.  She prescribed hydrocodon-Acetaminophen 5-325 for which I was to take 1 to 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed.This is a nasty drug.  After taking the first tablet, I develope a headache, pressure in my ears, sounds amplified, nausea and awful light-headedness...but my surgical pain went away.  The half tablet was just as bad.  I learned if I cut the tablet into thirds, I can sort of tolerate a third of it.I don't normally take any drugs, and so this drug is very hard on me.  I will continue taking it for another day or two until then stop taking it.After reading other people's reviews, it looks like I'm the only one who has been affected so adversely by the awful drug.

acetaminophen-hydrocodone	Myalgia	2010-11-17 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	3.0	5.0	This drug is very addictive and you can get hooked on it easily.  I had shingles and I was taking 8-12 per day for almost a year it was getting harder to get them the doctors were getting begining not to believe I was in such pain. A pharmisist pointed out to me that I was probably addicted and my reply was that I am in so much pain.  She said the drug may be enhancing the pain so you will take more of it.  She suggested that I should detox and see if the pain is less and I did It was horrible but after about 3 days I realized that a lot of the pain I was feeling was much less.  It took awhile for me to recover and that was 6 months ago.  I still have chronic pain and I take 2 to 3 per day now but no more than that and it really helps.
acetaminophen-hydrocodone	Dental pain	2010-06-18 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	I would not recommed this product b/c it does not work at all if you read up on it...Its says this medicine is for before the pain starts how in the world is someone suppose to know when they are going to have a toothache. The hospital gave me this for dental pain. It didnt work for me. It takes one hour and 30 minutes for it to kick in and anyone whoever had a toothache b4 knows that feels like a lifetime! Plus it made me sick as a dog! I had all the less severe side effects! Plus after reading the hospital was not suppose to give this to me anyways b/c ppl who has has gallbladder problems are not suppose to take this. I didnt know this until after I looked this up. If we cant trust the people who give us this medicine who can we trust! read up on your med b/c you take it.. it could save your life!

Prescribed Hydrocodone/apap--5mg/500mg for kidney and general body pain from a kidney infection. Found the pain relief to be helpful tho' not absolute. Possible side effect seemed to be dizzyness, slower thinking processes and inability to sleep. Allowing that some of these complaints may have been caused by the infection itself.Hope this is useful to someone.

I have been taking vicodin for 18 months for back pain.  At first it helped but it got to where I needed more and more and was up to taking  up to 25 a day.  I am now off of them for 7 days and am having withdrawls.  I feel very anxious and irritable and feel like I cant do any normal day tasks without them.  My body aches badly and my life just feels like it cant function normally in any way.  I dont want any one around me, including my kids though they are grown, and my boyfriend doesnt know why Im so cranky.  No one knows of my addiction or withdrawls and its a terrible thing to go through alone.  If you are taking this drug for any reason please be careful and use only when needed.

aciphex	Barrett's esophagus	2011-01-06 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	easy to swallow , takes the pain away
aciphex	Reflux esophagitis	2010-12-17 00:00:00		0.5	0.5	0.5	0.5	What really works is Twin Lab Super Enzymes.  Stopped acid in 5 days.  For burns in throat - 1000 milagrams L-Lysine per day.  No side effects!!! Get at health food stores.
aciphex	Reflux esophagitis	2010-12-14 00:00:00		5.0	1.0	5.0	2.5	Causes vertebral fractures and bone problems with prolonged use, per study that I read about, printed in CNN.com. Do the research.Recommendation is now to take it for 14 days in a row, and no more.Apparently it does such a effective job, that, with the lack of acid in the stomach, the calcium and minerals do not get broken-down to be delivered to the bones.If you have taken this for more than three months and find that you have back pain or some type of bone pain, be aware and concerned. Once again, do a search on &quot;Aciphex and vertebral fractures&quot; to see more details.Works well for the stomach, but the side effects may be very serious.

My gastrointerologist gave me several different &quot;PPI's&quot; to try. When they all failed he gave me some samples of Aciphex and I haven't had reflux since. LOVE this little pill!!!   My insurance considers it an &quot;Out-of-network&quot; medication and my co-pay is about $70 when I have to use my insurance, I a lucky enough to have a PCP with a in office pharmacy and as long as one of the doctor's there writes the Rx I only have to pay $15 (drastic price difference. My regular pharmacy has told me that with out insurance that a 30 day supply is around $130. I don't actually know what the full retail price is.
aciphex	Reflux esophagitis	2010-06-12 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I have Acid Reflux for 10 years and this little pill is like no other!  I now enjoy vegetables like onions again - I couldn't even look at one before Aciphex! I tried Nexium and Pepcid AC, but neither of them worked
aciphex	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease	2010-04-09 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I love this little pill and have taken it for several years....one pill a day.  Now this year my insurance carrier will not cover it....so I'm reduced to over the counter since I won't pay $2 per pill.    :(  Nancy

My condition, which is severe acid, was not listed as a condition.  I tired several OTC as well as prescription products without success.  Aciphex was a miracle drug for me.  I do not have reflux...but the acid build-up was so severe I thought I needed to go to the emergency room on several occassions...OTC products took the edge off only.  The quality of my life improved significantly with Aciphex

Aciphex did nothing for me. I was on it for a year because it's the only ppi my insurance would pay for, but my condition really deteriorated during that time and I had to go back to taking Prevacid, which works the best for me. It's costing me a fortune, but it's better than the horrible symptoms I was exxperiencing. My doc says there all the same, but I disagree with that. All of these ppi's are way overpriced imo.

Diagnosed with GERD, erosive Esophagitis and Barrett's Esophagus 8 yrs ago by Upper GI Endoscopy with biopsy.  Aciphex prescribed, 8 weeks later erosive Esophagitis fully resolved. Follow up Endosopy and biopsy a year later, Barrett's Esophagus fully resolved.  Another Upper GI Endoscopy 2 years ago confirmed.  Because Aciphex is high tier drug, my insurance copay started to go up 4 years ago so tried other lower tier, lower cost PPIs.  Did not get same results.  Went back to Aciphex despite the higher cost.  Continue daily dose; as long as I do not forget to take and do not overeat, I have no symptoms of heartburn or acid reflux.  Also take a multi-vitamin and a Vitamin B supplement due to potential side effect of reduced vitamin absorbtion.  Aciphex had been exceptionally effective for me, just wish the manufacturer's cost would come down, my health insurance would cover more of the cost, or a generic version of the drug would become available.

Aciphex works well! After having severe side effects from Prilosec, I was put on Aciphex twice a day.  Aciphex worked well.  I had occasional breakthrough reflux but it was tolerable.  The only reason I was taken off of it was because my insurance no longer covered it.  If I had to switch PPIs, I would not hesitate to go back on Aciphex.

Great for GERD I used this drug for the treatment of GERD for approximately 2 1/2 years.  It was the most effective I found and I was able to use it for the longest before it quit working.  In the end I was taking it several times a day but got no relief.  Nissen fundoplication was the answer for me.

Pariet, Heartburn &amp; Constipation The most interesting change in my life since I started taking this drug (PARIET)is not only the disappearance of acid indigestion and heartburn but also the disappearance of constipation from which I have suffered for many years. It would be interesting to know if others are experiencing this added benefit. I no longer use any heartburn tablets (tums, etc.) At this point, I must consider this a pharmacuetical extraordinaire! I do hope there are no long term negative effects.

Aciphex clearly better for me After being diagnosed with GERD and a small area of Barrett's, the doctor prescribed Aciphex. Within a few days, my symptoms improved dramatically and soon I was able to eat &quot;regular&quot; foods (nothing too spicy or acidic, but more than just comfort foods like mashed potatoes and saltines!).&amp;#13;&amp;#10;&amp;#13;&amp;#10;I know the Aciphex, specifically, is the more effective variety among the PPIs for me because, when we sent in my next Rx to our mail-order pharmacy, they substituted (without my consent) omeprazole. I didn't notice the change in the medication on the label and continued to take it as I had the Aciphex. When I began to feel terrible GERD symptoms again, I took a close look at the bottle's label, did a little googling and discovered that omeprazole isn't merely the generic version of the Aciphex but an entirely different variety.&amp;#13;&amp;#10;&amp;#13;&amp;#10;I got my doctor to write specifically for Aciphex and haven't had any trouble since (unless I start drinking a lot of caffein, which I sometimes do to relieve my CFS and sleep disorder symptoms, unfortunately).

Aciphex &amp; Depression/Eye problems I have been using aciphex for about 2 years. I also started on Zocor (for cholesterol) at about the same time. Since then, I just haven't felt like myself. I assumed it was from the Zocor. I would have eye muscle pain. Several weeks ago I started having severe anxiety attacks. My GERD got a lot worse so the DR then increased my dose of aciphex 2x daily. About a month later, I sunk into a pretty bad depressive state. I was always sad and felt like crying - in addition to anxiety attacks. Well, I stopped taking the aciphex 2 days ago and I do not have the eye pain anymore and I don't seem to be as depressed. Both are side effects of Aciphex. It's amazing how a little pill can cause so much change in your life! Update Jan 2006: Discontinued using Aciphex back in Dec. 2004. My Dr. tried prescribing additional Proton Pump Inhibitors and I had the same side effects. I completely came off all acid medication and a few weeks later had blood work done. My liver function tests were now normal(prior to that, my LFTs were all elevated about twice the normal limit). My Dr. then seemed to take me more seriously about my reaction to Aciphex and my side effects. It was determined that I am allergic to all Proton Pump Inhibitor medications. I now take Zantac as needed and it works like a charm for me. I actually have less Reflux now that I don't take aciphex! According the the Aciphex website, there ARE short and long term studies that document adverse reactions in a few people. However rare, they do happen.

So far, so good. After being on Aciphex for just over a week, I am happy to say that it seems to work as well as Nexium for me, without the severe headache side effect.  No other side effects so far.  UPDATE- Been on it a month now, and it's somewhat lost it's effectiveness, I have to take two a day about 3x a week. UPDATE- Been on this over 2 months now, having to take it 2x day most days but it still seems to work well enough.  No side effects at all.  Still using samples, switched to Prilosec OTC when DSHS would not pay for this.

Just started Aciphex I was diagnosed 12 years ago with &quot;GERD&quot; ... less than 2 years ago with a hiatial hernia ... and in Sept 2005 had my gall bladder removed.  I have used so many different pills and diets over the years and I STILL have heartburn, acid reflux and pain and discomfort.  I used NEXIUM for almost 2 years - it worked for awhile, but then stopped.  Have just started the Aciphex - will update in a few months to let you know my opinion.

Didn't help my symptoms I too aciphex for about a month.  It did not seem to help my symptoms at all.  No side effects that I noted.  Cost is an issue because my insurance is now limiting coverage for PPI medications to only 60 days.  After that, you need a note from your doctor and your condition has to fall into certain categories and they may extend it.  Otherwise, your on your own.

Rabeprazole and joint pain. Prior to taking the proton pump inhibitor Rabeprazole (Pariet) for my GORD I had previously tried H2 antagonists (Ranitidine, Cimetidine, etc) and the ppi Omeprazole (Losec), but had encountered problems with all. As well as losing their effectiveness quite rapidly I found that the H2 antagonists tended to make me depressed, and produce some minor joint pain. I tried these on and off for some time, and with each trial the joint pain returned, but passed away within a short time of discontinuing the H2 antagonist in question. I then moved on to Omeprazole. These were far more effective in suppressing acid production, but again there was depression, and more significantly, a lot more joint pain which took a lot longer to pass away when I discontinued the Omeprazole. I tried this on a number of ocassions, and on each occasion the joint pain was more severe. Finally I tried Rabeprozale, one 20mg tablet per day. (I had asked my GP for the lower dose of 10mg, but was mistakenly prescribed the higher one.) I have been suffering from worsening arthritic pain in the joints ever since. One theory is that the suppression of acid in the gut puts the balance of the intestinal flora out of whack, and that some of the more insidious of these may then migrate to the joints if there is a leaky gut. Anyone else have this kind of a problem?

(I had asked my GP for the lower dose of 10mg, but was mistakenly prescribed the higher one.) I have been suffering from worsening arthritic pain in the joints ever since. One theory is that the suppression of acid in the gut puts the balance of the intestinal flora out of whack, and that some of the more insidious of these may then migrate to the joints if there is a leaky gut. Anyone else have this kind of a problem?

Aciphex My gastroenterologist recently added this to my daily medications after I began having stomach pains during the night and after eating certain foods.  I thought they were gall bladder attacks but she believed it was acid reflux.  After starting this medication I have had almost no episodes of this and it has helped reduce more IBS symptoms as well.

Aciphex didn't stay effective for me. I started taking Aciphex over four years ago. At first it worked great. 20mg in the morning was all I needed. Gradually, the hearburn started creeping back and I started having trouble swallowing. They bumped me up to 20mg twice a day and that worked for a couple more years. My insurance recently removed this drug from the list of &quot;approved&quot; medications so it's cost effectiveness rating is way down.I ended up with some complications from a respiratory infection and coughing which caused a large hiatal hernia and I no longer had any sphincter left. I went in for a Nissen fundoplication on November and had submitted a report on that procedure on this forum. I'm no longer on the Aciphex and seem to be on the mends. My thought is that if you can postpone a surgical repair, you should, and Aciphex may allow you to do that.

Aciphex causes insomnia? I have been taking Aciphex for about three weeks.  However, I have been battling insomnia within the past couple of weeks, and wonder if Aciphex is the culprit.  Insomnia is listed as a side effect.  I lie awake, not fretting over anything, but I just can't sleep.  Just as I am about to nod off, I will experience a slight twitch or jerk.  It's not restless legs syndrome, for the jerks are minor and occur all over my body.  I'd rather suffer from GERD.  Please email me if you have ever experienced similar symptoms.

Best one out there When I was on this I had no symptoms and it was wonderful, one pill each morning and I was able to eat within reason what I wanted. My insurance made me switch to OTC med which do not work and I have to monitor everything I eat. My GERD had advanced to Barretts Esophagus so I need a med that keeps the GERD under control, heal damage, and not advance the Barretts, and this Aciphex did.

Caused depression...     I switched from Prevacid to Aciphex after insurance refused to cover Prevacid any longer.  I have been having serious problems with depression and I think alot of it has been caused by the Aciphex since the deperession and suicidal thoughts have worsened since I have been on the Aciphex.    When hosipitalized for depression I was put on Protonix which also seemed to work about as well the Prevacid however about $2 a pill for Protonic's to be on it outside the hospital and that is after what insurance will pay for.

Aciphex Aciphex was the third PPI I tried.  Prevacid, the first one I was prescribed, produced intense bloating, nausuea, gas and diahrrea.  I was then prescribed Prilosec and it offered some relief, but Aciphex worked better.  I tried Protonix for about 9 months to see if the reflux symptoms could be further reduced after taking Aciphex for a year, but it wasn't any more effective, and was more expensive, so I returned to Aciphex. Recently, I was changed to 40 mg. of Nexxium twice a day, so I'll see if the little purple pill can do the trick.I had no discernible side effects with Protonix Aciphex.

PPI's can have dangerous side effects I took aciphex for about 7 months initially on a daily basis. It worked fine during the initial onset of the acid-reflux problem. 6 months later, I started to feel weird in the head, was not able to focus or think clearly, started to suffer from severe anxiety and confusion, started to experience tingling sensations in the left side of the head, couldn't sleep well at night, and eventually sank into a depression. At first, I didn't know what was going on, but later I suspected it had something to do with Aciphex and so stopped taking it. Things then started to become better. However, recovery has been very slow. The depression has for the most part gone away. However, the anxiety and nervousness have still to go away. I sleep much better. I reported this to my doctor, but he only pooh-poohed the whole thing saying millions take Aciphex. I don't understand the doctor's philosophy. I have nearly lost a year out of my life, and here the doctor still thinks Aciphex is a wonder drug. I am also very surprised that the literature that came with Aciphex at the pharmacy said that it had no reported potential side effects. I also believe that not many doctors know anything about its dangerous side effects. As to how I cope with acid reflux, I would certainly recommend changing your diet and lifestyle. I stopped eating spicy food, started to chew my food very well so that the esophagul sphincter did not get strained when letting food into my stomach, and lastly I sip a glass of milk through each day. Also, try not to stress yourself. Watch out for those moments when you tighten your stomach muscles unknowingly while sitting erect in front of computer or at a desk, so that you can relax those muscles. All these things are great because they work and you are not dependent on any drugs any more. Not only has the esophagus healed, I think the sphicter has healed too. What's really important to know is that our body is divine and ha

purple what??? I would rate Aciphex as slightly less effective than Protonix but still very good. Protonix cured my GERD, Aciphex is maintaining me after a year. I avoid things that disturb my stomach such as onions, cinnamon, pizza sauce, pepperoni. That's a small price to pay for relief from the extreme pain I was suffering, enough to be hospitalized. Nexium did not touch my GERD. I was taking Vicodin or Hydrocodone to ease my stomach pain which I would rate as severe. After no relief from Nexium my internist prescribed Protonix. For me it was a minor miracle. With one dose my pain subsided. I had relief and it has not come back. I was given samples for 6 - 8 months and then the VA put me on Aciphex (Rabeprazole). I was worried about the switch but it's doing the trick too. I understand they are all very expensive. My HMO prescribed Prilosec to replace the Protonix/Aciphex regimen but I'm not switching just because of cost. The pain was too severe for me to ever go back to something else. In my case Protonix and Aciphex were superior to Nexium and Prilosec both in initial relief and as a maintenance medication in the relief of severe GERD.

Pains in legs and arms I took Aciphex for several weeks.  It worked well for my GERD at first, but then its effectiveness seemed to diminish.  I started getting pains in my thighs while sleeping and also some pains in my hands and occasionally head or neck pains.  I went to a neurologist for tests before it occurred to me that it might be the Aciphex.  When I stopped taking Aciphex, all my pains disappeared.  Protonix works much better for me. I've been on Protonix for a couple of months now, and so far so good, but I'm concerned about the safety of using PPIs for the rest of my life.  I tried Nexium once and that gave me a serious headache.

Getting Scared Was on 1 Aciphex tab a day for about 3 months before it stopped working. Doc upped it to 2 tabs a day a few weeks ago and the symptoms (pain &amp; nausea) are mostly gone again. But what happens once that stops working too? At the rate I'm going I will exhaust all the available PPI's in a couple of years. What happens to me then? I'm only 34 and I can't live with this back and forth game for the next 40 or so years!

Scary side effects I took Aciphex for 2 years and developed nerve problems including anxiety, paresthesia (tingling in legs and feet) and peripheral neropathy. (All are listed in the small print as side effects). After lots of testing including neurologists, mri's and blood tests with no results, I stopped the Aciphex and got back all the acid problems. I then took a natural approach with the help of a holistic MD. A change of diet (no meat, alcohol, caffiene, diet or decaf drinks; lots of pasta, rice and vegetables, watermellon, cantelope and bananas and lots of water, including eating very slowly and chewing a lot has taken almost all symptoms away within a month. Slowly, the nerves are healing. Proton pump inhibitors are new and should be used with caution long term.

Rabeprazole  Seems to be working well. Take 2/day. I've noticed some depression and wondered if it was a side affect from Aciphex and came to this site. I see it is one of the side affects... 56 year old male crying while watching sad movies... but no heartburn... glad I came to this site, thought I was going crazy. Thanks.

aciphex I have taken aciphex and it works great. The only thing is that I have been off it for a while due to a lack of money, and the consequences are bad. I am consistently in pain without it.

Beware of Potentially Lethal Side Effects After starting to take Aciphex I became depressed and suicidal. I was also paranoid and nervous and started having black out periods where I couldn't remember who I was--amnesia. These are ALL rarely published or talked about side effects of Aciphex. After a year of psychiatry and physician's bills I had to stop taking Aciphex because I couldn't afford to take it anymore. Three days after stopping the medication all of my suicidal, and other psychological symptoms disappeared. The voices in my head literally stopped as quickly as they had begun. This medication is dangerous because not many doctors know about or bother to look up these side effects and may not diagnose the problem in time. Stopping this medication saved my life. I have since had surgery for my GERD and am happier than I ever have been. I highly recommend the relatively painless laproscopic fundoplication procedure over this dangerous and insidious drug.

aciphex aciphex is one of the most recently prescribed drugs in a 2.5 yr battle with GERD like symptoms and comes after prilosec, nexium, protonics, ranitadine, carafate, and before reglan.  Actually - most recently I was told to have both carafate and reglan before meals and before bedtime and aciphex once per day.  This combo has intensified my symptoms to the point of my completely stopping all of them.  The drug that gives me the most relief - in the amount of 375mg is vicodin - which my doctors say makes no sense - but I am in pain and NOTHING else they have given me helps.

ACIPHEX vs PRILOSEC After taking PRILOSEC for over 5 years and not being able to skip at least 1 day without severe acid burning I have now gone to new insurance and new Dr which has recommended ACIPHEX. I still am wondering &quot;why&quot; he took me off the &quot;purple pill&quot; which after taking Zantac, Pepcid, Tagamet and others gave me the relief from stomach burning. Although I have tried this pill for only 1 day do not see any great &quot;price reduction and/or effectiveness&quot; over the wonder drug PRILOSEC and so decided to send this report to see how others have found this drug to compare with PRILOSEC. I have been told that I have /and produce, to much stomach acid and will post another message as to if I like this drug ACIPHEX vs PRILOSEC. Also am trying to find Generic for Prilosec to which druggist told me there was none. Trying to save $$ as I have no insurance but find this drug ACIPHEX to be just as expensive but less effective as PRILOSEC.

Aciphex I received 2 free bottles (1 week each and purchased a month's supply. The 1st week seemed to work well, the 2nd week I thought I had a placebo.  The month's supply only worked for about 8-10 hrs and then gave out.  My Dr. has switched me over to Nexium for a month and then we are to try Aciphex again?

Negative, but dangerous if CA prone.Also received $150 in rebate slips. To 1 little old lady!  No wonder drugs are expensive!

Aciphex I have been taking Aciphex for a couple months now for Hypersecreatory Stomach Syndrome, the usual dosage is 1 daily (I take 2-4 daily). So far it has helped me to be able to eat a bit more with less pain (not a cure but definitely a lifesaver).

I take the generic  for Actiq 800mcg. I take it for times a day for my pain which is quite bad. I have tried every kind of pain meds out there with no relief. Only Actiq seems to help fast and with no side affects. I only have one problem - getting Medicare to cover it since it is only  approved for cancer patients. Without Actiq my quality of life is greatly reduced and I end up staying in bed not able to do anything. Cigna Medicare Rx was paying for 3 years and now they just stopped. They are saying I do not meet the criteria (cancer).

I find it appauling that the government has stepped in to stop the prescribing of the medication for severe chronic pain patients,  It's proven itself and is now in a generic form.  It's been my saving grace and CT is crazy to allow legislators determine this most important issue.it's a drug that helps many severe conditions and should be used in more applications for relief of debilitating pain.  I pray Ohio never steps in and makes changes that don't allow me this medication as it's worked miricles with me.  i'm still working with a very serious broken neck condition due to this medication.  I take it for breakthrough pain but can't imagine not having this medication to help me.  I'd be on SSI without it.  Legislators should think about that for awhile....keep pain patients working or bedridden???

I call this a miracle medication.  When nothing else helps my intense, cervical spine injury (broken neck due to car accident)....I can put an ACTIQ LOLLIPOP in my cheek, lay down and feel better within 15 minutes.  It relieves my break through pain (very severe) as well as the worst of the migraines that I get due to my condition.  I also am on a slow release morphine Kadian to shield me from daily chronic pain but the ACTIQ has changed my life in the sense that I have so much more control over my bad pain days that used to keep me in bed. It has also come out in a GENERIC form so that it's affordable, it works and I'm so blessed to have a Pain Mgt. Dr. who knows what to prescribe and isn't afraid to use these amazing new tools to help people like me who, without it, wouldn't be functioning and able to work,  REMEMBER the hope I have now,  Relief is BLISS and Actiq relieves severe pain quickly (with mininal side effects) LASTS ABOUT 3 - 4 HRS.

Works great but prolonged use can give you nasty heartburn upon continuation.  Not sure the best way to deal with this (heartburn medications can greatly enhance the effect of pain-killers through inhibition of CP450) but it does work great for pain.  The patch works about as well but without the heartburn.

Actiq with Fioricet Actiq used in conjunction with Fioricet can stop a cluster headache cold.  You have to work up to it, and you have to be on a base medication like oxycontin.  I have chronic pain care due to reactive arthritis which leads to cluster headaches.  I have controlled them, along with widspread pain throughout my spine and body in the following way.  I take 80 mcg of oxycontin twice a day as a base.  I take one Fioricet in the morning when I wake up, and one or two in the evening when I go to bed or with the second oxycontin. When a headache flares up, I immediately take two Fioricet and one or two Actiq.  The Actiq is for breakthrough pain and stops the immediate panic caused by the onset of the pain.  Actiq takes fifteen minutes to get fully down, rubbing as fast as you can on your gums.  You have to work the dosage.  I started out with 400's, but as my body became used to it, or my pain got worse--I don't know which--I found that I had to move to 800's.  This is a powerful medication, so start out taking one, and see if that works.  It is immediate and obvious.  If you still have the pain, take the second, at whichever dose your doctor has given you.  The nice thing about Actiq is that you can adjust the dose simply by stopping the sucking on it.  If you feel yourself getting dizzy or if the pain has subsided, take it out of your mouth and wait a few minutes, or suck on it more slowly.  Do this only under a doctor's supervision as this is powerful medicine.  The down side here is that Actiq is hugely expensive if you do not have insurance.  There is no generic.  The main ingredient here is Fioricet, which is the all-time greatest headache drug.  It combines tylenol, with a mild barbituate and caffiene as a catalyst.  My body is used to heavy medication from years of chronic pain, so many people cannot take these doses.  Play around with them carefully.  Some people are knocked flat with only one Fioricet.  I have found that two are safe

Best medication for breakthrough pain Actiq works very quickly 5-8 minutes and for me lasts 4-6 hours.  However once you're on it for long term maintenance of (in my case) back pain, sudden withdrawal can be very stressful.  A change in health insurance coverage requiring prior authorization could force you to be without it for a week. Or it may be removed from coverage in a health plan. The cost for 40 lozenges has gone from $550/mo. to $1100/mo. my co-pay is $100 but I'm sure that our health insurance will eventually decide not to cover this medication.

Better than hydrocodone/apap The advantages of transmucosal administration are significant - take it while eating or when food is in the stomach.  Interrupt the administration at any time.  Adjust the dosage on-the-go.Used with a morphine pump.  Have used hydrocodone/apap for six years.  Actiq is much better.  Reduces side effects of constipation but does not eliminate.  Much less drowsiness.BRING THE PRICE DOWN!!!

The good and the bad of fentanyl (Actiq) lollipops As a chronic/refractory Lyme patient, other than severe neurological symptoms, pain was my worst problem.  This is very common in Lyme patients.  I was given a baseline drug (this is something like methadone or long-acting morphine) and Actiq for breakthrough.  It was far and away the most effective drug I had. You could use a half of one if that met your pain needs.  It only lasts about 4 hours.  Problems:  frequently hard to get, very expensive, and it is sugar-based, so it's inappropriate for diabetics.  Also, all that sugar sitting in your mouth will ruin your teeth.  It is almost impossible to be discreet about it's use, since it takes 15-30 minutes to complete a lollipop.

Excellent Pain reliever - often lasts 12 hrs I have used the Actiq lozenge since June for FMS pain breakthrough pain relief. It works very well. My only concern is cost (2 month supply=$500 out of pocket) and whether it is okay for long term use, since it has only been approved (so far) for cancer pain. It is truly worth the money, and I will continue to use it as long as my Dr. will prescribe it. I have developed tolerances very quickly for most of the commonly used pain relievers in FMS, so this was a godsend.

Actiq I was on the pain patch a 400 patch changed every 72 hours.  I also had the Actiq pain pop which was great for break though pain.  Now the Drs. will not give me anything for my pain other than a huge increase of neurontin 800 mgs 3 X a day.  Also Relafen 500 mg tabs. 3 X a day.  I am in so much pain I wilt or can not function.  Lupus is controling my blood pressure, lungs and stomach or digestion.  I also have RSDS/CRPS which is also very painful.  When I was taken off the opiods I had to call 911 at least once a week or more.  I could not breath, and my heart felt like it was going to come out of my mouth.  Also the pain in my stomach can be unreal.  With RSDS, Reflex Sympatic Dystrophy Syndrome (www.rsdhope.org) my arms up to about the middle of the upper arm and my hands burn.  Also my feet up to my knees burn. I feels just like you fell into a fire.  It also has many other complications.Now that I have nothing to help I am so limited as to what I can do.  I also have FM and Osteoarthritis and a few other things.  I don't know what to do at this point.

Actiq for Breakthrough Pain I was hesitant to take this when my pain Dr. suggested it, but now it is really a major part of my regime.  I take Oxycontin twice a day as my base, but that is a steady background drug.  If I want to play ball with the kids, or do something just a little past what I should, I get breakthrough pain which can lead to much worse pain, spasms, etc.  These things look like lollipops.  You have to keep them far away from kids and lock them up.  They taste good too.  You can only take them if you are already taking a fair level of opiates, or they will make you sick.  You suck on one at a time, placing it between your gum and lip, and finish it in 15 minutes.  It gives you immediate pain relief but only short term.  What is great about these is you can take as much or as little as you want.  You can finish one, or take only half.  Or, if the pain is severe, you can take two.  In dire circumstances, I have taken three.  They are for short term pain breakthrough only.  However, I have found that I have specific times of the day where I always exceed the limits of relief the Oxycontin gives me.  So, rather than go up in dosage on the Oxycontin, which probably wouldn't help stop the pain of a two hour carpool commute anyway, I sit back and break the pain with an Actiq.  Also, it allows me the freedom to do special things with my kids.  If I am just on the edge, or very tired and hurting just a little, and the kids want to play or something special, I can take an Actiq and do it with them because it is immediate.  It allows me to be a father when I need or want to be, and not have to suffer to do it.  These things are great, but have to be taken with care and under a doctor's careful supervision.  I was hesitant to take them because all the literature for them is for use for cancer patients and terminal patients, so I thought it would be too strong.  Those unfortunate people are taking much higher doses.  The 400's do the trick for most of us with t

actiq Due to crohn's disease I developed chronic pain from many years on steroids. I use actiq as part of my total pain treatment. It works very fast but the taste of the new actiq (within 2 years) is pretty bad. It has a sandy feel and a bad taste. The old actiq was made from a sugar candy base versus the present formula which is a pressed non candy base.

The old actiq was made from a sugar candy base versus the present formula which is a pressed non candy base.

Actiq Made me throw up.  I can't use any pain killers for this reason.  Unfortunately, they do work for pain, but I can't use them!

Actiq: I was put on Actiq 800 mg 4 times a day, from a doctor at the pain clinic and Narco for break through pain. I wish they had told me that the Actiq would make me lose my teeth. The Actiq works great. I have FMS, bi ladder pelvic hip rotation injury, from a car accident, and carpal tunnel. I can't take most of the medicines they use for these medical problems. The Actiq works so fast and helps me be mobile.  Most of the time I am in a wheel chair. I can use my walker when I take the Actiq. The Narco is better then vicodin or vicodin E.S. 7.5/750 There is a big difference. You can take 1-2 Narco every 4-6 hours 10/350 each. Vicodin only has 7.5 mg of narcotic and 750 mg of Tylenol. That is why you can only take 4 a day. It causes liver damage. Narco comes 10/350 I get more pain medicine and less Tylenol, less chance of liver damage. It works good as a break through medicine. Nothing else worked for me, with out sever reactions.

Actiq (For Cancer Patients Only) It's funny, the thing that started me on the Actiq wasn't my Fibro, rather it was being prescribed to me by my Neurologist for my migraines.  (Which was working pretty well, I might add.)  Since using it for them, I noticed my Fibro. flares didn't seem quite as bad, so if I had a bad flare one day, I'd suck on an Actiq for a couple minutes (as I was on 1200mcg for my migraines and didn't feel I needed that much for the Fibro), and it worked beautifully!This went on for a few months, until one day I got a phone call from Blue Cross, my insurance company, who were calling to ask me if I had any form of cancer that they were unaware of.  I said no, so they asked what I was using the Actiq for &amp; I told them it was one of the ONLY things my Neurologist had found within the past 4 years that has worked for my migraines.  He informed me that my insurance was no longer going to pay for them since they were approved through the FDA for &quot;Breakthrough Cancer Pain&quot;, and since I didn't have cancer, I could no longer use them.  (At least, not without shelling out hundreds of dollars myself for a script.)  So there ended a wonderful medication that not only worked with my severe migraines, but was helping the Fibro as well.  Damn insurance companies!!!!!!!! (Yes, it's been quite a few months, but there's still A LOT of anger here!!)

Actiq - a new tool for the worst headaches This is the most effective medicine I've ever taken and brings the effectiveness of a ER visit in the home setting. My neurologist found a study done on it and found that something like 95% of the patients were able to eliminate trips to the ER with this drug. I haven't had to go to the ER since. However, since it's a powerful drug there are some prejudices on the part of some doctors, pharmacists, and insurance companies. While my last 2 insurance carriers paid for it, my current insurance will not. Their excuse is that the PDR does not include migraines as a condition for this drug. It costs the same as Axert though but it's $15.00 per lollipop. Even at that it's worth it for me as nothing else works. Axert, Maxalt , etc, works only about 40% of the time for me. Talk to your doctor or neurologist- this drug takes a severe migraine away in 15 minutes.

Actiq Lozenge Relieves pain considerably; better than most other types of opiate pain blockers.  Downside is the high incidence of physical addiction (like a diabetic w/ insulin).  Most doctors will not prescribe this to anyone.  Drug is primarily for cancer patients.  A pain specialist may be the best chance to see if Actiq is for you.  It is very $$$$$.

Actiq is excellent in CHRONIC severe pain  I was put on both 200 &amp; 400mcg Actiq 8 months ago for my 3+ year of severe c-spine (neck) painwhich would not respond to other meds. Within 1 lozenge I can say it worked like Cephalon claims in 15 minutes.1 month later, I was put on Duragesic (fentanyl patches) with the Actiq as a breakthrough med needed for flare uos.The combination is wonderful. I have 90% relief with both, and 5 months after being put on Actiq by my neurosurgeon he was able to do my surgery (discomectomy, allograft, fusion, powdered donor bone)...My recovery has been really rough, so I have remained on the Actiq and Duragesic since and I have been told I may need them both till I am fully fused in 1 year. Any longer term use of either Fentanyl based drug is hard to wean off of, so I will at the time needed go to a 2 day detox inpatient center for medical addictions (for people with legitimate drug use due to chronic pain). But the Actiq is a wonderful drug for SEVERE ONLY pain when other meds don't work, or in my case I am allergic to 2 major used pain meds).ACTIQ IS EXTREMLY EXPENSIVE WITH HAVING TO PAY OVER $1000 A MONTH FOR 2 BOXES OF 200MCG, AND 2 BOXES OF 400MCG.. IF PAID FOR BY CASH! (GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT THE 1600 MCG COSTS!) but for me I have a $30 co-pay.I will say a lot of insurance companies will not pay for Actiq since it is labeled for cancer patients only, but a lot of neurosurgeons and chronic pain centers use them all the time for non-cancer severe pain.It is a hard drug to get RX's for due to the high abuse factor if they get put into the wrong handsof known abusers.Actiq is not to be used unless lesser narcotics will help, and each separate wrapped in foil and plastic that you have to cut to get open package, they clearly state &quot;NOT TO BE USED BY NON TOLERANT MORPHINE OR FENTANYL PATIENTS)*** if your house has children they must be kept locked up in a cabinet since even 1 can and will kill a child or person over

actos	Diabetes Mellitus Type II	2012-08-07 00:00:00		4.0	1.0	5.0	2.5	Good example of why all docs you see need to know about all drugs you take. I developed congestive heart failure after taking Actos for several years. My cardiologist said to quit taking it, but my internist said to take a lower dose. I said no way. Then had to quit metformin too when creatine levels went up, indicating kidney trouble, and metformin can aggravate that. Now am taking glipizide and starting insulin soon.

My doctor disregards the warning I have been on the drug for over two years. My doctor being a family physician seems to be in love with the drug, but I have told him I am worried about these side effects he told me it is the best thing I can take for my health.
actos	Diabetes Mellitus Type II	2011-10-04 00:00:00		2.5	2.5	5.0	2.5	I have taken this drug before but it got too expensive even on my insurance so I was taken off of it.  It has helped my glucose levels to go down since I am taking 45mg along with 2000 mg of metformin daily.  As I read the other comments about weight gain I have seen any of that yet I know that I do want to eat all the time but I try to resist that urge.  I just hope that I do not gain any weight due to medications because I have got the 25 lbs off that I gained while on insulin and don't want to get any of that back.  I think that this will work but I don't want the weight.  We will see I will come back and update in a month or so.

May work for some, but not for me I was prescribed Actos following high FBS results.  I took this medication for almost a year until changing doctors. The biggest drawbacks for me was that because of the FBS I was told to take it at night, which caused sleep disturbances and extreme hunger in the morning.  Durning the day I would suffer from increased impatience and irritability.  I wanted off the medication because the side effects were affecting my relationships with family and friends.

It didn't work. I was on Actos once a day for a month and my fasting glucose stayed the same 150-170 mg/dl for the whole time I was on it. I had edema, especially my face and feet. And I had an asthma type breathing symptom.  I was on Glucophage XL for a month when I was initially diagnosed in March and had menstrual cramping symptoms that were daily and difficult to ignore.  I will try a herbal remedy. I can't tolerate the side effects of the antidiabetics that are the only option my doctors have given me. I have gone as far as I can with exercise, weight loss, and diet. My fasting glucose level seems very resistant to the drugs.

Don't work anymore I have been on Actos for about 5 years. Before that I was on Glucotrol. The glucotrol kept my blood suger too low and I could not funtion. With the Actos, I did pretty wel for a long time. For the past year and a half my children and grandchildren have been living with us. This began at he time that I was caring for my mother. (She passed away in Nov. 2004.) The stress has been unbearable! My daughter-in-law is bipolar and so am I. The Actos no longer works. My doctor added 1000 mg. of Metformin. My sugar levels have now come down to a reasonable level. Of course, I need to lose weight. I weight 220 and am 5'4''.

Try diet and exercise first... No big benefit seen. Has too many side effects to consider. My advice.... try diet and exercise first, metformin second, then go on to other treatments if necessary.

Just started I've all ways had a problem with high sugars and they have always been up and down. After 20 years on insulin, one of my drs. gave me actos. I've just started it and it has the sugars down to around 100. My A1C was 8.9 and the goal for now is to get it down to 7. Right now I don't have a problem with it, not sure how expensive it is, haven't had to buy any yet, the dr. gave me samples, I will let you know how it goes.

If you use it when you first feel the tingling and itching symptoms beginning, it will usually prevent an outbreak. If you use it after the outbreak, it cures faster, but only days faster.

I was prescribed acyclovir before I started taking Valtrex.  The acyclovir was horrible.  I took about 8 pills a day b/c the medication was not suppressing my outbreaks.  I was beginning to think that I was diagnosed wrong!  I had to finally switch to Valtrex and began to see results immediately.  I would not recommend acyclovir to anyone.  It did nothing for me.

adipex-p	Weight Loss	2012-09-12 00:00:00		3.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	this pill has worked for me i lost 7pounds in 5 days my imumn system is used to it already i would recomend this drug to anyone !
adipex-p	Weight Loss	2012-09-01 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	i started taking adipex in may. i weighed 200lbs and it is august and i weigh 175. i lost 15lbs in the first month. i am now trying to wheen myself off of them so to speak because i am used to the energy they give me. but at the same time i have built up a tolerance to them. after about 4 months they stop working as much. yes they still give you energy but you have to watch your eating again. but by that time you should have established some kind of good eating habit. i would recommed this if you can not lose the weight any other way. it works better than anything i have ever tried. but beware if you do not establish good eating habits and do not workout on a regular basis by the time you are ready to get off them then the weight will come back and it will come back with a revenge lol.good luck
adipex-p	Weight Loss	2012-05-30 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	I take 1 tablet in the morning before breakfast and follow the slim fast 1 2 3 diet.  I lose an average of 2 pounds per week (so I'm more likely to keep it off).  The adipex keeps me from feeling hungry with only the slim fast and 1 meal throughout the day.  The only side effects I've experienced have been dry mouth and a mild headache.  I've been using it for 1 month.
adipex-p	Weight Loss	2010-07-13 00:00:00		5.0	3.0	5.0	5.0	I have found adipex to work very very good, but when i took it for the first time i suffered from not wanting to eat at all. I had to force  myself to eat, the dosage was to strong, i ended up skipping days at a time of not eating. It gave me very bad dry mouth as it said it would in the side effects. I was weighing 289lbs when i started out on adipex. I am weighing 250lbs now from being on the pill for 2months. And thats from not taking the pill everyday with lots of excercise and a healthy way of eating. Adipex works different for each individual. I reccommend this drug to those that are in need of loding weight

First let me say I started in oct 2004 at 283lbs. WITHOUT any meds with JUST diet and exercise and going throug a divorce I lost 110lbs reaching 174lbs in 10 months. I am a 5ft 8in female so this was a good weight and got to keep my &quot;Betty Boop figure. I kept the weight off for about three years. In  the last year I put on 30lbs going to 207 I have been on adipex on and off for about6 weeks. The first 2 weeks I lost 15 lbs with diet and exersice going to 189lbs and platued i had to stop for a week because i had major constipation.  I gained 2 lbs back (prob in poop) When I started back with also eating 4 prunes nightly, i have lost another 4lbs. I think the week break helped to get the weight loss started again.

The first time I took it, I was not overweight. I am 5'9 and I weighed 175 pounds. I was ecstatic because I lost 15 pounds in 2 months..then gained the weight back within a couple more months (although I maintained a healthy diet and exercise regimen). I took Adipex a second time and lost 25 pounds in 3 months. Then I gained back around 35 pounds within just a few months. I took Adipex again, but actually gained weight on it. I am now 80 pounds heavier than the first time I ever took it. I have been undergoing several tests and my endocrine specialist believes adipex may have had a long term effect on my metabolism/digestive system. While it does make you feel very content and happy, almost like an anti-depressent, the long term effects can be horrific. Before I took adipex I was very calm and easygoing. Since taking it, I am prone to horrible mood swings and aggitation. My recommendation is to stay FAR AWAY from this drug!

Although this treatment is not right for everyone--check with your family doctor--I found that it worked for me. I also found that exercise and a proper diet has to be combined to make the treatment a success. It not only helps you to lose the weight, but it educates you on how to rethink what you eat, how you eat, &amp; that exercising is important. It doesnt call for you to starve yourself or work out for hours. However, working out for at least 30 minutes a day, &amp; eating a proper diet will not only improve your life but also produce results. It is not a fast fix, it takes several months &amp; it take effort, but it is well worth it. It only cost me $30 a month.

I have been on adipex for 2 weeks now and have dropped 13 pounds.  I find this amazing since I had been on a 1500 calorie diet for 5 months with only a 2 pound weight loss.  I still remain at 1500 calories a day and this is sometimes hard to do since I am not hungry.  The only negitive effect is muscle tension.  I have noticed since I started taking this that my back is very tense and aches.  Other than that I would defintly recommend this to anyone who is having trouble loosing weight.

After many years trying the recommend way to loose weight I decided to take drastic measures. Adipex-p is amazing. I have lost 30lbs in 3 months and the only side effect I have is the dry mouth-funny taste thing. I am not hyper and for the first time in 15 years I feel my energy level normal, I even sleep fine at night. My heart is fine and I have to say that long before I started taking these I did have a bit of an irregular heart beat but these pills in no way have caused me any problems. I know many doctors will look at you and say they are just speed pills but they are not. You really are not hungry. Its like gastric surgery without the surgery. And as a bonus with me its also  like an antidepressant. I have one more month left and hope to loose another 10lbs. If nothing else has worked you have to try this

I was recently given this to help in the aid of weight loss as I also have high blood pressure, high cholestrol. a history of heart disease. I have never heard of this before but the MD highly suggested I try it &amp; to be careful. I have taken it and am running on 3 hours sleep, my heart beat outta my chest, I had some trouble breathing but I thought it was my high load of stress I am under right now. I had already lost some weight before the MD gave me this RX. I have read good things about this drug and I am willing to give it a fair shot.  I seriously need to lose a few more pounds  easier to put them on than take them off so I need all the help I can get!!!  good luck to all who use this for a weight loss program   truthfully I had thought about getting something OTC for  weight loss

I have struggled with losing weight since my thyroid went wacko in 2002 and I gained 60 pounds within a few months, I am 60 yrs old and have limited mobility so losing weight was very difficult because  of not being able to do strenous excercises. I insisted my Dr help me after everything else we tried failed because of allergic reactions to most medications and some food especially hebal treatments. Finally she tried Adpex-P  37.5 mg, once a dayI  I lost more than 25 pounds in 4 months. I still can't do strenous excercise, but I do walk at least a mile a day and I swim twice a week, I have had no  side effects that I have noticed, and  I have missed a dose or two during the few months I have been using Adpex and I had no problems. The only downside, which makes me HAPPY is now I have to buy &quot;SKINNY CLOTHES&quot; :) :)  I have already recommende this treatment to friends of whom one is a physical therapist.

advair-diskus	Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	2012-03-10 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	4.0	5.0	I struggle with COPD breathing difficulties within a day or two after missing a dose of Advair. The only drawback to its use is that if you don't THOUGHLY rinse your mouth after inhaling the dose, you WILL develop a case of mouth thrush. Believe me, you do NOT want this adverse reaction.
advair-diskus	Asthma	2012-02-19 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I love Advair. I've had asthma since I was born and through the years I've been prescribed a lot of different medications as new drugs have become available. I take this once or twice a day, and it almost cuts out the need for a rescue inhaler. It's too expensive without insurance, but if you can get a sample or find another means through an assistance program, it's well worth it. I'm glad Advair exists and hope that before too long it is available in a generic form so that more people can breathe easier.

My husband was prescribed Advair for bronchitis which he had experieced for about a month.   He has never been in the hospital a day in his life, takes no medicine, doesn't smoke, exercises everyday.  About three weeks after discontinuing the Advair he had a horrible siezure which lasted several minutes involving his whole body.   It was so violent he compressed a vertabrae in his spine.  After receiving an MRI there is no known cause for his seizure.

I have been on Advair for about almost 6 years now. I almost never use my resuce inhaler now. This happended about a week or two after starting the medication. I have only had one serious asthma attack sending me to the hospitol since on this. One side effect that I had no clue about was Intercystal Cystitis (spasiming of the bladder) this causes the walls of the baldder to spasm and then scar creating perfect conditions for infection. When I was diagnosed by a Urologist, he advised that he believed it was a side affect of the &quot;asthma&quot; medication I was on. He said he had noticed this in several of his patients over the years and found this medication to be the common link. Through online chatting I also found others who had the same trouble. Now I'm on another med to control that. Think before you take it.

After a few months I was diagnosed with 'suspicious' white spots on my larynx.  The doctor wanted to do a biopsy.  Since I had had these spots in my mouth &amp; throat twice and they cleared up with an antifungal prescription I Googled the symptom.  I found out that there have been reports of just that problem, spots on the larynx - some resulting in unnecessary treatment/surgery.  I had to seek a second opinion but he &amp; my GP agreed to give me oral steroids so I could take a break from the Advair.  It worked - a laryngoscopy showed the spots had vanished!  Unfortunately we found out I'm &quot;dependent&quot; on Advair...couldn't stay off it for long without ending up in the ER.  My GP even called Glaxo-Smith Kline &amp; was told there is no protocol for stopping.  If you have severe asthma - please do whatever your doctor recommends but if you have a choice I would not recommend this.

I have been on Advair for 4 years now , I have always had asthma since I was a child but during my 2nd pregnancy it dramatically worsened. I have been on it ever since. At first it was a miracle drug, helped me breathe easier and almost completely stopped the attacks as well as having to use my rescue inhaler. Now 4 years later, I have tremors, chest pain, blurred vision, migranes, fatigue, SOB constantly , brusing , Dizziness and fungal infections of my digestive tract. THIS IS THE WORST MEDICATION AVAILABLE FOR ASTHMA. For the past 3 years I have had re occurant viral infections, rhinitis etc.,I really hope that I am able to stop taking this medication with out complications. I am only 24 years old. Hows that for improving the quality of life? I hope anyone just starting to take this medication is properly educated about the risks. I know I wasnt or I would have never started it.

I have mild asthma.  I usually use an albuterol inhaler per year it is so mild. My allergist decided to try me on Advair for some reason and I ended up in the ER 4-5 times because this medication actually made my asthma worse instead of better. During each ER visit prednisone and other inhalers were prescribed to treat my &quot;severe&quot; asthma.  After about 6 weeks on this drug I was also taking prednisone, flovent, and nebulizing albuterol and ipratropium every 3-4 hours.  My healthcare providers never identified this drug as being the problem.  I did my own research and found out that some of the rare side effects of this medication are &quot;difficulty breathing&quot;.  I stopped Advair on my own and felt much better after 24 hours.  Of course I had to taper off of prednisone, but I was also able to stop nebulizing and taking the other prescribed inhalers.

Advair Works Great for Newly Diagnosed Asthma My doctor recently diagnosed me with asthma and prescribed Advair.  Within 10 days I noted a marked improvement in my condition.  So much so, I wish that I would have spoken up earlier.I regularly go to the gym and am sure to spend at least 25 minutes on the cross-training machine at various levels 3-4 times a week for cardiovascular health and weight control. I could not imagine that something fundamental was affecting my energy levels.  My doctor first discovered abnormally low testosterone &lt;200.  With the addition of depo testosterone my energy levels rose but I was still tired, very sensitive to cold, with frequent sweats.  This lead us to check my thyroid.  Sure enough, I have hypothyroidism.  Levothyroxine soon raised my energy levels and eliminated other symptoms of hypothyroidism.  Yet,  I still felt tired.  Changes in my depression meds did not help.  By chance, I mentioned to my doctor that I felt like I was drowning when I would drink at a water fountain.  Despite my frequent exercise, sometimes I would get winded just walking up the stairs.  He tested me and sure enough I was asthmatic.I suppose after living in some of the heavily polluted urban centers in the world, like South Chicago area, Osaka, and Tokyo, as well as suffering from allergies, I should have expected it.This medication has greatly improved my quality of life.

advair side effect I found the treatment to be effective, but the side effects were too much to take.  My doctor did not tell me about the combination of taking Effexor with Advair.  But I awoke every morning severely depressed and not interested in getting out of bed.    My mouth was very dry, my face was swollen as if I had severe water retention.  The worse  part was that the mucus from my lungs went straight to my head.  I could not take the congestion in my head, so I was forced to stop the treatment.I am now back on my albuterol inhaler (unfortunately).

using advair I've had no problems w/ advair. I guestimated start of drug. I have used it since its introduction. Before I was its two components and they both worked very well..except I had to use 2 puffs of one twice a day, and 1 puff of the other 2 a day. With Advair 1  puff and I had both..a time saver, and it works. As for the cost, as there is no substitute/generic it is at the max co-pay, but it is on my list so its only $35/but if I had to pay for it myself I would not be able to afford..&gt;$250 a discus. The sum told of all my meds  w/ my co pay is $250 without it would be ~ $1500. Advair along w/volmax  has almost eliminated my ER visits.

Bad side effects This med works to control my asthma, but the side effects from the steroids are something I can't live with. I've had three separate types of symptoms at different times, all of which would go away if I stopped taking Advair and each of which caused me to decrease my dosage: 1) flu-like, listless; 2) dizzy/lightheaded, sleepy, tingling in arms; 3) intestinal pain. If I go back on this drug, I soon start experiencing the dizziness, then the intestinal pain. If I were to take a 'normal adult' dose, I would get the flu-like symptoms. I don't think these things will happen to many people, but be careful if you're sensitive to steroids.

Very effective in eliminating wheezing Worked well.  Used in conjuction with singulair 10mg.  Worst side effect was &quot;pressure&quot; hives.  Seemed to occur in morning and evening.  Welts appeared for about 30 minutes and would diminish.  Generally bilateral in location ie: behing both knees, on both thighs etc.

Advair 500/50 I was started on this medication during a 5 month upper respiratory infection by my primary care physician.  I had been using inhaled salmeterol, inhaled corticosteroids, and albuterol.  It was a lot easier to just use the one inhaler but found the lower doses don't work for me.  It's also cheaper to buy one med with insurance than 3 meds.  My pcp gave it to me in part because she thought the combination of the 3 other drugs was causing thrush although I've been told that Advair can also cause thrush.  It's important to rinse one's mouth afterward.  Unfortunately, I&quot;m often too tired and just go to sleep.  Advair lets me sleep all night; I couldn't do it without the high doses of salmeterol.  Unfortunately, I think it's effectiveness has dropped slightly although it still seems to be the best thing around.  The diskus is easy to use - I can easily tell how many doses I have left so there's no playing guessing games as to whether I'm getting the last dregs of the cannister.  I've also gone back to taking Singular along with Advair to get the most treatment.  Still feel like I have a mild bronchitis going on quite often. My pulmonologist tells me that I have Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease which she says is just a collection of symptoms and asthma is one of them.  I've never smoked so mine is presumably due to severe allergies.

short term worked well When I went to my doctor complaining of a chronic cough and slight trouble breathing, he said I had developed asthma.  This only lasted a few weeks (I think it was alongside bronchitis) but this advair really helped me.  I felt somewhat relieved when I used it.

Very good after other medication adjustment Advair &amp; albuterol were not effective at first.  Then my medical doctor took me off Inderol 80 mg. 2 x day and within a week I was feeling much better.  My asthma seems to be exercise induced.  I was also on Oxyegen, but now seem to have little need for it.  However, if I do anything to  stenuous, I continue to have shortness of breath.  I have had these symptoms for many years,(at least 8 years or so) but was only diagnosed after visiting pulmonary specialists, when my breathing and ability to do practically anything at all got so bad.  I do not seem to suffer any side effects from the Adviar and hope that I will be able to continue on it for the future. I am 69 yrs. old.  Asthma runs in my family, but I never developed it until the latter part of my life.

Beginning great; but after 2 1/2 years I had an asthma attack that lasted three days.  This is when I found out it is lactose based.  I am lactose sensitive.  Side effects before attack were chronic bronchitis and sinusitis.

Advair helps Since beginning a regimen of Advair, the use of an Albuterol inhaler has been reduced from several times a day (two prescriptions per month) to once or twice a month! I am very pleased with the results of Advair.

Asthma Wonder Drug. Use it once every three days at night. When i first started using advair it worked after one day.  At that time i used it twice a day 100/50. After about 6 months i cut it down to once a day, 3 months later i cut it down to every other day.I can do all the things i could not do, run, swim, walk long distance.

Advair This is a nice alternative to prednisone. Though a corticosteroid in any form need to be done in moderation.  I lost much bone mass due to high dosage use of corticosteroids over a decade.

Very good, except I developed Dysphonia and I can't help but wonder if this type of inhaler has contributed to Dysphonia. I have used other types of inhalers over the years. I am interested in something new. Like something I can inject.

Guarded I tried ADVAIR at my doctor's recommendation.  I have had asthma all of my life.  I believe it started in early childhood around 4-5 years of age.I have used various inhalers all of my life and they have given me the freedom to do everything I wanted to do.  I have played sports, road off road motorcycles, sailed, waterskied and even scuba dived (not a good idea).My asthma has been consistent over my lifetime in that if I kept it under control, I was OK.  If it gets out of control, I can get into serious trouble quickly.  As an example, once I was staking a wood pile that had mold in it.  Suddenly, my inhaler would not work and I was taken to the emergency room where my breathing was so restricted I passed out.  I was given adrenoline and it probably saved my life.I take my inhaler usually once during the night while trying to sleep.  I noticed with ADVAIR, I could easily sleep through the night without the use of an inhaler.  I also noticed that my use of the inhaler during the day was much less frequent.I stopped using ADVAIR only because of the potential side effects I read about on Google.  It can cause death, especially in Blacks.  I did notice while using it, I was great.  But when I stopped using it, my inhaler did not seem to work as well.  That dependency scared me.

A New Lease On Life I more than just impressed with the Advair Diskus, but I credit this medication, along with Singulair, for giving me a new lease on life.I used to be in and out of the hospital, had regular ER visits, and my flare ups were very frequent. I still struggle with my asthma, and still have several times each month that I end up taking nebulizer breathing treatments at home, but I have not had a single ER visit or hospitalization for asthma since I began taking the Advair two years ago.I also found that I was able to be compliant with my medication because it was only to be taken once in the morning and once at night...before this I was on several different meds that had two puffs or 4 puffs at different times during the day and I regularly missed most of them. The counter on the Advair is also wonderful (I wish they would add them to regular albuteral inhalers, as it would help me not to try to use empty ones and the &quot;float method&quot; is inconvenient when not at home). The Advair Diskus not only shows the numbers for how many inhalations are remaining, but when there are only 5 left, the numbers switch from black to red...which is very helpful to cue those of us who are forgetful to refill our medication.I have not noticed much in the way of side effects, accept sometimes a powdery residue left in my mouth which can cause mouth sores...but that is only when I neglect to follow the instructions which specifically say to rinse out your mouth with water after taking each dose.

Suspect to causing Seizure Daughter took Advair for 2 plus years and said it was great. It helped her be less dependent on the emergency inhaller. She's Seventeen years old and recently started having seizures. Doctor doesn't think it is Advair related but since taking her off the Advair the seizures have stopped. They started as tremors and became full seizures within a few days. The seizures were happening multiple time a day in some cases.I hope no one else has to have this same experience of not knowing.

Advair  is great! I have been using Advair discus for close to a year. I have not had an asthma attack since I began using the Advair discus. I use an Albuterol inhaler maybe once or twice a month; previous to the Advair I was using two Albuterol inhalers a month, sometimes three. Advair has been incredibly effective in controlling my asthma.

I still have doubts that it works. No noticeable side effect, but no noticeable positive effects either.  I take it for congestion from post nasal drip.  It is extremely expensive, so if I see no noticeable difference after a few more months I will probably drop it.

Good results but very risky? I just started using ADVAIR.  I take it twice a day (morning &amp; night) with (1) inhalation.  I have had asmthma since childhood and currently was only using Albuterol to keep it in check.  I immediately noticed that I could sleep all night without using my Albuterol inhaler.  I use to use my inhaler at least once during the night.Then I stopped taking the ADVAIR for one day to see if it made a difference.  Immediately upon stopping, I noticed that my Asthma seemed to get worse than before I started using ADVAIR.  This scared me.  I then searched Google for more information on ADVAIR and discovered several people have died from using it.  Especially Blacks seem to have complications and a higher rate of mortality.  But White people have also suffered death.  Until this product has more history and testing, I think I will just stick with the Albuterol for now.  It's safer!

No improvement-Side Effects/Extreme gitteryness I have used it for over a year (Med Dose).I dont feel it alone has helped my asthma.It gives me a side effect of gitteryness which I find to be unbearable at times to the point where I cant sleep.I continue to use it only because my doctor says it's a long term maintenance drug which will prevent inflamation in my lungs.I read that long term inflamation of the lungs due to allergies can cause permanent damage (scarring) to my lungs therefore I continue to take Advair.Found better results with Allergy shots(6 mnths)so far

Advair is a great combo for me After 20 years of MDI use, I was skeptical about the so-called &quot;dry inhalers&quot; and definitely did not like it at first, but now I think it's a much more effective way to get most of the medicine deep into the lungs.I like that the doses are counted out clearly (unlike your standard MDI, where you're supposed to keep track of all 200 doses yourself -- AS IF! -- has anyone ever done so?!) I like that the case forms a self-cover for the unit. I like that the medication combination is a good one for me, though I wish it had more salmeterol in it (Serevent).Complaints: there's no way to clean the mouthpiece easily and the different dosages do not have either different colors of labels or different color cases. It's impossible to tell a 100/50 from a 250/50 at a glance, and that's a problem in our house, because my four year old daughter uses this medication too. Here's has bright stickers all over it, while mine remains more dignified without the stickers, but it sure would be nice if they were red, yellow, and green, or even white/lavender/purple for the 50s and maybe cyan/blue/navy for the 25s -- anything to make it easy to tell them apart.This is one of the few medications I've been on for multiple years that I feel has continued to work as well after a long time as it did after I built up to a therapeutic level in my bloodstream.

advair 500/50 I have been on this for about 3 yrs.  I have gained weight, and have to constantly clear my throat and cough up mucus.  This is even worse than the way I was before advair.  I am considering coming off of advair for good.

Seizures -  Be Careful My 11 year old daughter was placed on advair for asthma, and at first it seemed to work great. However, she began getting more and more &quot;hyper&quot; and finally, on day 16, had some kind of mini-seizure where she zoned out, flung a glass of milk, and couldn't remember it at all. Asthma doc said never heard of such a thing. GP said very possible. Took her off and within a day she was back to normal.

Advair Diskus I have not really given the drug a proper trial, that is why I have listed it as only used over a short period.  Now that I finally have insurance, I was dismayed to find that I was charged $35.00 for a disk that my provider used to give me for free. And when I realized that i really needed two in order to carry out my pulmonologist's order, I was especially concerned. $70 per month co-pay for this one drug seemed excessive. It seems to help. however I have only taken it once daily rather than the twice daily that was prescribed. Martha

This stuff is the best Without it I am tired all the time. With it I can breathe without wheezing. Unfortunately it's so expensive that I spend alot of time without it.

Advair effectiveness The only problem I have with advair is weight gain.  I stopped using it off and on for that reason alone.

Advair Diskus I have been using AdvairDiskus 100/50 (morning and night), along with Singulair, for about 6 months now.Prior to treatment, I was using Albuterol every night.  Since the 1st week of treatment, I have not used Albuterol a single time.  I don't know which medicine is doing the job, but the combination has been remarkably effective.Side effects have been mild and have included occasional horse voice, dry throat, and weight gain.  It has been well worth the side effects for me.

Advair I used Advair for a few months when I was having a particularly difficult spell of asthma. I was going through a rough period of trying to get rid of ongoing coughing and wheezing. The Advair helped me to get through this period. I did get a couple infections on my tongue from using it, though. Once I became stablized, I went back to just using daily Singulair and am very happy with that. I thought the Advair did a good job, and would use it if my asthma put me in very risky condition again. It was easy to use, but I did not like the chalky residue that would end up in my mouth upon use. I am most happy when I can just stick to Singulair for daily maintenance.

put me in the hospital This did not work for me.  After finally having insurance after being unemployed, I went to the doctor to try and find ways to fix my asthma.  He recommended Advair, even though I personally am very suseptible to steroid side effects.  Within a month of taking Advair, I ended up in the ER for 2 days.  Nothing else had changed in my life EXCEPT the addition of Advair.  After the fact, I found that in some cases Advair can cause asthma to get worse, and there is an argument about a 'black box' warning on the drug.  If it works for you great; but if you're sensitive to steroids of any form you might want to think twice about this medicine.

Advair so-so I took Advair for a little over 2 months.  While I noticed a slight improvement, it was not as much as I expected given the cost.  I stopped taking it because the side effects of laryngitis, sore throat, headaches, and leg cramps, outweighed the benefits.

Seretide This was prescribed to me after I was hospitalized. Normally I use Asthalin inhaler. I was at first amazed at the packaging which is vastly different from Asthalin and it took some time for me to get accustomed to it. But then the breathing patterns etc were the same as it was in Asthalin. The powdery taste at first made me cough but later it was alright. This medication does not give me tremors as Asthalin does. I think in the long run, this would be much better as it controls the symptoms better in the long run. though when it comes to subsiding an attack instantly, it falls back, for which reason i still feel comfortable with my Asthalin inhaler. Overall, this is quite a good product and I would like to use this on a long term basis except for the fact that it is very expensive.

Weight gain This treatment made me gain more than 10 pounds in two weeks.  I kept taking it until I saw my doctor.  I was taken off the meds.  It was not worth the weight gain for me.
