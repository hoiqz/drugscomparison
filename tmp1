No positive benefits I was taking this medicine to treat bipolar depression.  I was extremely tired, but had trouble sleeping.  I felt absentminded.  My mind was racing constantly.  I eventually switched to Paxil, Lithium, and Ritalin before feeling normal.

I''m allergic to this med! After suffering from BPD and depression for the last 6 years I finally decided to try drug treatment again.  My doctor prescribed Effexor - big mistake.  I took it the first night, all night I tossed and turned, was hot, then cold, threw up twice, and when I finally got up the next morning my jaw hurt from clinching it.  I didn't feel right all day, nauseous, foggy, just not there.My mom suggested that maybe I should try instead of taking it at night, to take it a few hours before I had to wake up.  That way I'd be able to sleep, and to take it with a little food.  So the next morning I set my alarm for 3 am, woke up, took the pill with some toast and went back to bed.  Not alot of nausea, but instead again, for the next 3 hours I tossed and turned and had the hot and cold spells.  When I finally got out of bed I felt nauseous, disorientated, and again, just not there.  I was also still clinching my jaw and my thoughts were racing, but at the same time I couldn't make a complete thought at all.Now I'm on Wellbutrin in the morning and klonopin, so far so good ... the klonopin I just started yesterday because the Zyprexa I was on made me gain 15 pounds in a month (which was significant on my small frame) so the doctor took me off of it.My mom is taking the Effexor now and she says it works great for her, except she has hot flashes.

It has worked quite well. I worked part time. The most recent was as a counselor for mentally ill in a non profit org. I was terminated after 3 years when I had a bout with my severe depression that lasted one month.The only side affect I notice is some difficulty with sex. Nothing else seems to be of major concern to me.

Works great for BP-II, carefull of mania though I started this after I dropped Paxil (due to severe constipation). Side effects include night sweats and a tendency to mania. The latter I fixed by increasing the dosage of Seroquel (which I was using anyway to treat mania). Apparently common side effects I did NOT experience include constipation and sexual disfunction.Warning re. dosage: do not skip a day and make sure you have a supply as skipping two days can be pure hell.

Effexor XR a trigger I thought this medication was helping my depression, and it probably was, but it was the cause (I believe) of a lot of mixed states so I had more physical energy but spent a lot of time crying and angry and agitated.  It also made my hands shake terribly.

Found out antidepressants aren't a good idea I took this antidepressant from the time was first diagnosed with major depressive order, recurrant until after my correct diagnosis of BPII.  It wasn't until a change in docs with a different med philosophy that I realized that Effexor was actually destabilizing my moods.

Good I have been using Effexor for about 5 years now after almost 7 years on Prozac. I needed to get off Prozac because I found my more tired and with no libido at all. The Effexor has helped me in both areas but I wish it were a bit more effective. The best meds I was on (very briefly) was Wellbutrin, which made me feel wonderful, but unfortunately I developed hives very quickly and had to stop taking it.

Effexor XR/ 225mg per day I've been taking Effexor XR (Time-Released) 225mg (which is 3-75mg capsules) once in the morning.  My NPA (Nurse Practioner), whom I trust implicitly, explained to me that at the 225mg dosage, I am increasing reuptake of dopamine and norephineprine, as well as the serotonin.  Apparently, at lower dosages of Effexor, serotonin is the only neurotransmitter effected.I used to praise all the powers that be for Effexor.  I had been taking Zoloft at 100mg/day for 3 years prior, combined with Trazadone at 150mg/night, and I was noticing that it wasn't doing anything anymore.  I began to fall into a slump, and recognized right away the slope I was on.  Not wanting to slide any further down, I spoke to my Nurse Practioner, and she suggested Effexor.  I began taking this in December of 2003.  Since then, I've had a surgery that didn't cure what it was supposed to, and left me 1 ovary short.  I've also been dealing with chronic pain, which resulted in the loss of my job.  Yet despite all the sorrow over the loss of my ovary, and the loss of my job, I haven't been depressed.  I haven't felt like the future will always have these feelings, or that everything is hopeless.  So, I know that this drug is helping me, absolutely, because I think if I was on Zoloft at the time this had all happened, I would have had to check myself into a voluntary hold for suicide watch.Now that it's been 2 and 1/2 yrs on the drug, I would like to say that I'm satisfied with it, but I'm not.  I've been taking it in combination with Methadone for the chronic pain (not just to help folks kick addictions, kids), and I'm pretty sure that the combination is what resulted in sudden panic attacks now.  I've never had panic-anxiety disorder, although I do have anxiety with depression until the last 3 months (it's 06/06 now).  I found out through my own research that Methadone is also a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, so I believe I've just been getting too mu

lots of side effects even with the xr, i felt withdrawal symptoms BEFORE 24 hours, which was very uncomfortable, and disturbing during work (tingling lips and hands, feeling spaced out/dissociated). worked pretty well for both depression and anxiety, but i couldnt take the side effects, and i ended up swtiching meds due to trying to get pregnant.

Side Effects! Withdrawal! This is a serious drug. I used it before diagnosed w/ bipolar II as an attempt against resistant agitated depression. Basically I just hated this drug and never knew if it was working, but I sure as hell knew if I missed a dose. As for SNSRIs, Cymbalta was kinder to me, gentler, but unclear effectiveness. I perceived weight gain, so went off it, coupled with unsure effectiveness. Now in the context of bipolar II diagnosis, my experience may not be fair. But the side effects are *real.* And withdrawal is a b*tch.

terrible withdrawal symptoms when missed a dose Effexor worked for me for about a year and a half even though I would notice very vivid dreams if I would miss a dose.  After taking this drug for about a year and a half, I started having break-through depression and I wanted to increase the dosage.  My doctor said no because I was taking the upper limit of what is recommended.  She is trying to taper me off Effexor in order to start another drug and I'm having a TERRIBLE time getting off of it.  I have headaches, general body aches, terrible depression and wild, vivid dreams.

Horrible I know it works good for some, but it made me shaky.  The only thing that has worked for me is Tramadol or Ultram which is used for pain.

effexor experience After taking this drug for over 1 year, I find that I am starting to experience mild bouts of depression again, not as bad as before I started taking it, but bad enough to notice. Side effects: Lack of motivation, devrease in sex drive, short term memory problems, slight confusion. I am concerned about what I have been reading about removing myself from this drug, concerning withdsrawal problems. I would like to stop taking it, but am hesitant

Made me very groggy... I started taking Venlafaxine, having already tried and failed with Citalopram (Cipramil).  Within 2-3 days of taking the Venlafaxine, however, it quickly became apparent that it was having the same effect as the Citalopram.  To me, it just acted like a sedative.  It made me feel, groggy and a bit 'spaced-out' during the day and gave me insomnia at night.Sometimes when anti-depressants don't have the right theraputic 'action' for your particular condition, they seem to just make the symptoms worse.I put up with the effects of the Venlafaxine for about ten days before I felt I really couldn't go any further and came off them, ramping the dosage down slowly.This drug obviously works for some people, but it did nothing for my fatigue / lethargy based depression.....in fact it made it much worse.For my money, its sedative action makes it very similar to SSRI drugs, like Citalopram etc.

Excellent After experiencing severe depression and panic attacks that left me unable to accomplish the simplest daily tasks my doctor put me on Effexor XR. This drug changed my life.  The panic attacks and black hole of depression absolutely lifted and I was able to realize what a NORMAL person feels like.  I have been able to completely stop ruminating on all of the dreadful outcomes of every day life (flying, driving, etc.).  This drug has been a miracle for me.  I stopped taking Effexor for a short time (1 month) thinking I could handle my symptoms on my own but crashed down once again.  Going off of this drug helped me to realize how much this drug HAS improved my life.  I know I could not live without it.

Horrible I know it works good for some, but it made me shaky.  The only thing that has worked for me is Tramadol or Ultram which is used for pain.

effexor experience After taking this drug for over 1 year, I find that I am starting to experience mild bouts of depression again, not as bad as before I started taking it, but bad enough to notice. Side effects: Lack of motivation, devrease in sex drive, short term memory problems, slight confusion. I am concerned about what I have been reading about removing myself from this drug, concerning withdsrawal problems. I would like to stop taking it, but am hesitant

Made me very groggy... I started taking Venlafaxine, having already tried and failed with Citalopram (Cipramil).  Within 2-3 days of taking the Venlafaxine, however, it quickly became apparent that it was having the same effect as the Citalopram.  To me, it just acted like a sedative.  It made me feel, groggy and a bit 'spaced-out' during the day and gave me insomnia at night.Sometimes when anti-depressants don't have the right theraputic 'action' for your particular condition, they seem to just make the symptoms worse.I put up with the effects of the Venlafaxine for about ten days before I felt I really couldn't go any further and came off them, ramping the dosage down slowly.This drug obviously works for some people, but it did nothing for my fatigue / lethargy based depression.....in fact it made it much worse.For my money, its sedative action makes it very similar to SSRI drugs, like Citalopram etc.

Excellent After experiencing severe depression and panic attacks that left me unable to accomplish the simplest daily tasks my doctor put me on Effexor XR. This drug changed my life.  The panic attacks and black hole of depression absolutely lifted and I was able to realize what a NORMAL person feels like.  I have been able to completely stop ruminating on all of the dreadful outcomes of every day life (flying, driving, etc.).  This drug has been a miracle for me.  I stopped taking Effexor for a short time (1 month) thinking I could handle my symptoms on my own but crashed down once again.  Going off of this drug helped me to realize how much this drug HAS improved my life.  I know I could not live without it.

Very positive, Side effects was Constipation, treated that with a daily dose of Metamucil.  Sexual side effects were remedied through limiting ourselves (my wife and I)to once a week. Letting yourself build up to the occasion. :) My energy levels picked up, and I did not gain any additonal weight from the medication.  A very good medication to help.  Do not drink Alcohol with this product.

Weight Gain &amp; dizziness but eases depression Gained 15 pds so far. You need to exersise a lot to keep weight off. It causes dizziness when it starts to wear off or if you miss a dose. It gives me bizarre dreams sometimes. It sometimes give me panic attacks, definitely use the extended release pills.

HORRIBLY OUTRAGEOUS I started at the lowest dose and the doctor just kept increasing the dosage.  I turned into a zombie, divorced my wonderful husband whom I still love, left my beautiful home and am now in talk and medical therapy.  The side effects were horrible, especially the anger. By then, I was alone and no one wanted to be around me.  Can you blame them?  If I hear of anyone on Effexor, I warn them to watch out.

I'm happy I think it is working on my social anxiety. I seem to enjoy being around people more and I don't have a need to go home and be by myself. I still have performance anxiety though as in being afraid to read in front of a group. This med works great on my PMS tension and my preimenopause mood swings. There are sexual side effects.

Didn't  Help Depression I just switched from Lexapro to Effexor because I gained 20 pounds in 2 months on Lexapro. My Dr. said Effexor works just the opposite....causes loss of appetite. I have had no side effects.*** June 13 - I didn't have any side effects with Effexor but it didn't help my depression anything like Lexapro. I had to switch back. I will have to exercise more to keep the weight off because Lexapro made me feel GREAT!!

Didn't realize how effective it really was! When I first began taaking 75 mg of Effexor, the side effects were pretty bad.  I felt very depressed but I was also aware thet the depression was a result of the med and only temporary.  Slowly, my night sweats stopped and my tension head and neck aches ended.  Crowded department stores didn't bother me so much.I started a new job in November and met a great guy; I was ready to discuss decreasing dosage with my doctor.  I had not gotten around to it when accidentally, the 35 mg was prescribed. I decided not to say anything to the doctor b/c I was ready to step down anyway.  After 3 months, my symptoms returned.  I went to see her and I am back to 75 mg.  It hasn't been a full week yet but I can't wait for the tension in my neck to go away.

Works well but have changed to Wellbutrin After a couple of years on the 37.5 mg. XR dose I felt it wasn't working as well, and moved up to 75 mg. XR.  This dose did work better to control my anger and irritability. Unfortunately it also seemed to raise my blood presure some. And I tended to sweat and get hot easily.  Sexual side effects are also noticeable - very little interest in sex. After a couple of years on the 75 mg. dose I decided to switch to Wellbutrin, and was able to make the change over after just a few days, and with no side effects.  Didn't surprise me, as I seem to be one of the rare people that weren't affected by missing a dose.  Many days I didn't take it, sometimes even a couple of days in a row, and other than increased irritability had no other indications that I hadn't taken it.

Very poor--use extreme caution with this drug Efexor was the first anti-depressant drug that I took as part of a clinical trail in the 90s. As I was given it as part of a trial in Florida (uni of Florida med school) and having little experience with the anti-depressant drug culture, I assumed that taking it must have a positive effect.  During my 'romance' with Efexor I managed to lose my job, my wife and complete sense of purpose in life.  The drug side-effects included greater depression, loss of motivation, great lethargy, loss of libido, anxiety and suicidal thinking and increased drinking (if you are so inclined).  Maybe this drug works for some, but my advice/experience is that if you don't feel positive effects shortly after starting this regime--GIVE IT UP.  Giving up the drug after extended use is extremely traumatic and may require hostipalization--ie detox ward. It is not for the faint of heart.Paddles

Good at first, but horrible long term I began effexor along with wellbutrin in the summer of 2001. The two worked great initially.  But, looking back, I think they made me a little manic--I suddenly decided to break up with a live-in boyfriend i loved and started to sometimes shoplift. I also started to sleep all weekend and became really messy.  If I didn't take the effexor right on schedule, I'd get brain zaps.  After a few years, the sleeping problem got worse and I started having muscle pains in my legs. My depression also worsened.  I was like a zoombie.  My Dr. increased my dosage and i noticed the symptoms all got worse. It was like Chronic Fatigue. I started to wonder if it was the effexor and decided to quit--pretty much cold turkey.  The withdrawal was a NIGHTMARE! For weeks I had brain zaps, dizziness, loack of coordination, sweats and anxiety (which was never a problem for me).  Then, my tummy blew up like i had edema (very strange), my hair started to fall out in clumps and i became completely dysfunctional. Beware going off this med--be sure to taper slowly!  In order to &quot;realign&quot; my body, i had to briefly take lexapro and wellbutrin for a few months and then taper off slowly.  I've now been antidepressant free since Nov 2005.  I've been doing well--there are some days i wonder if i should take something, but it's almost like once you've tried antidepressants, anytime you have a bad day, you think you might need something.  I've been doing a lot of reading too and --while I do believe brain chemicals and personality plays a role in depression--i can also see where my thought process has contributed to my issues.  Needless to say, while effexor helped me a lot initially, given the withdrawal and long term effects--i don't think i would take it if i had to do it over again.

horrible, made me sick When I was first diagnosed with depression, the PA put me on Effexor at 75m once per day.  It seemed like no matter how I took it, with or without food, early or late in day, it would give me extreme nausea to the point that I kept trying to gag myself so I could throw up and feel better, also made me really dizzy.  Went back right away to get switched, doc said that I should never have been put on such a high dosage to start with anyway and that that could have been part of the problem, but he switched me to lexapro because it's supposed to have limited side effects, it's true--it worked great! I rarely had to up the dosage, the first time I did I also started seeing a counselor and participating in biofeedback where they hook you up to electrodes and a computer monitor that keeps track of your breathing, nervousness, tension etc and you listen to an audio tape on muscle tension/relaxation excercises, I don't know if the tape actually hypnotizes you or what, but it was the most restfull 45minutes of every week and greatly lowered my tension.

Bad. I used it with the Lamictal I was already taking to help with increased depression.  It may have helped, in that soon I had no emotions at all.  So I concluded that I was taking too much stuff.  I stopped taking the Lamictal.  I stayed on Effexor XR for two years too long.  The suicidal thoughts grew worse and almost continuous.  I tried to get off the Effexor, and had a really hard time...those &quot;brain shivers&quot;, I guess, and disorientation, and nausea.  I have only been free of effexor for a month, so who knows.  I feel better right now, because I can cry when I need to and laugh without faking it.  Maybe it or the lamictal helped.  I was so afraid that I had lost my ability to feel that I will never take either of these drugs again.  I highly recommend smoking pot to control manic states, and positive self-talk to keep the depression at bay.

Efectin worked very well for me It seems that Efectin has done a very good job in my case. But I have to tell you that I am also taking 10 mg of Zyprexa per day and maybe that is  what kept me from feeling hard withdrawal effects (I took Zyprexa from 15 july 2004 and still taking that same 10 mg per day). You can read my Zyprexa rating for more details.I have asked my physician and it seems that my disease is bipolar I disorder. I was hospitalized because of acute psychotic episode.How it started: after about 3 months of Zyprexa, it came out that I was depressed and have also much anxiety. I was very scared and thought of killing myself. Then I was put on a 150 mg Efectin ER (Venlafaxine extended release) per day. The first 2 weeks were difficult, I was feeling agitated internally. After that, I became more optimistic. I started taking Efectin on 15 Sept. 2004. I took 150 mg daily until September 2005 (for one year), feeling depressed and anxious, but Efectin helped me to cope with these feelings.I remember that before taking Efectin I was feeling like weeing on me from much anxiousity, but his was solved by the medicine. Also the suicide thoughts were gone. In January 2005 I tried to reduce the dosage to 75 mg per day, but I couldn't. In september 2005 I felt better and reduced the dose to 75 mg per day. I began feeling better and better, and each day more optimistic, until  on November 26 I was feeling too optimistic and I think I have developed a hipomania. This was the time to get rid of this medicine, I thought (my phichyatrist told me that I can stop medication with Efectin on my wish).Withdrawal: the first 3 days were kind of difficult, but not at allunbearable. I experienced slight dizziness, decreased sleep, increased appetite (but this might be from Zyprexa), and sweating. No diarrhea, no brain zaps, no nausea at all.

Wonderful I had tried many other depressants, of which none worked.  I started Effexor and felt like a person again.  I have had it increased several times.  I hate to think of life without it.

Great Hopes, then Disappointment My experience beginning treatment with Effexor was very memorable. I have actually gone through the process of introducing into my system twice as once my prescription ran out and my doctor was unavailable.Never before had I reacted so strongly to any medication.  I took this as a good sign. I was up (boy was I up),busy,organized,leaving the apartment alone - HOWEVER - I could not sleep for more than 2hrs at a time.  This lasted around 3 days! Then only gradually did I return to being able to sleep, after about 3 weeks.  Though irritable and tired I hoped this was the drug for me, because before it, I wanted nothing but to sleep.Unfortunately, when the insomnia wore off, so did the increased energy and 'enthusiasm for life'. This happened both times when introducing the medication into my system.Currently I'm actually taking 232.5mg/day.  I am still depressed and lethargic as well as experiencing an extreme worsening of these symptoms (+anger/irritability) for the 7 days before menstruation.My doctor said he had never heard of Effexor having this &quot;jump-start&quot; affect before and thought it sounded a little like mania, but I have never been diagnosed with manic depression ( thank the good Lord ).Also notice that if I miss as little as one day, I can count on nightmares...I would like to try something new but fear the withdrawal and introduction phase.  I'm thinking of asking my doctor if a period with NO medication (but my clonazepam) could be tried because I've been on one thing or another for so long I'm not sure what I'd even feel like when I'm just myself anymore!For anyone reading this, I genuinely hope you can take heart in a shared experience - or - in the fact you didn't share my disappointing one. God Bless You.Summary: Hard to get onto. Initial positive effects diminish with time. Missing a dose is a no-no.

Fantastic - allowed me to be me, not fogged in. This worked brilliantly all the time I was on it. Felt myself again after 5 years of various therapies (Prozac - allergic reaction, Cipramil - good, but no libido). Two other meds (including Fluoxetine) having failed, this has been fabulous over past 2 years. Not only were symptoms eliminated but libido came back! Like most things, seems to me it's horses for courses when it comes to antidepressants.Coming off was HELL! Did a very slow, very controlled withdrawal under supervision of GP, but had terrible dizziness and sickness, lack of sleep and panic attacks.

Coming down now with some effects Pdoc switched me to Effexor (with Zyprexa) after having jitteriness with Zoloft (and Zyprexa). Pdoc had diagnosed me as Bipolar. I was having anger issues and emotional control issues.Took Effexor in morning and Zyprexa at night- Sleep like a rock with vivid dreams. So much so that I don't want to get up in the mornings even with 8 or more hours of sleep. One of my problems while on the Effexor was that when I would miss the 225mg morning dose of Effexor- by evening of same day I am real dizzy and disoriented and getting a bad headache, feeling all out of sorts. And even after getting the 225mg back into my system, it takes a couple of hours to get back to &quot;normal&quot;. Pdoc answer it &quot;don't miss the dose&quot;. I had a lack of libido-- where before I was probably too easily stimulated and always interested. Still able to achieve erection (harder to maintain at times) but much more difficult to achieve orgasm, much to the wife's dismay (as it was never really easy before). I had gained 20-30 lbs and at least one pants waist size without changing my eating habits, and my cholesterol was up.Previous Pdoc had added Wellbutrin along with Effexor and Zyprexa. *4/24/06 Update*Switched Pdoc's. New Pdoc has taken me off the Zyprexa completely with the issues of the weight gain and the high cholesterol and will start the scale back process to get me off the Effexor, continuing only on the Wellbutrin.1st week scaling back 37.5mg of the Effexor not too bad. (Coming off the Zyprexa seems more of the issue now with not sleeping). Been a little more edgy...2nd week- down another 37.5 mg. Have a mild &quot;headache&quot; most of the time. Feeling generally crummy and out of sorts. Have localized intense itching and very sweaty palms, body temp hard to regulate (not sure if these aren't just more noticeable and coming from the Wellbutrin now). 3rd week- down another 37.5mg.

Effexor still working long term. Update about two years latter; Last month, I had my dosage increased to 225 Mg/day as the effectiveness was wearing off.  I should have increased it sooner, but I put it off as long as I could.  My reasoning was I didn't want to build up tolerance to it so I could stay on it longer as it has been effective.  When I increased the dosage to 225 Mg/day it got me out of the deep uni-polar depressive cycle I slowly slid into but it only worked somewhat; two problems arose first, it held me in a repetitive two day mood cycle.  Id go from an overall up-beat mood to low to medium grade depression every two days.  Basically on a depressed/manic scale of -10 to 10 Id go from a 2 to a -2 and back to a 2 in four days with the occasional depression depth hitting -4 or -6 just to remind me how I dont want to be.The second problem was that with my increased dose, I had major insomnia.

Update about two years latter; Last month, I had my dosage increased to 225 Mg/day as the effectiveness was wearing off.  I should have increased it sooner, but I put it off as long as I could.  My reasoning was I didn't want to build up tolerance to it so I could stay on it longer as it has been effective.  When I increased the dosage to 225 Mg/day it got me out of the deep uni-polar depressive cycle I slowly slid into but it only worked somewhat; two problems arose first, it held me in a repetitive two day mood cycle.  Id go from an overall up-beat mood to low to medium grade depression every two days.  Basically on a depressed/manic scale of -10 to 10 Id go from a 2 to a -2 and back to a 2 in four days with the occasional depression depth hitting -4 or -6 just to remind me how I dont want to be.The second problem was that with my increased dose, I had major insomnia.

Complete disaster. preceded to have terrible manic episode, rapid cycling and many other complications. Stopped medication 1 month ago - tried to taper off.

I Hate Effexor I am using it right now, in the beginning it helped a little, but now it doesn't seem to be doing anything at all. I get horrible withdrawl symptoms if I forget a day and I am planning to get off it and try something else at my docters apointment in a few days! I would say there is no point in getting it if it won't keep up!

Effexor has been the lessor of the evils. I was introduced to effexor after using  Amytriptolene and found it to be an improvement.As I reach long term use, I find the effectiveness diminishing.  It is stil used as part of a cocktail of Gabapentin, Lithium, Wellbutrin, Seroquel, Reminyl, and Propranolol.I am still having problems and also severe weight gain.  It is hard to isolate exactly what does what in this mix.

I am allergic to this med. They gave me this med when I was in an eating disorder treatment hospital.  It made me very nauseous, and unable to visually focus. I could, at one point, not move from the couch. I became so sick that they had to put me on a clear liquid diet, which is almost unheard of when you're in an eating disorder hospital.  My sister takes this med for bulimia and depression and does well on it, but it just didn't work for me.

Negative Effexor (Venlafaxine) initially worked well for me and very quickly as well, even though I experienced a lot of side effects for the first few weeks. However, after about 18 months, it just didn't work anymore and the anxiety and depression returned. I did not want to increased the dosage, so asked my GP to take me off it - bad, bad idea. THis is the worst SNRI to try to come off of. The Dr took me off over only 2 weeks! Big mistake. PLease, if you are coming off of Effexor, taper it off VERY slowly over at least 6 months. It is now 7 months after I stopped and I am still suffering from debilitating withdrawal effects (withdrawal syndrome) I would advise not to consider taking this one at all.

Helps some, but you can't get off it! I was given Effexor in combo with Vioxx and together they helped my pain - however Vioxx and Bextra are off the market and Effexor doesn't help much with other drugs - so I tried to get off it. First time, I quit cold - BAD idea. I got horrible feelings of what I've seen called 'Brain Freeze'. Didn't know what it was then, but going back on the Effexor stopped it. This time, I've gone down to half the dose - but even that is too much! Gave me the shakes and a nebulous feeling of terror - till I added the other half and voila! the feelings were gone. Now I am doing one day at 75mg and one day at 37.5. HOpefully I will be able to get off this drug. I strongly recommend AGAINST starting it unless you're willing to take it forever. And I don't trust it to be available forever - so I want off it.  I'll update if I ever get off this stuff.

Still not sure???? My dr. started me on 37.5 mg. about 3 weeks ago and worked me up to 150 mg. I haven't noticed much of a difference so far and was wondering how long it has taken to become effective for those people on this site that it has worked for?? I am hoping that the 150 mg. will start to kick in soon. I would appreciate any advice or stories.

Not worth it. If and whenever I ran out of medication I had the worst side effects of anything I have ever taken. That is the main reason for quiting. The side effect felt life threatening by way of physical and mostly mental. Hallucinations were unbearible. Would never recommend to any one I know.

Okay.. I have bad anxiety that goes back and forth from depression, for no reason, that I can explain. I was on Lexapro and then I went to effexor, the side effects were weird didnt have even one on lexapro but on effexor I had major gas and I was really sleepy. The sleepiness went away faster then when I took zoloft, but the gas was really anoying.My brain was really hazy, it was hard to focus on things and I kinda always felt like I was in a haze. This med was not for me but everyone should know you are gonna have to try a few.

The sleepiness went away faster then when I took zoloft, but the gas was really anoying.My brain was really hazy, it was hard to focus on things and I kinda always felt like I was in a haze. This med was not for me but everyone should know you are gonna have to try a few.

225mg of the stuff Effexor seemed to work at first. I started on the bottom dose, 37.5mg. I have managed to work my way up to 225mg, and it seems like whatever this drug once did for me it is no longer doing. I dread coming off of it as the withdrawl is so bad, even if you miss ONE pill.

Effexor XR I have been taking this drug daily since the start in February, 2005.  I feel that it has helped me immensly.  My only side effect has been weight gain.  Because of that, I am now starting to try to go off Effexor and, the fact that I am having no other problems with depression and anxiety. I went to see my internest last week and he suggested reducing my dosage to one 75 mg every other day for two weeks then one every two days for one week then off.  I am on my first week of discontinuing and acter six days, have had no problems.  Hopefully, I will be able to lose the 25 pounds that I have gained and still be depression/anxiety free.  However, if I am not then I will return to taking Effexor XR.  It worked for me when I really needed it and if that means gaining weight even though I tried really hard not too then I will have to deal with that.  However, my mental health is important too.  Weight loss is a side effect that I will have to learn to deal with in another way.  This has been a wonder drug for me in every other way.  I HATE being overweight but I also hate being depressed, having anxiety and panic attacks more.

WARNING: Effexor is a nightmare to stop I am updating my review- Effexor helped me in combination with Bextra - which is off the market. I now take OTC Aleve which helps only slightly, and pain meds like Ultram and Vicodin. The Effexor has diminished in helping but it's difficult to get off it. I am trying! I reduced my dose to half - 37.5 a couple weeks ago, and two days ago, I got so sick and shaky- had to take the other half dose- and then I felt fine. It's the most horrible feeling - and I am determined to quit this drug. If you haven't started it, don't, unless you plan to be on it the rest of your life. There ARE other drugs which are much easier to stop if needed.

withdrawal hell I'm really impatient and that's my own fault, but after three weeks of taking EffexorXR and feeling worse than before, I decided to stop. I didn't think withdrawal would be an issue because I hadn't been taking the meds for very long. The first three days were fine except for anxiety ridden dreams and severe night sweats. I would wake up and the sheets would be soaked, as if someone had dumped a bucket of water in my bed! I wasn't sure if this was related to stopping the Effexor or not - but then yesterday I was on the train coming home from work and started feeling AWFUL! I felt/feel like my blood sugar is really low. I'm sick to my stomach and all woozy in the head. It's horrible and I hope it goes away soon.

Lifesaver! It lifted the darkness and the feeling of being in &quot;the abyss,&quot; so that I was able to enjoy life again.  I've always thanked God for whoever invented this medication, because I don't know how I would've ended up without it.  I am thoroughly grateful it exists!!  However, after being on it for a number of years (8-9 years), my body appears to have adjusted to it and it no longer works as well as it did in the begining.  My doctor and I have recently decided to add another medication to my regimen, so that it may &quot;boost&quot; the Effexor's effects.

use extreme caution Maybe this will work for you, but BE SUPERVISED. As in, I could have literally killed someone. If you are any type of bipolar, i personally would be very careful. This drug was prescribed for depression for me and ended up showing me that i was bipolar.I flipped out and had to be held down because I was trying to attack my boyfriend. I started to panic because of a small thing that agitated me and ended up screaming and breathing heavily and, like I said, attacking my boyfriend. I was terrified on another occasion that a plant was going to eat me. Sounds funny, but it could have been worse. If I would have had a knife or something who knows. I became in super defense mode, thinking I needed to go live in the mountains to avoid the government, etc.Sounds funny but it's not. This drug could possibly be dangerous for bipolars. Don't go to a doc that works mainly with depression. You are different.

Effexor worked great for me  I was not so much depressed as I am stressed out to the max.  I take care of two disabled family members, one with Bi-Polar-Schizophrenia and my husband with a deadly slow disease Peripheral neuropathy and was working full time until I myself became dissabled with a back injury which will require surgery. Effexor along with Paxil or Prozac helped very much. An occasional Valium or Adivant helped when my Son's coping powers left him and he took out his madness on me or others.

Still undecided about taking this I started Effexor after stopping zoloft.  Zoloft was difficult to phase out.  I started 75mg of effexor I think and by Oct 2005 I was taking 225 mg of it.DO I have depression? Not sure realy.  I have difficulty getting out bed.  not really fatigued but not interested in doing anything.  It also seemed to be a seasonal thing, but again I'm not sure really.  I do know that I didn't like being like that.  So, after going to 225, my pri care doc reffered me to a psych doc to evaluate meds etc.  FOund out that I may have adult add and we adjusted meds, etc.Now I'm only on 75mg.  I think that effexor actually caused me to be more lethargic in some ways.  As I stepped down my dosage this past winter, It was easier to get up and &quot;at 'em.&quot;But, it was difficult stepping down. Similar to the withdrawals of Zoloft that I experienced but not as steep.  You can read my other reviews that tie into the rest of the story about medications I took to try treating anxiety, sleeplessnes and attention.Topomax: http://www.remedyfind.com/review_long.asp?id=4553&amp;review_id=21254Concerta: http://www.remedyfind.com/review_long.asp?id=18601&amp;review_id=50997Adderall:http://www.remedyfind.com/review_long.asp?id=18599&amp;review_id=50998Now I'm going to try Strattera.---

Works well for me I took Effexor for about 5 months, after trying quite a few different anti-depressants. This was the only one which worked well for me without giving any significant side-effects. Unfortunately, it caused my moods to cycle (I am bipolar), and so I stopped taking it to avoid the mood swings. Decreasing the Effexor dosage has caused me to become suicidal once, and so decreasing the dosage should be done very cautiously and with medical supervision!

awful This stuff effected me badly. First, I was getting sleepy from it, then I saw geometric patterns of white light forming as I was trying to go to sleep that kept me awake. I got dry mouth, a headache that formed in the middle of my forehead,  nervousness, eyesight was getting strange too: I saw the flourescent lights in Wal-Mart like they were under water and wavey and blurry. During my German test I took I misread a words and answered questions wrong that I knew the answers to. I was feeling vertigo, and nausea, and sweats, and my blood pressure which is always great was high. This also gave me two nightmares. It was not good. I decided to try Lexapro, and so far after nine days no side effects except dry mouth. So far so good on Lexapro. The Effexor was bad.

Excellent for two years Effexor XR worked great for me with minimal side effects (delayed orgasm) for the longest time any antidepressant has ever worked for me before.  I had two years depression free, despite a lot of stress in my life during this time.  Then, suddenly, it stopped working.  I am now in the process of slowly tapering off under the direction of my MD so as not to have the bad discontinuation symptoms that have been reported. So far, so good, but I don't know where to go from here in terms of treatment.  I have tried just about everything else.  I had a grand mal seizure on Wellbutrin and have had a lot of nausea with some of the SSRIs (esp. Zoloft).  We're trying Cymbalta now but I'm having bad nausea so will probably have to discontinue it.  I'm grateful for the 2 years depression-free (longest I've ever had) with Effexor XR.

I hate this drug. One missed dose causes nausea and weird brain effects. I am currently down to 25 mg but haven't been able to get off it completely. I have tried 3 or 4 times and have had horrible side effects, including extreme panic attacks and an episode of throwing stuff into my suitcase at 4 am to run away from home for no reason.

good at 1st relief-then breakthroughs-insomnia bad it worked thesn it didn't work as good and for the last year or so it was like I wasn't on it at all except for the buzzing in my head nausea and dizziness.Then the horrible insomnia-you know up for two-three nights in tears wondering if you shuld just end your miserable life.Since March 20 I have requested to be taken off of the effexor and I have gone from 225mg to 150+37.5 once a day. My doctor wanted me to do 150 every day but I was acting bad and very irritable and with his ok went back to 187.5 a day. and I do feel more human. I plan on taking as long as it takes to get off this drug-I use to be on Zoloft and changed because of sexual side effects-but as you can imagine that leveled off to the way things were on Zoloft. I was nursing but have saw fit not to expose myself to the stress and cut-throat atomsphere or expose myself to any innocent patient. This is so very sad, I waited all my life to find my niche and then lost it to this disorder. I see a mental health counselor and she is good for me and I am more than thankful she is in my life.  But to answer your question, yes many side effects. One big one is irritablness-almost instantly after taking the Effexor. That is when my doc put me on Lithium. Very food thing, but it to has a hx of destruction ie thyroid, teeth and gum health, tremors in fingers and hands.I hope this helps the cause   Linda L.

hellish When I went off of it after becming manic it was terrible withdrawl. Now they know more about it. It should be done extremely gradual. Personally i think it is poison and would not reccomend it. I know others who feel the same. I have been on several other meds in last 20 yrs and this is by far the worst.

discontinutation syndrome has no proven treatment I started Effexor 11 years ago.  It cured my lifelong depression.  I gave me the strength to break old destructive patterns and transform my life for the better.  That's why when my new insurance company refused to pay for it, I felt confident I could finally live AD free. I started 4 months ago gradually reducing like the drug's insert said.  This past month, I got very sick.  The depression hasn't returned, but I have been incapacitated by nausea and dizziness/vertigo. I haen't been able to work for 3 weeks.  I don't have paid medical leave or a domestic partner to support me financially while I go through this.  My doctor is clueless.  Wyeth's info is not correct.  They suggest gradual reduction over time will reduce the discontinuation symptoms, but they are wrong!  Read the testimonials on the web--there are thousands of people suffering just like me and Wyeth has done nothing to find an effective treatment.  I think they should be forced to pay for the treatment research out of the millions they are making from effexor prescriptions.  Everyone who has ever taken effexor should be notified.  There is a petition out there addressed to Wyeth and signed by effexor victims, but I don't think it goes far enough.  These are SEVERE symptoms, enough to make many go back on the drug.  That's the only sure treatment Wyeth recommends, going back on the effexor.  Addiction by prescription one victim has called it.

Effexor for Panic &amp; Anxiety READ UPDATE BELOW !!!  After 22 yrs. of panic and anxiety using a low dose of Xanax which kept it under control, my daughter developed severe depression.  It turned my life upside down and the panic was out of control.  Paxil made me sick, Lexapro did nothing.  I just started Effexor XR, one week on 37.5mg and now second week on 75 mg.  I've had no side effects so far but still need the Xanax til Effexor takes over (I hope).  I do not have depression, I'm hyper and just want to be calm.  I have a wonderful life and have nothing to panic about, it just happens.  I'm optomistic and will hope for the best. Unfortunately the best didn't happen. I was looking for help for panic and anxiety, instead I had 8 days of HELL.  It gave me depression, OCD, headache, nausea and tremors.  The Dr. called it a paradoxical effect.  I've been on 4 antidepressants (SSRI's) because most Dr's go thru the roof when you mention Xanax. All have made me sick.  I don't understand how something to correct depression where you want to be &quot;up&quot; can help anxiety where you just want to be CALM.No more experiments for me, I'll stick with the Xanax and a higher dose if needed.

A rose with thorns The addition of Effexor XR to my regimen changed my life.  My mood has been unbelievably good for over a year. I really cannot stress strongly enough how well this drug works for me. My good mood comes with a price. I often walk through the day feeling as if I'm in a cartoon. An odd sense of unreality.  I seem to have memory problems which I attribute to this drug. Occasional nightsweats. I have a tremor which may be caused by other meds. DON'T miss a dose. You really do go through withdrawl if your blood level gets too low. I notice symptoms after just one missed dose. Please keep in mind that I am on a number of other drugs. Side effects may overlap, but I have tried to keep track of them...when they started, what I was on etc.5/1/06I am no longer taking Effexor.  I was switched to Cymbalta some time ago.  These drugs are similar in that they are both SSNRI's.  I had no problem transitioning between the drugs (no Effexor withdrawal) and find the Cymbalta easier to take (1 dose/day).  I feel that Cymbalta has a better side effect profile as well (see my Cymbalta rating).

Depressed with Effexor XR I have been on Effexor XR for about 3 years now.  I have found that it has not helped very well with my depression.  I am taking the Effexor XR for depression which came on after my Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome began.  I put off taking any anti-depression meds until I crashed one day and realized that I needed something to help.  My pain mgnt. doc first put me on Zoloft which didn't work at all for me. When I began to see a Psychiatrist I mentioned that the Zoloft caused sexual side effects and that it wasn't working for my depression so he put me on Wellbutryn.  This cause other side effects so he then put me on the Effexor XR.  I am on 375mg now and I still don't find complete relief from my depression.  Now I was just diagnosed with RA and I am finding it very hard to cope with in combination with the RSD/CRPS.  My pain mgnt doc has suggested yet another type of anti-depressant I guess it's new to the market, so now I am waiting to see what my psychiatrist will do with this suggestion.

Depressed with Effexor XR I have been on Effexor XR for about 3 years now.  I have found that it has not helped very well with my depression.  I am taking the Effexor XR for depression which came on after my Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome began.  I put off taking any anti-depression meds until I crashed one day and realized that I needed something to help.  My pain mgnt. doc first put me on Zoloft which didn't work at all for me. When I began to see a Psychiatrist I mentioned that the Zoloft caused sexual side effects and that it wasn't working for my depression so he put me on Wellbutryn.  This cause other side effects so he then put me on the Effexor XR.  I am on 375mg now and I still don't find complete relief from my depression.  Now I was just diagnosed with RA and I am finding it very hard to cope with in combination with the RSD/CRPS.  My pain mgnt doc has suggested yet another type of anti-depressant I guess it's new to the market, so now I am waiting to see what my psychiatrist will do with this suggestion.

Increased my quality of life - until i stopped When i first started takin Efexor it was like the lights were switched back on. Fantastic with no noticable side effects at all.Until i tried to stop taking it. Have tried to stop several times by weaning myself off it, each time experiencing withdrawel symptoms so severe i have to take it again. 'Brain-zaps', sweating, shaking, loss of co-ordination, nausea, loss of muscle control, unbelievable dizziness, to name a few. after 8 years I am now well and truly stuck, desperate to stop taking it.

not great I did not take effexor for long so I am not sure how effective it would have been long term. This drug gave me terrible insomnia, could not sleep day in week out. Reduced appetite which I did'nt mind, blurred vision too and dizziness.

Works well for me. Lithium and Prozac always left me with a feeling of being a little too low, tilted toward depression, with a lack of energy, focus and motivation.  For the past year, Effexor has worked well.  I have good energy, focus and motivation.  I take Effexor in combination with a low dose (0.5 mg) of Risperdal.  I also use a low dose of Trazadone as a sleep aid at night.  This combination works for me.

draws you out of the abyss then knocks you down I'm taking 150mg. I would certainly say it can take someone in a deep depression and draw them out of it. it's the best so far for major depression. otherwise, it sucks. I think it's good to get out of depression, but the side effects are killing me. I can't think, I can't study, I can't sleep, poop , lose weight, ... oh yeah, and it makes some women lactate, how bout' that. did I mention, I no longer have a libido, yes, Im asexual now folks. effexor will take that away to. but I can't be sad about it, because it's numbed me . most terrible side effects don't happen for a year to some people. we are all different. our bodies are going to do different things, and for me, my body , does not like effexor. so best advice I can give, find a doctor who cares, and be cautious getting on effexor, and definitely coming off of it.

Worked very quickly to alleviate severe depression It worked very well at first but in the last six months I noticed that I am becoming depressed again and have suicidal thoughts at least daily, not a good sign for me since I have acted upon that a few times in the past.  I am aware that I need help and have contacted a therapist to get some support.I have gained almost 40 lbs since I started taking this medication, I have no energy and feel tired all the time.  When I took prozac I was feeling better but could not sleep.  Effexor XR allows me to sleep but I am wondering if the trade off is worth it.On Prozac I used to go everyday and spin or walk and had a better quality of life, now I come home from work totally drained and just sit in front of the tv and surf the various unappealing network offerings.I have no sexual interests and am becoming an hermit, very unusual for me since I am basically an extraverted personality.  Maybe it is not Effexor, maybe it is menopause but my world is very dark at this time.

Very painful withdrawl.  Dr.'s please take note. While on the medication it does seem to provide some relief for depression and anxiety.  The side effects while taking the medication were as follows:  lethargy, reduced alertness, slow memory recall, weight gain, and sensitivity to cold.  It should be noted that weight gain persisted even with regular exercise and a balanced diet. Discontinuation however was quite severe with lingernig symptoms even with a slow tapering of dosage. Dosage was tapered over 6 weeks from 75mg to naught. Symptoms included, brain shivers (read next paragraph for description), severe insomnia, extreme agitation, sensation as if ants were crawling all over you, and joint and muscle pain/soreness.  Symptoms were felt strongly over 6 weeks past final dose.  Joint/muscle pain remain at a significant level along with minor brain shivers even 8 weeks past final dose.  I have not had any muscle or joint issues prior to taking this medication.  Description of brain shivers from my perspective is as follows:  A random moment of extreme dizziness, with the feeling of being electrocuted, accompanied a flight or fight emergency perception. Its as if you nodded off and were re-awaked suddenly by a fire alarm.  The electrocution seems to travel from the head to the arms and sometimes legs.  The electrocution is the most distrubing feeling and feels very much indeed like a true electrical shock. These shivers were sometimes severe (think wall outlet) and other times mild (think battery).  The effect is somewaht random, but can be aggravated by a sudden change of direction or standing/sitting too quicly.  This symptom can be very distracting and upsetting.I would strongly advise the Medical community to more closely review the effects of this medication.   The severity and lengths of the withdrawal symptoms warrant further study.   While the drug may be effective for the treatment of depression and anxiety that is nullified if the disco

Not particularly effective I'm pretty much treatment resistant as far as depression goes, I never used to be years ago.  There was a time when anything I took seemed to work and work fast.I didn't find Effexor very effective but then I don't believe I ever got up to the maximum dose.  I think I was on about 100mg of it.  It had the least anxiety affects but made me feel very spaced out at times in a lethargic way, I still felt depressed on it and sometimes I felt like my head was going to fall off the back of my neck on it.  Maybe if I'd have got to a higher dose when it supposedly affects norepinephrine I would have found it more affective.Denise

Effexor helped me Did it work? YES. Mood improved. Relationship with my husband improved HUGELY.Did it have side effects? YES. Lower libido and initially and scarily, although temporarily, inability to orgasm...so a bit frustrating for me and my husband. Also, it triggered very bad migraines more frequently than i was used to having so i have had to learn to 'manage' those better too....and it has sometimes  made me want to come off the medication; in fact i am just now redcung my dose to 37.5mg and already the migraine headaches are much better. It's a good drug. Better than plain SSRI I think....but expensive if you are paying for it out of your own pocket.

Just started taking it... Just started on Effexor XR this past week. Already noticing sexual side effects. I have Social Phobia. I've been on Zoloft, Wellbutrin and Klonopin in the past and I've had no long-term success with those. Hopefully Effexor works out for me. I'll keep those that are interested updated.

Helps Yes, it works, but not to end all depression.  I have Fibromyalgia &amp; thyroid problems which cause depression.  I take Effexor as well as 60mg. of Cymbalta at bed with 5 mg. of Methadone.  Effexor softens the effects of depression.  Side effects for me are constipation (which I take something for) and sweats.  The sweats are sometimes very bad, but if we lower the dose then severe depression returns.  Catch 22.

Not great This did not work the way I was expecting.  Yes, it did help with the emotional lows but I felt numb and did not like feeling that way since I was numb about everything including the things that I used to consider pleasurable.  However, I would feel excited like the feeling you get when you are waiting for something good to happen and would then have trouble sleeping at night.  At first I liked the feeling but after awhile it get's old and I was tired of having trouble sleeping and ended up hating that feeling.  I also was sweating and had dry mouth.  I had no desire for sex which makes sense if you consider that I always felt numb.Withdrawal was horrible.  I have noted this on the withdrawal page.  I was very sick; for four days with dizziness, dirrhea, nauseous, confusion - trouble concentrating, emotional - I would cry one minute and then laugh the next and I had migraine headaches.  I had to miss work since I was so sick and that is not something I do.  Thankfully two of those days were my days off.  The next week and a half I was able to return to work but continued to have migraines,and nauseous.  The headaches would come on so fast with the sick feeling that it made it hard to work because I could be feeling almost fine and then wham.....major headache with sick feeling.I think my doctor took me off to fast; three days 75 mg then three days 37.5 mg then off.  So if you are on this and are going to come off COME OFF SLOWLY!!!

Worst experience of my life!!! Made me have no feelings, just sleeping my life away.  After stopping cold turkey with Dr. approval, terrible withdrawal symptoms!  Still experiencing horrible headache, nausea, stomach burning and pain after 35 days off.  Would not recommend this drug to anyone - only if they were really desperate and already tried all other forms of treatment.

Awful Started taking for depression with anxiety, severe PMS/PMDD.  Every month, about two weeks before cycle was still as depressed and out of control as ever.  So was upped to 150 mg.  Still, no help.  During PMS time I have always been tired, but seems with Effexor even more tired and no motivation whatsoever.  I am on my second try at weaning off, and it is the worst thing I have ever been through.  Once I am off, I will never try this one again.

better than ever After my dad passed away I was crying all of the time, even after several months...my doctor prescribed Efexor...even though I had been depressed off and on since my teen yrs. and had never dealt with my negative thoughts and I never realized how bad I actually felt until I started Effexor...not only did my grief go away...I felt better than I had ever felt before.

Good AD... IN the process of switching to Cymbalta....withdrawal is a challenge, and would be even more so if I weren't adding another antidepressant. It was excellent for depression and for migraine headaches. Eliminated sexual desire or arrousal and the weight gain were the two biggest problems.Very good length of time for effectiveness as I have been through many AD's that either don't work or stop working relatively quickly.

Not bad at all I have had no side effects at all - well maybe I have and I just haven't noticed any.  I don't know - I thought they were working but now the doctor has added Wellbutrin to the mix so maybe they are not quite as effective as I thought they were.  They are sure better than everything else I have tried and man, I have tried everything else.

So far, so good I began Effexor about 3 months ago, and titrated up slowly from 25 mg/day to 150 mg/day. I tried to go higher (to 200 mg) but side effects kicked in (tremor in hands, funny feeling in the nerves in my forearms). It helps to reduce IC pain, reduce frequency, reduce urgency (I can wait for several hours) and improve depression.  Along with Vicodin for pain, it's allowing me to live a fairly normal life, at a much higher quality than before.

smooth and steady side effects were mild - I took as the doctor told me - with food.  I had some GI upset for a short while, but that was it.  I and my family have noticed marked improvement with my mood and activity  each week.  It was my first antidepressant and I am glad my doctor recommend it.  Now I feel like I used to.

It has helped trememdously It worked really well, but the side effect when I forget to take it are not good.  There are actually physical side effects and that kind of creeps me out.

Generally Positive It was shakey the first week.  Experienced by the fifth day diaherra, night sweats, insomnia.  However, by the fifth or sixth week, I was up to 150mg/day, and my system was able to adjust to the medication.  I found that drinking plenty of fluids (water especially) and exercise helped my body to metabolize the medication.I still occassionally have headaches and tend to fall asleep easily watching TV in the evening.The only thing I wish I could change are the sexual side affects (low sex drive, delayed orgasm, etc.).  Being a 45-year-old male, I no longer experience the libido of a seventeen year-old.  In balance, after nearly a year and a half taking this medication, I can honestly say it has been the best thing for me.

increased impulsive activity Effexor, sadly to say to those who swear by it and doctors who love to prescribe it, is one of those drugs that I cringe when I hear the sound of it.  I probably did not take it long enough for it to hit depression but what it did was increase my binge eating and big time.  It diminished my impulse control and that was not good.  On the advice of myself I stopped taking it on a Saturday night, cold turkey, and by Sunday night started vomitting.  I called the pharmacy to see if there was something I could take they said nothing w/o a script.  I called the pdoc on call who told me to take another pill or drink some ginger ale and eat some crackers.  I was vomitting bile by this time and crackers and gingerale  was not staying down.  Needless to say, ALWAYS, consult your doctor before you stop taking a med.  The package inserts aren't kidding.  I went to the ER that night and my bill was $800.  Intravenus fluids and Zofran to stop the vomitting.  No more effexor for me.

Worked for years then less effective 8 yrs of effexor and it did help depression but not enough help in the anxiety department. I researched all the side effects that this drug has on a body and there are many that are not so pleasant. I felt great for about 4 half yrs. Side effects like brain shivers and cysts on my face and neck were no fun and it did not help my anxiety anymore. I have Bipolar 2 and the effexor caused me to rapid cycle. Please get your doctor to be clear as to whether u have just anxiety, unipolar depression(just depression no paranoid delusional episodes)or could be bipolar. If I had only suffered from anxiety (not depression or Bipolar Disorder), I would still give it a poor rating, because it did keep me on a more even keel but the severe attacks numbers did not decrease.

8 yrs of effexor Great for unipolar depression and anxiety. If you are bipolar or there is a chance you might be, use with great caution, talk to your doctor, it can cause episodes if rapid cycling etc. in some people. Read up on it. This is a big deal if you are bipolar,and your doctor is the one to help determine that. I think my doctor-who just kept raising dosage every year would have had me take a million mg a day instead of trying something else. It caused cysts to develop on my face and neck and in conjunction with lithium I could not have antacids, too much alcohol(socially not daily), and constant, profuse sweating-this really helped my self esteem and depression. Not everyone I've met has had these effects, but MANY did and did not tell thier doctor because they did not think they had a choice. I am off of effexor because it was helpful for a time, then it wore off. Then I had to switch doctors because of insurance and he realized that the effexor was making me rapid cycle, the medicine I was taking was making the BP worse....Lamictal, klonopin, seroquel, and wellbutrin are what I am currently on and for 1yr and 3 months my life has completely been improved!!

As long as I take it, its great. The only side effects are when I skip a day or a few. The side effects are hell. The depression is worse than before I started the treatment. Plus the physical side effects are like having high blood pressure and schock treatment. I am the opposite of &quot;me&quot; when I dont take it. Irritable, quick tempered, high enxiety, etc. I have never been on any other anti-depression treatment but if they are all like this, how does anyone ever get off them to find out if you can be without the meds?

frustrating! Hard to say if it really worked as there were so many stressful things going on in my life. Why am i still on them if i don't rate them that much? Simply because of the awful withdrawel effects trying to come off them. Have tried several times to come off them slowly. I take them now because i can't not take them (terrible heady movement, like dizziness; nauseus, disorientation, basically unable to function at all. Perhaps they helped a bit at first, its so long ago i can't remember! I'm told they probably help to keep me at a stable point but i don't find they are doing a lot for me. The fact that there are different dosages of this med contributed to me being on them longer than i might have been in the beginning. I have been on normal and modified release at varying doages over the years. I would prefer to come off Venlefaxine and maybe try a different antidepressant, though my experience as a whole has made me very cynical towards them all and drs who don't give the right information at the time of prescribing or tell you how horrific it can be when trying to stop these meds. Very disillusioned with it all.

Worth the Side Effects I am a depressed person with a family history of depression.  My father committed suicide and so did my great grandfather.  I am grateful that effexor has allowed me to really tone down those temper flashes that so interfered with my ability to mother my children.  Also, it has helped me to function better in the rest of my daily life.  On the other hand, I could really do without the intense dreaming, and take other meds every few nights to get enough sleep.  The other negative is that the withdrawal is indeed harsh.  Make sure you have that refill called in ahead of time because the withdrawal starts within a couple of hours of missing a dose.  For me, effexor is an overall positive, but not perfect.  I am prepared to stay on it for life because of the good things it has done for me.

Rocky at first but getting better I've been on Effexor for 3 months now. I'm up to 150mg and its been doing a good job. The only noticable side effect I have is that its harder for me to achieve an orgasm. For me the sacrifice is worth it because I wasn't able to enjoy sex before because I was constantly anxious. I recently lost my insurance and the cost of the prescription is a lot. My therapist is helping me get on the patient prescription plan that Merck has but until then i'm using samples or getting 7 day prescriptions from wal-mart (the only place i know of that will do that)I have noticed lately that i'll have bouts of irritability and hyperness. Right now they're managable but if they get worse I may have to switch to somthing else or ad somthing on. All in all im really happy with how Effexor helps my anxiety. I'm working at a job where I'm around new people all the time. I know theres no way I would be able to handle it without the effexor.

Effexor cleared my mind of brain fog Among my symptoms of depression was what I called &quot;brain fog&quot;.  I had no working memory and couldn't seem to process information.  I also always felt like I had just gotten up from a hard sleep, not quite awake yet and unable to focus. No amount of coffee seemed to help.  I had no energy.  I wanted to sit and stare.  Effexor cleared my head, but not until I got to the higher dosage.  (I take 300mg/day.)  I think this indicates that in my case I needed the norepinephrine help.  I've read that Effexor doesn't really kick in the norepinephrine until you reach the higher dosage.  Once it kicked in, it really brought me back to life.

Pretty Good Relieved my mild depression, but I still had no motivation and it made me tired.  More exhausted type of feeling.  When I first took it, I was knocked out for the first week.  I also had sweaty feet and hands, even on the mild dose.  They deminished slowly over two weeks or so.  I switched to Lexapro, due to still feeling slight exhausted all the time and even a little flat.

Helped depression &amp; anxiety, but at a cost... I began taking Effexor about three years ago, after experiencing &quot;Prozac poop-out&quot; as my psychiatrist called it. I have battled depression and panic disorder since my children were born, but it has been well-controlled for the past five years. But on the Prozac I had started to experience low mood again after a couple of years, and I was at the highest dose my psychiatrist was comfortable with.I felt good on the Effexor -- some strange side-effects at first, but nothing I couldn't handle. It was odd -- sometimes I'd just be exhausted, and other times I couldn't sleep at all. I was told this is not unusual. But those went away quickly, and I had no troublesome side effects after that. I did not experience sexual side effects, but I hadn't after a couple of years on SSRIs, either.However, there were two side-effects (if you can call them that) that I could not tolerate, and that is why I went off Effexor and switched to Wellbutrin last October. The first is that I couldn't cry. I didn't have one good cry in the two plus years I was on the stuff, and I found that creepy. Since I switched to Wellbutrin, I get choked up again with moving songs, or when my four-year-old daughter gives me that look like her world is falling apart when her ice cream falls on the ground, etc. Not depression crying, just the bittersweet sadness that comes with being human. I have never enjoyed the ability to cry the way I do now!The second problem is that I gained and held onto a bunch of extra weight. I couldn't get motivated to exercise or diet, and I had an enormous appetite. This was a problem because I have high cholesterol and really needed to lose weight. Since switching to Wellbutrin, in addition to quitting smoking, I have been able to lose 30 lbs (thanks also to the Suzanne Somers diet). That in and of itself is a big mood-booster!I know that lots of people do not have a weight gain problem on SSRIs, but I am not one

Effexor for Depression I take 300 mg of Effexor XR per day for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder. It worked great for about 6 or 7 years.  However, for the past two years, I have been in a very deep depression. The Effexor doesn't feel like it works anymore. However, when I tried to go off it, my symtoms did get worse. Also, there are withdrawal symptoms when you go off Effexor and they aren't fun. Because of the withdrawal symptoms, I usually end up going back on the Effexor. The withdrawal symptoms include: vertigo (which is similiar to feeling dizzy), feel spacey, mood seems to worsen. I have tried so many different antidepressants and none of them have helped. I still take Effexor, but recently I began taking 200 mg of Provigil every day. Most people seem to notice an increase in energy and an improved mood right away (on Provigil).Today is day 6 of Provigil and I've noticed an increase in energy for the first time. My doctor also suggested that I try Adderall if the Provigil doesn't work. I may do this as I am having trouble with insurance covering the Provigil.If anyone has any experience with Provigil or Adderall, I'd love to hear from you.  Hope the info I provided is helpful.  Good luck!

Do not miss a dose! I've been on Effexor for awhile now in combination with Wellbutrin and Lamictal. I have been diagnosed with a form of bi-polar in which I have only lows and sometimes normal days.  Mostly it's depressed and more depressed.  After 10 years of trying different meds, this combo is the first to work.  However, do NOT miss a dose of Effexor.  I have on occasion when my script ran out and couldn't get it immediately from the pharmacy.  I felt like I was going mad.  I felt anxious and jumpy, my heart raced and I felt like my skin was crawling.  Also, I had the worst and most bizarre nightmares ever.

Did nothing for social anxiety Effexor did nothing for my social anxiety, but did get rid of the feelings of hopelessness caused by the depression at the cost of not being able to enjoy things that did bring me pleasure such as sex, music, and exercise. Takes away the hopelessness and the joy, so whats the point I would rather be dead in ditch somewhere than take this garbage.

EFFEXOR......SAVE YOUR LIFE OR .... I have been on Effexor XL now for 6yrs. I personally think it is unfair to give this drug a bad rating because of the side-effects when discontinuing. Anyone who has suffered in the black, hell, pit of depression would welcome anything in order to claw their way out of it. I was there and Effexor saved my life and i will always be thankful to it. I was able to function again, and life was bearable once more. Now i think when recovery is well under way, the blackness left behind, people start to focus more on the negative reactions of the drug rather than the positive ones. Sure the side-effects are pretty awfyl...i hate the constant tiredness if i miss a dose, the sexual numbness, and the inability to concentrate, among many  other things,.....BUT and i say BUT, this is nothing compared to BEING DEPRESSED.Now my situation at this prsent time is that of being fed up with the side-effects. I want to feel normal and energetic again and to lose the weight that i have gained from taking Effexor. I have been on the drug a long time and have been in therapy now for a year.....i feel ready now to face life and take the chance by coming off it. I have went from 150mg down to 75mg, every other day. I have decided to stop cold turkey as of today. I know this is not advised but i reckon i will just suffer the withdrawal symptoms. I am feeling strong enough at the moment to deal with them........and yes...i am having them at the moment....the electric shock sensations and dizzy spells are the worst.....I have heard that taking travel sickness tabs is supposed to help, but i havent tried this yet. I do not recommend the cold turkey method.....it is just the way i want to do it, as i hate the days of tiredness following a dose of take one miss one. I would rather just not take any and face the tiredness all at once and get it over and done with.Finally i just want to say that anyone who has depression and is offered Effexor....

My bad experience... My experience with Effexor was not a good one. That does not mean that everyone's experience will be bad. I didn't have any of the sexual side effects associated with anti-depressants, which was good, but my emotions were not any better. And, if I missed any doses, I was plagued with withdrawal symptoms: dizziness, nausea, sweating. When I stopped taking it, I was weaned off of it week by week. The withdrawal was terrible! The doctor said that it was better to go off of it slowly. I hate to think about what I would have felt like if I had quit cold turkey! I will never take it again.

Taking Effexor and fatigue I had taken Effexor mainly for depression which had become severe. I was more tired due to the depression but was focusing on aleviating the depression.  Being less tired and having more enthusiasm with the ability to go out and do more has been great. I still sleep in the afternoon which sometimes refreshes me, not always.

Don't miss a day! I've been using Effexor in combination with other drugs for 4 years for bipolar II.  We lowered my dose to control mania and added Lamictal and now I'm nice and steady.  However, I do have a jittery lower lip when I drink or go to the dentist.  Also, if i miss a day, forget it I can barely stand up from the &quot;bedspins&quot; and I cry uncontrollably.

VERY OVERRATED!! Well, I'm currently in the process of ditching Effexor XR, because when taken with Adderall XR, the side effects are HORRIBLE! Mainly, just fidgetyness and nervousness... it's off the charts!! Also, if you have blood pressure problems, DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION! It has boosted mine up dramatically... and with Adderall on top of it, I have hypertension! Without both meds., I have normal BP at all times. I attribute my BP elevation to the Effexor mainly, because I've done trial and error with self-monitoring, and if I just take a 75mg. Effexor cap., then check my BP an hour or so later... it's up! I've not yet tried this experiment with Adderall XR solo, but I would bet that my BP will not be that elevated, if any at all. Stimulants like Adderall only raise BP in very few people,... unless it's abused, or one takes other stimulants along with it (eg.. coffee, sodas, nicotine, ephedrine, etc.) Bottom line, for as well as this med works, which is NOT VERY WELL, IT'S NOT WORTH THE SIDE EFFECTS!! In my opinion, this stuff is awful!

Effexor Effective in my case Panic attacks, general anxiety, moderate to severe depression, and some obsessive compulsive characteristics made my psychiatrist suggest I try Effexor.  The &quot;newer&quot; extended release works better.  I take 450 mg per day; that is,  two 150mg when I wake up, and one before I go to bed at night. The mild side effects such as dizziness sometimes, night sweats sometimes don't bother me enough to discontinue it.  When the days get longer, I drop down to two 150mg capsules a day.  I also have &quot;seasonal affected disorder&quot; so I get more depressed during the winter months.  It took a few years to pick up on why the effectiveness was going away - until we noticed it was for the same months every year.

Effexor Worked For Me I have had anxiety problems for most of my life.  It go to the point, while at college, where I could not even leave my apt.  Since then I have been on medicine, and have gone though counciling.  I have come a long way, and I am a firm believer in Medicine, if used correctly.  You hear all of these horror stories about people on these medicines, but most cases are due to the drug being mis-prescribed.  This really changed my life, and got me to a place where I could actually start to heal.  I still battle with anxiety from time to time, but it no longer runs my life.

This medication is bad news for bipolar people I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder 14 years ago. I took meds sporatically... only when I was having severe episodes. I didn't notice manic episodes until June 05, after being prescribed Effexor XR. At first I thought it was a miracle drug. After only taking it for a week and a half I was on top of the world and stayed there for a month and a half. Then I had the worst depressive episode ever. This cycle went on from June-December 2005, when I was diagnosed as Bipolar I with rapid cycling. The Dr started me on Lamictal and began weening me off the Effexor.2 weeks ago I took my last dose of Effexor. This drug brought out the highest high and the lowest low in my moods and the withdrawals almost killed me, literally. In the past, I have always had suicidal thoughts, but with Effexor I became obsessed with suicide. I was constantly thinking about doing it. I would even dream about it. I tried to do it several times, and I started cutting again... something I hadn't done in almost 10 years. I lost my job, my will to live, a lot of  my  friends, my man, and would have been homeless if not for the love and support of certain friends and family.If you are or may be bipolar please stay away from this medication, it's very dangerous. It almost ruined my life.

Use something else! I was originally using Celexa sucessfully for a few years.  I moved out of state and lost my benefits and ability to obtain Celexa cheaply.  To get started again I obtained state help.  Help, LOL - they wouldn't pay for Celexa and put me on Effexor instead.  I believe it has affected me for life.  I didn't experience any real noticeable relief from my depression.  When the state faltered on my coverage I suffered severe withdrawl symptoms.  I was on and off the medicine depending how I was yanked around.  With the remaining capsules I had, I broke them all open and divided it out to gradually wean myself over 4 weeks.  I was dizzy/vertigo, weak, tired, shakey, sweating, irritable, nervous, couldn't see straight, nauseous and I had dry/medicine mouth.  The 2 worst side effects were the unbearable colliding nerve Zaps! throughout my entire body and my ongoing memory loss.  I truly feel like I was a guinea pig robbed of my life.  I am extremely disappointed with Effexor and would rather be depressed than EVER take it again.

Effexor's effective Only shortcoming, besides loss of libido, is that the discontinuation symptoms are quick to set in if you miss a dose even by more than a few hours.  And I had all sorts of very unpleasant symptoms when I cut down from 225 mg to zero over a 2-week period in 2001.  They included nausea, dizziness, fatigue, feeling HORRIBLE overall...plus esophageal reflux(heartburn) that appeared over the next 5 or 6 weeks.  From what I've read this is a pretty common problem with Effexor. Very gradual weaning off, plus Prozac to cover that period of time, is supposed to be helpful.

Effexor Treatment I did not find that Effexor was enough for my depression.  However it did help with my essential tremor (in the hands).  I felt hot when I took it, but not as hot as when a psychiatrist suddenly took me off the medication.  The company warns not to discontinue Effexor abruptly, but I figured that the doctor was replacing it with another  medication that was preventing the withdrawal.I now know what suffering drug addicts go through when quitting their addictive drug(s). Please HEED the warning to slowly cut back on your dosage of Effexor should you need to stop taking it.  And, should any doctor try to pull you off the drug abruptly, please seek another physician to deal with your case.  This is what I did, and it may take a while to find another truly competent doctor, keep on trying.  They ARE out there.

WORKEDE GREAT UNTIL.... This was the WONDER drug for my slight depression and OCD.  I then got pregnant, had to go off of it for the class of drug it was and not being safe for the baby.  Went on Prozac during my pregnancy since it was a safe alternative.  After I gave birth and stopped breatfeeding, tried to go back on Effexor and I felt horrible, with really bad shakes.  My body chemistry totally changed after the baby.  Cannot take it any more.

Very paranoid and delusional.  Bad stuff This drug cause me to become a rapid cycler with severe mixed episodes.  I became very paranoid and suspicious and delusional.  It did not help my depression but instead caused me many severe manic and depression episodes with alot of anxiety.  I stopped it cold turkey and boy did that hurt and make me violently ill but it was well worth it.  One of the best things I did for myself was stop this drug.  What a relief that was.

Didn't Find the Effectiveness in Effexor For the first two months I was on a 50mg daily dosage of Effexor.  Everything seemed to be going well until I fell into another 'depressive episode'.  The dose was then increased to 75mg.  Just one month later I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt.  Effexor seemed to make a bad situation worse.What works for one may not work for another.  I realize that some people have had nothing but success with Effexor and that it works well for them, however I think it important that experiences like mine be shared.  It's important to know and understand what your taking and the risks that come along with the benefits.

Effexor My doctor put me on Effexor after having my second child and right away I was not liking my side effects. About 8 -10 hours after taking the medicine, I would start having really bad panic attacks. I don't know if it was tied to the medicine, I never had panic attacks before that.  I just know that I had to be taken off it. I know everyone is effected different ways with different medicines so what doesn't work for me, may work for someone else.

Very good for panic attacks and mood I began taking 300mg of Effexor XR a couple of years ago.  I have bulemia, bipolar disease and borderline personality disorder.  Effexor XR helped quite a bit with my mood and panic attacks (I was having 3-4 a day, now I have 1 a month) but has done nothing for my ability to feel pleasure in life (for that I'm taking Wellbutrin).A lot of people complain about side effects, but remember that not everyone will have them.  I had none whatsoever.  So don't let that stop you from trying a drug that can be very helpful, albeit very expensive.P.S there is no such thing as being &quot;sensitive&quot; to medication, that is your anxiety.

I have bulemia, bipolar disease and borderline personality disorder.  Effexor XR helped quite a bit with my mood and panic attacks (I was having 3-4 a day, now I have 1 a month) but has done nothing for my ability to feel pleasure in life (for that I'm taking Wellbutrin).A lot of people complain about side effects, but remember that not everyone will have them.  I had none whatsoever.  So don't let that stop you from trying a drug that can be very helpful, albeit very expensive.P.S there is no such thing as being &quot;sensitive&quot; to medication, that is your anxiety.

stay away! I took 5 tablets of effexor per day for about a year.  I felt as though they were sugar tablets for the amount of either benefits or side effects while i was on them.  When I came off them (over about 3 months) I felt like I was dying, it was the most horrific experience of my life.  Since i have been off them I have had an extreme emotional flattening and have felt no positive emotions whatsoever.  I would recommend staying far, far away from these at the risk of losing any future happiness.

Effexor - the wonder drug I don't remeber when I began taking Effexor or when I stopped (a nasty little side effect of CFS)but I do remember that it made me feel like a human again.  The only problems I had with it were that it made my heart beat too fast and I would sweat with any kind of prolonged activity.It was so bad at one point I thought I was going to pass out.  It took some time for it to get out of my system and I with it didn't have that effect on me because the pros helped me so much.  The cons probably would have killed me though.

Horrifying experience This was bar-none the WORST drug I have ever encountered. I had every side effect listed and then some. I felt as if I was dying the first day I took it. Then thought I had the flu but found out it is a side effect of the drug. Also had sore throat, nausea, fever, muscle pain, dizzy, faint, and worst of all joint pain to the point that I had difficulty walking. I was afraid to drive because I was so &quot;stoned&quot; on the medication. I had absolutely no sex drive and when I did get active was unable to reach orgasm. The Dr. cut me down to 1 pill every 2 days and that brought the side effects down to a tolerable level. Still, the slight benefit was far outweighed by the side effects. I would never recomend this drug to anyone!

Bad News! Tried samples for nagging depression of my bipolar.  Thought I was having a heart attack after a couple of days.  Went to the doc and they rushed me in for an EKG, kept me there until a new anti-hypertensive took effect.  Now I'm permanently on two blood pressure drugs.

Very effective, but worried about discontinuing I have been on Effexor for about 1 1/2 years.  I have tried others, but this one has worked the best for me.  However, I have had to steadily increase my dose for it to be effective.  Also, if I miss a dose, the consequences are horrendous.  I start feeling the withdrawal symptoms.  The &quot;brain shivers&quot; where I cannot turn my head without feeling out of it/weird...it almost feels like an EXTREMELY bad hangover, headaches, fatigue/weak feeling, nauseous...I can barely get out of bed. Upon finally taking a dose, it takes about 5-6 hours for me to feel normal again. My dose is getting up there (300/day) I know I can still take more, but with the increased dose I have gotten side effects.  Night sweats is the biggest. Dreams become more vivid. Like I said, it has been extremely effective with my depression/anxiety, but the thought of a higher dose &amp; switching meds scares the hell out of me!!!  I wish I would have known the discontinuation symptoms before starting.  Next time I'll do the research!

placebo to keep the doctors happy My primary problem is chronic pain, and the current treatment for this problem is a coctail of medications that includes psychiatric medications.  The pain docs consider antidepressants a &quot;must&quot;, and in order to maintain access to my pain medication, I must be seen to be taking an antidepressant.  Unfortunately for me, my body hates antidepressants.  Even though I suffer from depression over and over, the side effects of antidepressants are too much for me, and most of them don't work anyway.  The pain docs push Effexor because they believe it to have some power to relieve pain, and they like to dose patients with up to 300 mg. per day of the stuff.  I was discharged from a hospital stay taking a monster dose of Effexor, and I found that I was a mental basket case, crying every day, and also I wasn't sleeping at all, despite large doses of trazadone and then Ambien in addition.  I was up all night every night for months, and the psychiatric team had no cure for the problem, and didn't think that it was a big problem.  So I resorted to my tried and true solution and started tapering off the Effexor.  I found that at 150 mg. per day I could tolerate the stuff, though it was doing me no good at all, and it kept my doctor happy for years.  After I had taken it for about four years, I had a new psychiatrist, and she wanted me to increase the dose of Effexor.  I followed her instructions, and found that I didn't get the expected insomnia.  However, after several months, I started becoming extremely fatigued, to the point that I was afraid to drive.  Since I live alone and have no one to take care of me, this was a major problem.  The doctors I saw kept asking me if I had started a new medication, but I hadn't.  Finally I reasoned that since the antidepressant dose was the only thing that had changed, and since I had a history of sleep-related problems with anti-depressants, it would make sense to taper back down on the Effexor

Effexor used to treat IBS-D I was put on Effexor XR to control the anxiety from IBS-D.  I have been on this drug for over 4 years.  This drug did help with that problem, but the side effects were really hard to deal with.  I experienced weight gain, intense sweating, yawning &amp; fatigue, and loss of libido.  The mental side effects were a sense of flatness - I wasn't really happy or sad...just an awful apathy about everything...a feeling I've never experienced before in my life.  I've finally have begun the withdrawal process and I'm about halfway through this process (under a Dr.'s instruction for weaning) and so far I've not experienced too many symptoms of withdrawal.  It took a lot of courage to come off this drug after reading about others battle with withdrawal.  But I just felt that I could not live the rest of my life not caring about anything.  I don't know what to expect with the IBS-D after getting off of Effexor - I'll just have to cross that bridge when I get there.  I may try Lotronex since it seems to make more sense to treat the IBS-D than my brain.  I feel that the anxiety I was experiencing was due to the IBS-D rather rather the the other way around -i.e. that the IBS-D came first and then the anxiety.

Effexor Helped quite a bit at first but effectiveness has lessened over time; I'm still taking it, however, because without it, I get very teary - cry over the least little thing.  My dosage over these years has varied between 37.5 mg and 450 mg. per day.  (450 mg. is WAY too much!)  I have also tried several other meds during this time; even the ones that work well at the beginning lose their effectiviness over a few months.

effective but for how long? I've taken effexor for 4 years with brief periods of switching to other ad's. Effexor has been the most effective for me. My symptoms were in remission for about a year and a half which was great, but slowly they came back and i tried other antidepressants and my conditon only worsened. It seems after such a pro longed period of use, effexor has almost stopped working for me. In addition to this I developed side effects from it after almost 2 years of taking the drug, which is quite strange. Anyways its a good anti-depressant but i wouldnt rely on it for long term use.

Effexor I have been taking Effexor now for 6 weeks and I have to honestly say that I have never felt more myself ever.  The early side effects I got past and now I am just a little tired at times and it is hard to wake in the morning.  I am going backto the Dr and perhaps try some Wellbutrin for the tiredness and lack of energy, also a lower than normal interest in sex.   I personally like how it makes me more balanced, and did do plenty of research before taking it.

Wow!  Effexor XR, Dosage and Powerful Changes Hi Hi Guys ;)It has been months and months since I posted here. Quite frankly, the reason for that is that I have been imbalanced and tweaking meds following the death of my father.  My pdoc had a good supply of Effexor samples and suggested we opt for a 1 month trial of the med (which, btw, I have used before with not much success as you may see in a previous post).  I was hesitant to go back on the SSRI/SNRI wheel, but intuitively seemed to know that for me and my brain chem, this med at the RIGHT dose may be a godsend.Indeed, it was!  BUT... let me qualify that.  I took a full 4 weeks to tweak the dosage.  And quite frankly I believe that is the problem most people run into with Effexor.  The more I read up on it, the more I see it's so DOSE-SPECIFIC to each individual.  And this is key.  For me, starting at 75mg right out of the gate was not a problem.  For others, it causes chaos.  I increased the dose to 150mg within a week, again with positive changes and no problems.Now, after staying at 150 for another week, it just did not feel as effective as, say Lexapro or other SSRI's I've mentioned on this site.  However at 225mg of Effexor XR... MAGIC!!  All I can say is wowza!  It's not that I'm totally cured or that I have stopped or been concerned about the bipolar II side.  I still take other meds, and some have been altered because of the success of Effexor XR.  All I can offer you by way of personal experience, is this:  LISTEN, OBSERVE BUT DO NOT ACCEPT AS ULTIMATE TRUTH THE NEGATIVE OPINIONS REGARDING THIS MEDICATION!  Remember, it's very dose-specific to each.  And honestly, I have been on it before and come off it with minimal side-effects.  I don't doubt that some folks have withdrawal syndrome, but I can truthfully say that I did not.  In a nutshell, I truly think this med ROCKS (lol). It's not a &quot;high&quot;... rather it brings me back to earth and allows FEELING, decreases ANXIETY, and lets me

However at 225mg of Effexor XR... MAGIC!!  All I can say is wowza!  It's not that I'm totally cured or that I have stopped or been concerned about the bipolar II side.  I still take other meds, and some have been altered because of the success of Effexor XR.  All I can offer you by way of personal experience, is this:  LISTEN, OBSERVE BUT DO NOT ACCEPT AS ULTIMATE TRUTH THE NEGATIVE OPINIONS REGARDING THIS MEDICATION!  Remember, it's very dose-specific to each.  And honestly, I have been on it before and come off it with minimal side-effects.  I don't doubt that some folks have withdrawal syndrome, but I can truthfully say that I did not.  In a nutshell, I truly think this med ROCKS (lol). It's not a &quot;high&quot;... rather it brings me back to earth and allows FEELING, decreases ANXIETY, and lets me

Effexor XR  - the longest withdrawal period ever Every anti-depressant effects people differently. That said - as I can attest to and heard stories about - Effexor is incredibly difficult to come off of as compared to other anti-depressants. I was on a 300 Mg dosage for a  year and a half to treat chronic pain and depression. Once I was ready to come off the drug, it took another 5 months to get off it - not due to rebound depression side effects, but due to these shock sensations in my head when I tried to come off at any speed other than a turtle's pace. My doctor said this sensation is most common amongst effexor users than any other anti-depressant. Other side effects it caused me: fluid build up in the joints that led to mild arthritis (i'm 25 - it disappeared once I was off the drug), fragile blood vessels, that led to easy bruising.

REPOSTING I was on effexor since 0ctober 2002, never did I see the light on it, BUT it took my anxiety away, by 2004 my depression got WORSE, so I was put from 150mg to 225mg, still feel hopeless and abandoned, night sweats with the increase dosage and nothing else. Quit cold turkey and thought I was going to die of despair and vomiting - WITHDRAWALS FROM EFFEXOR ARE SOMETHING YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO WISH UPON EVEN YOUR WORST ENEMY- then was put on lexapro 20mg I've cutting my pills in two - plan to eventually take full pill to see a jumpy improvement, my Dr. also put me on abilify but I have kept it off for a while, I've read that abilify is a much stronger drug and I am afraid of putting myself through it.
