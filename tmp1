No positive benefits I was taking this medicine to treat bipolar depression.  I was extremely tired, but had trouble sleeping.  I felt absentminded.  My mind was racing constantly.  I eventually switched to Paxil, Lithium, and Ritalin before feeling normal.

I''m allergic to this med! After suffering from BPD and depression for the last 6 years I finally decided to try drug treatment again.  My doctor prescribed Effexor - big mistake.  I took it the first night, all night I tossed and turned, was hot, then cold, threw up twice, and when I finally got up the next morning my jaw hurt from clinching it.  I didn't feel right all day, nauseous, foggy, just not there.My mom suggested that maybe I should try instead of taking it at night, to take it a few hours before I had to wake up.  That way I'd be able to sleep, and to take it with a little food.  So the next morning I set my alarm for 3 am, woke up, took the pill with some toast and went back to bed.  Not alot of nausea, but instead again, for the next 3 hours I tossed and turned and had the hot and cold spells.  When I finally got out of bed I felt nauseous, disorientated, and again, just not there.  I was also still clinching my jaw and my thoughts were racing, but at the same time I couldn't make a complete thought at all.Now I'm on Wellbutrin in the morning and klonopin, so far so good ... the klonopin I just started yesterday because the Zyprexa I was on made me gain 15 pounds in a month (which was significant on my small frame) so the doctor took me off of it.My mom is taking the Effexor now and she says it works great for her, except she has hot flashes.

It has worked quite well. I worked part time. The most recent was as a counselor for mentally ill in a non profit org. I was terminated after 3 years when I had a bout with my severe depression that lasted one month.The only side affect I notice is some difficulty with sex. Nothing else seems to be of major concern to me.

Works great for BP-II, carefull of mania though I started this after I dropped Paxil (due to severe constipation). Side effects include night sweats and a tendency to mania. The latter I fixed by increasing the dosage of Seroquel (which I was using anyway to treat mania). Apparently common side effects I did NOT experience include constipation and sexual disfunction.Warning re. dosage: do not skip a day and make sure you have a supply as skipping two days can be pure hell.

Effexor XR a trigger I thought this medication was helping my depression, and it probably was, but it was the cause (I believe) of a lot of mixed states so I had more physical energy but spent a lot of time crying and angry and agitated.  It also made my hands shake terribly.

Found out antidepressants aren't a good idea I took this antidepressant from the time was first diagnosed with major depressive order, recurrant until after my correct diagnosis of BPII.  It wasn't until a change in docs with a different med philosophy that I realized that Effexor was actually destabilizing my moods.

Good I have been using Effexor for about 5 years now after almost 7 years on Prozac. I needed to get off Prozac because I found my more tired and with no libido at all. The Effexor has helped me in both areas but I wish it were a bit more effective. The best meds I was on (very briefly) was Wellbutrin, which made me feel wonderful, but unfortunately I developed hives very quickly and had to stop taking it.

Effexor XR/ 225mg per day I've been taking Effexor XR (Time-Released) 225mg (which is 3-75mg capsules) once in the morning.  My NPA (Nurse Practioner), whom I trust implicitly, explained to me that at the 225mg dosage, I am increasing reuptake of dopamine and norephineprine, as well as the serotonin.  Apparently, at lower dosages of Effexor, serotonin is the only neurotransmitter effected.I used to praise all the powers that be for Effexor.  I had been taking Zoloft at 100mg/day for 3 years prior, combined with Trazadone at 150mg/night, and I was noticing that it wasn't doing anything anymore.  I began to fall into a slump, and recognized right away the slope I was on.  Not wanting to slide any further down, I spoke to my Nurse Practioner, and she suggested Effexor.  I began taking this in December of 2003.  Since then, I've had a surgery that didn't cure what it was supposed to, and left me 1 ovary short.  I've also been dealing with chronic pain, which resulted in the loss of my job.  Yet despite all the sorrow over the loss of my ovary, and the loss of my job, I haven't been depressed.  I haven't felt like the future will always have these feelings, or that everything is hopeless.  So, I know that this drug is helping me, absolutely, because I think if I was on Zoloft at the time this had all happened, I would have had to check myself into a voluntary hold for suicide watch.Now that it's been 2 and 1/2 yrs on the drug, I would like to say that I'm satisfied with it, but I'm not.  I've been taking it in combination with Methadone for the chronic pain (not just to help folks kick addictions, kids), and I'm pretty sure that the combination is what resulted in sudden panic attacks now.  I've never had panic-anxiety disorder, although I do have anxiety with depression until the last 3 months (it's 06/06 now).  I found out through my own research that Methadone is also a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, so I believe I've just been getting too mu

lots of side effects even with the xr, i felt withdrawal symptoms BEFORE 24 hours, which was very uncomfortable, and disturbing during work (tingling lips and hands, feeling spaced out/dissociated). worked pretty well for both depression and anxiety, but i couldnt take the side effects, and i ended up swtiching meds due to trying to get pregnant.

Side Effects! Withdrawal! This is a serious drug. I used it before diagnosed w/ bipolar II as an attempt against resistant agitated depression. Basically I just hated this drug and never knew if it was working, but I sure as hell knew if I missed a dose. As for SNSRIs, Cymbalta was kinder to me, gentler, but unclear effectiveness. I perceived weight gain, so went off it, coupled with unsure effectiveness. Now in the context of bipolar II diagnosis, my experience may not be fair. But the side effects are *real.* And withdrawal is a b*tch.

terrible withdrawal symptoms when missed a dose Effexor worked for me for about a year and a half even though I would notice very vivid dreams if I would miss a dose.  After taking this drug for about a year and a half, I started having break-through depression and I wanted to increase the dosage.  My doctor said no because I was taking the upper limit of what is recommended.  She is trying to taper me off Effexor in order to start another drug and I'm having a TERRIBLE time getting off of it.  I have headaches, general body aches, terrible depression and wild, vivid dreams.

Horrible I know it works good for some, but it made me shaky.  The only thing that has worked for me is Tramadol or Ultram which is used for pain.

effexor experience After taking this drug for over 1 year, I find that I am starting to experience mild bouts of depression again, not as bad as before I started taking it, but bad enough to notice. Side effects: Lack of motivation, devrease in sex drive, short term memory problems, slight confusion. I am concerned about what I have been reading about removing myself from this drug, concerning withdsrawal problems. I would like to stop taking it, but am hesitant

Made me very groggy... I started taking Venlafaxine, having already tried and failed with Citalopram (Cipramil).  Within 2-3 days of taking the Venlafaxine, however, it quickly became apparent that it was having the same effect as the Citalopram.  To me, it just acted like a sedative.  It made me feel, groggy and a bit 'spaced-out' during the day and gave me insomnia at night.Sometimes when anti-depressants don't have the right theraputic 'action' for your particular condition, they seem to just make the symptoms worse.I put up with the effects of the Venlafaxine for about ten days before I felt I really couldn't go any further and came off them, ramping the dosage down slowly.This drug obviously works for some people, but it did nothing for my fatigue / lethargy based depression.....in fact it made it much worse.For my money, its sedative action makes it very similar to SSRI drugs, like Citalopram etc.

Excellent After experiencing severe depression and panic attacks that left me unable to accomplish the simplest daily tasks my doctor put me on Effexor XR. This drug changed my life.  The panic attacks and black hole of depression absolutely lifted and I was able to realize what a NORMAL person feels like.  I have been able to completely stop ruminating on all of the dreadful outcomes of every day life (flying, driving, etc.).  This drug has been a miracle for me.  I stopped taking Effexor for a short time (1 month) thinking I could handle my symptoms on my own but crashed down once again.  Going off of this drug helped me to realize how much this drug HAS improved my life.  I know I could not live without it.

Horrible I know it works good for some, but it made me shaky.  The only thing that has worked for me is Tramadol or Ultram which is used for pain.

effexor experience After taking this drug for over 1 year, I find that I am starting to experience mild bouts of depression again, not as bad as before I started taking it, but bad enough to notice. Side effects: Lack of motivation, devrease in sex drive, short term memory problems, slight confusion. I am concerned about what I have been reading about removing myself from this drug, concerning withdsrawal problems. I would like to stop taking it, but am hesitant

Made me very groggy... I started taking Venlafaxine, having already tried and failed with Citalopram (Cipramil).  Within 2-3 days of taking the Venlafaxine, however, it quickly became apparent that it was having the same effect as the Citalopram.  To me, it just acted like a sedative.  It made me feel, groggy and a bit 'spaced-out' during the day and gave me insomnia at night.Sometimes when anti-depressants don't have the right theraputic 'action' for your particular condition, they seem to just make the symptoms worse.I put up with the effects of the Venlafaxine for about ten days before I felt I really couldn't go any further and came off them, ramping the dosage down slowly.This drug obviously works for some people, but it did nothing for my fatigue / lethargy based depression.....in fact it made it much worse.For my money, its sedative action makes it very similar to SSRI drugs, like Citalopram etc.

Excellent After experiencing severe depression and panic attacks that left me unable to accomplish the simplest daily tasks my doctor put me on Effexor XR. This drug changed my life.  The panic attacks and black hole of depression absolutely lifted and I was able to realize what a NORMAL person feels like.  I have been able to completely stop ruminating on all of the dreadful outcomes of every day life (flying, driving, etc.).  This drug has been a miracle for me.  I stopped taking Effexor for a short time (1 month) thinking I could handle my symptoms on my own but crashed down once again.  Going off of this drug helped me to realize how much this drug HAS improved my life.  I know I could not live without it.

Very positive, Side effects was Constipation, treated that with a daily dose of Metamucil.  Sexual side effects were remedied through limiting ourselves (my wife and I)to once a week. Letting yourself build up to the occasion. :) My energy levels picked up, and I did not gain any additonal weight from the medication.  A very good medication to help.  Do not drink Alcohol with this product.

Weight Gain &amp; dizziness but eases depression Gained 15 pds so far. You need to exersise a lot to keep weight off. It causes dizziness when it starts to wear off or if you miss a dose. It gives me bizarre dreams sometimes. It sometimes give me panic attacks, definitely use the extended release pills.

HORRIBLY OUTRAGEOUS I started at the lowest dose and the doctor just kept increasing the dosage.  I turned into a zombie, divorced my wonderful husband whom I still love, left my beautiful home and am now in talk and medical therapy.  The side effects were horrible, especially the anger. By then, I was alone and no one wanted to be around me.  Can you blame them?  If I hear of anyone on Effexor, I warn them to watch out.

I'm happy I think it is working on my social anxiety. I seem to enjoy being around people more and I don't have a need to go home and be by myself. I still have performance anxiety though as in being afraid to read in front of a group. This med works great on my PMS tension and my preimenopause mood swings. There are sexual side effects.

Didn't  Help Depression I just switched from Lexapro to Effexor because I gained 20 pounds in 2 months on Lexapro. My Dr. said Effexor works just the opposite....causes loss of appetite. I have had no side effects.*** June 13 - I didn't have any side effects with Effexor but it didn't help my depression anything like Lexapro. I had to switch back. I will have to exercise more to keep the weight off because Lexapro made me feel GREAT!!

Didn't realize how effective it really was! When I first began taaking 75 mg of Effexor, the side effects were pretty bad.  I felt very depressed but I was also aware thet the depression was a result of the med and only temporary.  Slowly, my night sweats stopped and my tension head and neck aches ended.  Crowded department stores didn't bother me so much.I started a new job in November and met a great guy; I was ready to discuss decreasing dosage with my doctor.  I had not gotten around to it when accidentally, the 35 mg was prescribed. I decided not to say anything to the doctor b/c I was ready to step down anyway.  After 3 months, my symptoms returned.  I went to see her and I am back to 75 mg.  It hasn't been a full week yet but I can't wait for the tension in my neck to go away.

Works well but have changed to Wellbutrin After a couple of years on the 37.5 mg. XR dose I felt it wasn't working as well, and moved up to 75 mg. XR.  This dose did work better to control my anger and irritability. Unfortunately it also seemed to raise my blood presure some. And I tended to sweat and get hot easily.  Sexual side effects are also noticeable - very little interest in sex. After a couple of years on the 75 mg. dose I decided to switch to Wellbutrin, and was able to make the change over after just a few days, and with no side effects.  Didn't surprise me, as I seem to be one of the rare people that weren't affected by missing a dose.  Many days I didn't take it, sometimes even a couple of days in a row, and other than increased irritability had no other indications that I hadn't taken it.

Very poor--use extreme caution with this drug Efexor was the first anti-depressant drug that I took as part of a clinical trail in the 90s. As I was given it as part of a trial in Florida (uni of Florida med school) and having little experience with the anti-depressant drug culture, I assumed that taking it must have a positive effect.  During my 'romance' with Efexor I managed to lose my job, my wife and complete sense of purpose in life.  The drug side-effects included greater depression, loss of motivation, great lethargy, loss of libido, anxiety and suicidal thinking and increased drinking (if you are so inclined).  Maybe this drug works for some, but my advice/experience is that if you don't feel positive effects shortly after starting this regime--GIVE IT UP.  Giving up the drug after extended use is extremely traumatic and may require hostipalization--ie detox ward. It is not for the faint of heart.Paddles

Good at first, but horrible long term I began effexor along with wellbutrin in the summer of 2001. The two worked great initially.  But, looking back, I think they made me a little manic--I suddenly decided to break up with a live-in boyfriend i loved and started to sometimes shoplift. I also started to sleep all weekend and became really messy.  If I didn't take the effexor right on schedule, I'd get brain zaps.  After a few years, the sleeping problem got worse and I started having muscle pains in my legs. My depression also worsened.  I was like a zoombie.  My Dr. increased my dosage and i noticed the symptoms all got worse. It was like Chronic Fatigue. I started to wonder if it was the effexor and decided to quit--pretty much cold turkey.  The withdrawal was a NIGHTMARE! For weeks I had brain zaps, dizziness, loack of coordination, sweats and anxiety (which was never a problem for me).  Then, my tummy blew up like i had edema (very strange), my hair started to fall out in clumps and i became completely dysfunctional. Beware going off this med--be sure to taper slowly!  In order to &quot;realign&quot; my body, i had to briefly take lexapro and wellbutrin for a few months and then taper off slowly.  I've now been antidepressant free since Nov 2005.  I've been doing well--there are some days i wonder if i should take something, but it's almost like once you've tried antidepressants, anytime you have a bad day, you think you might need something.  I've been doing a lot of reading too and --while I do believe brain chemicals and personality plays a role in depression--i can also see where my thought process has contributed to my issues.  Needless to say, while effexor helped me a lot initially, given the withdrawal and long term effects--i don't think i would take it if i had to do it over again.

horrible, made me sick When I was first diagnosed with depression, the PA put me on Effexor at 75m once per day.  It seemed like no matter how I took it, with or without food, early or late in day, it would give me extreme nausea to the point that I kept trying to gag myself so I could throw up and feel better, also made me really dizzy.  Went back right away to get switched, doc said that I should never have been put on such a high dosage to start with anyway and that that could have been part of the problem, but he switched me to lexapro because it's supposed to have limited side effects, it's true--it worked great! I rarely had to up the dosage, the first time I did I also started seeing a counselor and participating in biofeedback where they hook you up to electrodes and a computer monitor that keeps track of your breathing, nervousness, tension etc and you listen to an audio tape on muscle tension/relaxation excercises, I don't know if the tape actually hypnotizes you or what, but it was the most restfull 45minutes of every week and greatly lowered my tension.

Bad. I used it with the Lamictal I was already taking to help with increased depression.  It may have helped, in that soon I had no emotions at all.  So I concluded that I was taking too much stuff.  I stopped taking the Lamictal.  I stayed on Effexor XR for two years too long.  The suicidal thoughts grew worse and almost continuous.  I tried to get off the Effexor, and had a really hard time...those &quot;brain shivers&quot;, I guess, and disorientation, and nausea.  I have only been free of effexor for a month, so who knows.  I feel better right now, because I can cry when I need to and laugh without faking it.  Maybe it or the lamictal helped.  I was so afraid that I had lost my ability to feel that I will never take either of these drugs again.  I highly recommend smoking pot to control manic states, and positive self-talk to keep the depression at bay.

Efectin worked very well for me It seems that Efectin has done a very good job in my case. But I have to tell you that I am also taking 10 mg of Zyprexa per day and maybe that is  what kept me from feeling hard withdrawal effects (I took Zyprexa from 15 july 2004 and still taking that same 10 mg per day). You can read my Zyprexa rating for more details.I have asked my physician and it seems that my disease is bipolar I disorder. I was hospitalized because of acute psychotic episode.How it started: after about 3 months of Zyprexa, it came out that I was depressed and have also much anxiety. I was very scared and thought of killing myself. Then I was put on a 150 mg Efectin ER (Venlafaxine extended release) per day. The first 2 weeks were difficult, I was feeling agitated internally. After that, I became more optimistic. I started taking Efectin on 15 Sept. 2004. I took 150 mg daily until September 2005 (for one year), feeling depressed and anxious, but Efectin helped me to cope with these feelings.I remember that before taking Efectin I was feeling like weeing on me from much anxiousity, but his was solved by the medicine. Also the suicide thoughts were gone. In January 2005 I tried to reduce the dosage to 75 mg per day, but I couldn't. In september 2005 I felt better and reduced the dose to 75 mg per day. I began feeling better and better, and each day more optimistic, until  on November 26 I was feeling too optimistic and I think I have developed a hipomania. This was the time to get rid of this medicine, I thought (my phichyatrist told me that I can stop medication with Efectin on my wish).Withdrawal: the first 3 days were kind of difficult, but not at allunbearable. I experienced slight dizziness, decreased sleep, increased appetite (but this might be from Zyprexa), and sweating. No diarrhea, no brain zaps, no nausea at all.

Wonderful I had tried many other depressants, of which none worked.  I started Effexor and felt like a person again.  I have had it increased several times.  I hate to think of life without it.

Great Hopes, then Disappointment My experience beginning treatment with Effexor was very memorable. I have actually gone through the process of introducing into my system twice as once my prescription ran out and my doctor was unavailable.Never before had I reacted so strongly to any medication.  I took this as a good sign. I was up (boy was I up),busy,organized,leaving the apartment alone - HOWEVER - I could not sleep for more than 2hrs at a time.  This lasted around 3 days! Then only gradually did I return to being able to sleep, after about 3 weeks.  Though irritable and tired I hoped this was the drug for me, because before it, I wanted nothing but to sleep.Unfortunately, when the insomnia wore off, so did the increased energy and 'enthusiasm for life'. This happened both times when introducing the medication into my system.Currently I'm actually taking 232.5mg/day.  I am still depressed and lethargic as well as experiencing an extreme worsening of these symptoms (+anger/irritability) for the 7 days before menstruation.My doctor said he had never heard of Effexor having this &quot;jump-start&quot; affect before and thought it sounded a little like mania, but I have never been diagnosed with manic depression ( thank the good Lord ).Also notice that if I miss as little as one day, I can count on nightmares...I would like to try something new but fear the withdrawal and introduction phase.  I'm thinking of asking my doctor if a period with NO medication (but my clonazepam) could be tried because I've been on one thing or another for so long I'm not sure what I'd even feel like when I'm just myself anymore!For anyone reading this, I genuinely hope you can take heart in a shared experience - or - in the fact you didn't share my disappointing one. God Bless You.Summary: Hard to get onto. Initial positive effects diminish with time. Missing a dose is a no-no.

Fantastic - allowed me to be me, not fogged in. This worked brilliantly all the time I was on it. Felt myself again after 5 years of various therapies (Prozac - allergic reaction, Cipramil - good, but no libido). Two other meds (including Fluoxetine) having failed, this has been fabulous over past 2 years. Not only were symptoms eliminated but libido came back! Like most things, seems to me it's horses for courses when it comes to antidepressants.Coming off was HELL! Did a very slow, very controlled withdrawal under supervision of GP, but had terrible dizziness and sickness, lack of sleep and panic attacks.

Coming down now with some effects Pdoc switched me to Effexor (with Zyprexa) after having jitteriness with Zoloft (and Zyprexa). Pdoc had diagnosed me as Bipolar. I was having anger issues and emotional control issues.Took Effexor in morning and Zyprexa at night- Sleep like a rock with vivid dreams. So much so that I don't want to get up in the mornings even with 8 or more hours of sleep. One of my problems while on the Effexor was that when I would miss the 225mg morning dose of Effexor- by evening of same day I am real dizzy and disoriented and getting a bad headache, feeling all out of sorts. And even after getting the 225mg back into my system, it takes a couple of hours to get back to &quot;normal&quot;. Pdoc answer it &quot;don't miss the dose&quot;. I had a lack of libido-- where before I was probably too easily stimulated and always interested. Still able to achieve erection (harder to maintain at times) but much more difficult to achieve orgasm, much to the wife's dismay (as it was never really easy before). I had gained 20-30 lbs and at least one pants waist size without changing my eating habits, and my cholesterol was up.Previous Pdoc had added Wellbutrin along with Effexor and Zyprexa. *4/24/06 Update*Switched Pdoc's. New Pdoc has taken me off the Zyprexa completely with the issues of the weight gain and the high cholesterol and will start the scale back process to get me off the Effexor, continuing only on the Wellbutrin.1st week scaling back 37.5mg of the Effexor not too bad. (Coming off the Zyprexa seems more of the issue now with not sleeping). Been a little more edgy...2nd week- down another 37.5 mg. Have a mild &quot;headache&quot; most of the time. Feeling generally crummy and out of sorts. Have localized intense itching and very sweaty palms, body temp hard to regulate (not sure if these aren't just more noticeable and coming from the Wellbutrin now). 3rd week- down another 37.5mg.

Effexor still working long term. Update about two years latter; Last month, I had my dosage increased to 225 Mg/day as the effectiveness was wearing off.  I should have increased it sooner, but I put it off as long as I could.  My reasoning was I didn't want to build up tolerance to it so I could stay on it longer as it has been effective.  When I increased the dosage to 225 Mg/day it got me out of the deep uni-polar depressive cycle I slowly slid into but it only worked somewhat; two problems arose first, it held me in a repetitive two day mood cycle.  Id go from an overall up-beat mood to low to medium grade depression every two days.  Basically on a depressed/manic scale of -10 to 10 Id go from a 2 to a -2 and back to a 2 in four days with the occasional depression depth hitting -4 or -6 just to remind me how I dont want to be.The second problem was that with my increased dose, I had major insomnia.

Update about two years latter; Last month, I had my dosage increased to 225 Mg/day as the effectiveness was wearing off.  I should have increased it sooner, but I put it off as long as I could.  My reasoning was I didn't want to build up tolerance to it so I could stay on it longer as it has been effective.  When I increased the dosage to 225 Mg/day it got me out of the deep uni-polar depressive cycle I slowly slid into but it only worked somewhat; two problems arose first, it held me in a repetitive two day mood cycle.  Id go from an overall up-beat mood to low to medium grade depression every two days.  Basically on a depressed/manic scale of -10 to 10 Id go from a 2 to a -2 and back to a 2 in four days with the occasional depression depth hitting -4 or -6 just to remind me how I dont want to be.The second problem was that with my increased dose, I had major insomnia.

Complete disaster. preceded to have terrible manic episode, rapid cycling and many other complications. Stopped medication 1 month ago - tried to taper off.

I Hate Effexor I am using it right now, in the beginning it helped a little, but now it doesn't seem to be doing anything at all. I get horrible withdrawl symptoms if I forget a day and I am planning to get off it and try something else at my docters apointment in a few days! I would say there is no point in getting it if it won't keep up!

Effexor has been the lessor of the evils. I was introduced to effexor after using  Amytriptolene and found it to be an improvement.As I reach long term use, I find the effectiveness diminishing.  It is stil used as part of a cocktail of Gabapentin, Lithium, Wellbutrin, Seroquel, Reminyl, and Propranolol.I am still having problems and also severe weight gain.  It is hard to isolate exactly what does what in this mix.

I am allergic to this med. They gave me this med when I was in an eating disorder treatment hospital.  It made me very nauseous, and unable to visually focus. I could, at one point, not move from the couch. I became so sick that they had to put me on a clear liquid diet, which is almost unheard of when you're in an eating disorder hospital.  My sister takes this med for bulimia and depression and does well on it, but it just didn't work for me.

Negative Effexor (Venlafaxine) initially worked well for me and very quickly as well, even though I experienced a lot of side effects for the first few weeks. However, after about 18 months, it just didn't work anymore and the anxiety and depression returned. I did not want to increased the dosage, so asked my GP to take me off it - bad, bad idea. THis is the worst SNRI to try to come off of. The Dr took me off over only 2 weeks! Big mistake. PLease, if you are coming off of Effexor, taper it off VERY slowly over at least 6 months. It is now 7 months after I stopped and I am still suffering from debilitating withdrawal effects (withdrawal syndrome) I would advise not to consider taking this one at all.

Helps some, but you can't get off it! I was given Effexor in combo with Vioxx and together they helped my pain - however Vioxx and Bextra are off the market and Effexor doesn't help much with other drugs - so I tried to get off it. First time, I quit cold - BAD idea. I got horrible feelings of what I've seen called 'Brain Freeze'. Didn't know what it was then, but going back on the Effexor stopped it. This time, I've gone down to half the dose - but even that is too much! Gave me the shakes and a nebulous feeling of terror - till I added the other half and voila! the feelings were gone. Now I am doing one day at 75mg and one day at 37.5. HOpefully I will be able to get off this drug. I strongly recommend AGAINST starting it unless you're willing to take it forever. And I don't trust it to be available forever - so I want off it.  I'll update if I ever get off this stuff.

Still not sure???? My dr. started me on 37.5 mg. about 3 weeks ago and worked me up to 150 mg. I haven't noticed much of a difference so far and was wondering how long it has taken to become effective for those people on this site that it has worked for?? I am hoping that the 150 mg. will start to kick in soon. I would appreciate any advice or stories.

Not worth it. If and whenever I ran out of medication I had the worst side effects of anything I have ever taken. That is the main reason for quiting. The side effect felt life threatening by way of physical and mostly mental. Hallucinations were unbearible. Would never recommend to any one I know.

Okay.. I have bad anxiety that goes back and forth from depression, for no reason, that I can explain. I was on Lexapro and then I went to effexor, the side effects were weird didnt have even one on lexapro but on effexor I had major gas and I was really sleepy. The sleepiness went away faster then when I took zoloft, but the gas was really anoying.My brain was really hazy, it was hard to focus on things and I kinda always felt like I was in a haze. This med was not for me but everyone should know you are gonna have to try a few.

The sleepiness went away faster then when I took zoloft, but the gas was really anoying.My brain was really hazy, it was hard to focus on things and I kinda always felt like I was in a haze. This med was not for me but everyone should know you are gonna have to try a few.

225mg of the stuff Effexor seemed to work at first. I started on the bottom dose, 37.5mg. I have managed to work my way up to 225mg, and it seems like whatever this drug once did for me it is no longer doing. I dread coming off of it as the withdrawl is so bad, even if you miss ONE pill.

Effexor XR I have been taking this drug daily since the start in February, 2005.  I feel that it has helped me immensly.  My only side effect has been weight gain.  Because of that, I am now starting to try to go off Effexor and, the fact that I am having no other problems with depression and anxiety. I went to see my internest last week and he suggested reducing my dosage to one 75 mg every other day for two weeks then one every two days for one week then off.  I am on my first week of discontinuing and acter six days, have had no problems.  Hopefully, I will be able to lose the 25 pounds that I have gained and still be depression/anxiety free.  However, if I am not then I will return to taking Effexor XR.  It worked for me when I really needed it and if that means gaining weight even though I tried really hard not too then I will have to deal with that.  However, my mental health is important too.  Weight loss is a side effect that I will have to learn to deal with in another way.  This has been a wonder drug for me in every other way.  I HATE being overweight but I also hate being depressed, having anxiety and panic attacks more.

WARNING: Effexor is a nightmare to stop I am updating my review- Effexor helped me in combination with Bextra - which is off the market. I now take OTC Aleve which helps only slightly, and pain meds like Ultram and Vicodin. The Effexor has diminished in helping but it's difficult to get off it. I am trying! I reduced my dose to half - 37.5 a couple weeks ago, and two days ago, I got so sick and shaky- had to take the other half dose- and then I felt fine. It's the most horrible feeling - and I am determined to quit this drug. If you haven't started it, don't, unless you plan to be on it the rest of your life. There ARE other drugs which are much easier to stop if needed.

withdrawal hell I'm really impatient and that's my own fault, but after three weeks of taking EffexorXR and feeling worse than before, I decided to stop. I didn't think withdrawal would be an issue because I hadn't been taking the meds for very long. The first three days were fine except for anxiety ridden dreams and severe night sweats. I would wake up and the sheets would be soaked, as if someone had dumped a bucket of water in my bed! I wasn't sure if this was related to stopping the Effexor or not - but then yesterday I was on the train coming home from work and started feeling AWFUL! I felt/feel like my blood sugar is really low. I'm sick to my stomach and all woozy in the head. It's horrible and I hope it goes away soon.

Lifesaver! It lifted the darkness and the feeling of being in &quot;the abyss,&quot; so that I was able to enjoy life again.  I've always thanked God for whoever invented this medication, because I don't know how I would've ended up without it.  I am thoroughly grateful it exists!!  However, after being on it for a number of years (8-9 years), my body appears to have adjusted to it and it no longer works as well as it did in the begining.  My doctor and I have recently decided to add another medication to my regimen, so that it may &quot;boost&quot; the Effexor's effects.

use extreme caution Maybe this will work for you, but BE SUPERVISED. As in, I could have literally killed someone. If you are any type of bipolar, i personally would be very careful. This drug was prescribed for depression for me and ended up showing me that i was bipolar.I flipped out and had to be held down because I was trying to attack my boyfriend. I started to panic because of a small thing that agitated me and ended up screaming and breathing heavily and, like I said, attacking my boyfriend. I was terrified on another occasion that a plant was going to eat me. Sounds funny, but it could have been worse. If I would have had a knife or something who knows. I became in super defense mode, thinking I needed to go live in the mountains to avoid the government, etc.Sounds funny but it's not. This drug could possibly be dangerous for bipolars. Don't go to a doc that works mainly with depression. You are different.

Effexor worked great for me  I was not so much depressed as I am stressed out to the max.  I take care of two disabled family members, one with Bi-Polar-Schizophrenia and my husband with a deadly slow disease Peripheral neuropathy and was working full time until I myself became dissabled with a back injury which will require surgery. Effexor along with Paxil or Prozac helped very much. An occasional Valium or Adivant helped when my Son's coping powers left him and he took out his madness on me or others.

Still undecided about taking this I started Effexor after stopping zoloft.  Zoloft was difficult to phase out.  I started 75mg of effexor I think and by Oct 2005 I was taking 225 mg of it.DO I have depression? Not sure realy.  I have difficulty getting out bed.  not really fatigued but not interested in doing anything.  It also seemed to be a seasonal thing, but again I'm not sure really.  I do know that I didn't like being like that.  So, after going to 225, my pri care doc reffered me to a psych doc to evaluate meds etc.  FOund out that I may have adult add and we adjusted meds, etc.Now I'm only on 75mg.  I think that effexor actually caused me to be more lethargic in some ways.  As I stepped down my dosage this past winter, It was easier to get up and &quot;at 'em.&quot;But, it was difficult stepping down. Similar to the withdrawals of Zoloft that I experienced but not as steep.  You can read my other reviews that tie into the rest of the story about medications I took to try treating anxiety, sleeplessnes and attention.Topomax: http://www.remedyfind.com/review_long.asp?id=4553&amp;review_id=21254Concerta: http://www.remedyfind.com/review_long.asp?id=18601&amp;review_id=50997Adderall:http://www.remedyfind.com/review_long.asp?id=18599&amp;review_id=50998Now I'm going to try Strattera.---

Works well for me I took Effexor for about 5 months, after trying quite a few different anti-depressants. This was the only one which worked well for me without giving any significant side-effects. Unfortunately, it caused my moods to cycle (I am bipolar), and so I stopped taking it to avoid the mood swings. Decreasing the Effexor dosage has caused me to become suicidal once, and so decreasing the dosage should be done very cautiously and with medical supervision!

awful This stuff effected me badly. First, I was getting sleepy from it, then I saw geometric patterns of white light forming as I was trying to go to sleep that kept me awake. I got dry mouth, a headache that formed in the middle of my forehead,  nervousness, eyesight was getting strange too: I saw the flourescent lights in Wal-Mart like they were under water and wavey and blurry. During my German test I took I misread a words and answered questions wrong that I knew the answers to. I was feeling vertigo, and nausea, and sweats, and my blood pressure which is always great was high. This also gave me two nightmares. It was not good. I decided to try Lexapro, and so far after nine days no side effects except dry mouth. So far so good on Lexapro. The Effexor was bad.

Excellent for two years Effexor XR worked great for me with minimal side effects (delayed orgasm) for the longest time any antidepressant has ever worked for me before.  I had two years depression free, despite a lot of stress in my life during this time.  Then, suddenly, it stopped working.  I am now in the process of slowly tapering off under the direction of my MD so as not to have the bad discontinuation symptoms that have been reported. So far, so good, but I don't know where to go from here in terms of treatment.  I have tried just about everything else.  I had a grand mal seizure on Wellbutrin and have had a lot of nausea with some of the SSRIs (esp. Zoloft).  We're trying Cymbalta now but I'm having bad nausea so will probably have to discontinue it.  I'm grateful for the 2 years depression-free (longest I've ever had) with Effexor XR.

I hate this drug. One missed dose causes nausea and weird brain effects. I am currently down to 25 mg but haven't been able to get off it completely. I have tried 3 or 4 times and have had horrible side effects, including extreme panic attacks and an episode of throwing stuff into my suitcase at 4 am to run away from home for no reason.

good at 1st relief-then breakthroughs-insomnia bad it worked thesn it didn't work as good and for the last year or so it was like I wasn't on it at all except for the buzzing in my head nausea and dizziness.Then the horrible insomnia-you know up for two-three nights in tears wondering if you shuld just end your miserable life.Since March 20 I have requested to be taken off of the effexor and I have gone from 225mg to 150+37.5 once a day. My doctor wanted me to do 150 every day but I was acting bad and very irritable and with his ok went back to 187.5 a day. and I do feel more human. I plan on taking as long as it takes to get off this drug-I use to be on Zoloft and changed because of sexual side effects-but as you can imagine that leveled off to the way things were on Zoloft. I was nursing but have saw fit not to expose myself to the stress and cut-throat atomsphere or expose myself to any innocent patient. This is so very sad, I waited all my life to find my niche and then lost it to this disorder. I see a mental health counselor and she is good for me and I am more than thankful she is in my life.  But to answer your question, yes many side effects. One big one is irritablness-almost instantly after taking the Effexor. That is when my doc put me on Lithium. Very food thing, but it to has a hx of destruction ie thyroid, teeth and gum health, tremors in fingers and hands.I hope this helps the cause   Linda L.

hellish When I went off of it after becming manic it was terrible withdrawl. Now they know more about it. It should be done extremely gradual. Personally i think it is poison and would not reccomend it. I know others who feel the same. I have been on several other meds in last 20 yrs and this is by far the worst.

discontinutation syndrome has no proven treatment I started Effexor 11 years ago.  It cured my lifelong depression.  I gave me the strength to break old destructive patterns and transform my life for the better.  That's why when my new insurance company refused to pay for it, I felt confident I could finally live AD free. I started 4 months ago gradually reducing like the drug's insert said.  This past month, I got very sick.  The depression hasn't returned, but I have been incapacitated by nausea and dizziness/vertigo. I haen't been able to work for 3 weeks.  I don't have paid medical leave or a domestic partner to support me financially while I go through this.  My doctor is clueless.  Wyeth's info is not correct.  They suggest gradual reduction over time will reduce the discontinuation symptoms, but they are wrong!  Read the testimonials on the web--there are thousands of people suffering just like me and Wyeth has done nothing to find an effective treatment.  I think they should be forced to pay for the treatment research out of the millions they are making from effexor prescriptions.  Everyone who has ever taken effexor should be notified.  There is a petition out there addressed to Wyeth and signed by effexor victims, but I don't think it goes far enough.  These are SEVERE symptoms, enough to make many go back on the drug.  That's the only sure treatment Wyeth recommends, going back on the effexor.  Addiction by prescription one victim has called it.

Effexor for Panic &amp; Anxiety READ UPDATE BELOW !!!  After 22 yrs. of panic and anxiety using a low dose of Xanax which kept it under control, my daughter developed severe depression.  It turned my life upside down and the panic was out of control.  Paxil made me sick, Lexapro did nothing.  I just started Effexor XR, one week on 37.5mg and now second week on 75 mg.  I've had no side effects so far but still need the Xanax til Effexor takes over (I hope).  I do not have depression, I'm hyper and just want to be calm.  I have a wonderful life and have nothing to panic about, it just happens.  I'm optomistic and will hope for the best. Unfortunately the best didn't happen. I was looking for help for panic and anxiety, instead I had 8 days of HELL.  It gave me depression, OCD, headache, nausea and tremors.  The Dr. called it a paradoxical effect.  I've been on 4 antidepressants (SSRI's) because most Dr's go thru the roof when you mention Xanax. All have made me sick.  I don't understand how something to correct depression where you want to be &quot;up&quot; can help anxiety where you just want to be CALM.No more experiments for me, I'll stick with the Xanax and a higher dose if needed.

A rose with thorns The addition of Effexor XR to my regimen changed my life.  My mood has been unbelievably good for over a year. I really cannot stress strongly enough how well this drug works for me. My good mood comes with a price. I often walk through the day feeling as if I'm in a cartoon. An odd sense of unreality.  I seem to have memory problems which I attribute to this drug. Occasional nightsweats. I have a tremor which may be caused by other meds. DON'T miss a dose. You really do go through withdrawl if your blood level gets too low. I notice symptoms after just one missed dose. Please keep in mind that I am on a number of other drugs. Side effects may overlap, but I have tried to keep track of them...when they started, what I was on etc.5/1/06I am no longer taking Effexor.  I was switched to Cymbalta some time ago.  These drugs are similar in that they are both SSNRI's.  I had no problem transitioning between the drugs (no Effexor withdrawal) and find the Cymbalta easier to take (1 dose/day).  I feel that Cymbalta has a better side effect profile as well (see my Cymbalta rating).

Depressed with Effexor XR I have been on Effexor XR for about 3 years now.  I have found that it has not helped very well with my depression.  I am taking the Effexor XR for depression which came on after my Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome began.  I put off taking any anti-depression meds until I crashed one day and realized that I needed something to help.  My pain mgnt. doc first put me on Zoloft which didn't work at all for me. When I began to see a Psychiatrist I mentioned that the Zoloft caused sexual side effects and that it wasn't working for my depression so he put me on Wellbutryn.  This cause other side effects so he then put me on the Effexor XR.  I am on 375mg now and I still don't find complete relief from my depression.  Now I was just diagnosed with RA and I am finding it very hard to cope with in combination with the RSD/CRPS.  My pain mgnt doc has suggested yet another type of anti-depressant I guess it's new to the market, so now I am waiting to see what my psychiatrist will do with this suggestion.

Depressed with Effexor XR I have been on Effexor XR for about 3 years now.  I have found that it has not helped very well with my depression.  I am taking the Effexor XR for depression which came on after my Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome began.  I put off taking any anti-depression meds until I crashed one day and realized that I needed something to help.  My pain mgnt. doc first put me on Zoloft which didn't work at all for me. When I began to see a Psychiatrist I mentioned that the Zoloft caused sexual side effects and that it wasn't working for my depression so he put me on Wellbutryn.  This cause other side effects so he then put me on the Effexor XR.  I am on 375mg now and I still don't find complete relief from my depression.  Now I was just diagnosed with RA and I am finding it very hard to cope with in combination with the RSD/CRPS.  My pain mgnt doc has suggested yet another type of anti-depressant I guess it's new to the market, so now I am waiting to see what my psychiatrist will do with this suggestion.

Increased my quality of life - until i stopped When i first started takin Efexor it was like the lights were switched back on. Fantastic with no noticable side effects at all.Until i tried to stop taking it. Have tried to stop several times by weaning myself off it, each time experiencing withdrawel symptoms so severe i have to take it again. 'Brain-zaps', sweating, shaking, loss of co-ordination, nausea, loss of muscle control, unbelievable dizziness, to name a few. after 8 years I am now well and truly stuck, desperate to stop taking it.

not great I did not take effexor for long so I am not sure how effective it would have been long term. This drug gave me terrible insomnia, could not sleep day in week out. Reduced appetite which I did'nt mind, blurred vision too and dizziness.

Works well for me. Lithium and Prozac always left me with a feeling of being a little too low, tilted toward depression, with a lack of energy, focus and motivation.  For the past year, Effexor has worked well.  I have good energy, focus and motivation.  I take Effexor in combination with a low dose (0.5 mg) of Risperdal.  I also use a low dose of Trazadone as a sleep aid at night.  This combination works for me.

draws you out of the abyss then knocks you down I'm taking 150mg. I would certainly say it can take someone in a deep depression and draw them out of it. it's the best so far for major depression. otherwise, it sucks. I think it's good to get out of depression, but the side effects are killing me. I can't think, I can't study, I can't sleep, poop , lose weight, ... oh yeah, and it makes some women lactate, how bout' that. did I mention, I no longer have a libido, yes, Im asexual now folks. effexor will take that away to. but I can't be sad about it, because it's numbed me . most terrible side effects don't happen for a year to some people. we are all different. our bodies are going to do different things, and for me, my body , does not like effexor. so best advice I can give, find a doctor who cares, and be cautious getting on effexor, and definitely coming off of it.

Worked very quickly to alleviate severe depression It worked very well at first but in the last six months I noticed that I am becoming depressed again and have suicidal thoughts at least daily, not a good sign for me since I have acted upon that a few times in the past.  I am aware that I need help and have contacted a therapist to get some support.I have gained almost 40 lbs since I started taking this medication, I have no energy and feel tired all the time.  When I took prozac I was feeling better but could not sleep.  Effexor XR allows me to sleep but I am wondering if the trade off is worth it.On Prozac I used to go everyday and spin or walk and had a better quality of life, now I come home from work totally drained and just sit in front of the tv and surf the various unappealing network offerings.I have no sexual interests and am becoming an hermit, very unusual for me since I am basically an extraverted personality.  Maybe it is not Effexor, maybe it is menopause but my world is very dark at this time.

Very painful withdrawl.  Dr.'s please take note. While on the medication it does seem to provide some relief for depression and anxiety.  The side effects while taking the medication were as follows:  lethargy, reduced alertness, slow memory recall, weight gain, and sensitivity to cold.  It should be noted that weight gain persisted even with regular exercise and a balanced diet. Discontinuation however was quite severe with lingernig symptoms even with a slow tapering of dosage. Dosage was tapered over 6 weeks from 75mg to naught. Symptoms included, brain shivers (read next paragraph for description), severe insomnia, extreme agitation, sensation as if ants were crawling all over you, and joint and muscle pain/soreness.  Symptoms were felt strongly over 6 weeks past final dose.  Joint/muscle pain remain at a significant level along with minor brain shivers even 8 weeks past final dose.  I have not had any muscle or joint issues prior to taking this medication.  Description of brain shivers from my perspective is as follows:  A random moment of extreme dizziness, with the feeling of being electrocuted, accompanied a flight or fight emergency perception. Its as if you nodded off and were re-awaked suddenly by a fire alarm.  The electrocution seems to travel from the head to the arms and sometimes legs.  The electrocution is the most distrubing feeling and feels very much indeed like a true electrical shock. These shivers were sometimes severe (think wall outlet) and other times mild (think battery).  The effect is somewaht random, but can be aggravated by a sudden change of direction or standing/sitting too quicly.  This symptom can be very distracting and upsetting.I would strongly advise the Medical community to more closely review the effects of this medication.   The severity and lengths of the withdrawal symptoms warrant further study.   While the drug may be effective for the treatment of depression and anxiety that is nullified if the disco

Not particularly effective I'm pretty much treatment resistant as far as depression goes, I never used to be years ago.  There was a time when anything I took seemed to work and work fast.I didn't find Effexor very effective but then I don't believe I ever got up to the maximum dose.  I think I was on about 100mg of it.  It had the least anxiety affects but made me feel very spaced out at times in a lethargic way, I still felt depressed on it and sometimes I felt like my head was going to fall off the back of my neck on it.  Maybe if I'd have got to a higher dose when it supposedly affects norepinephrine I would have found it more affective.Denise

Effexor helped me Did it work? YES. Mood improved. Relationship with my husband improved HUGELY.Did it have side effects? YES. Lower libido and initially and scarily, although temporarily, inability to orgasm...so a bit frustrating for me and my husband. Also, it triggered very bad migraines more frequently than i was used to having so i have had to learn to 'manage' those better too....and it has sometimes  made me want to come off the medication; in fact i am just now redcung my dose to 37.5mg and already the migraine headaches are much better. It's a good drug. Better than plain SSRI I think....but expensive if you are paying for it out of your own pocket.

Just started taking it... Just started on Effexor XR this past week. Already noticing sexual side effects. I have Social Phobia. I've been on Zoloft, Wellbutrin and Klonopin in the past and I've had no long-term success with those. Hopefully Effexor works out for me. I'll keep those that are interested updated.

Helps Yes, it works, but not to end all depression.  I have Fibromyalgia &amp; thyroid problems which cause depression.  I take Effexor as well as 60mg. of Cymbalta at bed with 5 mg. of Methadone.  Effexor softens the effects of depression.  Side effects for me are constipation (which I take something for) and sweats.  The sweats are sometimes very bad, but if we lower the dose then severe depression returns.  Catch 22.

Not great This did not work the way I was expecting.  Yes, it did help with the emotional lows but I felt numb and did not like feeling that way since I was numb about everything including the things that I used to consider pleasurable.  However, I would feel excited like the feeling you get when you are waiting for something good to happen and would then have trouble sleeping at night.  At first I liked the feeling but after awhile it get's old and I was tired of having trouble sleeping and ended up hating that feeling.  I also was sweating and had dry mouth.  I had no desire for sex which makes sense if you consider that I always felt numb.Withdrawal was horrible.  I have noted this on the withdrawal page.  I was very sick; for four days with dizziness, dirrhea, nauseous, confusion - trouble concentrating, emotional - I would cry one minute and then laugh the next and I had migraine headaches.  I had to miss work since I was so sick and that is not something I do.  Thankfully two of those days were my days off.  The next week and a half I was able to return to work but continued to have migraines,and nauseous.  The headaches would come on so fast with the sick feeling that it made it hard to work because I could be feeling almost fine and then wham.....major headache with sick feeling.I think my doctor took me off to fast; three days 75 mg then three days 37.5 mg then off.  So if you are on this and are going to come off COME OFF SLOWLY!!!

Worst experience of my life!!! Made me have no feelings, just sleeping my life away.  After stopping cold turkey with Dr. approval, terrible withdrawal symptoms!  Still experiencing horrible headache, nausea, stomach burning and pain after 35 days off.  Would not recommend this drug to anyone - only if they were really desperate and already tried all other forms of treatment.

Awful Started taking for depression with anxiety, severe PMS/PMDD.  Every month, about two weeks before cycle was still as depressed and out of control as ever.  So was upped to 150 mg.  Still, no help.  During PMS time I have always been tired, but seems with Effexor even more tired and no motivation whatsoever.  I am on my second try at weaning off, and it is the worst thing I have ever been through.  Once I am off, I will never try this one again.

better than ever After my dad passed away I was crying all of the time, even after several months...my doctor prescribed Efexor...even though I had been depressed off and on since my teen yrs. and had never dealt with my negative thoughts and I never realized how bad I actually felt until I started Effexor...not only did my grief go away...I felt better than I had ever felt before.

Good AD... IN the process of switching to Cymbalta....withdrawal is a challenge, and would be even more so if I weren't adding another antidepressant. It was excellent for depression and for migraine headaches. Eliminated sexual desire or arrousal and the weight gain were the two biggest problems.Very good length of time for effectiveness as I have been through many AD's that either don't work or stop working relatively quickly.

Not bad at all I have had no side effects at all - well maybe I have and I just haven't noticed any.  I don't know - I thought they were working but now the doctor has added Wellbutrin to the mix so maybe they are not quite as effective as I thought they were.  They are sure better than everything else I have tried and man, I have tried everything else.

So far, so good I began Effexor about 3 months ago, and titrated up slowly from 25 mg/day to 150 mg/day. I tried to go higher (to 200 mg) but side effects kicked in (tremor in hands, funny feeling in the nerves in my forearms). It helps to reduce IC pain, reduce frequency, reduce urgency (I can wait for several hours) and improve depression.  Along with Vicodin for pain, it's allowing me to live a fairly normal life, at a much higher quality than before.

smooth and steady side effects were mild - I took as the doctor told me - with food.  I had some GI upset for a short while, but that was it.  I and my family have noticed marked improvement with my mood and activity  each week.  It was my first antidepressant and I am glad my doctor recommend it.  Now I feel like I used to.

It has helped trememdously It worked really well, but the side effect when I forget to take it are not good.  There are actually physical side effects and that kind of creeps me out.

Generally Positive It was shakey the first week.  Experienced by the fifth day diaherra, night sweats, insomnia.  However, by the fifth or sixth week, I was up to 150mg/day, and my system was able to adjust to the medication.  I found that drinking plenty of fluids (water especially) and exercise helped my body to metabolize the medication.I still occassionally have headaches and tend to fall asleep easily watching TV in the evening.The only thing I wish I could change are the sexual side affects (low sex drive, delayed orgasm, etc.).  Being a 45-year-old male, I no longer experience the libido of a seventeen year-old.  In balance, after nearly a year and a half taking this medication, I can honestly say it has been the best thing for me.

increased impulsive activity Effexor, sadly to say to those who swear by it and doctors who love to prescribe it, is one of those drugs that I cringe when I hear the sound of it.  I probably did not take it long enough for it to hit depression but what it did was increase my binge eating and big time.  It diminished my impulse control and that was not good.  On the advice of myself I stopped taking it on a Saturday night, cold turkey, and by Sunday night started vomitting.  I called the pharmacy to see if there was something I could take they said nothing w/o a script.  I called the pdoc on call who told me to take another pill or drink some ginger ale and eat some crackers.  I was vomitting bile by this time and crackers and gingerale  was not staying down.  Needless to say, ALWAYS, consult your doctor before you stop taking a med.  The package inserts aren't kidding.  I went to the ER that night and my bill was $800.  Intravenus fluids and Zofran to stop the vomitting.  No more effexor for me.

Worked for years then less effective 8 yrs of effexor and it did help depression but not enough help in the anxiety department. I researched all the side effects that this drug has on a body and there are many that are not so pleasant. I felt great for about 4 half yrs. Side effects like brain shivers and cysts on my face and neck were no fun and it did not help my anxiety anymore. I have Bipolar 2 and the effexor caused me to rapid cycle. Please get your doctor to be clear as to whether u have just anxiety, unipolar depression(just depression no paranoid delusional episodes)or could be bipolar. If I had only suffered from anxiety (not depression or Bipolar Disorder), I would still give it a poor rating, because it did keep me on a more even keel but the severe attacks numbers did not decrease.

8 yrs of effexor Great for unipolar depression and anxiety. If you are bipolar or there is a chance you might be, use with great caution, talk to your doctor, it can cause episodes if rapid cycling etc. in some people. Read up on it. This is a big deal if you are bipolar,and your doctor is the one to help determine that. I think my doctor-who just kept raising dosage every year would have had me take a million mg a day instead of trying something else. It caused cysts to develop on my face and neck and in conjunction with lithium I could not have antacids, too much alcohol(socially not daily), and constant, profuse sweating-this really helped my self esteem and depression. Not everyone I've met has had these effects, but MANY did and did not tell thier doctor because they did not think they had a choice. I am off of effexor because it was helpful for a time, then it wore off. Then I had to switch doctors because of insurance and he realized that the effexor was making me rapid cycle, the medicine I was taking was making the BP worse....Lamictal, klonopin, seroquel, and wellbutrin are what I am currently on and for 1yr and 3 months my life has completely been improved!!

As long as I take it, its great. The only side effects are when I skip a day or a few. The side effects are hell. The depression is worse than before I started the treatment. Plus the physical side effects are like having high blood pressure and schock treatment. I am the opposite of &quot;me&quot; when I dont take it. Irritable, quick tempered, high enxiety, etc. I have never been on any other anti-depression treatment but if they are all like this, how does anyone ever get off them to find out if you can be without the meds?

frustrating! Hard to say if it really worked as there were so many stressful things going on in my life. Why am i still on them if i don't rate them that much? Simply because of the awful withdrawel effects trying to come off them. Have tried several times to come off them slowly. I take them now because i can't not take them (terrible heady movement, like dizziness; nauseus, disorientation, basically unable to function at all. Perhaps they helped a bit at first, its so long ago i can't remember! I'm told they probably help to keep me at a stable point but i don't find they are doing a lot for me. The fact that there are different dosages of this med contributed to me being on them longer than i might have been in the beginning. I have been on normal and modified release at varying doages over the years. I would prefer to come off Venlefaxine and maybe try a different antidepressant, though my experience as a whole has made me very cynical towards them all and drs who don't give the right information at the time of prescribing or tell you how horrific it can be when trying to stop these meds. Very disillusioned with it all.

Worth the Side Effects I am a depressed person with a family history of depression.  My father committed suicide and so did my great grandfather.  I am grateful that effexor has allowed me to really tone down those temper flashes that so interfered with my ability to mother my children.  Also, it has helped me to function better in the rest of my daily life.  On the other hand, I could really do without the intense dreaming, and take other meds every few nights to get enough sleep.  The other negative is that the withdrawal is indeed harsh.  Make sure you have that refill called in ahead of time because the withdrawal starts within a couple of hours of missing a dose.  For me, effexor is an overall positive, but not perfect.  I am prepared to stay on it for life because of the good things it has done for me.

Rocky at first but getting better I've been on Effexor for 3 months now. I'm up to 150mg and its been doing a good job. The only noticable side effect I have is that its harder for me to achieve an orgasm. For me the sacrifice is worth it because I wasn't able to enjoy sex before because I was constantly anxious. I recently lost my insurance and the cost of the prescription is a lot. My therapist is helping me get on the patient prescription plan that Merck has but until then i'm using samples or getting 7 day prescriptions from wal-mart (the only place i know of that will do that)I have noticed lately that i'll have bouts of irritability and hyperness. Right now they're managable but if they get worse I may have to switch to somthing else or ad somthing on. All in all im really happy with how Effexor helps my anxiety. I'm working at a job where I'm around new people all the time. I know theres no way I would be able to handle it without the effexor.

Effexor cleared my mind of brain fog Among my symptoms of depression was what I called &quot;brain fog&quot;.  I had no working memory and couldn't seem to process information.  I also always felt like I had just gotten up from a hard sleep, not quite awake yet and unable to focus. No amount of coffee seemed to help.  I had no energy.  I wanted to sit and stare.  Effexor cleared my head, but not until I got to the higher dosage.  (I take 300mg/day.)  I think this indicates that in my case I needed the norepinephrine help.  I've read that Effexor doesn't really kick in the norepinephrine until you reach the higher dosage.  Once it kicked in, it really brought me back to life.

Pretty Good Relieved my mild depression, but I still had no motivation and it made me tired.  More exhausted type of feeling.  When I first took it, I was knocked out for the first week.  I also had sweaty feet and hands, even on the mild dose.  They deminished slowly over two weeks or so.  I switched to Lexapro, due to still feeling slight exhausted all the time and even a little flat.

Helped depression &amp; anxiety, but at a cost... I began taking Effexor about three years ago, after experiencing &quot;Prozac poop-out&quot; as my psychiatrist called it. I have battled depression and panic disorder since my children were born, but it has been well-controlled for the past five years. But on the Prozac I had started to experience low mood again after a couple of years, and I was at the highest dose my psychiatrist was comfortable with.I felt good on the Effexor -- some strange side-effects at first, but nothing I couldn't handle. It was odd -- sometimes I'd just be exhausted, and other times I couldn't sleep at all. I was told this is not unusual. But those went away quickly, and I had no troublesome side effects after that. I did not experience sexual side effects, but I hadn't after a couple of years on SSRIs, either.However, there were two side-effects (if you can call them that) that I could not tolerate, and that is why I went off Effexor and switched to Wellbutrin last October. The first is that I couldn't cry. I didn't have one good cry in the two plus years I was on the stuff, and I found that creepy. Since I switched to Wellbutrin, I get choked up again with moving songs, or when my four-year-old daughter gives me that look like her world is falling apart when her ice cream falls on the ground, etc. Not depression crying, just the bittersweet sadness that comes with being human. I have never enjoyed the ability to cry the way I do now!The second problem is that I gained and held onto a bunch of extra weight. I couldn't get motivated to exercise or diet, and I had an enormous appetite. This was a problem because I have high cholesterol and really needed to lose weight. Since switching to Wellbutrin, in addition to quitting smoking, I have been able to lose 30 lbs (thanks also to the Suzanne Somers diet). That in and of itself is a big mood-booster!I know that lots of people do not have a weight gain problem on SSRIs, but I am not one

Effexor for Depression I take 300 mg of Effexor XR per day for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder. It worked great for about 6 or 7 years.  However, for the past two years, I have been in a very deep depression. The Effexor doesn't feel like it works anymore. However, when I tried to go off it, my symtoms did get worse. Also, there are withdrawal symptoms when you go off Effexor and they aren't fun. Because of the withdrawal symptoms, I usually end up going back on the Effexor. The withdrawal symptoms include: vertigo (which is similiar to feeling dizzy), feel spacey, mood seems to worsen. I have tried so many different antidepressants and none of them have helped. I still take Effexor, but recently I began taking 200 mg of Provigil every day. Most people seem to notice an increase in energy and an improved mood right away (on Provigil).Today is day 6 of Provigil and I've noticed an increase in energy for the first time. My doctor also suggested that I try Adderall if the Provigil doesn't work. I may do this as I am having trouble with insurance covering the Provigil.If anyone has any experience with Provigil or Adderall, I'd love to hear from you.  Hope the info I provided is helpful.  Good luck!

Do not miss a dose! I've been on Effexor for awhile now in combination with Wellbutrin and Lamictal. I have been diagnosed with a form of bi-polar in which I have only lows and sometimes normal days.  Mostly it's depressed and more depressed.  After 10 years of trying different meds, this combo is the first to work.  However, do NOT miss a dose of Effexor.  I have on occasion when my script ran out and couldn't get it immediately from the pharmacy.  I felt like I was going mad.  I felt anxious and jumpy, my heart raced and I felt like my skin was crawling.  Also, I had the worst and most bizarre nightmares ever.

Did nothing for social anxiety Effexor did nothing for my social anxiety, but did get rid of the feelings of hopelessness caused by the depression at the cost of not being able to enjoy things that did bring me pleasure such as sex, music, and exercise. Takes away the hopelessness and the joy, so whats the point I would rather be dead in ditch somewhere than take this garbage.

EFFEXOR......SAVE YOUR LIFE OR .... I have been on Effexor XL now for 6yrs. I personally think it is unfair to give this drug a bad rating because of the side-effects when discontinuing. Anyone who has suffered in the black, hell, pit of depression would welcome anything in order to claw their way out of it. I was there and Effexor saved my life and i will always be thankful to it. I was able to function again, and life was bearable once more. Now i think when recovery is well under way, the blackness left behind, people start to focus more on the negative reactions of the drug rather than the positive ones. Sure the side-effects are pretty awfyl...i hate the constant tiredness if i miss a dose, the sexual numbness, and the inability to concentrate, among many  other things,.....BUT and i say BUT, this is nothing compared to BEING DEPRESSED.Now my situation at this prsent time is that of being fed up with the side-effects. I want to feel normal and energetic again and to lose the weight that i have gained from taking Effexor. I have been on the drug a long time and have been in therapy now for a year.....i feel ready now to face life and take the chance by coming off it. I have went from 150mg down to 75mg, every other day. I have decided to stop cold turkey as of today. I know this is not advised but i reckon i will just suffer the withdrawal symptoms. I am feeling strong enough at the moment to deal with them........and yes...i am having them at the moment....the electric shock sensations and dizzy spells are the worst.....I have heard that taking travel sickness tabs is supposed to help, but i havent tried this yet. I do not recommend the cold turkey method.....it is just the way i want to do it, as i hate the days of tiredness following a dose of take one miss one. I would rather just not take any and face the tiredness all at once and get it over and done with.Finally i just want to say that anyone who has depression and is offered Effexor....

My bad experience... My experience with Effexor was not a good one. That does not mean that everyone's experience will be bad. I didn't have any of the sexual side effects associated with anti-depressants, which was good, but my emotions were not any better. And, if I missed any doses, I was plagued with withdrawal symptoms: dizziness, nausea, sweating. When I stopped taking it, I was weaned off of it week by week. The withdrawal was terrible! The doctor said that it was better to go off of it slowly. I hate to think about what I would have felt like if I had quit cold turkey! I will never take it again.

Taking Effexor and fatigue I had taken Effexor mainly for depression which had become severe. I was more tired due to the depression but was focusing on aleviating the depression.  Being less tired and having more enthusiasm with the ability to go out and do more has been great. I still sleep in the afternoon which sometimes refreshes me, not always.

Don't miss a day! I've been using Effexor in combination with other drugs for 4 years for bipolar II.  We lowered my dose to control mania and added Lamictal and now I'm nice and steady.  However, I do have a jittery lower lip when I drink or go to the dentist.  Also, if i miss a day, forget it I can barely stand up from the &quot;bedspins&quot; and I cry uncontrollably.

VERY OVERRATED!! Well, I'm currently in the process of ditching Effexor XR, because when taken with Adderall XR, the side effects are HORRIBLE! Mainly, just fidgetyness and nervousness... it's off the charts!! Also, if you have blood pressure problems, DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION! It has boosted mine up dramatically... and with Adderall on top of it, I have hypertension! Without both meds., I have normal BP at all times. I attribute my BP elevation to the Effexor mainly, because I've done trial and error with self-monitoring, and if I just take a 75mg. Effexor cap., then check my BP an hour or so later... it's up! I've not yet tried this experiment with Adderall XR solo, but I would bet that my BP will not be that elevated, if any at all. Stimulants like Adderall only raise BP in very few people,... unless it's abused, or one takes other stimulants along with it (eg.. coffee, sodas, nicotine, ephedrine, etc.) Bottom line, for as well as this med works, which is NOT VERY WELL, IT'S NOT WORTH THE SIDE EFFECTS!! In my opinion, this stuff is awful!

Effexor Effective in my case Panic attacks, general anxiety, moderate to severe depression, and some obsessive compulsive characteristics made my psychiatrist suggest I try Effexor.  The &quot;newer&quot; extended release works better.  I take 450 mg per day; that is,  two 150mg when I wake up, and one before I go to bed at night. The mild side effects such as dizziness sometimes, night sweats sometimes don't bother me enough to discontinue it.  When the days get longer, I drop down to two 150mg capsules a day.  I also have &quot;seasonal affected disorder&quot; so I get more depressed during the winter months.  It took a few years to pick up on why the effectiveness was going away - until we noticed it was for the same months every year.

Effexor Worked For Me I have had anxiety problems for most of my life.  It go to the point, while at college, where I could not even leave my apt.  Since then I have been on medicine, and have gone though counciling.  I have come a long way, and I am a firm believer in Medicine, if used correctly.  You hear all of these horror stories about people on these medicines, but most cases are due to the drug being mis-prescribed.  This really changed my life, and got me to a place where I could actually start to heal.  I still battle with anxiety from time to time, but it no longer runs my life.

This medication is bad news for bipolar people I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder 14 years ago. I took meds sporatically... only when I was having severe episodes. I didn't notice manic episodes until June 05, after being prescribed Effexor XR. At first I thought it was a miracle drug. After only taking it for a week and a half I was on top of the world and stayed there for a month and a half. Then I had the worst depressive episode ever. This cycle went on from June-December 2005, when I was diagnosed as Bipolar I with rapid cycling. The Dr started me on Lamictal and began weening me off the Effexor.2 weeks ago I took my last dose of Effexor. This drug brought out the highest high and the lowest low in my moods and the withdrawals almost killed me, literally. In the past, I have always had suicidal thoughts, but with Effexor I became obsessed with suicide. I was constantly thinking about doing it. I would even dream about it. I tried to do it several times, and I started cutting again... something I hadn't done in almost 10 years. I lost my job, my will to live, a lot of  my  friends, my man, and would have been homeless if not for the love and support of certain friends and family.If you are or may be bipolar please stay away from this medication, it's very dangerous. It almost ruined my life.

Use something else! I was originally using Celexa sucessfully for a few years.  I moved out of state and lost my benefits and ability to obtain Celexa cheaply.  To get started again I obtained state help.  Help, LOL - they wouldn't pay for Celexa and put me on Effexor instead.  I believe it has affected me for life.  I didn't experience any real noticeable relief from my depression.  When the state faltered on my coverage I suffered severe withdrawl symptoms.  I was on and off the medicine depending how I was yanked around.  With the remaining capsules I had, I broke them all open and divided it out to gradually wean myself over 4 weeks.  I was dizzy/vertigo, weak, tired, shakey, sweating, irritable, nervous, couldn't see straight, nauseous and I had dry/medicine mouth.  The 2 worst side effects were the unbearable colliding nerve Zaps! throughout my entire body and my ongoing memory loss.  I truly feel like I was a guinea pig robbed of my life.  I am extremely disappointed with Effexor and would rather be depressed than EVER take it again.

Effexor's effective Only shortcoming, besides loss of libido, is that the discontinuation symptoms are quick to set in if you miss a dose even by more than a few hours.  And I had all sorts of very unpleasant symptoms when I cut down from 225 mg to zero over a 2-week period in 2001.  They included nausea, dizziness, fatigue, feeling HORRIBLE overall...plus esophageal reflux(heartburn) that appeared over the next 5 or 6 weeks.  From what I've read this is a pretty common problem with Effexor. Very gradual weaning off, plus Prozac to cover that period of time, is supposed to be helpful.

Effexor Treatment I did not find that Effexor was enough for my depression.  However it did help with my essential tremor (in the hands).  I felt hot when I took it, but not as hot as when a psychiatrist suddenly took me off the medication.  The company warns not to discontinue Effexor abruptly, but I figured that the doctor was replacing it with another  medication that was preventing the withdrawal.I now know what suffering drug addicts go through when quitting their addictive drug(s). Please HEED the warning to slowly cut back on your dosage of Effexor should you need to stop taking it.  And, should any doctor try to pull you off the drug abruptly, please seek another physician to deal with your case.  This is what I did, and it may take a while to find another truly competent doctor, keep on trying.  They ARE out there.

WORKEDE GREAT UNTIL.... This was the WONDER drug for my slight depression and OCD.  I then got pregnant, had to go off of it for the class of drug it was and not being safe for the baby.  Went on Prozac during my pregnancy since it was a safe alternative.  After I gave birth and stopped breatfeeding, tried to go back on Effexor and I felt horrible, with really bad shakes.  My body chemistry totally changed after the baby.  Cannot take it any more.

Very paranoid and delusional.  Bad stuff This drug cause me to become a rapid cycler with severe mixed episodes.  I became very paranoid and suspicious and delusional.  It did not help my depression but instead caused me many severe manic and depression episodes with alot of anxiety.  I stopped it cold turkey and boy did that hurt and make me violently ill but it was well worth it.  One of the best things I did for myself was stop this drug.  What a relief that was.

Didn't Find the Effectiveness in Effexor For the first two months I was on a 50mg daily dosage of Effexor.  Everything seemed to be going well until I fell into another 'depressive episode'.  The dose was then increased to 75mg.  Just one month later I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt.  Effexor seemed to make a bad situation worse.What works for one may not work for another.  I realize that some people have had nothing but success with Effexor and that it works well for them, however I think it important that experiences like mine be shared.  It's important to know and understand what your taking and the risks that come along with the benefits.

Effexor My doctor put me on Effexor after having my second child and right away I was not liking my side effects. About 8 -10 hours after taking the medicine, I would start having really bad panic attacks. I don't know if it was tied to the medicine, I never had panic attacks before that.  I just know that I had to be taken off it. I know everyone is effected different ways with different medicines so what doesn't work for me, may work for someone else.

Very good for panic attacks and mood I began taking 300mg of Effexor XR a couple of years ago.  I have bulemia, bipolar disease and borderline personality disorder.  Effexor XR helped quite a bit with my mood and panic attacks (I was having 3-4 a day, now I have 1 a month) but has done nothing for my ability to feel pleasure in life (for that I'm taking Wellbutrin).A lot of people complain about side effects, but remember that not everyone will have them.  I had none whatsoever.  So don't let that stop you from trying a drug that can be very helpful, albeit very expensive.P.S there is no such thing as being &quot;sensitive&quot; to medication, that is your anxiety.

I have bulemia, bipolar disease and borderline personality disorder.  Effexor XR helped quite a bit with my mood and panic attacks (I was having 3-4 a day, now I have 1 a month) but has done nothing for my ability to feel pleasure in life (for that I'm taking Wellbutrin).A lot of people complain about side effects, but remember that not everyone will have them.  I had none whatsoever.  So don't let that stop you from trying a drug that can be very helpful, albeit very expensive.P.S there is no such thing as being &quot;sensitive&quot; to medication, that is your anxiety.

stay away! I took 5 tablets of effexor per day for about a year.  I felt as though they were sugar tablets for the amount of either benefits or side effects while i was on them.  When I came off them (over about 3 months) I felt like I was dying, it was the most horrific experience of my life.  Since i have been off them I have had an extreme emotional flattening and have felt no positive emotions whatsoever.  I would recommend staying far, far away from these at the risk of losing any future happiness.

Effexor - the wonder drug I don't remeber when I began taking Effexor or when I stopped (a nasty little side effect of CFS)but I do remember that it made me feel like a human again.  The only problems I had with it were that it made my heart beat too fast and I would sweat with any kind of prolonged activity.It was so bad at one point I thought I was going to pass out.  It took some time for it to get out of my system and I with it didn't have that effect on me because the pros helped me so much.  The cons probably would have killed me though.

Horrifying experience This was bar-none the WORST drug I have ever encountered. I had every side effect listed and then some. I felt as if I was dying the first day I took it. Then thought I had the flu but found out it is a side effect of the drug. Also had sore throat, nausea, fever, muscle pain, dizzy, faint, and worst of all joint pain to the point that I had difficulty walking. I was afraid to drive because I was so &quot;stoned&quot; on the medication. I had absolutely no sex drive and when I did get active was unable to reach orgasm. The Dr. cut me down to 1 pill every 2 days and that brought the side effects down to a tolerable level. Still, the slight benefit was far outweighed by the side effects. I would never recomend this drug to anyone!

Bad News! Tried samples for nagging depression of my bipolar.  Thought I was having a heart attack after a couple of days.  Went to the doc and they rushed me in for an EKG, kept me there until a new anti-hypertensive took effect.  Now I'm permanently on two blood pressure drugs.

Very effective, but worried about discontinuing I have been on Effexor for about 1 1/2 years.  I have tried others, but this one has worked the best for me.  However, I have had to steadily increase my dose for it to be effective.  Also, if I miss a dose, the consequences are horrendous.  I start feeling the withdrawal symptoms.  The &quot;brain shivers&quot; where I cannot turn my head without feeling out of it/weird...it almost feels like an EXTREMELY bad hangover, headaches, fatigue/weak feeling, nauseous...I can barely get out of bed. Upon finally taking a dose, it takes about 5-6 hours for me to feel normal again. My dose is getting up there (300/day) I know I can still take more, but with the increased dose I have gotten side effects.  Night sweats is the biggest. Dreams become more vivid. Like I said, it has been extremely effective with my depression/anxiety, but the thought of a higher dose &amp; switching meds scares the hell out of me!!!  I wish I would have known the discontinuation symptoms before starting.  Next time I'll do the research!

placebo to keep the doctors happy My primary problem is chronic pain, and the current treatment for this problem is a coctail of medications that includes psychiatric medications.  The pain docs consider antidepressants a &quot;must&quot;, and in order to maintain access to my pain medication, I must be seen to be taking an antidepressant.  Unfortunately for me, my body hates antidepressants.  Even though I suffer from depression over and over, the side effects of antidepressants are too much for me, and most of them don't work anyway.  The pain docs push Effexor because they believe it to have some power to relieve pain, and they like to dose patients with up to 300 mg. per day of the stuff.  I was discharged from a hospital stay taking a monster dose of Effexor, and I found that I was a mental basket case, crying every day, and also I wasn't sleeping at all, despite large doses of trazadone and then Ambien in addition.  I was up all night every night for months, and the psychiatric team had no cure for the problem, and didn't think that it was a big problem.  So I resorted to my tried and true solution and started tapering off the Effexor.  I found that at 150 mg. per day I could tolerate the stuff, though it was doing me no good at all, and it kept my doctor happy for years.  After I had taken it for about four years, I had a new psychiatrist, and she wanted me to increase the dose of Effexor.  I followed her instructions, and found that I didn't get the expected insomnia.  However, after several months, I started becoming extremely fatigued, to the point that I was afraid to drive.  Since I live alone and have no one to take care of me, this was a major problem.  The doctors I saw kept asking me if I had started a new medication, but I hadn't.  Finally I reasoned that since the antidepressant dose was the only thing that had changed, and since I had a history of sleep-related problems with anti-depressants, it would make sense to taper back down on the Effexor

Effexor used to treat IBS-D I was put on Effexor XR to control the anxiety from IBS-D.  I have been on this drug for over 4 years.  This drug did help with that problem, but the side effects were really hard to deal with.  I experienced weight gain, intense sweating, yawning &amp; fatigue, and loss of libido.  The mental side effects were a sense of flatness - I wasn't really happy or sad...just an awful apathy about everything...a feeling I've never experienced before in my life.  I've finally have begun the withdrawal process and I'm about halfway through this process (under a Dr.'s instruction for weaning) and so far I've not experienced too many symptoms of withdrawal.  It took a lot of courage to come off this drug after reading about others battle with withdrawal.  But I just felt that I could not live the rest of my life not caring about anything.  I don't know what to expect with the IBS-D after getting off of Effexor - I'll just have to cross that bridge when I get there.  I may try Lotronex since it seems to make more sense to treat the IBS-D than my brain.  I feel that the anxiety I was experiencing was due to the IBS-D rather rather the the other way around -i.e. that the IBS-D came first and then the anxiety.

Effexor Helped quite a bit at first but effectiveness has lessened over time; I'm still taking it, however, because without it, I get very teary - cry over the least little thing.  My dosage over these years has varied between 37.5 mg and 450 mg. per day.  (450 mg. is WAY too much!)  I have also tried several other meds during this time; even the ones that work well at the beginning lose their effectiviness over a few months.

effective but for how long? I've taken effexor for 4 years with brief periods of switching to other ad's. Effexor has been the most effective for me. My symptoms were in remission for about a year and a half which was great, but slowly they came back and i tried other antidepressants and my conditon only worsened. It seems after such a pro longed period of use, effexor has almost stopped working for me. In addition to this I developed side effects from it after almost 2 years of taking the drug, which is quite strange. Anyways its a good anti-depressant but i wouldnt rely on it for long term use.

Effexor I have been taking Effexor now for 6 weeks and I have to honestly say that I have never felt more myself ever.  The early side effects I got past and now I am just a little tired at times and it is hard to wake in the morning.  I am going backto the Dr and perhaps try some Wellbutrin for the tiredness and lack of energy, also a lower than normal interest in sex.   I personally like how it makes me more balanced, and did do plenty of research before taking it.

Wow!  Effexor XR, Dosage and Powerful Changes Hi Hi Guys ;)It has been months and months since I posted here. Quite frankly, the reason for that is that I have been imbalanced and tweaking meds following the death of my father.  My pdoc had a good supply of Effexor samples and suggested we opt for a 1 month trial of the med (which, btw, I have used before with not much success as you may see in a previous post).  I was hesitant to go back on the SSRI/SNRI wheel, but intuitively seemed to know that for me and my brain chem, this med at the RIGHT dose may be a godsend.Indeed, it was!  BUT... let me qualify that.  I took a full 4 weeks to tweak the dosage.  And quite frankly I believe that is the problem most people run into with Effexor.  The more I read up on it, the more I see it's so DOSE-SPECIFIC to each individual.  And this is key.  For me, starting at 75mg right out of the gate was not a problem.  For others, it causes chaos.  I increased the dose to 150mg within a week, again with positive changes and no problems.Now, after staying at 150 for another week, it just did not feel as effective as, say Lexapro or other SSRI's I've mentioned on this site.  However at 225mg of Effexor XR... MAGIC!!  All I can say is wowza!  It's not that I'm totally cured or that I have stopped or been concerned about the bipolar II side.  I still take other meds, and some have been altered because of the success of Effexor XR.  All I can offer you by way of personal experience, is this:  LISTEN, OBSERVE BUT DO NOT ACCEPT AS ULTIMATE TRUTH THE NEGATIVE OPINIONS REGARDING THIS MEDICATION!  Remember, it's very dose-specific to each.  And honestly, I have been on it before and come off it with minimal side-effects.  I don't doubt that some folks have withdrawal syndrome, but I can truthfully say that I did not.  In a nutshell, I truly think this med ROCKS (lol). It's not a &quot;high&quot;... rather it brings me back to earth and allows FEELING, decreases ANXIETY, and lets me

However at 225mg of Effexor XR... MAGIC!!  All I can say is wowza!  It's not that I'm totally cured or that I have stopped or been concerned about the bipolar II side.  I still take other meds, and some have been altered because of the success of Effexor XR.  All I can offer you by way of personal experience, is this:  LISTEN, OBSERVE BUT DO NOT ACCEPT AS ULTIMATE TRUTH THE NEGATIVE OPINIONS REGARDING THIS MEDICATION!  Remember, it's very dose-specific to each.  And honestly, I have been on it before and come off it with minimal side-effects.  I don't doubt that some folks have withdrawal syndrome, but I can truthfully say that I did not.  In a nutshell, I truly think this med ROCKS (lol). It's not a &quot;high&quot;... rather it brings me back to earth and allows FEELING, decreases ANXIETY, and lets me

Effexor XR  - the longest withdrawal period ever Every anti-depressant effects people differently. That said - as I can attest to and heard stories about - Effexor is incredibly difficult to come off of as compared to other anti-depressants. I was on a 300 Mg dosage for a  year and a half to treat chronic pain and depression. Once I was ready to come off the drug, it took another 5 months to get off it - not due to rebound depression side effects, but due to these shock sensations in my head when I tried to come off at any speed other than a turtle's pace. My doctor said this sensation is most common amongst effexor users than any other anti-depressant. Other side effects it caused me: fluid build up in the joints that led to mild arthritis (i'm 25 - it disappeared once I was off the drug), fragile blood vessels, that led to easy bruising.

REPOSTING I was on effexor since 0ctober 2002, never did I see the light on it, BUT it took my anxiety away, by 2004 my depression got WORSE, so I was put from 150mg to 225mg, still feel hopeless and abandoned, night sweats with the increase dosage and nothing else. Quit cold turkey and thought I was going to die of despair and vomiting - WITHDRAWALS FROM EFFEXOR ARE SOMETHING YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO WISH UPON EVEN YOUR WORST ENEMY- then was put on lexapro 20mg I've cutting my pills in two - plan to eventually take full pill to see a jumpy improvement, my Dr. also put me on abilify but I have kept it off for a while, I've read that abilify is a much stronger drug and I am afraid of putting myself through it.

Is there life after Effexor???? If you have been taking Effexor 75mg XR for 6 months or more, you will probably have to do what I did in order to wean yourself off of it. There will be times that you think you 'just cant do it' but DONT GIVE UP! YOU CAN DO IT!  I had the help of a very compassionate DR. &amp; Pharmacy and am almost off completely!The first week try 1/2 tablet every day (6 days) 37.5mgThe second week break the 37.5mg in half and take 18.8mg (6 days)The third week you will take one half of the 18.8, which is about 9mg for 6 days (**9mg doesnt seem like much but believe me it is when it comes to the withdrawal symptoms, it is!) THe brain jolts or shivers will drive you nuts when you dont take it.The fourth week, you will take the 9mg every other dayThe fifth week, you will take 9mg every two days.The sixth week - you take none.......WITHDRAWALSIf you are lucky enough to have a doctor that understands that the effexor is  poisoning your body then you may see if he/she can give you Xanax or ativan to take  morning and night.  They also gave me meclizine 50mg to take 1-3 times daily  depending on how much I needed it.  BOTH OF THESE THINGS WILL HELP THE BRAIN JOLTS.  IF I DIDNT HAVE THOSE TWO THINGS I WOULD HAVE GONE NUTS!! THe meclizine is over the counter if you have a TARGET store that carries 'motion sickness' meds, you can even get the generic.  Unfortunately the xanax  has to be given by a doctor(An understanding and compasionate doctor).I, of all people UNDERSTAND what you are going through......You are welcome to email me if you need moral support.If at anytime you feel as though you are coming off of it too quickly back it up and slow it down.

CAUTION:  Discontinuation syndrome / Withdrawal Disclaimer: The symptoms i experienced on Effexor discontinuation were so intense I feel like i have a moral obligation to write this review.I took Effexor for one year, first stabilized at 150mg, then up to 300mg, then up to 600mg a day.  Good thing i have great insurance, or else this would have cost me upwards of $300 a month (if my memory recalls).  The reason for such a high dosage was justified by my previous P-Docs assumption that i was metabolising it too quickly and the noradrenaline effects from the drug needed to be boosted to counteract the seratonin sleepiness and lethargy effects. Effexor works.  It does.  It did.  Or did it?  I could never know, because i lost a job on it and practically failed school.  I had a unstable sleeping pattern (bed at 3 or 4 am and rise at 6am for school or 3pm or 4pm when i didnt have school).But when it's time to quit, the world as i knew it potentially became turned upside-down.I decided to quit effexor without supervision in January, i quickly tapered down to 150 and then quit, all the while experiencing debilitating physical and mental side effects.  A few days later i suffered a very severe panic attack and was in the E.R.  The solution: Ativan.  That calmed things down and I restabilized on 300mg of Effexor and sought a new P-Doc.He suggested to take this very slowly, and prescribed me 37.5mg doses and 75mg doses so i could, one week at a time, taper off 37.5mg at a time.  300 to 262.5 the withdrawal syndrome began its menacing toll.  I remained diligent and brave to continue forward, 37.5 at a time.  When i finally hit 37.5mg, one time a day, the brain shivers, body chills, anxiety, and terror were starting to creep.  These are the signs of the syndrome (more below).2 days after wavering off and on 37.5 then finally quitting, i woke up at 7am shivering uncontrollably.  My body was in near convulsion.  It was 70 degrees in the house but i felt

Effexor Withdrawal Warning I have been taking 75mg Effexor for approx 18 months-drug does help with depression and other problems BUT once you attempt to stop or taper drug side effects are HORRIBLE!  For past two months I have switched from 75 to 37.5mg daily and I can barely function; severe headaches-flu like symptoms-fatigue-inability to think or concentrate-BRAIN SHIVERS-very emotional-moody.  I am not convinced Dr's are getting needed info about drug before prescribing it to patients.  When discussing these symptoms with my Dr. I was advised there were &quot;no&quot; such withdrawals that he was aware of and I could always go back to normal dose if needed.  Should we &quot;have&quot; to take a drug we no longer feel we need to keep from having &quot;withdrawal&quot;?

good and bad I started taking 37.5 mg to treat GAD, prescribed by my GP. Initially I felt better , the only side effect I had was nausea for a couple of hours after first dose. Eventually she raised my dose to 75mg. I seemed to feel normal again for quite a while. But slowly I was gaining weight (about 17 lbs) to date. I was also feeling melancholy again. The doc raised my dose telling me to take 75mg in the morning and 37.5 at night. This did not work at all. I gave it time to kick in, but I was miserable! I stopped taking the extra 37.5 mg at night. I still don't feel well, these are most of the side effects I've been feeling (not necessarily at the same time):  Bad night sweats, nausea, excessive yawning, constant sleepiness, no energy, hair loss, dry mouth, constipation, weight gain, and no desire to do the things that used to give me pleasure. And a couple of times I have felt surges of extreme agitation. Well I decided to go off my med cold turkey 2 1\2 days ago. So far I feel a bit dizzy and under the weather. I also feel sad at times. I will see my doc in one week for a check up. I know she will be upset at my decision to abruptly stop, but I thought I'd take the chance that my withdrawal would not be severe. I figured that I could always take a smaller dose if I became miserable with withdrawal effects. To conclude, in the beginning Effexor really helped me get back to feeling normal, but it seems that long term usage for me got much worse.

Effexor XR 37.5 mg 1x2x a day This is the one that gave me the severe skin rashes and lesions on my scalp and eyebrows. My hair fell out and so did my eyebrows. I'm still tring to deal with the severe hairloss and dried up cement like scabs on my scalp and almost an excema type rash on my eyebrows. The hair follicles become clogged inflamed and burn severely once thats over they ooze a sticky substance then it itches/burns and your hair sticks to it then the hair falls out. Did I forget to mention it also causes alopecia? I use to be a hairdresser w/my own buisness for over 20 yrs. That's gone now. I am devasted by my appearance. Not to mention the fact that my hair was alwaysa thin at the top and I use to dye thbe roots and foil the rest to make it appear thicker. That worked for me for several yrs. prior to this antidepressant! This is supposed to help me w/depression? I do NOT think so. Now, I look awful feel awful and am extremely frustrated with these drugs and their awful side effects we're not told about until enough patients report it.This was another one in which I had to get a sample box, take out the insert and actually show the Dr. the awful side effects/adverse reactions. After I told him that antidepressants do NOT agree with me. I really wish these DR.'s had more intense education before prescribing this stuff. I had one Dr. try to prescribe this to me because I was /am going through menopause!! They just love to prescibe this stuff. They forget that we're the ones that have to deal with their uneducated ways of prescribing such poison and the new thing I read was they're now dishing it out to children. What's next? You have clinical depression or an imbalance in your brain chemistry for everything that can happen in your life? Who, in this day of age is NOT depressed at one time or another?

So far, so good So far, Effexor XR has done a good job of cutting through the underlying anxiousness that was lurking in the background on a daily basis.  Its much easier to take things with a grain of salt.  Its much also to recognize when I'm getting obsessive over problems and try to 'let it go'There are the usual range of noticable side effects though:  increased carb cravings, sexual side effects, some memory issues (increased tendancy to blank on people's names) and night sweats. (dramatic if I've overslept past dosage time)  There's also the extraordinarily vivid dreams, but they are more fascinating than anything.  (especially if I've had to take Nyquil for a cold)The oddest thing I've noticed is that my alcohol tolerance has increased dramatically on Effexor.   Very easy to drink more than usual without feeling the normal buzzy or dis-orienting effects.  Be careful of this.I haven't tried to stop taking it yet though.  Based on my investigations, I have no doubt it will be a royal PITA and that may change my opinions overall, but at the moment this seems like a good plan.

good &amp; bad When I started on Effexor XR, I was in a bad way - have extreme anxiety symptoms all day long &amp; not sleeping.  Taking effexor helped me with my symptoms while I learned other ways to deal with anxiety.  Now I'm in the process of quitting which is extremely difficult &amp; must be done in very small tapers over a long period of time - much smaller tapers and a longer period of time than most doctors and pharmacists suggest.

Taking effexor helped me with my symptoms while I learned other ways to deal with anxiety.  Now I'm in the process of quitting which is extremely difficult &amp; must be done in very small tapers over a long period of time - much smaller tapers and a longer period of time than most doctors and pharmacists suggest.

improved mood &amp; sleep, but anticholergenic effects I tried a sample from my doctor for not quite 3 weeks. I started at 37.5 mg, for 2 weeks, then went up to 75 mg for the last week.I have a history of anticholergenic side effects, e.g., dry eyes and severe constipation, with any anti-depressant that works on norepinephrine. So that included effexor. Not  everyone has this problem.Effexor really helped my insomnia, and it seemed to improve my mood after just one week.

MMD After a terrible set of withdrawal symptoms from Paxil, was thrilled with the results from Effexor although dosage was increased from 150mg/day to 100mg 2xday.  Depression significantly reduced, feel simply calmer when in high stress situations, more patient with people and events.  Strongly suggest trying if others have not worked.

Weaning Off This med was pretty good at helping me through dark times and in particular, handling the extreme anxiety.There were side effects that were generally mild like the dry mouth and ticks that came with trying to sleep. I frequently delayed my daily dose until after sex because it greatly reduced my ability to climax.The one truly bad thing about the Effexor is trying to go off it. As time passed, it didn't work as well. My Doc started me on a different SSRI and reduced my Effexor dose by 75 mg a day. I was doing well until I had completely stopped the Effexor. Roughly 2 days later, I was down with flu like syndromes. There chills, aches, nausea and an awful taste in my mouth. It never subsided and after 5 days I took a 75 mg XR to hold me over until  could rework a taper off schedule with the Doc. So, I thought I would take the 75 mg every other day until I am able to get in with the Doc.

Effexor, Remeron, Trileptal and DBT Effexor side-effects are dry mouth, lips crack, sweat, and tremors or trembling. Trileptal was added yesterday to stop the trembling.It worked. I cannot judge Effexor yet since I have just started taking it last month.

MY REVIEW-EFFEXOR 150MG X TWICE DAILY THE BEST ANTI-DEPRESSANT THAT I'VE EVER USED.  THE REAL DOWN FALL OF THIS MEDICATION IS THE INABILITY TO EJACULATE.  I HAVE FOUND THAT ALMOST EVERY ANTIDEPRESSANT I HAVE EVER USED HAD SOME TYPE OF SEXUAL ADVERSE REACTION.  STILL, FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME, (MY DEPRESSION PUT ME ON SSDI) THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE A SECONDARY ISSUE.  I'VE BEEN USING EFFEXOR SHORTLY SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION INTO THE MARKET.

Less Effective after Long Term Use I've battled major depression for over 10 years, and have taken so many different antidepressants and/or combinations of antidepressants that I feel like a &quot;guinnea pig.&quot;  In 2001 I researched my symtoms on the internet and asked my doctor to prescribe Effexor XR.  I had been taking Zoloft with great initial success, but its effectiveness had diminished over time.  Initially, I believed Effexor XR to be the miracle drug I so desperately sought.  I gradually worked up to a dose of 75mg daily.  It was like taking a &quot;happy pill&quot; every morning.  After several weeks, the euphoria subsided, and my depression seemed under control for a year or so.  I suppose one's body learns to tolerate medication to the point where it is no longer effective.  Some 4 years later, I am taking 150mg daily with little effectiveness.

Worked Great As Long As I Didn't Need to Stand Up I started Effexor XR after hitting the darkest deppression I've ever experienced. I have a chronic disease (25+ years) and have experienced depression periodically throughout it's course. I did not find relief until I started 150 mg/day - but the change in mood was dramatic over just a few days at that dose.  however, within 2 weeks I began to experience dizzyness and light-deadedness with exertion. The problem worsened over 5 days to a point where I could hardly stand up at all.  Blood pressure testing showed dramatic falls upon standing (e.g., 120/70 sitting to 60/30 standing). Since Effexor was the most recent medication started it was suspect. The dosage was reduced by 37.5 mg a day per week. The hypotension did not decrease with the dosage reduction and only resolved after discontinuation.  Depression returned within 2-3 weeks and I am now trying Lexapro.

I finally can tolerate dumb people I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing but at least I can do my job without feeling like throwing myself out the 30th floor window.  I also take this medication for the people I love which is why I tolerate the side effects.  I am more engaged in my life and theirs.If you are coming to these reviews to determine whether or not to take Effexor, then I doubt you will find much helpful information but you instead may become nervous by all the side effect complaints.  And there are side effects, baby, but it is all relative.  If you're so miserable now that you are actually spending your time surfing websites for opinions on various antidepressants (like I did), then what do you have to lose?  I've tried Zoloft, Celexa, and Lexapro.  Each worse than before because they were ineffective and I just felt medicated, a chemical presence in my brain.  I don't want to take something where I can just sit and stare at the wall for hours without caring.  I want emotions.  I want to laugh manically and I want to cry vociferously when appropriate.  I do not want to walk day in and day out with a sense of dread.  Now, after these weeks, I do not feel medicated on Effexor but I feel fine.  It sucks that I have to take a medication to feel this way but the way I was before sucked more.  So here I am and this is life.But you're not here to read about how it works.  You worried, probably depressed, anxious and you're looking for everything that could go wrong because so far it has.  Well that is just the type of pity me crap this medication will smack out of you.  Maybe some other one works better.  Who knows?  You gotta go try.  You wasted years of your life doing nothing so might as well waste a couple of years finding the right balance of meds, you crazy nut.  Find a good doctor.  Not out of the phone book.

Horrible Drug! This is one of the WORSE drugs I have ever been prescribed, and I have taken a lot of them.  If I was late taking it by even an hour or two it would give me horrible nausea.  It had to be taken with food.  It raised my liver enzymes and cholesterol.  It raised instead of lowering my anxiety, which made the OCD worse.  I had no insomnia before I took this med, but it kept me from sleeping so much I experienced hallucinations from sleep deprivation!  My doctor prescribed a sleep med to take while I was on it, and now, 7 years after going off Effexor I still have horrible insomnia.  Everyone I have talked to who has taken this drug has had some bad experience with it.  I think it should be outlawed.

not good with pre-existing liver problem I have liver problems- at that time (age 24)I only had cirrohsis of the liver. I was in a MICA (Mental Illness Chemicall Addicted) program. The Dr. there laughed at me and didn't believe that at my age, my health condition was even possible. Because as you know, a lot of medications are mostly metabolized by the liver, therefore making the liver work harder. Within about 10 days of being on the Effexor, I was already jaunice and went to the hospital for blood work. My liver enzymes which at the beginning of my stay were close to normal were now doubled!!! I was taken off the medication immediately. Just because this happened to me, does not mean it could happen to you. I already had a liver condition that helped cause this reaction. My piece of advice from this is to make your Drs. aware of your health conditions and keep reminding them.

Effexor 75mg Effexor, in my experience is benefitial to treat anorexia, Generalized anxiety disorder and major depression..I found however, after three months of being on 37mg, I needed to increase my dose, like salt in soup, you have to get the amount just right.  Effexor is helpful in taking the edge of worry and nervousness, allowing a person to focus on healing and treating their condition.Side effects do occur for me if I drink coffee, when taking; or before taking my dose, the stimulant reaction with the medication makes me irritable, when I was on a smaller dose, I would become a bit intoxicated feeling if I took caffine with my dose.  The first few weeks on Effexor, I was very tired and found myself sleeping alot, I was under enourmous stress however, and I had been through a huge breakdown, so I am not sure if I should contribute this to the meds or not...Overall, I am very happy to take this medication, it is the only one I have ever taken and it has affected my life very positivly..

Effexor and bipolar A life-saver during severe depression, but had nasty side-effects (bruising, weight gain, irritability, very tight muscles which cannot relax) which worsen with time. Diabolical withdrawal problems - migraine, nausea, vomitting, muscle spasms, if you stop too suddenly. However, it can be done if you take it very, very, very slowly.

Effexor has helped but.... In 1997 I was so depressed I could barley get out of bed. I felt like my body was shutting down because of it. I had been getting progressivley worse for years and this was my breaking point. I thought I would try antidepressants again after waiting about ten years for some others to come out. Prozac did not work for me and some others left me feeling way too tired. So, my doctor at the time gave me 300 mg of effexor and 100 mg of welbutrin. The welbutrin gave me a headache and made my hands shakey. As a hairdresser, that was not going to work for me. I went off the welbutrin, but stayed on the effexor. It helped me alot with anxiety, add type symptoms and racing thoughts.Also my abiltiy to be calmer and not get so angry so quickly was much better. It got me through very rough patch in my life. I decided to open a business and moved ahead in my life with its help. I have also been in therapy, but the effexor definately calmed me down and grounded  me alot. I have wanted to get off of it for about 4 years now and I have been slowly doing that. I do it very slowly, over the past 3 years I have gone down from the 300 mg to the 150 mg. I take one in the morning and 1/2 one at lunch.The reason why I want to go off of it is because I would like to try alternatives like 5 htp for example. I notice too that exercise helps me with my energy level and my mood. Sunglight does too. I bought one of those natural light boxes and use that in the winter and I think it helps.Avoiding alcohol and sugar do too. Being around loving, positive people and humour is a Godsend.  I am not sure that I will be able to be off the effexor for good when I do go off of it, but I want to try it. If I have to go back on it, that will be o.k. I am learning that I need to be gentle with myself in this process of healing. I believe that all illness is spiritually based and not to beat myself up for not being &quot;spiritual&quot; enough but I would like to try to heal my self by sp

Depression relief! I didn't realize i was this depressed until i started taking Effexor; i feel like my old self again.  I started to feel very sluggish and tired all the time without realizing i was pushing people away i was getting deeper into a depression.  I feel Effexor has really helped me.  It has helped me to be more social, caring, relaxed and at ease with things.  Most of all i feel better about myself.  Okay that is the good now the bad...The first week i started this drug i thought it was ripping my stomach inside out literaly.  Horrible stomach pain, constipation, diarhea, sleeplessness, yawning (that was weird) and this awful tiredness in the evening.  And the worst of all was my lack of orgasm.  Yes, even though i am depressed i still like sex!  It has been four weeks now since i've started effexor and i feel so much better.  I am more social, outgoing and generally more relaxed about life... my old self.  I still have some of the side effects like constipation and waking with a head ache every morning.  How much tylenol can one person take before burning out your liver???  I hope this will pass also.  My doctor says it takes a full six weeks before i feel the FULL affects of Effexor.  I can't imagine feeling any better!Good luck and be patient with your body.  It takes a long time for your brain to learn new ways of doing things.  Were not getting any younger :)***UPDATE*** 2/20/05I still am taking 75mg SR once daily and find it to be working great.  I have had a few 'break through' depression days and will discuss this with my doctor on my next visit; i think i should increase.  I still have sleep problems and require Restoril.  And what is up with the sex???  I dream about it EVERY NIGHT!!!  Truly every night i have a dream about sex in some way shape or form.  Weird.*****UPDATE***** 4/7/05I asked my doctor to to switch anti-depressant meds as i had NOT slept for 4 days straight.

A life-saver! After having been on zoloft for several years, and still not feeling like myself, the doctor put me on effexor and what a difference! I was a little &quot;shaky&quot; at first for a few hours after taking it, but it has allowed me to find joy in life again! It is quite expensive for those who don't have insurance, but it is well worth it.

I must have been prescribed far too much I felt like I'd been poisoned. Like a HORRIBLE case of the flu. I couldn't open my eyes because the light was far too bright. My pupils were probably dialated badly... but the Doctor didn't look or care..(sigh).This review has more to do with realizing when you have an inept Doctor.  I was not yet diagnosed with bipolar, but misdiagnosed with depression.  The written test would have cleared that up immediately! (grumble)

Definitely not the best choice for ADHD I start effexor to treat a deppression. I did'nt had any other ADHD related medicamentation at this time and I did'nt seen any improvement concerning this touble . I think it's because the antidepressant increase serotonine.. not dopamine at a strong enough level.

effexor I have taken this.  I had to comment.  It worked very well for anxiety, depression, social phobia.  Caused mania symptoms for me.  Was dx'd with BP after. Also, particularly when coming off. Caused extreme tiredness, but not for everyone.  Coming off of this drug is very difficult. It takes a long time (brain/body shocks) and causes numerous physical and mental health issues.  This effect of comming off seems to be unanimous among people I have spoken to.

It Helps! I was very much against taking antidepressants.  I didn't want to start on it and then become dependent on it.  But I feel differently about Effexor.  I went on it for depression after my divorce.  It helped right away to keep me from reaching the really low, lows.  I ended up finding out that it also helped with my Fibromyalgia - when combined with Provigil.  I feel normal on it.   I don't feel like I can really plummet to a really low depression.  I can still get down - occasionally depressed and sad - but I haven't felt so low like I couldn't recover from it like before.  It's nice.  You can't miss a dose though.  Within two days of missing I start to get shakey and edgy.  But I don't miss.  And if I want to step down off it - I really don't think it will be bad.  My doctor explained that all it does is help your body absorb more serotonin - so it's not adding anything to your body.  I liked that - and I feel it works for me.

I can still get down - occasionally depressed and sad - but I haven't felt so low like I couldn't recover from it like before.  It's nice.  You can't miss a dose though.  Within two days of missing I start to get shakey and edgy.  But I don't miss.  And if I want to step down off it - I really don't think it will be bad.  My doctor explained that all it does is help your body absorb more serotonin - so it's not adding anything to your body.  I liked that - and I feel it works for me.

Effexor, yes First anti-depressant that I ever took that was effective. It took at least 3 weeks for the side effects to subside though. My brain felt like it was loose in my head.

Effexor, weight gain, &amp; withdrawal Effexor did not help for depression. It caused, in part, for me to gain 70 pounds, and it has nasty withdrawal effects. If i missed just one dose, i would feel like i was about to die until i took the next dose.

Feel like a junkie! Update- 12/09/05- Since taking half a 37.5 at 4 o'clock yesterday and feeling normal today, started getting the 'zaps' around 5 o'clock, but am trying to stick it out until tomorrow morning.  It hits you over the head so quickly!!! If I didn't have Ambien for tonight, I'd be hittin' the Effexor tonight!I had a great response to Effexor XR.  After a year of feeling great, I decided that I did not want to continue taking it forever, so my Dr and I decided to wean me off it.  She prescibed a 2 month discontionuation program. After taking the last 1/2 cap of 37.5 the hell began.  I couldn't work, couldn't sleep and when I did had horrible nightmares.  I had major sensory disfunction, the brain zaps and whirling in my head.  So glad that I found this site and realized that I'm not alone.  I really felt like I was going to die.  After 2 days of getting absolutely nothing done at work (I'm a Special Ed teacher) I broke down and called my Dr.  She said that I must fall into a very small category of people who are very sensitive to the drug.  After seeing this web site and others, I think the category is huge.  Anyway, she called in 6 more 37.5 caps for me and I raced over to the pharmacy to get them.  When I got home I opened a cap with shaky hands and poured half into each end of the capsule.  It was then that I said to myself &quot;I feel like I'm doing drugs!&quot; The Dr. is my dealer!  But today I feel like a normal human being again.  I think I'll wait for the winter break to try to quit again, because I can't go through those withdrawls while I'm trying to work.  This sucks!!! How long does it take to feel better?  My Dr said 3-4 days but I don't believe her.  I need to know that there will be an end in sight!

Effexor effects only temporary I started out taking 75mg per day.  It helped, but after about a month it would stop working.  The doctor would then advise me to increase dosage.  It would work again for a while, and then it would stop working again.  This continued until I was taking 300mg per day.  At this dosage it was causing serious constipation requiring an enema to have a bowel movement.  When I weaned off of this drug the withdrawal was rough.  I had &quot;brain shakes&quot; and my depression/anxiety was aweful.

So far, so good... I've been on this for almost a year, and so far, so good.  I didn't do well on straight SSRIs or Wellbutrin, they triggered anxiety.  But the depression is SO bad, I need an antidepressant. Outside of dry mouth and very vivid dreams, I haven't had that rock-bottom depression.

I use a combo with Wellbutrin I am on a combo of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg i qam &amp; Effexor 150 mg i qam. I have been on this combo for more than one year with Effexor 300 mg for 6 mos alone before Wellbutrin added. Wellbutrin helped &gt; my interest, energy, motivation, and clarity of thought as compared to Effexor alone. I have MS and have lesions in the emotional regulation area of my brain so I expect to be on meds long term. I was first diagnosed with Major Depression when I was a teen, 14 to be exact. I was on Prozac when it first hit the market large doses, Paxil, Zoloft, Lexapro. and then Effexor. So far, Wellbutrin &amp; Effexor combo helped me to no longer need Clonopine to address my panic symptoms. Those symptoms have resolved with use of the Wellbutrin &amp; Effexor combo.

very pleased I have been using Effexor for a year and a half now.  Until I reached the right dose for myself, I did have problems with the &quot;brain freeze&quot; side effect.  My dose was finally adjusted in December 2004.  I started out on the 35mg dose, a month later moved to the 75mg does and a month later went to the 150mg dose.Initially, I felt a lot of fatigue and felt very confused.  The confusion lasted for a month and the fatigue lasted for several months until I adjusted to the medications.  I tend to be sensitive to any medications, so I will wait a longer time to let my body adjust.I am very pleased with this medication.  I do have to take it daily.  I definitely have very quick side effects of extreme fatigue if I miss a dose of the medication any day, and I experience the &quot;brain freeze&quot; side effect.  I can tell the medication will have definite unpleasant side effects should I have to discontinue use.But, over the long term, I am pleased with how well it works for me.  I like the fact that I don't experience any real side effects once the dosage is correct.

Ms. I was going through hell and even thought I might have to be admitted to a psych ward when my dr prescribed this drug for me and it has been a true lifesafer. It's treated my depression very successfully - my anxiety not as much. But I take one miligram of xaxax xr per day and this combination seems to work. The one thing I'm concerned about is the withdrawal when I feel like I no longer need this drug.

Hell before and after The medication gave me very severe, warped, vivid, violent and haunting nightmares. The medication also gave me electrical feelings through my body, made me feel hot, and made me itchy. After a very severe series of horrific nightmares from this medication, I decided to go off of it cold turkey. I was only on it for two weeks, and four days later am still experiencing VERY extreme withdrawal symptoms. I have massive feelings of electrical shocks running through my body at all times. I am also dizzy and nauseated. I have gone off of other anti-depressants in the past, and never had any sort of withdrawal like this. I would only take this medication if you plan to be on it for life.

Side effects Severe rash/hives manifested on equal sides of body viz: inner/upper arms, down outer shoulders, across stomach, buttocks and inner thighs. Armpits, groin not affected. Problems persisted for several weeks after ceasing dosage and required a short course of Prednesone to reduce the severity. After another three weeks the underlying rash has not gone although the itching has generally ceased. It is unclear now whether the new anti depressant was responsible but it is still certainly the major suspect.

Another Recovering from Effexor I suffer from longterm depression that started back in my 20s.  I'm 47 years old now.  I started taking effexorXR 75mg after having been on Celexa and then off and only using alcohol to medicate for a year or so (not a recommended solution!)I don't honestly remember exactly when I started taking it but I know I've been on it for a pretty long time, more than 2 years.  The thing is, it works well because it numbs you out.  You don't seem to feel anything and that leads to extremely low motivation t make any changes in your life.  Interestingly, I've spoken with friends who tell me that I did actually feel stuff so apparently my view of what I was feeling and what I was expressing were somewhat incongruent with what other people saw?Anyway, I really hated the withdrawal side effects which were amazingly difficult to handle: brain zaps, nausea, headache, achiness and easily angered.I decided that I didn't want to be on a drug that was somehow promoting my lack of motivation and that made me feel really crappy if I didn't take it, so I tapered off without talking to my MD about it.  I did it really slowly, literally by 5 grains a night (there were approximately 500 grains, so it took me a looong time to do it).  I didn't have near the difficulties that I did when I just quit cold turkey and in fact thought I had been successful in the tapering until I actually completely finished.Within a few weeks of being off completely, my depression came back, I was extremely tearful and very easily angered.  It was scary because I hadn't remembered being this angry or tearful back before I had taken it!Things melted down this last Friday at work and I may have some collateral damage to deal with at work from my loss of emotional control.  I called my doctor who actually wanted to call in another prescription for Effexor to which I said NO WAY.

Not sure about this one... ****************************Update - came off it quickly about a month ago. Experienced the brain zaps, and they're still there a little on occasion, but the first week was by far the worst. Have now come to the conclusion that venlafaxine made absolutely no difference to my state of mind at all, other than by giving the impression it was working by zoning me out. I've also had an absolutely terrible temper since coming off it, though if anything I think my mind is clearer and my mood just the same - variable. If you aren't sure if venlafaxine actually works for you, my advice is to give yourself a bit of time out - the immediate withdrawal might be a bit of a rollercoaster, but I found that it wore off quite quickly and left me feeling much more of a whole person afterwards.  **********************************I have taken Effexor at 150mg per day twice in my history of depression, and I'm still not entirely sure what to make of it. The first time, I was young and didn't notice any definite negative side-effects, but no definite benefit either - I got better more or less without treatment, and so stopped taking the medication. This was at 75mg per day, and I did not withdraw gradually, and I cannot say that I noticed any of the withdrawal effects that people talk about.This time, it's hard to tell what's happening. It has some definite side-effects like tireness, weakness, yawning, total loss of orgasm. In the first week or so it made me feel very nauseous, and I had visual disturbances when trying to fall asleep, and also the runs, and a bit of wooly-headedness, but this wore off. I did not notice any negative effect on my mood at first or in subsequent weeks. Now, I think that it may be helping, a little bit, though I don't really enjoy the tiredness. I'm going to start lowering the dose and see what happens, in favour of trying an SSRI like Citalopram. This is because SSRIs have a much more potent effect on levels of serat

My  story and feelings Hi im 57 yrs old and have been depressed for 2 yrs now although i.ve been under treatment for 2 yrs now I still have periods of unsafe thought,s always tired, feel like I,m just useless, overweight and have been for some number of years, I also have been diagnosted with agent orange which I contracted in Vietnam 66/68 in which I was a truck driver and hauled the product, and then traveled thru the areas that it had been used in. I,ve had a heart attact in 1995, I,m diabetic, overweight 311 lbs, I have arterio/neurothopi w/pain in my feet and lowerlegs most all the time, kidneys are leaking, arms&amp;hands get weak&amp;numb, headaches alot. I am now classified as disabled thru the Military, and also the state of Michigan and receiving compensation from both. But what I want most of all is my life back, and the prospects of that happening look dimmer everyday.  My psyciatrist also has me on a drug called Nortriptaline 25mlg 1 time daily.

Side Effects?? My doctor recently put me on Effexor along with my Zoloft. I am epileptic and it says that it can increase seizures. I am trying to get ahold of my epileptologist, but so far no luck. Has anyone had a problem with siezures while on Effexor? Any epileptics who tried it?

effexor XR This drug helped me a lot for a long time. It wasn't until late in treatment that the sexual side effects began to hit me.  Believe me, those were not fun. The doctor began weaning me off of it. I didn't experience any of the awful side effects of going off the drug. It was okay the whole time.  I was just glad to get my mojo back.

Season Med - Not perfect but works Using in the late fall &amp; winter to deal with depression - it is not perfect, it helps a lot.  Still tired all of the time and a bit anti-social but I am functional.The price is a bit high and when I go on it &amp; come off it I go though a week at each end that is very on comfortable, other then that I do not have any major side affects.

Using Effexor to deal with my Bi-Polar Son I take effexor and Prozac to control my stress dealing with my 27 year old Bi-Polar Son. I understand it helps with my Seratonin Level.  I have been dealing with him for 13 years with every form of eratic behavior you can imagine.  He is also an Meth/Addict and can't remember to take his bi-polar meds which are zyprexa, Depacoate and Paxil.

Long time I have been on Effexor XL since 2001 and it is the one for me and it has kept me stable. I have tried to go off and it did not work so I am a lifer for Effexor XL. I believe there are less side effects after about 3 -5 months of taking the medication. I feel happy that finally something that helps my depression with less side effects and that really works. !!!!!!

Beneficial for me Now up to 187.5mg and it helps a lot.Weaned off of 75 mg last year and it was hard, but the benefits outweigh the anticipated discomfort by far.

Worked! It worked great for me. I went off it rather quickly and it put me through two weeks of hell. I got through it. Then I was just back to my regular fight to get through my day,anxious unfocused self. I am going back on it. I do not think it is habit forming.

Efexor not effective I took effexor for more than 2 years. It help me someone at the beginning but it sometimes made me more anxious taking it than not eespecailly at the end on my 2 years taking it. I have switched to cesamet(related to pot) For the first time in recent memory I feel relaxed.

Effexor use Used Effexor XR for over one year.  It was great for relief of back pain from Fibromyalgia.  One of things I loved about Effexor was that it gave me energy.  It also took me out of my depression however it caused my first mania.  I was then diagnosised with Bi-polar type II.  I am now working with my psydr to find the best combination for me.

Beware of the withdrawal effects! UPDATE below.I was &quot;only&quot; on 75 mg for 4 months due to moderate postpartum depression. I really didn't have any major side effects while on it, except for not really feeling much of anything - not sad, not happy, just &quot;flat&quot;. I tapered down to 37.5 mg for one week and stopped one week ago. The withdrawal side effects have been ridiculous, and I have read that they get worse before they get better. Since stopping the medication, I feel moody and irritable, dizzy, nauseated, disoriented, and unable to focus. In addition, I have brain &quot;zaps&quot;, intermittent diarrhea, horrible neck and shoulder pain, and have strange dreams and trouble getting good quality sleep.This drug needs to be reevaluated by the FDA. The consensus among the online community, and I tend to agree based on my albeit limited experience, is that this is the hardest antidepressant to get off of. I really wish I had never gone on this drug.UPDATE: After having been off of the Effexor 2 1/2 weeks, I finally am feeling almost normal. However, for the first time since I was teenager, I had a near-panic attack yesterday (started feeling like I couldn't get a breath, and broke out in a cold sweat). This was in a relatively benign situation - I was walking around a crowded mall and I really didn't feel consciously stressed. Now I can't say for sure that this was an effect of coming off the Effexor, but it seems a little too coincidental. Also, I had forgotten this I guess, but my sexual response while on the Effexor was WAY decreased. While I still felt a desire, it was much, much harder to reach orgasm. I have noticed a huge improvement in the past week or so.

Effexor good for short term-look out! I've been on Effexor XR at 225 mg/day for over 8 years. Trying now to wean myself off. I am well versed in the withdrawal symtoms, having had to go without it for several days at a time. I just want to say that it works great at the beginning, but it pooped out on me, and now I take 37.5mg/day less every two weeks, and now at 150mg/day I am starting to feel some withdrawal symptoms: irritable, nervous,&amp;$*#$y, wanting to be alone, not sleeping...but this sure beats the way I was feeling on the 225mg. dose. And I think I can put up with these feelings. I may do three weeks at 150mg., because it may stabilize me a bit. I don't really know. Maybe because it is so hard to get off of, I will need to go even slower...especially near the end of the tapering off. I think they will eventually take this drug off the market because the effects are not long-lasting, and side effects are awful. Withdrawal suicide-making. No one believed me when I tried telling them about the withdrawal 6 years ago: now it's common knowledge. Thank God for that, and keep getting the word out!

IMO This drug did not appear to aid in any significant way in regard to my bi-polar/depression conditions.  PLEASE take care when weening off this medication.  Do not under any circumstances stop this drug cold turkey.  My withdrawal symptoms bordered on psychotic episodes and it took over a week to feel at some sort of baseline &quot;normality&quot;  I am now taking Geodon and it has been working well.

No side effects if starting very very low dose  I was afraid to try another anti-depressant because it seems I always have bad reactions like extreme fatigue. I had been on Celexa which worked for a while and then just started to make me sleepy So I tried Effexor to help me with extreme depression and anxiety. I have had no side effects, amazing to me! I have noticed my mood is better, more normalized energy. Not the kind of energy I had on Wellbutrin, but available to me if I need to do the housework or something. I tried going to my doc's recommended dose of 150mg but I got so sleepy and tired that I have decided 75mg is working just fine for now.My doctor said this does have a lot of withdrawal problems for some people but she told me not to worry about it because if I can survive the panic and depression for twenty years, I can handle the weaning process when I decide to do it. I'm impressed that I haven't had side effects, (though I was hoping for a loss of appetite!) But other than a more positive calm mood, i can't even tell I'm on anything. November 2004... I am still doing well, though I have had a couple of &quot;bad&quot; days regarding depression, but I guess that's just part of living. This has been the best anti depressant I have ever tried. I still get stressed, but who doesn't and I can handle the stress MUCH better than without the Effexor. I am grateful for this drug. It hasn't effected my weight or sexual ability or anything else for that matter. I have problems with anxiety too, but even that is better regarding my panic attacks. UPDATE I've been on Effexor quite a few months now, still doing great. I do have extremly vivid dreams, I still can't up my dosage as it makes me too sleepy. I am tired more than I had been even up to a m onth ago, but it could be because it's the middle of winter. Which by the way, usually zaps me out and leaves me feeling very depressed. This winter, with Effexor, I am pretty stable. I hope the Effexor never wears off, be

I tried going to my doc's recommended dose of 150mg but I got so sleepy and tired that I have decided 75mg is working just fine for now. My doctor said this does have a lot of withdrawal problems for some people but she told me not to worry about it because if I can survive the panic and depression for twenty years, I can handle the weaning process when I decide to do it.I'm impressed that I haven't had side effects, (though I was hoping for a loss of appetite!) But other than a more positive calm mood, i can't even tell I'm on anything.November 2004... I am still doing well, though I have had a couple of &quot;bad&quot; days regarding depression, but I guess that's just part of living. This has been the best anti depressant I have ever tried. I still get stressed, but who doesn't and I can handle the stress MUCH better than without the Effexor. I am grateful for this drug. It hasn't effected my weight or sexual ability or anything else for that matter.I have problems with anxiety too, but even that is better regarding my panic attacks. UPDATE I've been on Effexor quite a few months now, still doing great. I do have extremly vivid dreams, I still can't up my dosage as it makes me too sleepy. I am tired more than I had been even up to a month ago, but it could be because it's the middle of winter. Which by the way, usually zaps me out and leaves me feeling very depressed. This winter, with Effexor, I am pretty stable. I hope the Effexor never wears off, because I have

Like a placebo with withdrawal symptoms Apparently venlafaxine works for a lot of people. It had no discernible effect on me, apart from insomnia, confusion, sweating, and irritability when ramping up the dosage.I'm currently suffering the same effects from ramping down to wean myself off it, with added 'electric shock' sensations apparently colloquially known as 'the zaps'. I did some reading, and apparently for some people these withdrawal symptoms (euphemistically referred to as 'discontinuation syndrome') never actually cease, so they can never stop taking this drug again.Also, it has been reported (but not studied) that combining cannabis with even the smallest effective dose of this medication may cause serotonin syndrome, with symptoms including fever, tachycardia, sweating, convulsions, and death.My doctor did not inform me of any of the above.This is supposedly the most commonly effective antidepressant around, so it may be worth giving a try if you really need one - who knows, it may work perfectly for you. But be mindful of the risks.

still working Since I've been finding out how expensive the drug is, have been wondering about less costly alternatives. Am nervous about withdrawing, which I've been considering because of cost.Have read a number of the readers below and appreciate the level of detail provided. My own experience is that everything was gradual. My physician started me on 37.5mg and from there I advanced to 225. Now I'm back on 150 and planning to stay there for a while. The most important benefit for me was an overall lessening of anxiety and improved concentration. I still feel that life is wierd and still have intensely vivid dreams (which I enjoy for the most part) but the benefit is still the lesssening of anxiety which I'd lived with most of my life (am in my 50s). Because of decreased anxiety, I can 'work' with my two teenage children without going berserk. I can see life in more measured terms and can talk/discuss issues with ex-wife without getting angry.  Of course, I would like to feel like this without the 'intrusion' of a drug. However...we'll see.

Effexor I am at the point where I think withdrawing from effexor is the way to go. Either that or adding another anti-depressant to the mix (remeron), to see if that helps.I've been taking remeron in addition to effexor for about 4 weeks. After about 10 days I thought I had noticed some improvement, but it was accompanied by an incredible need for sugar. The last 72 hours, I've had about 4 hours sleep. Looks like another visit to the doctor to try a different approach to my treatment.For interest sake, my underlying condition is fibromyalgia, which of course is associated with depression and significant sleep difficulties.

Just started on Effexor I just started on Effexor and so far I really like it. The only thing I think is bad is I sweat all the time, and get hot flashes. I am only 30 so should not be getting hot like I do. Overall it is a pretty good drug though.

Stopped working I used this medicine for over a year.  In the beginning it worked alright.  After a couple of months I was still gettin down.  The Dr. kept increasing my dosage until he could go no higher.  I felt the worse I had ever felt while taking a medicine.  I was suicidal and had to be taken off of it completely.

112.5 XR Dosage + Talk Therapy Working Great Male 30 - I had my first bout of extreme panic/anxiety and subsequent depression 5 years ago. 1 year of Paxil and Attacking Anxiety program put me on the road to recovery the first time. Managed fine for the last few years especially since my job requires 100% travel. Recently had major life changes (engaged, new job) and the panic ambushed me. Tried to go it alone for 2 weeks and then the Dr put me on Effexor XR. Started at 37.5 for a week then 75 for 5-6 weeks. 75 worked well at first then seemed to plateau and maybe even regress a bit. Upped dosage to 112.5 for the last 4 weeks and have been doing much better. Very little if any panic, obsessive thinking thoughts are much less severe, general mood is &quot;normal&quot;. One thing to note is that this med is a b*tch when you first start. The first week was hell, as was the step up to 75. However now I have no noticeable side effects. Libido is fine. Overall I am happy so far with this med. I highly recommend moving slowly through the doses. Most dr's will jump you from 75 to 150 but if you ask they will probably let you step up to 112.5 instead. This allows you to find the right level for you.

No More Hot Flashes or Night Sweats! My Gyno prescribed Effexor for my excessive hot flashes &amp; night sweats.   Seems Effexor treats social anxiety disorder.  One of the symptoms with SAD is excessive blushing and sweating - Effexor controls this.  Within a few weeks I was back to normal.

pain relief as a side effect of drug I was prescribed this med for anxiety and depression, BUT, I have found that there is a side effect of pain relief that comes along with it.  It is most obvious when I leave it off for a period of time and ache so bad I can hardly move.  Restarting the drug resolves the achyness.  This has happened several times so I think it important to mention as a med that influences pain.  Because I have osteo severe, I do think it helps with the pain relief such that I would continue to take it even if I did not need it for the depression.

Effexor xr I started on a New dose of Effexor xr (150 mg)on Oct.6,'05. When I first started, It was June 20,'05, My PC doc had me alternating My Doses at 75 mg one day/150 mg the next day. This worked only slightly. Around Oct.6.'05, My Psychiatrist told me that I wasn't taking enough, So He put me on 150 mg one pill per day. When I first started this, I didn't like the way I felt. I felt confused, Mixed up, Had trouble keeping up with the days and events of the week, I had a hard time remembering things from day to day, This was extremely frightening! I thought I was developing Alzheimers' Disease! But My Psychiatrist assured me that I wasn't. So Now, It has been about 3 weeks since I started on the 150 mg dosage. I have still had to endure slight mood changes, some confusion, memory problems, and alot of Anxiety. I Must say that the Symptoms seem to be getting less and less severe. My Mood is lifting better now, I'm feeling more calm now, But I'm still having a few memory problems, I'm hoping that this will begin to improve in a week or so. I Know that these Meds take time to feel the full benefits. I had thought about asking My Doctor to switch me to Zoloft, But I fear having a relapse before the Zoloft begins to start working. I do believe that the SSRI'S have less side effects than the SNRI'S. I Have an Appt. with My Psychiatrist on Tomorrow, I may discuss switching back to an SSRI, Because Although the Effexor xr is effective, There are still a Substantial amount of Side Effects associated with this Med. I Hope that this Information has been helpful to someone, Sincerely, BAP

Side Effects are NOT worth the benefit I started taking this med in place of Prozac about 4 months ago.  I started on 37.5mg per day for 7 days then on to 75mg per day for 7 days then finally 150mg per day.  The first day, I felt results in 4 hours.  I didn't feel cured...i just felt a little better.  The second day, no appetite.  I couldn't eat the whole day.  The third day, headache, tension, tremors, insomnia.  The fourth day, anxious, nervous, jaw clenching, insomnia, nausea, headache. this continues the rest of the time on the medicine...The first week on 150 mg was abnormal.  I didn't have an appetite, I felt tired and &quot;not present&quot; at work, i was developing chronic insomnia.  I have always been the type of person that could sleep anywhere, anytime... Not on Effexor.  I would wake up several times in the night and toss and turn.  I felt dis-oriented and dilusional, (sp?)I started to have vivid nightmares that would wake me in the middle of my 2 hours of sleep per night.  The nightmares would come and go...they didn't occur everynight.  But, the worst part about the nights...(besides not sleeping) had to be the constant night sweats and jaw clenching.  I would wake up with damp skin in the mornings with my jaws clenched so tight that my jaw muscles would be sore all day.By week 2 I started feeling really good.  I felt pleasant and sociable.  I didn't feel so withdrawn from the world.  I started to talk to my family members again without screaming and ranting profanity.  I actually felt human again. (human, but with side effects).By week 3 I had uncontrollable yawning at work.  I had tried to switch my doses from night to mornings in hopes that would cure the insomnia, but it caused me to be severly tired at work. I started having a loss of interest in my relationship. Lack of sex drive, took a VERY LONG time and a LOT of effort to have an orgasm if at all.  I felt happy but with no ambition.  I felt better about going to the mall and being

effexor and situation depression I started using Effexor because of the trauma of a divorce after a 36 year marriage -- my ex led a second life with several lovers while maintaining the loving husband, good father image. The effexor took the edge off my depression and helped me function. Now I am facing a second situational depression life event.  I have become the caretaker of my elderly parents and once more my life is limited.  My doctor suggested increasing the effexor, but I am trying to increase my exercise first.  Yoga helped me tremendously when my ex left and now I am trying to add tai'chi to this also.  However, the tai'chi requires concentration and memory, and both of those aren't strong points right now.

Effexor I started with Prozac, went to Paxil and ended up of Effexor. worked very good but I started having hand tremors after about five years of being on SSRI's. My dr thought it was long-term use of SSRI's and he put me on Wellbutrin but that didn't help me depression as much so he has me on both. 75mg of Effexor once in AM and 150mg of the older type of Wellbutrin about 2 PM. I have been on this for over two years and works fine for me. I found out after getting other symptoms that I had toxic black mold growing under my trailer and I ended up living in a tent in the west texas desert. I started feeling better on the 4th day but by a couple of weeks, my hand tremors stopped so it was apparently from the mold exposure and not the SSRI's.

Only one effective for me I have ADD comorbid with depression. After being treated with several different antii-depressants over many years, my psychiatrist put me on the combination of venlafaxine and Ritalin. The combination has proved most effective in that I no longer have the suicidal thoughts that previously spiraled downward into actual suicide attempts - two of which I barely survived. Taking the doses upon awakening and right before bed has made it easy for my ADD scrambled brain to remember to take them (most of the time.)

Helped for a while My family doctor put me on Efexor, which was my third antidepressant, which I started on after the first two stopped working.  It helped for a while, although I lost all interest in sex.  For a while I was willing to make that trade off.   As it started to lose it's effectiveness, I was back to white-knuckeling my way threw life, and that is no way to live.   Finally saw a good psychitrist and he put me on Lamictal, and life is soo much beter and my sex life is back!

like magic, then caused tics I have taken Effexor three times. It always works like amgic. I stop crying the first day and everytihng seems fine. Then the tics start. The first time it was a year into the treatment--chewing my cheeks and clicking my front teeth together. The second try, several years later lasted for almost a year before I had to get 2 crowns because I was grinding my teeth so hard. The last time, was the same. The crying stopped right away, but the cheek chewing started within just a few months. I'm trying Cymbalta now and it seems OK so far.

Venlafaxine Efexor XL Fought depression and panic attacks since 2nd pregnancy (The attacks came out of nowhere one week before I found out I was pregnant). Fought it for 6 months after the birth. By this time I was too exhausted to fight any longer and terrified. Effexor took  4-5 weeks to properly kick in. Side effects in first couple of weeks were :dry mouth,weird dreams,Sweating,these all went by week 3 or 4.Now no depression or attacks, confident and back to my old self. And now for the downer:Tried to come off on 3 separate occasions. SLOWLY. The last time took from Jan to Nov last year until I was down to a tiny speck shaved off a 35mg tablet. It only took days after going to nothing for my mood to dive and threaten to take over. So back I went to the doctors. I'm fine again now and I don't think I will ever come off them. Of course, looking back the danger time is once you feel good you may think great! I'm OK now lets get off the drugs, but would a diabetic do that with insulin or an asthmatic on medication etc etc? This is an illness in it's own right. Chemicals need substituting if they are out of balance whether physical or mental. Oh one major detail I must state. It took 3 years after the birth before I got a thyroid test at Doctors (and that was only because a friend suggested I ask for one since the tiredness was still present). It turned out to be under. So also take 100mg thyroxine, I do wonder if it was my thyroid all along mimicking symptoms of depression. Could all the despair have been avoided if I'd been given a test in the first place? I never know

5th week on Effexor XR/Panic Attacks return I am just starting my 5th week on Effexor XR for depression and panic attacks.  I am feeling better as far as the depression goes, but this last week my panic attacks have returned (two times per day)and my anxiety level is high again. Is this normal?  I am contacting doctor tomorrow.  I am disappointed.  I have been off antidepressants for a year and have accepted this is how it has to be. It's frustrating finding one that works. I feel so out of control.  Like my body is attacking me from within.

Effexor Effexor really is the anti-depressant for me - because for me it works and it works well which no other anti-d has.  I actually take combined normal and time release versions.  No distinct side effects at the onset of treatment that I can recall. However, I ran out one Friday and decided to just wait until Monday to buy a new supply - big mistake.  By the Sunday dizziness and vertigo was so bad I couldn't walk - the withdrawal symptoms are very strong and would be VERY scary if you didn't know what was happening.  As an aside, my father who is also bipolar was prescribed Effexor and it made him ill, anxious and disturbed to the point he thought he was dying.

I was given another chance. I have been taking Effexor since January 2005. It has been very effective alongside the ECT treatments I was given. I am very thankful for this medication. I do admit though missing a dose or two can cause quite an agonizing feeling, so I recommend keeping up with your dosing. I was in and out of the hospital since June of 2004 which was my first experience with hospitalization. I would get into these psychotic fits which were marked with a deep depression. I wanted to die. I wanted to scratch my skin off my body. I was basically flipping out of my tree. The hospital stays were grueling. One day the doctor decided to give me a try on Effexor and remove my anti psychotic replacing it with another mood stabilizer. Then I was given 6 ECT treatments along side it. After that I have not had anymore episodes of depression with psychosis. I live happily slowly getting my life back together. There is one quite disturbing side effect. I have vivid dreams at night. They seem so real that they pain me for hours afterwards. I wake up tired, irritated and depressed. I have never tried withdrawing from it and from what I have heard I don't plan to. I have had depression problems and mood problems my whole life that were never treated with medication. I am now finally starting to become more responsible with the help of my boyfriend. Not everyone has the same success on a medication so be very careful what you put into your body. I hope you have success in your endeavor for wellness of the mind.

Good but &quot;poops out&quot; for some Effexor XR was the only anti-depressant I ever took that seemed to actually work (besides Cymbalta, which I'm now on), but I had to stop cold turkey which sucks (Don't ask, long story)because I've stopped a lot of things cold turkey and the one that sent me to the hospital was Effexor. I've gone cold turkey off of hydrocodone, xanax, and weed and never, in my life, was a withdrawal as horrible as effexor.

Withdrawal put me in the hospital Even though going thru a taper I still had intense withdrawal that the drug companies like to call &quot;discontinuation symptoms&quot;  ha!  Tell my body and mind that!  I had intense physical withdrawal...nausea, headache, vomiting and brain shivers....then came the thoughts of death and hopelessness and eventually the Rehab to be monitored off of the Effexor, and to be given medication to help with the withdrawal.  I had never in all of the years I have been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder had thoughts of wanting it all to end until I tried to go off of this med.

Effexor Effexor was the only med that hleped with my depression for a long time.  2 years ago, I began using an antiepileptic with the Effexor, and had a better response, but Effexor was really helpful for me.  Tapering off Effexor was really, really difficult though.

Efectin-ER was THE ANTIDEPRESSANT for me! Efectin-ER helped me out of a very hard depression. Doctors didnt treat my depression for a long time and it was really a very hard one. The cheaper antidepressants didnt work for me - but when I started with Efectin, I started to become a good and interesting feeling in my brain. The dosis was increased to 450 mg per day [in the morning 150 mg + 75 mg (capsules Efectine-ER) and at midday the same dosis]. My brain worked normally again - no, better than before - and I could enjoy life again!!! A great medicament!The only and heavy side effect is a reduction of sexual desire and potency, maybe because the brain works so well and one looks more critical at his partners.I liked and needed sexuality always very much and therefore I reduce my high dosis stepwise and slowly now. With Cialis I get nice erections, but sexuality is different.Life is great and so interesting!!!

Effexor XR I moved from 75mg to 150mg (XR) about a year ago, resulting in fewer and less severe mood swings. Amissed dose results in ears ringing and disorientation in about six hours, so could be serious is a backup dose is not available. This is the best I have found, after transitioning from Klonopin, toBuSpar and to Preozac before learning about the possible efficacy of Effexor from a therapist.

Amissed dose results in ears ringing and disorientation in about six hours, so could be serious is a backup dose is not available. This is the best I have found, after transitioning from Klonopin, toBuSpar and to Preozac before learning about the possible efficacy of Effexor from a therapist.

Not Effective Anymore, Hard to get off of I have been on Effexor since June/1997.  It was very effective for the first few years that I was on it, but no longer seems that effective.  I have been in a severe depression with paranoia for several months now.  I am now on Seroquel as well, which is helping with the paranoia and anxiety, but I still suffer from depression.  I have tried several times to get off this drug, but the withdrawal effects have been unbearable - shakiness, headache, a feeling of being on pins and needles, and &quot;brain freeze&quot;.

Best I've been on Tried seroxat, cipramil, prozac but this is the first one that worked without side effects. The only problems occur if you forget a dose when there is dizziness and nausea.

Effexor Effexor has been wonderful for me...for depression. However, I have not seen any decrease in fibro symptoms due to using it. Then again, I take so many meds for so many conditions, that I am not sure if I could pick out what works for what. And after 3 years of use, depression is breaking through also.

Effexor While Effexor helps with the clinical depression, I do not see that it has had any effect on the chronic fatigue. It may contribute to the sleepiness as a matter of fact, although in my case that is hard to determine, since I take many other meds that are &quot;drowsiness specific&quot;. But in helping with the depression, I find that it has the effect of making all of my illnesses easier to handle in the long run.

madness in a pill I suffer from depression and anxiety. The effexor was for anxiety. If I had kept taking someone was going to get hurt (myself or some other lucky soul). All my symptoms got worse. The other great affect was sweating, I mean sweating! I have switched to lexapro, better but not great. It has been a month now and the sweating is slowly getting better. If you need a vacation in hell this is the drug for you.

Horrible Actually made my anxiety (my MAIN problem) much, much worse. Also caused development of prostatitis type symptoms. Both anxiety and physical side effects flared up within hours of taking it. Only lasted with it for a few days as situation worsened each day.

The Good and Bad of Effexor I took 37.5 mg of Effexor XR for about 4 months.  After telling my OB/GYN about my anxiety, inability to enjoy my family more because I always had to be busy doing housework, cleaning, straightening, etc. she decided I was suffering from Post Partum depression even though my baby is 2.  In my head I disagreed.  I knew that my symptoms were more anxiety related, with a drop of depression added in from time to time.  I knew that I had alway been like this but at 37 was ready to educate myself and do something about it.  I took the prescription and started taking once a day as prescribed.  I was eager for relief.Ridiculous as it sounds, I started feeling better right away.  For the first time in years I actually sat down when I came home from work.  I watched t.v., watched movies, didn't stress about what needed to be done and had a sense of calm.  My husband noticed right away too.  So yes, I do think it works.  Another huge bonus is that I was able to go to sleep easier at night.  Previously I would sleep facing the door and hall watching the door to my baby's room.  I've always had a fear that someone would come get us. Now...the ugly side of Effexor and what the dr. doesn't tell you.I think I had just about every side effect listed.  The most annoying was eye twitching and worm like feeling on the inside corner of my eyes.  I had boughts of feeling nauseous, yawning, and headaches. I experienced the brain zaps that I had read about on many websites.  In the mornings on days I wanted to sleep in, the brain zaps would start up, waking me before I was ready to get out of bed.The first week or two I had total loss of appetite which was a bonus!  But that quickly went away. I ended up gaining weight in the 3 months.  This was reason enough to get of the medication as I had worked so hard to get from a size 10 to a size 6 after having a baby!  The eye twitching lasted for at least 2 months and then happened occasionally.  Sex drive D

Effexor XR I took 225 mg..  I had good success with this anti-d when combined with others.  I had tried so many, too!The one thing I don't like is the discontinuation syndrome.  I can get pretty sick by missing just two doses, and I'm now down to a lower dose.Overall, I like being on it.  It has worked well for me.

Effexor is heaven and hell in one pill I took Effexor XR (225mg) once a day for about six months with great success.  I finally pulled out of major depression for about 5 months, only to have Effexor &quot;poop out&quot; on me.  Unfortunately, the transition of was not as easy as the manufacturer would like you to believe.  I carefully tapered for almost 2 months from 225mg/day to 37.5/two days accompanied by constant headache (worsened every day around 3), nausea, fatigue, and generally feeling like crap.  However, after reaching the lowest dosage I began to have serious OCD/anxiety issues that were not helped by the 450 mg of Wellbutrin XR that I was taking for depression.  So I continued on 75mg/day of Effexor XR for about 5 months before deciding that I wanted off for good.  After another two months of going from 75mg to 37.5mg to nothing I am finally Effexor free!  While I can't forget how much it helped me, I can't excuse the HORRIBLE withdrawal syndrome.  On a side note, my ease of use number is lower because if you miss ONE DOSE or take it more than 4 or 5 hours late, YOU WILL KNOW.  Look forward to flu-like symptoms combined with intense depression: achiness, violent shaking, crippling headache, crying, etc.  I wouldn't recommend taking this if you EVER have a problem remembering your meds.

Has helped somewhat with fatigue I've been taking effexor for 5 years for fatigue.  It allows me to function at 75%, whereas before I was almost bedridden.  Slight sexual disfunction. I originally took 400 mg/day. One year ago I went down to 2, 50mg pills per day. At this dose the 50 mg. only lasted 6 hrs before tiredness crashed in. I went off cold turkey last week in hope of finding something that worked better and hopefully wasn't such a strong chemical.  It was dizziness, nausia, vertigo, headaches for a complete week...I do not recommend this method of quitting.

Effexor - WOW! This works for me! I have been seeing psychiatrist for 7 years for chronic mild depression (dysthymia) and anxiety. I have struggled w/ a pessimistic outlook since I was young (I am now 38).  I was usually always tired, cranky and obsessive.  I could never get enough sleep or I'd get too much.  I think this was caused because I was a restless sleeper.  I also had a lot of problem falling asleep.I tried as I remember (over the 7 years) Prozac, Paxil, Wellebutin, Zoloft and a few more (forget names).  I can't be completely sure the others didn't work as I could never get in a routine of taking them.  A few had very bad side-effects (dizziness, dry mouth, etc).So, after not taking meds for a year I decided I needed to do something so I am trying effexor.I can NOT believe the difference.  In the last 2 weeks I have been getting about 5 hours sleep a night.  That being said I feel AWESOME.  I usually wake up at 3:30.  I then try to go back to sleep but have yet been able to (I have always had this issue).  So I usually get up at 4:00.  It's hard to explain but during the rest of the day I may feel tired but I am extremely functional and in a great mood.  Before effexor if I got up tired (even after 7 or 8 hours sleep) I was a monster.  I would fight a tired, dead feeling ALL day.I have read all the messages on effexor and I dont see anyone that has mentioned needing significantly less sleep.  I am not sure but I figure its one of two reasons why: a) I sleep much better because of the drug, so the 5 hours of sleep feels like 8. b) I sleep much better during the night because my anxiety level is so much lower during the day.I do sometimes have weird strange dreams for sure, no doubt about that.  I will be seeing my doctor next Monday and will talk to him about my results.My biggest fear is things start to taper off and the effexor loses its effect on me.I cant overstate how much better I feel.  It is like a new lease on life. I

effexor I did not like effexor at all.  I stayed sick at my stomach all the time.  I don't feel that it helped much with my depression either.  What ever you do DON'T stop taking it cold turkey.

Want off I was switched from luvox to efexor xr. I had to have a 4 day washout period. That was hell on earth. Now I have done heaps of research and have found that efexor is apparently the worst one to come off. I have been on anti depressants for almost 2 years now and I think it's time to come off them. I'm really worried about coming off this drug

Effexor XR I was given Effexor XR after a few months on Effexor. I noticed no difference. In fact. neither worked comparable to a lower dose of Prozac.

XR  I too, thought that this was a wonderful drug for me. It helped with the depression for a few mths. Then, nothing. I lost weight on Effexor though. I loved that , although , the opposite would have been much better for me. I am anorexic. I stopped taking this cold turkey ,after being on it sev years. It was  horrible. I had very harsh nightmares. I was freezing one min.burning up,sweating , the next.Vomiting,shaking,weak as can be. This lasted 14 days-honestly. My doctor was very upset. Please don't just stop this drug. It is a very bad idea-truly.

terrible poison! 3 days on this were enough! no sex drive, no sleep, no nothing. side effects too strong, felt very unpleasent, like &quot;transmitted&quot;, but actually i can't rate the  effectiveness, as i did stop it. for those who need an energy buzz, this one might be a choice, but i hated it. now i'm on luvox and its amazingly &quot;huge&quot;, without making me tired or sleepy!!

Effexor made me a lunatic Yes, it did &quot;rocket&quot; me out of depression, as my doctor promised. But even as I started to come in each week to report symptoms of mania, his only response was to increase the drug, which I took in combination with Remeron and Klonopin for anxiety attacks. I finally was thinking that I had been misdiagnosed, and was actually bipolar. Now I think it was the Effexor. I had a period of very wreckless behavior that freaked out everyone close to me. This included promiscuity, binge drinking, talking crazy, fighting, etc. This are behaviors I had not engaged in for many years. In the month I was on Effexor, they rapidly came back. Had I known that behavior was affected by this drug I could have been aware and noticed that I was out of control.

very effective for major depression &amp; anxiety I have derived great benefit from this medication. Although it's relatively expensive and has a notably unpleasant withdrawal, it works better to cut through the combination of anxiety and depression than any other medication I've tried. I'm probably going to have to take medication for depression and anxiety for the rest of my life, and effexor's eficacy and relative lack of side effects has been powerfully helpful to me. I consider that withdrawal difficulty is less significant to me than the fact that effexor finally resolved a deep depression that two better than two years to fully recover from.

Effexor I had been on Lexapro for a month or so and was having good results but not liking the sweating and yawning so my doctor said I could try Effexor and see if I had any better results.  I did not.  Effexor made me jumpy and nervous and I did not like it.  I went back to Lexapro very quickly and soon the few side effects that I had with that subsided and I have had a long term successful (so far) experience with Lexapro.  The sedative effect of the Lexapro is definitely better for my type of GAD Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

Works pretty good for me on depression It has worked pretty well for me on my depression, and have more energy, but sometimes no motivation to do anything, but once I get started I can get a lot accomplished.  I feel much better overall.  Feel much less irritability or misplaced anger, don't usually have any extreme emotions.  Makes me feel quite steady.  But have experienced quite a bit of dizzyness, getting on it or if I miss a dose.  No problems with Nausea.  No significant sexual side effects for me on this drug, unlike my experience with Lexapro &amp; Wellbutrin which left me feeling like my sexual side was in the dead zone.  Overall I think it has been pretty helpful.

Hard to rate Hard to rate the AD effect of this drug due to life changes throughout the period I was taking it, eg. job, house move.Side fx were big drop in sex driveoccasional night sweatsvivid and unpleasant dreams (or was it just the drug enabling me to remember dreams that were already there?)Definitely worked as a decent AD for some time but the effects may have worn off.Hard to come off this drug, I made a few attempts but went back on due to difficulties. Best to wean off very slowly.I wouldn't go back on it due to the loss of sex drive.

Suicidal Impulses higher at higher dosages Was on 75mg once a day for about 6 months, doctor increased the dosage slowly right up to 300 mg a day over another 4 months.  The higher the dosage, the more suicidal I became.  I found overall that it didn't really help me.  Still had problems sleeping, still had overall depression, feelings of unhappiness.  Overall I found the dual action class of antidepressants to not help me at all.

Effexor XR No More I was on Effexor from the beginning of May 2004 until Wednesday August 24, 2005.  And I want to emphasize that my last dose of 37.5 mg/day was that of five days ago. I am still having the effects of the withdrawals and it is miserable.I decided to discontinue my use of Effexor XR because after careful consideration, I realized it didn't help some of my co-disorders which effect my BPD. I struggle with Bulimia (and have for the last 14 years), anxiety, ADD, depression, and self mutilation (including, but not limited to my bulimia).  2 months after I began Effexor XR, was the first time I cut myself with intention to release emotional pain. I had alcohol in my system, (which by the way should be used very rarely or not all while taking the drug...it intensifies the effects of the alcohol and causes severe altered perceptions/impulsiveness). I raised my dose from 75mg/day to 150mg/day following the cutting episode. I was able function fairly regularly, but began a slow weight gain over a year, which lead to massive anxiety, increased binge/purge occurrences, and depression. I again found myself cutting (100% without any alcohol additives), so increased my dosage one last time to 225mg/day. At this dosage I kept gaining weight, spent LOTS of money on medication (2 scripts, one of 75mg/day and one of 150mg/day), and continual bulimic behaviors.After careful consideration, I realized that the effexor xr had a placebo effect in the beginning as do most meds for BPD, only to find that this was definitely the wrong medication. I am looking for new options, but feel that I may run into a dead end...

Maybe not?!!! Well, I don't think any antidepressant should be prescribed for bipolar, and I think this ones side effect profile and discontinuation syndrome rank it as one of the worst offenders in those regards!If you can tolerate Lamictal........try it and save yourself some time. I ran the full gammut of SSRI's and Trycyclic's before I broke the cycle. The best an antidepressant can do is attempt to &quot;curb&quot; the depression phase but at a cost, the cost being a speeding up of the cycle.I think if you take antidepressants when you are bipolar it is somewhat like trying to run you car engine at full throttle and you go faster for awhile, run out of gas, and then wait for the tank to get filled again. Sorry for the odd metaphor.Take care,

Couple yrs of Effexor Increased strength over a period of time to seek optimal benefit.  Didn't seem to help with increased energy or reduction of sleepiness.  May have helped to reduce pain, anxiety, depression.  Currently tapering off towards quitting.  Down to 50mg each morning.  I wish to see if low dosage and cessation will have any adverse effects or loss of benefit.

Effexor is Dangerous I've been on a low dosage, 75mg for 3 years, this drug works, but will leave you dependent for life. I have tried to decrease to 37.5 in summer (less SAD), and got sick: extreme nausea, headaches, suicidal, couldn't stop crying. Stay at the lowest level you can or find another drug. Long term effects to me are heart murmur, eyesight damage, weight gain, insomnia, inability to orgasm, lack of interest in sex. The withdrawal is an absolute horror. Get a pyschopharmacologist to help wean you off. This is a very dangerous drug.

Sleep Paralysis, Zaps Coming off it was HORRIBLE I was on Effexor 150mg for about a year and if I missed one single dose I would have &quot;Sleep Paralysis&quot; where I would cognitively be awake but physically could not move.  In my mind I would be shouting for my husband to wake me up but of course nothing was verbally coming out.  It got to the point that I was afraid to go to sleep.  Coming off of it, the first month was HELL I had constant nightmares which the contents where everything that I have always been the most anxious about.. it was almost like the drug was playing upon my worst fears.  I personally would never recommend it but if your on it and it works well SUPER just be careful if you ever have to come off of it!!!

It got to the point that I was afraid to go to sleep.  Coming off of it, the first month was HELL I had constant nightmares which the contents where everything that I have always been the most anxious about.. it was almost like the drug was playing upon my worst fears.  I personally would never recommend it but if your on it and it works well SUPER just be careful if you ever have to come off of it!!!

Tempermental Treatment I've been using Effexor since April 2003.  Diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder in February 2004.  Initially, my primary care Dr. used it to treat me for depression and when I suggestion seeing a Psyche Doc, the Psyche Doc has been upping the dosage since and may eventually get me up to 300mg.  Currently, I am taking 225mg in the morning.Over The New Year Holiday I went camping and forgot to take the medication with me - big mistake.  Got withdrawals of headache, dizziness, nauseau, and severe depression.  Had to cut the trip short.  When I got home, I took my med and within about a half hour I was better.  Don't forget to take your meds.This medication is very expensive if you don't have insurance.  Works out to about $4.22/per 150mg pill without the insurance.  There is no generic version available yet.Update 7/8/04 - saw the P-Doc last night.  We've decided the Effexor isn't being 100% effective so we're adding 150mg of Wellbutrin to the mix.  No additional side effects but still suffering from depression at 225mg.Update 11/9/04 - still taking the Effexor as a cocktail with other drugs.  Seems to be effective without side effects except slight weight gain though when you are taking a cocktail of drugs - it's tough to tell which drug is causing issues.Update 8/17/04 - worked with my P-doc to get off this medication.  Horrid, Horrid experience.  We tapered down slowly then it took me about a week or two to rid the side effects.  Side effects included frequent crying, inability to deal with life's quirks, and anxiety.  I wouldn't

helps, but side effects Effexor has been prescribed to me several times. I've gone on and off (not fun) but I always find myself needing something to help me with my &quot;brain fog&quot;. Effexor helps that, but it also makes me sweat, gain weight, and very fatigued. Anything above 75 mg. daily makes my brain go in the opposite direction. Low dose is my only hope for some comprehension and retention of things I have read or listened to. I'm thinking there must be something better out there for me but I've tried all the others and their side effects are worse!  I've been searching for the right remedy for 11 years..

great medication, but some weight gain I have been on effexor for about 2 and a half years.  I have OCD and some depression as a result.  The medicine is outstanding in treating these conditions.  It literally made every symptom go away and the good thing about it is that I still have a high level of energy on it and also don't feel &quot;numb.&quot;  I was on prozac and I tried zoloft and paxil.  Of those three, Prozac was the best but they all made me feel spaced out and unable to do my job/etc. On prozac I slept all day.  The one thing about effexor is the weight gain.  I was always a very very thin person.  I exercise a lot, I'm a runner, etc. but yet slowly I've gained 15 lbs on effexor.  Not a lot but enough to make me dislike it.  Update.  Effexor is still the #1 medication in my opinion .  I haven't tried the new one, Cymbalta.  I did start complaining again a month ago however about the weight gain with effexor.  So my dr. and I tapered me off (yes the withdrawal is tough but worth it if you ask me because it works so well).  My dr. now has me trying Geodon.  Has anyone heard of using this drug for OCD?  It is a medicine typically used for schizofrenia and it is very strong.  I've been on it a week, on the lowest dose, and I feel very strange on it though not numb, just a little too energetic or something.  He said it affects seretonin so it can help OCD as an off-label use and it has no weight gain.  I have to say that since stopping effexor a month ago and starting this one, I've lost five pounds.  I really like effexor and recommend that you try it for a while - give it a few months (because I did feel tired from it the first week or two and then that went away).  Don't let the weight gain deter you because you might not gain.  I will report back on the use of Geodon for OCD but if the side effects don't subside, I might not last very long on it.  I'm going to give it a month.Update: Back on effexor.  Nothing else works as well for me with as f

Effexor XR I've been on Effexor XR for 6 years or so (in conjuction with other medications).  With insurance, it cost me $25/month (the highest co-pay possible), and without insurance it costs me over $200/month.  It seems to be a good drug, unless you forget to take it.  Even with the extended release, I go into withdrawal after about 24 hours.  Dizzy, nausous, light-headed, giddy, sad, hysterical, headache....  It comes and goes until I remember to take it.  I once ran out and was without it for 3 days and I was miserable.  I wasn't able to go pick up my medicine--I had to send someone to get it for me.  Of course, I also get those same symptoms after about 24 hours, they just intensify the longer I'm without it.  So, overall, I'd say it's a good drug, IF you are going to stay on it literally for the rest of your life.  Are you ready for that?

Horrible withdrawal symptoms my md switched me from Serzone (which I had taken for many years with no side effects) to Effexor due to &quot;alerts&quot; concerning possible long-term liver damage with Serzone (even though tests showed my liver function to be fine). When I changed jobs &amp; lost insurance coverage, I was shocked to discover the cost of a 30-day supply to be $150 &amp; couldn't afford to pay this, so began to try to wean myself off. What a nightmare! Dizziness, insomnia, feeling totally disconnected from my body, ringing in my ears and other auditory hallucinations, etc. If you know you can afford this med &amp; plan to stay on it, I suppose it's fine, but I wouldn't recommend it as a first-time treatment.

Effexor...Beware Let my start of by saying DO NOT CONSIDER USING THIS DRUG FOR SHORT TERM....it is highly addictive and once you start it is very difficult to discontinue.  This is my 4th time on the drug...the last time was three years ago after my brother was killed in an MVA...I was at 150mg and weaned down over a 9 month period for a total of two years on the drug...I have never been so sick in all my life...and I didn't know that what was causing my illness (similar to a mysterious illness had a few years previously) was caused by discontinuation until I started research about 6 months ago.  The only reason I am going back on it now is that after one year of being off the drug...my withdrawal symptoms have not subsided and my metabolism is so out of whack that I cannot put on weight no matter what I try( I am currently about 15-20 lbs UNDER weight).Effexor worked for my depression and my mysterious illness(now I realize was Effexor withdrawal for the FIRST time) that I had BEFORE the accident suspiciously disappeared a few months after restarting the drug and I put on some weight...so after doing a lot of research this time around and discovering that my body has become irreversably dependent on this drug and the last resort to feeling normal and putting back the weight is to try a maintenance dose of this drug...has only been 5 days and the only side effect is insomnia, which I never experienced after the first week before so I am confident that will pass.  I will update...BUT PLEASE....TAKE MY WARNING...DO NOT TRY THIS UNLESS IT IS A LAST RESORT...OR YOU MAY BECOME DEPENDENT ON IT LIKE ME!!

Just like the rest The drug keeps me from wanting to kill myself, usually.  But it relieves very little of the depression.I don't believe any drug can stop the nightmares/flashbacks.And like every other anti-depressant I have tried, the sexual side effects are even more depressing.

Withdrawing from 375mg per day After being on Effexor for years, we decided to lower my doses. I had brain zaps, dizziness, sadness, lack of energy, the whole range of depression symptoms as I went from 375mg per day to 150mg per day in a month. I am tired of fighting through the side affects of withdrawal so will stay at 150mg per day. For now. Any medicine that can cause so many side effects as you go in it and then the same set of side effects as you go off of it can not be a good medicine. Yes, it helped me get through my depression, and I would increase the dose if I fell back into the black pit again. But sometimes I wonder if I am better because of the medicine or am better because I now have the tools to deal handle the depression. I have added exercise and healthy eating to my life style. I hope by reducing the Effexor, I will start to lose the many many pounds I have put on since I have been on the Effexor. And I detest anyone who thinks depression can be &quot;snapped out of&quot;. This is a real medical illness that needs proper treatment to get well.

Effexor saved my life, then made me manic effexor was my first antidepressant and pulled me out of psychotic depression.  true n the 1st day using it, i was REALLY psychotic, it went away.  and it is powerful.  and there was a bit of a speedy high for the year when i took it.  i only stopped it after a mini-breakdown from mania.  i don't even remember much about it, but i remember my shrink starting the lithium and pulling me down to 20 mg of prozac.  i guess it has been 8 years sincce then and my body is tolerating the lithium very well but my sex life is sometimes awkward from the prozac.

only thing that works I've tried many different drugs for depression (old and new) and many combos.  Effexor is the only thing that really helps my depression.  (That and therapy) I'm currently on only one tab a day but have been on as many as five.  Another good thing about it is it doesnt cause any side effects for me other than slight light headedness if I forget to take it.

Terrible initial side effects - Beware I tried it for 4 days and it was a terrible experience. I suffer from anxiety. I took effexor and my anxiety tripled. I couldn't sleep, my heart felt like it was doing flip flops, I couldn't concentrate AT ALL. I was afraid to drive. I felt as if I haden't slept in a week. I quit taking it and after only a week of use I had withdrawal. I have switched to Lexapro and so far it is great!!!

Worked well, but... Had been on 225mg/day, worked very well but then a bombshell....health report in UK connects Venlafaxine with irregular heart patterns.Thus, I had to come off, did so in just two weeks. (Weaning period was my choice)  Now, after 6 weeks without, placed on Escitalopram....hope I improve.

I want more SECOND UPDATE! JULY 27, 2005I am now completely weaned off this drug. Using the carefully thought out weaning schedule devised by my psychiatrist, I had not one side effect, never felt like I was withdrawing from ANYTHING, and went through the schedule like a breeze.So the key to getting off a medication that you've been on for years and years is requesting that your prescribing doctor make up a schedule that gradually reduces your doses. Follow it!UPDATE: 6/05Upon seeing my longterm psychiatrist I &quot;put my foot down&quot; and said &quot;I'm not taking this (Effexor XR) any more.&quot; He thought I'd already quit but I told him I wanted a schedule of how to wean off without horrible side effects. He actually gave me one!I told him about two articles I'd recently read (on this website, curiously enough): one was on Lamictal for treatment of treatment-resistant depression, the other was on the use of Cymbalta for treatment-resistant depression. He chose to start me on Lamictal. I started weaning off immediately. I now have about 2 weeks until I'm off completely. I've had ZERO side effects from going down and then off.I know this belongs on the WITHDRAWAL FROM ANTIDEPRESSANTS board, but I don't remember what &quot;schedule&quot; of weaning my doctor put me on!

Effexor XR and Blood Pressure I started on Effexor XR 150 mg about six weeks ago.  I also take Remeron 60 mg (evening) and Klonopin 2 mg (twice a day).  Effexor has had a strong &amp; positive effect on my mood, bringing me out of a &gt;1 yr long period of moderate to severe depression.  (I've been taking antidepressants for over ten years, with many ups and downs).  I and my doctor have noticed a marked increase in my blood pressure since I started Effexor.  It has climbed from an average of 120/70 to as high as 160/100 in six weeks since I started it.I'm also experiencing some minor manic episodes, increased heart rate, and have noticed occasionally that my pupils appear to be dilated.  The manic episodes have included increased use and tolerance to alcohol (up to five drinks per day, from three per day before starting), vivid dreams, and minor aural hallcinations. I wonder if anyone has had a similar reaction to Effexor?  I'm especially interested to learn more about people who have experience with Remeron + SSRIs, and, even more so, those who have been taking Benzodiazapines long term (years).Many Thanks, and All Best.

Effexor was a nightmare My doctor recently (within the last three weeks) switched me from Zoloft to Effexor.  He warned me that there would be a &quot;down period&quot; when trying to switch medications.  The Effexor took me from being mildly depressed and obsessive to feeling bipolar and suicidal.  These were not symptoms I had at my baseline before I started the Zoloft.  It certainly hasn't helped that my doctor has only devoted a total of 5 minutes to the issue.  I finally decided to go off of it myself after having accidentally missed a pill and feeling much better the same day.  By the end of that first day off, I started just feeling fuzzy.  I was just kind of numb and having a hard time thinking.  This was a much better symptom than wanting to die and feeling like I was having a nervous breakdown on the Effexor.  By the next day, I was feeling a spinning dizziness, almost passed out several times, and was extremely nauseated.  I finally called by OB/GYN and talked to his nurse, who told me how to more effectively wean off of the Effexor.  This has been really frustrating for me, to be put on a medication that is so hard to get off of with absolutely no warning about this from my doctor.  This is only the third antidepressant that I have tried, and think this should've been held out on.

No better than the SSRIs After sixteen weeks on this I haven't seem much improvement.  It has helped me in ways the other meds I have taken have. Which is nothing close to remission.  I have found most of meds so far (see ratings) have just taken the edge off and don't let me reach a point of total worthlessness.  Effexor maybe the worst for sexual side effects, but all the SSRIs have been bad on that count.  I had some chest pain each time I upped the dose and it seems I have the same SE as I am withdrawing.  I'm down to 75mg a day now and am fortunate not to have any of the bad withdrawal symtoms I have read about.  In a few days I'll start Prozac.  I'm hoping the energizing qualities of prozac will be helpful.  Currently my depressive symptoms include lethargy, anhedonia, and cognitive slowing.  Good luck all.r

Effexor was poison for me Effexor was the first antidepressant I was put on a few years ago for bipolar II.  It was a nitemare.  Effexor effects I got: worsened anxiety, jitteriness, EPS side effects, irritability, visual distortion, auditory distortions, paranoia, radical insomnia, panic attacks, tremors, nitemares, constipation, racing heart, elevated blood pressure (at age 22!), loss of manhood and hypomania.  There may be other side effects I just forgot about...  And when I quit, I had a horrible withdrawal reaction.  Just the worst med I have tried in my entire life.  I now take Celexa with my Depakote and Seroquel and feel great.

Effexor XR is a great medication so far! Being a long-time panic sufferer, I've tried different meds looking for relief, including Lexapro.  After a while, I couldn't stand the sleepiness and general 'drugged' feeling I got from the Lex.  I went med-free for about a year, and then started getting very frequent, intense panic attacks.  My doctor put me on Effexor XR, and the first week was hellish. Bad panic and sleeplessness. HOWEVER, after being on it for two weeks, I saw improvemenet.  After a month, I was feeling better than I have in a long time. No panic for several weeks, and an overall feeling of well-being.  No side effects other than a slight decrease in sexual feeling.  I'll take that any day over anxiety, let me tell you.  Overall, this medication has been a god-send for me.  I'm even driving with confidence now.  Good stuff!!!!

Effexor xr I have been on Effexor XR for 5 years.  I stopped using this medicine when I became pregnant with my son.  I immediatley went back on it and except for some withdrawl symptoms I have had no problems with this medication.  I am only now having some symptoms of my bi polar but will not come off this medication because of how well it has worked for me.  I even recommended it to my brother when he was going through a depression because if the med worked for me a family member is likely to benefit as well.  He was on a low dose but had success.  Effexor is a life and marrage saver for me.

Effexor  Effect of: Tried Effexor for a year, but not much luck, in fact became more depressed and ended up with a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot; and in hospital for two days after Effexor and Zoloft  (on each one for about one year).  Am on Desyrel right now with Gabapentin,and multi vit/min's.  Seems okay. But still go up and down - mainly down.  It has been a long, long time since I have laughed.  Also have fibromyalgia and broke both my feet and crushed lower spine (L3,4,5, S1,2,) in accidents and experience quite a bit of pain (often made worse by walking!) Bipolar (hypo manic and mostlydeep depression.  Today is a fairly good day.

Effexor OK, but for how much longer? My gyn. diagnosed me with PMDD last year, and wanted to put me on SSRIs 1-2 weeks per month before my period. I had no medical insurance and a friend said he could get me a big supply of Effexor. It was really hard to start the Effexor because for me the side effects were nausea, loss of appetite, and a dizziness/disoriented feeling. Now I know to take a half (37.5mg) dose and ramp-up to whatever I need. It works great on the PMDD, but there is a sexual side-effect of it being really difficult to achieve orgasm. And once I forgot to take an Effexor in the morning and took it in the afternoon--DO NOT TRY THIS. My brain would not shut off at night and I could not go to sleep or make my brain stop thinking at 90 mph; I thought I would go nuts! But I was happy for months with Effexor as a PMDD treatment. Now, however, the 75mg dose is less effective and I am having to take more to get the job done. I am wondering how long I can last using the Effexor before it just loses its effect entirely.

Very effective when on it; a nightmare to get off! Effexor was wonderful in treatment, I was able to feel &quot;normal&quot; and function well as long as I made sure to take it on schedule.  However, getting off it (after being on it several years) has been a bear!    I have that vertigo, brain shock, nightmares, etc. I cannot believe that the dr didn't tell me that going from 37.5 to nothing is pretty much impossible,yet that's exsactly what her taper schedule is!  THERE IS NO WAY! I wanted to get pregant this summer but now that looks impossible!    Not only is this a class c drug, there is NO telling what it could do to a developing fetus when it makes me and countless others feel this horrible to get off!

Effexor 75 mg. Effexor has had a wonderful affect on me.  I suffer from anxiety and moderate mood swings.  I have found that I am able to concentrate better and have a better outlook which has made me happier.  It works wonders for my sister as well.  I was informed by my doctor that if it works well for one family member, it will probably work very well for another.

Just don't do it! I've taken as much as 225 mg of Effexor a day, and I took that for a long time. It was what a psychiatrist prescribed after zoloft quit working. It gradually pushed me towards hypomania until I was having outbreaks of rage at work and at home. AHA she is not depressive, she is bipolar. New psych realized that Effexor was bad news in this case and tried to wean me off -- with horrible physical and psychological side effects. We've gotten me down to 75 mg a day, and next week we discuss changing my &quot;cocktail&quot; so I can get off it for good. The docs won't tell you that this is the hardest antidepressant to discontinue. Go VERY slowly and be prepared for dizziness, anxiety, crying jags, tremors.... Not a pretty sight. Wish me luck. Next week is my third try at getting this stuff out of my life.
effexor	Bipolar II disorder	2005-06-24 00:00:00		4.0	0.5	4.5	3.0	Just don't do it! I've taken as much as 225 mg of Effexor a day, and I took that for a long time. It was what a psychiatrist prescribed after zoloft quit working. It gradually pushed me towards hypomania until I was having outbreaks of rage at work and at home. AHA she is not depressive, she is bipolar. New psych realized that Effexor was bad news in this case and tried to wean me off -- with horrible physical and psychological side effects. We've gotten me down to 75 mg a day, and next week we discuss changing my &quot;cocktail&quot; so I can get off it for good.

effexor &amp; borderline personality disorder I have been taking 300mg of effexor for a few months now.  It seems to work well with lamictal for my depression and suicidal thoughts.  However, I missed my doses for 2 days because I forgot to take them on a trip and the withdraw was horrible.  It felt like someone was &quot;shocking&quot; my brain.  So don't miss any doses!!  By the way i'm 23 years old and have been on several medications and this one seems to work the best.

Helps with anxiety Effexor is good for treating my anxiety but I hate the side effects. Particuraly at night. When asleep I have terrible dreams.  It also has diminished my sex drive

Effexor XR I took EffexorXR a few years ago for general anxiety.  I eventually weaned myself off of it and had HORRID withdrawal effects for about 4 months.  However, that being said, I have decided to go back on the medicine because it is effective at handling general anxiety.  It is worth all of the annoying initial side effects, as well as the possible withdrawal effects due to its effectiveness.  I have tried Prozac (which made me sexually dead), Paxil (which made me numb and had worse side effects than Effexor), herbal remedies, hypnotherapy, and more.  Effexor XR is the best anxiety treatment on the market.

Good Stability This is the only antidepresssant I have taken which doesn't seem to cause side effect of mania unless we increase the doseage over 75 mg which is sometimes necessary when I cycle into a severe depressive state. Basically, I have been more stable on this antidepressant than on any other and no weight gain from it.

Efficacy of Effexor XR This medicine has worked very well to keep my depression at bay for the last three years or so - I've been on it so long I have forgotten exactly when I started it.  I have had the dose adjusted some times during this period, but I find this dose to be most effective.  I do not feel side effects from it.

I am so happy-can't believe it's legal That is pretty much what I told my Dr..I tried other drug (prozac),but it did nothing.This worked.The side effects suck--ie.nausea if you forget to take your pill--agitation if you try to stop cold turkey.This is a drug that needs some serious thought before taking.But if you were as depressed as I was you would try taking it.

Effexor XR I originally was on 225 mg. of this.  It has helped.  My newest doc. has taken me down to 150 mg., and would like me off it.  However, he doesn't want to do it while I'm dealing with the neuropsych effects of lupusas I am at the moment.Several times when I missed a day or two of the drug, I really suffered from it.  Brain zaps, anxiety, headaches, etc.  I never let my supply get low anymore!

EFEXOR/VENLAFAXINE This medication has caused my mood swings to become much more extreme, I think, with powerful highs and constant invasive suicidal thoughts.  It's hard to reduce - even after my BP went sky high! the &quot;bounce-back&quot; depression put me on the ward in a unit - very scary!! I have no libido (am surprised I can even remember how to spell it!), I can't concentrate, my memory - long &amp; short-term is affected, etc. Very sad &amp; frustrated.

High dose? I have taken Effexor xr for 5 1/2 yrs.  It has been a wonderful drug for my treatment resistant depression.  I currently take 600 mg. in the morning.  I am afraid I am hitting the top dose and was wondering if anyone is at a higher dose and if not what they added to help the breakthrough depression.  Thank you?

Great for Fibromyalgia So-So for depression This med pretty much eliminates most of the symptoms of my fibromyalgia except neck and shoulder pain but does not do much for my depression. Although it's hard to say how bad I'd be if I didn't take it since I have been on it for years. I'm still weepy a good bit of the time. But thank God for it for those of us with Fibromyalgia. I use it along with 20mg Topamax for migraines and I'm about to try Depakote for BP after trying Lamictal, Abilify, and Geodon. P.S. Made my breast larger too. Not a bad side effect!

Effexor Stopping to Work Been taking 150mg for 6 months and after the initial mood change at the start when I felt almost euphoric it's beginning to stop working. I'm now getting back to feel the same dark way I did before I started taking it; well mentally anyway. Physically libido still gone but getting back to feeling I may burst into tears about any minor thing. Starting to feel like a ghost again where people can't see me.Anyone had similar experiences on this please get back or post where they went. I took Paxil many years ago for 6 months when my partner left and I know it's a dreadful drug but it got me over it and improved my mood to where I could take back control. I take Effexor each day now out of habit.

Should be renamed (Side Efexor)! I used Efexor XR for one year after using paroxetine and it was the worst year of my life!  The side effects from this were worse than the depression, I couldn't sleep, I was permanently jittery and anxious, lost 10kg in weight because I couldn't eat.  I lost all desire for sex and had no sexual function whatsoever.  I also became aggressive and wanted to just die on this, took 5 months to withdraw, it was just awful.  Never take this if you are offered by the doctor!  Now on mirtazapine and citalopram and doing great!

hmm After having my daughter at a very young age I became depressed and the doctor told me that I was suffering from post-partum depression. I had always known that I was depressed. I was first put on Celexa and I was up to taking 4 pills daily, then Wellbutrin and Remeron. The suicide thoughts soon went away but I was always tired almost to the point that I could not function my doctor then put me on Effexor. I have gotten up to taking 300mgs a day but am now currently taking 225mgs. I now feel that I need this pill not because it makes me feel better but because if I go more then two days without taking it I began to feel dizzy and vomit, I also begin crying for no reason at all. This was the worst withdrawal ever. I don't think it should be used for short-term  treatment because the patient will be worse off with the withdrawal then the depression its self. I only take this pill so that I do not have to go through the withdrawal it causes. Other than that its does nothing. I am always tired I have no energy. I can't think and I have began picking at my face.. All in all this pill may work wonders but it is not worth the withdrawal.

Another Drug For the past year my doc and I have been trying to find the right drug for me. I have depression and anxiety. The depression is something I have always had...sometimes it is more severe then others. I recently got off of Lexapro and Paxil (not happy with either one of these). I am at the point that if Effexor does not work...I don't want to try anything else.I started taking Effexor this morning and so far so good. I woke up and took it at 8am. I went back to sleep and has some real sexual dreams (which is fine with me). I woke up about 11am and really didn't want to sleep all day. I normally would sleep until about 1-2pm with no problem at all. I have been smiling today (which is very rare). Normally Iam very  angry (I cuss in my head and talk to myself-don't act like you don't do that sometimes). ..I feel upbeat...And the big one--I want to take a SHOWER. Listen, if I could get away with not taking one, I will. But, I have realized that it is very unhealthy for me emotionally . UPDATE: I upped my dose to 75mg--Horrible headache. I drank a cup of coffee and then I was fine. I notice some excessive sweating today...but, it could just be that it is hotter then hell in Houston. Still doing well with Effexor.I will keep you all updated as the time goes on.Thanks...TUPDATE: It is day 3 and I am very pleased with Effexor. I have been more upbeat and energetic and happy. I am now modivated to do things like taking a shower and cooking dinner. The main side effect that I noticed is a bad headache, usually at night. So I pop two tylenal and call it a night.The first day I was at the grocery store, clapping and singing...I didn't realize I was doing that. Ofcourse I stopped myself, because people would think I was crazy (HA,HA,HA). I was shocked that I was happy and singing. I used to do that when I was younger and happy-I hadn't done that in a long time. I will keep you updated and I hope this gives somebody hope. I have been looking for

I have no spirit any more I just want to sleep all the time, I haven't been out of the house 100 times in last 3 years, so what do you think? should I change??

Great for Fibromyalgia So-So for depression This med pretty much eliminates most of the symptoms of my fibromyalgia except neck and shoulder pain but does not do much for my depression. Although it's hard to say how bad I'd be if I didn't take it since I have been on it for years. I'm still weepy a good bit of the time. But thank God for it for those of us with Fibromyalgia. I use it along with 20mg Topamax for migraines and I'm about to try Depakote for BP after trying Lamictal, Abilify, and Geodon. P.S. Made my breast larger too. Not a bad side effect!

Effexor Stopping to Work Been taking 150mg for 6 months and after the initial mood change at the start when I felt almost euphoric it's beginning to stop working. I'm now getting back to feel the same dark way I did before I started taking it; well mentally anyway. Physically libido still gone but getting back to feeling I may burst into tears about any minor thing. Starting to feel like a ghost again where people can't see me.Anyone had similar experiences on this please get back or post where they went. I took Paxil many years ago for 6 months when my partner left and I know it's a dreadful drug but it got me over it and improved my mood to where I could take back control. I take Effexor each day now out of habit.

Should be renamed (Side Efexor)! I used Efexor XR for one year after using paroxetine and it was the worst year of my life!  The side effects from this were worse than the depression, I couldn't sleep, I was permanently jittery and anxious, lost 10kg in weight because I couldn't eat.  I lost all desire for sex and had no sexual function whatsoever.  I also became aggressive and wanted to just die on this, took 5 months to withdraw, it was just awful.  Never take this if you are offered by the doctor!  Now on mirtazapine and citalopram and doing great!

hmm After having my daughter at a very young age I became depressed and the doctor told me that I was suffering from post-partum depression. I had always known that I was depressed. I was first put on Celexa and I was up to taking 4 pills daily, then Wellbutrin and Remeron. The suicide thoughts soon went away but I was always tired almost to the point that I could not function my doctor then put me on Effexor. I have gotten up to taking 300mgs a day but am now currently taking 225mgs. I now feel that I need this pill not because it makes me feel better but because if I go more then two days without taking it I began to feel dizzy and vomit, I also begin crying for no reason at all. This was the worst withdrawal ever. I don't think it should be used for short-term  treatment because the patient will be worse off with the withdrawal then the depression its self. I only take this pill so that I do not have to go through the withdrawal it causes. Other than that its does nothing. I am always tired I have no energy. I can't think and I have began picking at my face.. All in all this pill may work wonders but it is not worth the withdrawal.

Another Drug For the past year my doc and I have been trying to find the right drug for me. I have depression and anxiety. The depression is something I have always had...sometimes it is more severe then others. I recently got off of Lexapro and Paxil (not happy with either one of these). I am at the point that if Effexor does not work...I don't want to try anything else.I started taking Effexor this morning and so far so good. I woke up and took it at 8am. I went back to sleep and has some real sexual dreams (which is fine with me). I woke up about 11am and really didn't want to sleep all day. I normally would sleep until about 1-2pm with no problem at all. I have been smiling today (which is very rare). Normally Iam very  angry (I cuss in my head and talk to myself-don't act like you don't do that sometimes). ..I feel upbeat...And the big one--I want to take a SHOWER. Listen, if I could get away with not taking one, I will. But, I have realized that it is very unhealthy for me emotionally . UPDATE: I upped my dose to 75mg--Horrible headache. I drank a cup of coffee and then I was fine. I notice some excessive sweating today...but, it could just be that it is hotter then hell in Houston. Still doing well with Effexor.I will keep you all updated as the time goes on.Thanks...TUPDATE: It is day 3 and I am very pleased with Effexor. I have been more upbeat and energetic and happy. I am now modivated to do things like taking a shower and cooking dinner. The main side effect that I noticed is a bad headache, usually at night. So I pop two tylenal and call it a night.The first day I was at the grocery store, clapping and singing...I didn't realize I was doing that. Ofcourse I stopped myself, because people would think I was crazy (HA,HA,HA). I was shocked that I was happy and singing. I used to do that when I was younger and happy-I hadn't done that in a long time. I will keep you updated and I hope this gives somebody hope. I have been looking for

still depressed I have taken Effexor xr 75mg for several months I feel a little less depressed, but I think I could do alot better on something else honestly,I feel like a zombie most of the time  I can't tell if it's because of the CFS/FMS or just depression. I have no spirit any more I just want to sleep all the time, I haven't been out of the house 100 times in last 3 years, so what do you think? should I change?? My pain specialist doesn't seem very helpful or isn't taking me serious enough. I am so tired of just existing &amp; not living, nothing sparks my interest any more.

Effexor XR I found Effexor to be quite able to reduce depression/anxiety symptoms, however it is almost impossible to discontinue.  It has quite servere withdrawal symptoms.  I feel sick to my stomach, headache, dizzy, by just reducing the dose slightly!

Effexor I had the worst experience of my life with Effexor. I was on 37.5mg for about 4 days and had some serious side effects. To make a long story short, it incapacitated me completely. I started hallucinating and when the walls started to melt, I stopped it. My doctor could not understand why I had that reaction, but I would not recommend Effexor to anyone.

Side Effects I was taking 225 mg per day and it did help with the depression... however, I experienced many unpleasant side effects, especially when weening (which I did under close watch by my psychiatrist).... nausea, dizziness, light-headedness, sweats, fatigue with insomnia, nightmares, vision problems, and the worst extreme stuttering. I weened much slower than the normal patient and still got sever side effects. This medication is EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE. My symptoms persisted for weeks.I would not recommend this medication to anyone sensitive to medications or side effects. I will ABSOLUTELY NOT take this medication again.

Works well at first but causes manic episodes worked very well the first few years on my depression. gave me much energy and good outlook. however anger issues became more prevelant and i was often pushed into manice episodes with anger outbursts and impuslive decisions which were risky at best. i am now trying to get off and just use seroquel. my depressive feelings have minimized since i used effexxor.  but i have become more isolated and have tremendous difficulty being around people. stress causes anger outbursts and confusion. if you are looking to get out of the depressive blues this is the most effective anti-depressent. however my bipolar manic side has become worse.

Good choice Hi. I was badly depressed for at least six years and at some periods that was cruel. Out of depression I have not fully profiled signs of narcolepsy and mainly cataplexy - borderline outcome from polysomnography. I had tried a lot of medications, and the real results brought me Effexor (Efectin in our country). After one month on this medication (and piracetam as adjuncts) with only partly effect, I underwent simultaneously full sleep deprivation and the result was sudden and great. So it seems, that the suppression of REM-periods of sleep (that the latency after getting to bed I have short,  ant the frequency excessive) turned out to be useful. Now, I am on this medication (Efectin, piracetam 5.6 g a day) for six months, and I am feeling better than any before. I have energy to live standard style of life - and that is something incredible for me.

Didn't Work After Wellbutrin alone wasn't working, Effexor XR (37.5 mg) was added to the Wellbutrin (150 mg) dose. Still nothing changed (and I was on the combo for at least three or four months). No add'l energy, no change of mood, no relief of either mental or physical symptoms, etc. The slippery capsule is not fun to take, either, as it doesn't go down into my throat easily, sticks to my tongue, and once it even got washed out of my mouth into the bottle of water I was using to wash it down with! Now that was a trick and a half.... (I am talking about this as a med for severe Major Depressive Disorder and Dysthymia. I also have severe Social Anxiety Disorder and slight Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.)

Effexor - effective Effexor seems to have done a good job bringing my general mood up. There may have been some 'over-zealousness' brought on with it that encouraged me to try to accomplish too much in my day-to-day life as a result though and feeling reasonably untroubled about life's challenges I may have tended towards complacency with regards to dealing with issues while I was on it. After 3 years or so of taking the drug I also began to notice that it didn't seem to be doing quite as a good a job as it did originally. Side effects were the biggest problem I encountered. If I missed a dose I'd feel it within a few hours. Several times I chose to drive home from work to get the stuff rather than face the day without and have to deal with the brain zaps. Round trip distance is 75 miles - just to give you a sense of how important it seemed to me at the time...

Pros and cons of Effexor When I began using Effexor, I went from being multi-orgasmic to not being able to orgasm at all. Began craving carbs early on. Gained weight. (I am female)Slowly got off of Effexor, even though it had worked for the anxiety. Very difficult to get off of. Got electric shock feelings while on final weaning off (@ less than 50%) of original dose. My internist finally referred me to a Doctor (she has been psychiatrist for 22 years), who finally gave me 3 days of Prozac while going off Effexor cold turkey. She said the Prozac stays in the system for 6 weeks so it makes it easier to get off the Effexor. It worked. I also take Wellbutrin.Am now using Buspar (15mg) instead of Effexxor (and still using Wellbutrin SR 200mg.). And have my libido and ability to orgasm back again. Anxiety is well in hand as is depression.

Side effects of effexor and general happiness. Effexor is expensive, and for me, very hard to adapt to. It has been relieving for my anxiety problems. I used to go to the ER b/c I thougth I was having a heart attack and the effexor has helped that. I still get some tightness in my chest on occassion, but I take xanax if that happens. I try to take the xanax rarely, b/c my MD said it was highly addictive. I am also tired while I'm on effexor and I have a hard time reaching orgasm. That puts a strain on my marriage b/c I am uninterested in sex. Luckily, I am married to a great guy who is understanding. I hope to get off of Effexor in about a year, but we'll see.

effexor-rise in blood pressure+withdrawel symptoms effexor caused a major rise in my blood pressure after being on this med. for a number of years.  My blood pressure returned to normal after stopping this med.  Neither the psych dr. or my internist thought my blood pressure elevation was related to effexor use.  Boy were they wrong!The withdrawal from this med. was horrible-and i did it very slowly over a 5-6 week span.  When i stopped the med. my last dose was 1/2 of 37.5 mg. for a few days.  i felt like i was in a hurricane-labile, hysterical, shaking, feeling like i was having a break down.  i added 5 mg. of lexapro and the withdrawal went away within an hr.  Took the lexapro for a couple of weeks and then went off it.  No withdrawal side effects then!

Effexor use Used Effexor XR for over one year.  It was great for relief of back pain from Fibromyalgia.  One of things I loved about Effexor was that it gave me energy.  It also took me out of my depression however it caused my first mania.  I was then diagnosised with Bi-polar type II.  I am now working with my psydr to find the best combination for me.

Helped, but watch the withdrawal I was on Effexor for 6 months - it really helped stabalize me and I had no side effects.  Then my doc decided to discontinue it to &quot;simplify my med regime.&quot;  The withdrawal was awful, and unexpected, so I really thought I was going crazy. From what I hear this is pretty common.

Another Drug For the past year my doc and I have been trying to find the right drug for me. I have depression and anxiety. The depression is something I have always had...sometimes it is more severe then others. I recently got off of Lexapro and Paxil (not happy with either one of these). I am at the point that if Effexor does not work...I don't want to try anything else.I started taking Effexor this morning and so far so good. I woke up and took it at 8am. I went back to sleep and has some real sexual dreams (which is fine with me). I woke up about 11am and really didn't want to sleep all day. I normally would sleep until about 1-2pm with no problem at all. I have been smiling today (which is very rare). Normally Iam very  angry (I cuss in my head and talk to myself-don't act like you don't do that sometimes). ..I feel upbeat...And the big one--I want to take a SHOWER. Listen, if I could get away with not taking one, I will. But, I have realized that it is very unhealthy for me emotionally . UPDATE: I upped my dose to 75mg--Horrible headache. I drank a cup of coffee and then I was fine. I notice some excessive sweating today...but, it could just be that it is hotter then hell in Houston. Still doing well with Effexor.I will keep you all updated as the time goes on.Thanks...TUPDATE: It is day 3 and I am very pleased with Effexor. I have been more upbeat and energetic and happy. I am now modivated to do things like taking a shower and cooking dinner. The main side effect that I noticed is a bad headache, usually at night. So I pop two tylenal and call it a night.The first day I was at the grocery store, clapping and singing...I didn't realize I was doing that. Ofcourse I stopped myself, because people would think I was crazy (HA,HA,HA). I was shocked that I was happy and singing. I used to do that when I was younger and happy-I hadn't done that in a long time. I will keep you updated and I hope this gives somebody hope. I have been looking for

Effexor helps depression &amp; tinnitus I have suffered with low self esteem and depression for most of my life.  I tried elavil and had hallucinations.  I tried vallium and was a zombie.  Effexor started to work its magic right away and with each passing day worked better.  I now feel like a normal person.  I still get sad now and then, but sad at things you should be sad about.  I have seen significant relief with the symptoms of my pulsatile tinnitus (heart beat noise) in my right ear.  I am noise free most of the day.  I also take clonazepam (anti-anxiety tablet) which also helps with tinnitus.  Coffee also helps pulsatile tinnitus because it opens up the arteries wider for the blood to flow through easier.  I wouldn't dream of going off either effexor or clonazepam because I now feel normal in my moods and a great many hours of relief from the noise of tinnitus.  I would suggest anyone who believes they have tinnitus to go for tests to verify that it is indeed tinnitus and if it is, ask him or her to prescribe effexor and clonazepam.  Clonazepam also helps eliminate panic attacks and it has helped my mom get rid of her restless legs syndrome, which she had been suffering with for years.

Adverse Reaction to EFFEXOR I had a very bad reaction to EFFEXOR as treatment for CFS and Generalized Anxiety.These were mood swings really explosive and depressive.  Detox procedures took almost a year, much longer than the 6 or 7 weeks of using Effexor (slow dosage then increase over 2 weeks, to full dose)I have some liver disfunction, not serious.I can only speak very negatively of my disastrous experience with this most unhelpful drug.  As if long term CFS wasn't enough to cope with, Effexor made the situation a whole lot worse.

Effexor side effects I have been taking this med for nearly two months.  It work great at first, just took a little getting used to.  I started with side effects of confused thinking, the anxety has started to returned, side effects that have started are painful facial acne, heavy brusing, broncial (lung) problems have started during the 2nd month. Have been having since the beginning over heating and sweating causing a horrible enbarrasing body smell.    I dont look forward to the withdrawals to this med as i hear they are worse.  I called my doctor and I am now in the process of withdrawal, then will start anew with another med.  My job is not tolerable to anything that interferes with business. They are not open to anyone that is not at their best.  I think I may have to look at maybe going on sdi etc.  I live by myself and have only myself to support me.  They expect the best of everyone, I dont know how this med has effected my work til my next review.

They expect the best of everyone, I dont know how this med has effected my work til my next review.

Effexor effective for depression but not bingeing I was on Effexor-XR for two years and while I never found it helped with reducing the incidence of binge eating it was quite helpful in reducing my anxiety and depression. I had to discontinue due to side effects (excessive sweating at higher doses) and as has been reported, the withdrawal period was nasty.

Effexor I have found it to be quite helpful with my energy level and depression.  I did run out at one point for 3 days and was sent into a tailspin with severe dizziness and tearfulness. Since then my doctor has increased the dosage to 75 mg twice daily and after several days on this dose I am starting to feel much better.  It's supposed to have a side effect of weight loss...wish that side effect would affect me!

You'd think I would learn...... Every 6-9 months or so, I decide that I am going to try to get off of this @#!$ medication. I am trying to do that now. As you all know, the withdrawals are atrocious! And this has been after missing one dose. I can barely stand up straight from being so dizzy, I am not able to think clearly and I am suffering from vomiting and diarrhea (I don't think that I have ever had the brain zaps). If I was able to stay home in bed, that would be the first place I would be! So, as usual, I took a trip home during my lunch break to take the Effexor again. I have been on so many different meds and was so happy when I first started taking it. It actually worked! Now I am on 300 mgs a day and I am a slave to it. I cannot miss a dose without becoming almost incapacitated. When I feel this poorly, I &quot;troll&quot; the web and read stories of other people going through this hell and at least know that I am not the only one. ARRRRGGGHHH!

Good medicine, bad side effects I was on Effexor for about a year about 6 years ago.  Right now I'm on Cymbalta, but before Cymbalta, Effexor had been the most effective for me.  For me it eventually reached a sub-therapeutic point.  This could be due to how sick I was back then, too.  There is no denying that I had bad side effects, and I tolerate medicine rather well.  I had what I called &quot;brain shivers.&quot;  I guess I could also describe it like rapid fire electric shocks in my head.  This would happen even if I was 6 hours late taking the medicine.  Also, whenever I was weaning off of it, my doctor gave me a small dose of Prozac to help with the withdrawal effects.  Everytime we went down in strength, I felt like I had the flu for a couple of days in addition to the brain shivers.  Also, while I was discontinuing it, I felt very depressed.It's good medicine if you can tolerate the side effects.  Make sure you work with your doctor if you decide to stop taking it.

Effexor XR is a winner Dysthymia on the brain; Effexor XR has returned me to normal, to myself. Possible reduction in sex drive, but I'm also reaching male menopause age. Can't they combine some testosterone with one of these drugs?

Just watch out for withdrawal affects. I was on Effexor for some time. I felt it did relieve my depression somewhat but only incompletely. It also left me feeling emotionally numb, spacey and just generally weird. When I went to get off of it, I had full blown withdrawal including , the feeling of electrical jolts in the extremeties,anxiety, flu symptoms etc. I wouldn't recommend this drug over all although I am sure it works for some people.

Dangerous side effects with no value for CFS or FM I began Effexor to increase my energy level and reduce fatigue according to my Rheumatologist.  The first dose caused irritability out of character for me.  The next day found me with uncontrolled irritabilty which I held in so as not to emotionally injure family members with words.  By the third day I felt violent and said to my husband when he came home from work &quot;I would just love to slap someone right in the face!&quot;  I discontinued the Effexor immediately, made my bedroom dark except for old black and white movies on the tv (color increased my light sensitivity) which also sooth me.  I increased my Xanax slightly (which I had permission by my doctor to do as needed) and went to bed for my family's benefit as well as my own.  By the second day of bedrest my prescribed Xanax dosage was resumed and on the third day of bedrest I had returned to &quot;normal&quot;.  I think this shows that my energy was increased however not in a productive way.  I will never take Effexor or any SSNRI again for fear of the aggressive feelings it caused.

Effexor XR I've taken effexor xr for several years.  it seems I very seldom feel depressed..I almost never cry - even when I would like to.I also took wellbutrin for a while to help bipolar..didn't like wellbutrin.  Now I take trileptal.I took Prozac for several years before effexor, prozac became ineffective.I did gain 100 lbs..who knows if most of it was due to effexor??I had gastric bypass surgery and all is well once again.

It eased a little when I started on Zispin but only went completely when I went onto Reboxetine a month later.

Absolutely the most awful pill I've ever taken I will try to remain objective about my experience with this drug, but it has truly been the worst thing I've ever put into my body.I was prescribed Effexor (evil-exor) when my Zoloft stopped working for my depression and OCD. I was in a bad state and my doctor suggested I add this drug on top of the Zoloft. I technically took 112.5mg at night (not 37.5mg 3 times a day), but this wasn't for long.The side effects were... incredible. Although Effexor (evil-exor) wasn't too bad for my weight (I gained roughly 5-10 pounds), the emotional numbing and sexual side effects were just ridiculous. It completely turned off the part of me that cares and feels passionate about things, loves, hates and just generally makes me who I am. I felt like a zombie. It was difficult to express my feelings to my significant other because it felt like I had none. I also lost interest in sex and I basically couldn't have an erection for the life of me, regardless of stimulus and situation. Effexor was also incredibly sedating. I was taking naps all the time, had a difficult time staying awake in school and just generally felt sleepy all day long.My other big problem with Effexor (evil-exor) was that, although it certainly took care of my depression, it did nothing for my OCD. Well, actually, it sort of tricked me into thinking I didn't have it anymore. I was still exhibiting a lot of the symptoms of compulsion, but my obsessive thinking was dumbed down enough for me to think it was normal.I spent a year weaning myself off of this drug. Although it wasn't the most horrible experience, I experienced bouts of rage and anger I never thought possible and at times I felt like I was just plain losing my sanity. I also had the famous zaps, albeit very mildly. And I still do, when falling asleep and waking up, even though I took my last Effexor (evil-exor) pill roughly nine weeks ago.Evil stuff. I can't honestly recommend this drug to

The Drug I Hate To Have Ever Loved Ah, effexor- the only antidepressant in a multitude of wannabes to work. Relieved my major depression, restored life to some semblance of order. Side effects sucked bad - massive pupil dililation, headache, increased heart rate,sweating. But BLAM! Just as my life returned it was cruely snatched away by the winged demons of depression. And then when life couldn't suck worse- WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS -DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THEY DON'T EXIST. If they try, punch them in the face. Really. You have my permission. Then sue effexor. HA! HA! I'm not bitter. Really.

Don't like it but it treats the biggest problem. Effexor has been the most effective medication I have used for Depression. However, on my current course, I recently tried to wean off and found it was covering up an underlying anxiety problem. About 3 weeks into dosage reduction started having severe and then violent anxiety attacks, rage and suicide ideation. Was immediately put back to 150mg daily with Diazapam. After 1 or 2 months back on Effexor the anxiety attacks have reduced from daily to every few days and rarely severe. Use Diazapam at the onset of prolonged anxiety symptoms. Side effects which have not gone away or improved after prolonged use are vivid nightmares and sexual disfunction. Withdrawal effect which occurs after one missed or late dose are severe dizziness (referred to as brain shivers by patients), nausea and insomnia.Overall, on the medication, instead of months of depressive states, I only suffer several days.

Not good in the long run Excited about starting this drug and with time (4-5 weeks) the full effect kicked in and my depression lifted with 225mg/day. Weight gain and sexual side effects were a problem after a few weeks and then it contributed to a manic episode. New pdoc has tapered me off in favor of Mirapex - feeling 100% better though getting off Effexor wasn't easy.

I completley went Berserk! When I started taking Effexor...I was having hallucinations. I had times..where I was lying there and I could here my 3 year old and 5 year old talking to me..yet..I couldn't speak to them, I was zoned out. It was the scariest thing to ever happen to me. And that's when I learned how bad side effects can be, and got off the drug.I have taken, Paxil, Wellbutrin, and Celexa..and none of them..gave me this kind of a reaction.I do have some friends that have Fibromylagia, and Effexor...has help them so much especially with the pain management.

After 9 years.... I still find Effexor XR the best drug for me. I had tried Elavil, Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, and Wellbutrin (HIVES!) prior to Effexor. I weaned myself off slowly twice, thinking I was ok, I could handle things. Nope. I will be a life time user. Looking at my family history, I can see now that my mother was depressed for many years. My father was an alcoholic. My brother is an alcoholic, as is my daughter, who also takes Effexor. My daughter never experienced any trauma as a child or young adult, which strengthens my belief that depression and alcoholism are genetically based disorders. Treatable, but not just with drugs alone. Counseling is a must. I feel the drug has given me the clarity I need to see inside myself and discuss my problems (PTSD, Social Anxiety, Depression)  openly. I believe it is a tool and I never again want to be the way I was &quot;before.&quot;

effexor and anxiety While I found that this drug works really well for my depression and initially for my anxiety over the last few months I've had some really bad anxiety attacks that have lasted for days. In between I've been fine. And I'm not experiencing the panic attacks that I was having before. Can now cope with everyday things again like shopping and socialising with friends!Also if I forget to take it I feel really achey and &quot;fluey&quot; Only just realised that that is because of withdrawal sympyoms!! So not looking forward to coming off this drug!

Been on for 3 years now i am on Effexor XR 75mg, but am also on Prozac 10mg- they work well together. I was on the effexor alone for a year or so though and didn't have any problems with it and felt that it definitely did help my mood swings and especially helped with my anxiety. When you first start taking it, the first few weeks, it will make you very nauseous, but that passes pretty quickly and i reccomend increasing dosage very slowly.

Effexor This drug is wicked and should be outlawed. Weaning off of it was pure hell. It affects your brain so severely that you get these &quot;brain shivers&quot; when going off of it and have to wean very slowly. I actually had to keep a chart to make sure the time elapsed between each dose was one hour longer than the previous dose. It took forever to wean. It was awful.

love it or hate it, I guess It's interesting to read the reviews on this drugs--very differing results. I was put on Effexor during a serious (bipolar) depression after trying other antidepressants but I became very agitated and made a suicide attempt. The doctors at the hospital immediately took me off it. It sounds like it's a godsend for some people but for me, it was a very dangerous drug.

Initial benefit then lots of side effects PRO: 1)Initial increase in mental and physical energy 2)initial mood improvement (first two weeks)CON: 1)back end insomnia 2)very tired when waking 3)low energy (after first two weeks) with occasional bouts of extreme lethargy 4)mild nausea 5)shaky hands 6)emotional instability (after 2nd week) 7)hot and cold spells 8)extreme emotional sensitivity at other's comments  9)eventually my affect became very flat on effexor  10)withdrawal is a bit worse with Effexor than with other's I've triedJust a note about Effexor.  This drug started off so well.  Other than sleep disturbances all aspects of my depression lessened for the first few weeks. I thought I had finally found the drug. Then it was as if my body became used to it.  No matter what dose, or time of dose, things got worse and worse for me.  Over the last 6 years I have tried Effexor 2 more times and now I get no benefit at all.  Again, it is as if I have developed resistance.  But for a time, ever so briefly I felt what it was like to feel mostly well.  What a tease.

Effexor XR I began taking Effexor in 1997.  These were the pinkish house shaped pills.  In 2000, I began to take Effexor XR, 150 mg., 2 in the morning and 2 at night.Although I have not been formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I know I am bipolar from the way I used to be prior to 1997 and up to 2001.  I have been diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder.I hail Effexor XR as my savior from bipolar disorder.  I no longer have the depression I used to experience, no more roller coaster moods.  My moods are very level, I am very calm.  The anger and hositility I used to experience are no more.I don't know why more people don't take Effexor.  It has changed me for the better.

I'm not quite sure The effexor is good for someone with depression, but I think I have more along the line of OCD.  I like to clean alot and I would like to redirect my attention elsewhere.  It took quite a while to kick in (2mos) and in a few areas I can tell a difference.  I am going to request Zoloft today.  I did respond well with that

PTSD vs Effexor I've been on effexor for over two years now and  am slowly beginning to create a life that's effective over the long term.

Just Say No To Effexor I have dealt with depression for many years.  I switched to Effexor due to weight gain from Zoloft and decreased effectiveness of Zoloft.  I truly hate Effexor. Worst experience with suicidal ideation. I do not think it should be prescribed.  There have to be other alternatives.  Take it off the market. I have PTSD and certain environmental stimulants will set it off. If I am stressed and facing too many challenges, I get depressed even on meds.  While on Effexor I had worse experience of real suicidal ideation. My suicidal thoughts very calm and thought out. Fortunately I was able to work my way through it. You have a horrible reaction if you miss a dose. &quot;Extended release&quot; moniker is a misnomer.   Makes you feel like your head is blowing up. Think of damaged live power lines that are loose on a street snapping and flapping back in forth.  Feels like small explosions in your head. I tried for a year to convince my doctor that I really did not like this drug.  Finally, I am getting assistance &quot;weaning off&quot; and switching to something else.  DO NOT try to get off this drug with out being monitored by your psychiatrist.  Good experience backing off stressful work, staying clear of triggering stressors, getting sunlight, and integrating massage and yoga.

Finally, I am getting assistance &quot;weaning off&quot; and switching to something else.  DO NOT try to get off this drug with out being monitored by your psychiatrist.  Good experience backing off stressful work, staying clear of triggering stressors, getting sunlight, and integrating massage and yoga.

What Have I Done? This morning I ran out of Effexor.  After a few hours had passed I felt horrible!!  This stuff also makes me hyper and I can't sleep.  Last night I took 20mgs. of Ambien and slept two hours.  I don't think an elephant strength tranquilizer gun could have made me sleep. Sooo....I went to the internet. OH MY GOD!!  I was a textbook case of what can happen if someone with BPII takes this drug.  Be careful BP friends!

works for me!! I have found effexor xr to be very effective with my bipolar syndrome. It makes me think clearly and not explode at my family. My family enjoys my company much more when I'm taking the Effexor xr.

Withdrawal nightmarish! It seemed to help stabilise my mood for the first several months, allowing me to get out of bed and carry on teaching and interacting.  However, as time went on past then, I found myself withdrawing more and more.  It did give me enough strength to cut ties with my (emotionally poisonous) family in November 2004, although my moods by that stage were continuous despair without any variation.  That and a large weight gain were the main side effects I noticed while on this treatment.Once I managed to cut ties (and deal with the immediate birthday and xmas repercussions), I decided to wean myself off it by taking apart the capsules and decreasing the granules inside over a 2 month period.The withdrawal and the month afterwards were horrific - I could not concentrate due to mini-blackouts (skips), which I think many people describe as lightening strikes to the brain.  In the beginning they were occuring several times a minute, and I spent most of the months of weaning sleeping.  Even now, 2 months later I get an occasional skip.  I'm very glad I had three months off work to get through this.  Being off Effexor my moods returned, both high and low.  Unfortunately no weight loss yet!

Effexor  I lasted 5 days on 37  mg dosage. I went 3 days without sleep even after taking 20mg Ambien. Side effects included nausea, insomnia, depression, and loss of appetite. Dr. encouraged me to continue taking it. The dosage was stepped up to 75mg. Side effects were worse. This one isn't for me.

venlaflaxine I have taken this since January after stopping Cipramil.  I dont really think i have noticed many changes.  I feel it may be responsible for my headaches and odd sleep patterns.

dulled the attacks Effexor was key in helping me reclaim my life from panic attacks. After some gradual build up of chest pain and shortness of breath I exploded into a mass series of severe panic attacks. I was averaging about 7 per day and almost every one of them felt like an all out heart attack, complete with the sensation of my heart no longer pounding, but buzzing and massive tingling and numbness in my arms and legs. I had convulsions which would last for hours. I was prescribed Effexor. I have suffered from depression and hypomania for a long while, but have refused to be medically treated for it, but when a doctor offered up a medication to help with this, I could not refuse. After I had eased up to 75mg and had been taking them for about 2 weeks when I started to feel the attacks dulling a bit. After about a month they were noticeably dulled and less frequent, enough to allowed me to get out the door and start going to classes again and be a little social. After about 2 and a half months though the attacks started to break through again and i had to increase my dosage to 150mg. Once again the attacks dulled and decreased and it was at this point that I began Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (highly recommended!!!). After 3 months of this therapy weekly, and being on 150mg Effexor my attacks are essentially gone. Though it was not my reason for taking the medication, Effexor also did quite the job of easing my depression. The only con for me, is that it has also pushed my hypomania into all out mania and it is growing increasingly unpleasant. I hope to begin to taper off of the drug soon, since I believe the CBT will be enough to get me through any future panic troubles. I have heard many horror stories about discontinuation, and experienced some nasty things when missing a dose. Extreme dizziness and electric shock sensations in my head and arms. And for the record.. the 150mg capsules are BIG friggin monsters. I know I'm used to them,

Venlafaxine-Powerful AD &amp; Mild Anxiolytic I am currently taking 150mg venlafaxine to help control my mood, social &amp; general anxiety.I have tried this medicine in the past with a moderate improvment in my symptoms (which is actually very good since I have tried a very broad selection of antidepressants and had no response at all; often felt worse). I had to discontinue it last time as the side effects were intolerable and seemed to be getting worse. The withdrawal (an abrupt one at that) was as horrendous as its reputation implies.I decided to take it again after discontinuing clonazepam, which I had been taking for several years to control my anxiety. I experienced some very unpleasant side effects; flushing hot &amp; cold, sweating, coldness of the extremities. I almost gave up on it, but after about five weeks these unwanted effects subsided. Thankfully, and unlike most other antidepressants, venlafaxine does not intefere with my ability to have an orgasm.Venlafaxine definately helps sustain my good mood, and I have noticed a slight reduction in my overall levels of anxiety.I would rather take this medicine than take nothing, however its anxiolytic effects are too weak for it to contribute a substantial improvment to my overall quality of life in terms of anxiety.Give me a benzo any day!

Effective for 4 years I used 75mg for 4 years.  Couldn't increase the amount, as it caused lock jaw/jawbone cracking and severe yawning.  I had to switch meds because Effexor began to lose its efficacy--suicidal thoughts returned; hypomanic episodes too.  While on it, it was very effective-truly saved my life.  Biggest complaints: 1) weight gain (30 pounds) and 2) severe withdrawal-symptoms which included vertigo, nausea, panic attacks, crying spells, depression, and &quot;mild&quot; paranoia.

Life Saver I have been on Effexor XR for about 6 weeks now and noticed a difference after about 1 week. The difference is that I feel like a gray cloud has been lifted  and things are the way they are suppose to be.  I handle my emotions 100 % better, I actually look forward to the next day, I don't have tightness in my chest nearly as much (about 2 times since I have been on it  vs. everyday when I wasn't) where I felt like I was having a heart attack.  I see the posts about the withdrawal effects which I had when I got off Paxil but I don't plan on getting off this drug. I realize that this is what I have to do..it is a lifetime drug I have to take.  My side effects have been dry mouth, hard time sleeping though the night (which actually subsided after about 3-4 weeks) and being a bit more tired during the day and some nausea.  But I will take those side effects if it means that I am actually a mother and wife that my family wants to be around.  It has changed my life in just the 6 short weeks that I have been on it.  Thanks for &quot;listening&quot;!!

Works Well except with anxiety After trying Lustral this was the next thing to be tried, eventually went up to 225mg/day, so a slight pain in remembering to take 3 tablets a day, but apart from that as an anti-depressant I found it very effective. However for me it had very little effect on anxiety and the dosage constantly needed boosting to keep it working, and unfortunately since I had to start on a high dose I was soon at the max. Know someone who is taking higher dose in tablet form and she also finds them quiet effective. I have heard a lot of remarks about the come-down but have to say I didn't have any, the only problem was the short half-life meant their effect wore out long before I finished cutting the dosage and could move onto Mirtazapine so felt as if I hadn't taken any.

However for me it had very little effect on anxiety and the dosage constantly needed boosting to keep it working, and unfortunately since I had to start on a high dose I was soon at the max. Know someone who is taking higher dose in tablet form and she also finds them quiet effective.

Effexor XR made things worse Took Effexor XR for three days and could not tolerate the side effects. More anxiety / panic, unable to concentrate, cold sweats, insomnia. I couldn't even drive myself to work (or work for that matter)! Discontinued after 3 days and it took 2-3 days for it to get out of my system. Definately not for me!

Effexor &amp; adhd I used to be a teacher, in special ed, so I had plenty to keep me busy, and my impulsivity and jumping focus weren't really problematic. Now, I am a software engineer, and sitting in an office was a big transition.  The effexor was originally for being &quot;blue&quot; at 75mg.  After about 5 mo, my mood was great, but I talked to the Dr. about adhd treatment and Effexor, so she upped my dosage.  The explanation was that the norepinephrene(sp?) effects didn't kick in unti lthe higher dosages, and that was what was helpful for the adhd.  It has been. I haven't found it to have any negative side effects, although I mustn't miss a dose.  I have only done so about 3 times, but I don't want to repeat it.  SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome is Not, I repeat, not fun. It should be, when you read the description, but it isn't.So, take it everyday and give it a shot for a few months, just be sure to taper up and down.

Effexor XR wasnt for me I was taking effexor xr for a few months and I didnt realise at the time but the tablets made me more depressed than anything. Even to the point of attempted suicide (more than once). Effexor kind of put a little bit of ease on my anxiousness, although I now realise there are so many different anti-depressants out there to try, you dont have to just stick with the one brand. Some people say you have to wait for months and months for the tablets to take full effect, I dont agree. I have now been taking lexapro for a few days, and I already feel like a new person.

Experience with Effexor This drug did not work at all for me.  It had no physical side effects, but the depression became worse than ever before during the weeks I was on Effexor.  My suicidal tendencies increased by leaps and bounds, and I was eventually hospitalized and taken off this medication.  While I understand it may work very well for some people, it was a nightmare for me!

&quot;Side-Effexor&quot; This med did absolutely nothing for me.  I thought it was working a little at first, but within a week it had quit.  Raising the dosage resulted in my &quot;not being myself&quot; and I stopped taking it for that reason.From what I hear, I am very lucky.  I came off Effexor-XR almost cold-turkey and had no ill effects.  But I have heard MANY stories of people being hospitalzied in order to wean them off Effexor, and some people go through very horrible withdrawals.  So NEVER abruptly stop taking it!!

Drugs may not be the answer... Depression is a scary thing, especially when there seem to be no drugs that are consistently effective for its treatment.  I have tried Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Effexor, Remeron, and am in psychotherapy.  Improvement is minimal, and I have been eating healthy, exercising and trying to live a lifestyle that is conducive to vitality and happiness.  I have been getting 7 or 8 hours sleep a night lately using Remeron, although I believe it's effectiveness is waning.  I don't want to sound pessimistic or discouraging, this is simply my case.Effexor worked for me about 2 years ago.  It seemed to bring me out of depression and I was able to discontinue it without any difficulties.  I was 18 at the time.  After this I decided to engage in prolific drug use, primarily GHB and marijuana, and the problem was reawakened from it's slumber about 6 months ago.  General indifference and frustration have been the order of the day since this time, as well as some anxiety thrown in for good measure.  I began taking Wellbutrin at first, in conjunction with Remeron for sleep, and despite a lengthy trial of four months no improvement was noted.Enter Effexor.At first it seemed to work well, although I had trouble sleeping.  I was seeing some improvement in both my mental and phyical faculties, notably in chess and weightlifting.  Unfortunately, the positive effects dissipated after a couple weeks as the lack of sleep caught up with me.After a painful period of waiting, my good friend Remeron was thrown back into the mix. The result of this was the same subtle improvements that manifested themselves in the first few weeks with Effexor.As time rolled steadily by, I received some good marks in my class and some moderate gains from a continuous strength training program, although the uneasiness in public places that I have felt for the last few years began to worsen.

GAD, Depression, and Effexor XR I'm actually on a dosage of 112.5 mg, once a day. It has been AWESOME in helping me deal with my GAD and Depression, both of which I've been diagnosed with since January of 2002. I first tried Celexa (SSRI), and it was no where NEAR effective in my treatment. Unlike most SSRI's, EffexorXR affects both Serotonin AND norepinepherine reuptake. As I've looked more deeply into those neurotransmitters and what exactly each does in the body, the effects of Effexor on these is PERFECT for what I need to progress into remission of both my GAD and Depression (i.e., irritability, racing thoughts, aggression, inability to eat, insomnia, etc.). Effexor is also the FIRST drug the FDA approved for treating both Generalized Anxiety Disorder AND Depression. I highly reccomend it, or at least looking into it as a possible remedy for you. It has given me hope where no other medicine has.

I became so sick, I thought something was seriously wrong with me until I found a site like this in which people share their experiences. I have been on several antidepressants, and this one was literally painful to wean off of. I hope that this can help someone before they take the drug without understanding that if it does not work, the side effects may literally cause you to be ill. I have read that other people have also suffered like I did, and I recommend speaking to a psychiatrist before taking this or at least before stopping it. I also know that it works great for a lot others and all body chemistries are different.

Please read-Truth about effexor xr I am a 28 year old female. I asked my doctor for help because I was often tired after school and had a child and a fiance to take care of. My regular doctor gave me Effexor XR. At first, Effexor was like a miracle drug.  I was very active and happy, living life to the fullest. My grades were nothing less than A's.  However, I couldn't sleep and the worst part is that I could not have an orgasm no matter how hard I tried. Imagine getting right to that spot of orgasm and then it going away. I felt like I was teasing myself.  It was torture. Oh, and night sweats are not listed as side effects but need to be. I never sweat but once on the medicine, I would soak my sheets every night. My doctor said that there was no proof that others suffered from this because of the medicine. Also, I could go a week without sleeping and my brain would not turn off. I could memorize every question from my previous tests, I loved that.  My doctor said that I needed to sleep so he put me on trazadone to help me sleep. Upon research, I noticed that almost everyone on effexor has to take some sort of sleeping pills.  After that, I was a wreck.  I had to take effexor to wake up and trazadone to sleep.  After a while, I couldn't wake up anymore.  I quit school. I quit work. I couldn't take care of my children or be a part of my fiance's life. I wouldn't have sex because I knew it would be a let down. Therefore, my doctor raised the effexor to the maximum amount of 150 mg twice a day and it still had no effect on me.  I would sleep 20 hours of every day and the four hours that I was awake were miserable.  I spent many of days in the psychiatric emergency room.  I took it upon myself to quit taking the trazadone. I figured that way I would at least be able to wake up.  That was one of the worst mistakes that I could have made.  I was extremely tired but could not fall asleep.

Too Powerful... Side effects starting on Effexor were a nightmare.  Going on a year on the drug, I feel like my mind is getting more and more numb.  Side-effects in dropping the doses are awful as well.  Shocks/jolts to system - like little seizure feelings.  I wish I had never started on this drug.  I think I'm going to try and get off this pill as quick as I can and suffer the side-effects as a drop dosages.I have developed some jaw trouble, I think mainly because I believe Effexor is responsible for making my jaw muscles clench almost constantly.The huge drop in sex drive and proneness to constipation are also inconvenient.

Effexor for Depression and Anxiety       I became depressed after the birth of my second child and had also suffered from anxiety most of my life. My doctor suggested Effexor XR to try for at least one year. I felt better almost immediately after starting it. An immediate inner peace. My depression lifted for a while and then seemed to creep back, so my dosage was raised to 150 mg, and that's where I stayed for the rest of the year. My anxiety also disappeared. Side effects were delayed orgasm and lack of sexual sensation. If I was late taking my pill, I would get electrical shock sensations down my arms into my fingers, headache, and nausea. As long as I took my pill at the same time every day, I was fine. Also a 25lb weight gain.After I was on Effexor for the 1 year, I was doing Great! Decided to come off the medication. My doctor weaned me off very slowly - I think it took me about 6 weeks - it wasn't that bad. I did have the electrical shock sensations, slight lightheadedness at times and a ringing in my ears that lasted up to a month or so even after I was off the medication. I managed a &quot;normal&quot; life for the next few years - But once again, I'm back - mostly anxiety and panic attacks.

Neither good nor bad I basically started Effexor to counteract the side effects of my other meds (weight gain).  I don't really think it did that much for my moods.  I can say that I have successfully weaned myself off of Effexor twice and I didn't have any major problems.

Trapped After 7 years on Efexxor XR, the only thing I want is to get off it.  I have gained 35 pounds, have night sweats, brain &quot;zits&quot;, vertigo, and nausea when I forget just one!  I hate it and would advise never taking it.  I wish my doctor would have advised me how hard it would be to stop taking it.  I have tried too many times to count and always start taking it again. I feel trapped by the drug that was supposed to make me better.  It is so addictive in the respect that the withdrawal symptoms are so dreadful you WANT to keep taking it!  My advice...don't start!

Effexor is now working I think I may have found an A/D that works for me. The Hep C has been with me they figure since I was the age of 5 to 15. (Their estimate) my liver damage is 4 (bad) but I still have pretty good liver function. I've been severely depressed for about 9 months, a common side effect to Interferon/Ribavirin treatment. They tried Lexapro, Zoloft and finally Effexor. I told my GP that it wasn't working and she upped my dose. In a short time I started feeling better. I still have severe fatigue but even that seems to be a little better now. I also take Trazodone to sleep, the combo might be the answer, I'm not sure. The depression waxes and wanes so I'll have to update when I'm well enough to go back to work :)

Effexor is Working for Me Since 1995, I have taken Prozac, Celexa, Lexapro or Wellbutrin. Even during pregnancies, I could not go drug-free without major depression and increasing bulimia nervosa activity. Effexor is the first medication on which I experienced a nearly immediate reduction in binge/purge cycling without any other changes in behavior or meds. After more than 25 years of chronic relapses under stress, I feel the possibility of freedom at last.

Effexor: from agony to the light I had a vicious major  depression that was very physical: lots of nausea, extreme anxiety, palpitations and panic, no concentration, insomnia, lack of appetite, constant thoughts of suicide.  I never knew such pain was possible.  My thoughts were racing but my body felt like it was underwater against the tide.  After many side effects -- especially vomiting and that so so uncomfortable &quot;very wired but exhausted&quot; feeling,  Lexapro brought me about halfway back but did not resolve anxiety.  Still, it was helping.  Effexor XR has been great and I feel like I can really function again.  I definitely feel that these drugs that act on more than one neurotransmitter are much more effective.  Small side effects include occasional headache, sweating...no big deal.   I am taking 225 mg a day and will continue to increase until I remit completely.  I also am going to begin hormonal therapy (I am 45 and in perimenopause), have begun psychotherapy, take multivitamins and magnesium, fish oils, and will start SAM-e.  I need to exercise again and get plenty of sunlight!!    My next step would have been transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS or rTMS), which is now available in Canada and has virtually no side effects (no anesthesia either) and studies show may rival ECT for effectiveness.  (It is also available off-label in US through two physicians.)  You MUST give these antidepressants, however, at least eight weeks to work , EXPECT some side effects the first several weeks and TITRATE UP, (working with a competent psychiatrist NOT AT INTERNIST) until you start feeling better!!  Two or three weeks on small doses is NOT an adequate trial for real clinical depression.   Read the studies on the Internet!  Some people don't respond for 10-12 weeks!  I pray that all of you with the horror that is major depression not lose hope.  Don't be ashamed of depression.  Severe depressions always end, even if treatments fail.   Although I am not 100%,  Effexor ha

Effexor was Excellent Effexor worked very well for me.  I had tried a number of anti-depressants including Zoloft, Paxil, Wellbutrin, and they all had side-effects or left me feeling at little &quot;spaced out&quot;.  Effexor was tied because of its quicker acting properties, but also did not have any side effects for me.I have recently been switched to a new drug that is supposed to also help the nueropathy or numbness in my feet, but may return to Effexor because of its better effectiveness.

Effexor took a while It took a while but I think its working now. I felt very down when I went from my Hep C specialist who prescribed this drug to my primary care doctor. The former had prescribed 3/37.5 mg caps a day. The latter said 1/150 mg a night. Sounds like not much difference to me but after a few days I am feeling better. I don't know how long this will last, but its the best I have felt in months.

horrible dizziness I think this is one of the worst SSRI's out there because it not only didn't alleviate any of my depression but I would have dizzy spells that got progressively worse.  I could barely walk around without having to stop every 15 minutes or so to let a dizzy spell last (5-10sec. duration).

Effexor XR I think like any other meds, taking them for a length of time makes you wonder whether it is the med that is helping or all the other therapy. But it is probably a combination of both. Only side effect I had was that it tended to affect my mugrains, but my GP and I eventually got them under control.Very easy to take but dont go off them cold turkey. Many horrorible side effects.

I went from one antidepressant to another, but could not find one that would work for more than six months.   The doc who literally saved my put me on a cocktail that included Effexor XR:  300 mg two times a day.

Still good My doc had to talk me into using Effexor because I'd heard so many bad things about it. Now I like it. It works very well on my nasty depressions. I had tried many other antidepressants such as Wellbutrin and Celexa(bad news, I flipped out)none of which worked. Just don't forget a dose of Effexor. I forgot once, and was very nauseated and dizzy.

Effexor was prescribed to deal with depression and chronic pain. I'm unclear as to any noticeable improvements in pain. It did help with the depression. As I started feeling better the side affects, mostly very sluggish bowels, caused me to decrease my dose to a my current dosage. I would like to decrease it but my provider is not so rushed possibly because weaning is difficult and she feels it may help with pain. I'm not so sure.

I get to choose: hypomania or depression Starting out, 37.5 didn't do anything. That was expected.Then 75 did a little. I was slightly less depressed. In fact, I was antidepressed enough to start complaining that I was depressed :-) One tearful call to my doc's answering machine at 5 am crying that I was still having suicidal fits was enough to suggest a change.So, we went up to 150. I felt less depressed. Then I feld *un*depressed. Then I felt great! Then my girlfriend complained that I hadn't slept in a week....Upping the Lithium didn't do enough to being me back out. Adding an antipsychotic was a disaster. So, I went off ADO. Not a great idea, but I was toggling between suicidal and invincible, so what did I care? Plus, I was in Las Vegas for a few days, and remembering to take pills was a buzz-kill.In the end, we've set the Effexor back to 75. And added more mood stabilizer. And we're watching. Maybe the depression won't come back, or maybe it will. But at least I'm not seeing things that aren't there. Or at least, not very many.Side effects: several in the sexual spectrum, but nothing all that terrible. I may be more tolerant of those than many are. Nothing much that I attribute to the Effexor.So, why did I mark this so low on the SE scale? Simple. You try cutting your dose down or stopping quickly. I was being careful, so it wasn't that bad. I've watched friends go from 225 to 0. This is not a drug to discontinue abruptly. Unfortunately, it's also likely to push you so manic that you believe that a) you don't need it anymore and b) you can handle the discontinuation effects. I've done this with other antidepressants; I do not want to do so with Effexor.

Effexor - Anxiety and depression I was a wreck the middle of summer 2004.  The depression and anxiety set in suddenly. I was supposed to fly to DC to see my 1 year old granddaughter and did not want to go.  I was crying constantly and thought of suicide.  I saw my pcp and he prescribed Effexor - 150 mg in the morning.  He sent me to a psychiatrist who doubled the dosage of the Effexor to 300 mg in the morning and started me on xanax.  I felt better right away. When I flew to DC, I had a panic attack on the plane. There is no place to go except to the bathroom.  I took a xanax and tried to pull myself together.  The whole time I was on my trip I felt anxious.  I still take 300 mg of the Effexor and the xanax on an as needed basis and feel great.  I am once again going to DC the end of March and could not be more excited!  My precious little one is now 18 months.  Grand children seem to grow much faster than our own children did.  I have rearranged my priorities which has worked very well for me. I am sure the Effexor has a lot to do with that.

Life is good with Effexor 75 mg of Effexor XL has made life livable for me for about 5 years now. Admittedly, my problems might not be as severe as some people experience, but this relatively low dose of Effexor has made a tremendous difference for me. I suffered from undiagnosed depression nearly my entire life, had suicidal ideologies as a teen, and went through my early adult years just getting by but never happy and building huge walls around myself to safeguard against feeling anything, being  hurt, or having a breakdown. It wasn't until my mid-fifties that an understanding doctor suggested an anti-depressant might help me feel better and not cry all the time. A tragic family situation drastically increased my depression and anxiety level.The doctor first prescribed Celexa and that was a great boost at first. I took that for a couple years and felt like I had a new perspective on life for the first time. But it did not address the low-level anxiety, and eventually I began having full panic attacks, particularly when driving.I then switched to Effexor and I feel great 99% of the time! With Effexor, I am cheerful and life can be fun! I would say it has also been a big help getting through my menopause years fairly effortlessly. With Effexor each day, I can handle most anything that comes my way - and there have been some major things!  I don't recall any significant side effects when I began taking Effexor XL and today my only problem is if I do NOT take it. If I accidentally miss a dose, I go into a huge nosedive! Anxiety, nervousness, crying, obsessive worrying ... but as soon as it dawns on me why I feel that way, and I take the Effexor, then I am OK again. I hope I don't ever have to go off of it for some reason!

Effexor in treatment of Bi-polar Phase II I was placed on effexor 225mg at first for major depression in my disorder-I now take 37.5mg.  I went from 225mg to 37.5 in one week with only slight feelings of withdrawal.  I feel this mediation is a good one for the depressive side of the disorder if you do not experience manic phases-then I believe you have to be careful using any anti-depressant.

Be careful with this one. I think the most important thing that I could say here is this: Do NOT take Effexor without the supervision of a psychiatrist.  This medication should never be prescribed by a regular doctor, in my opinion.  If you do nothing else, read the discussion of withdrawal at the bottom of this post, even if you're going to read nothing else.I took Effexor for approximately eight months, starting at 37.5 mg for a week, 75 mg for a couple of months, and then 150 mg for the rest of the time.  My doctor gave me the prescription after I went to him to tell him that the Zoloft my gynecologist had given me for PMDD was not working.  He was on Effexor himself (perhaps too much self-disclosure for a doctor, but at that time, it was comforting...) and said it had worked wonders for him, so I was optimistic.  Sadly, the results were similar to Zoloft.  No sex drive. No noticable difference in my depression.  In terms of my anxiety, I was better able to suppress my feelings, meaning that I was less likely to cry in a given situation and visibly &quot;freak out.&quot;  One might think this was a good thing, but I felt like a walking time bomb. Crying can be a good thing--on Effexor, I felt like I was going to explode, and I am probably one of the least angry people you'll ever meet.  I don't know if this is a typical reaction, but it's the only way I can describe it.  After complaining about the &quot;numbness,&quot; my doctor switched me to Wellbutrin.  Here's where the real fun began.  Effexor withdrawal should be done VERY VERY gradually, often over the course of several months.  My doctor's method of &quot;weaning off&quot; Effexor consisted of: Week 1--Taking my 150 mg of Effexor every other day while taking 150 mg of Wellbutrin.Week 2--Stopping the Effexor totally, taking 300 mg of Wellbutrin.My psychiatrist was shocked when I told her how quickly my doctor had taken me off Effexor. When I was taking the Effexor every other day, I was OK.  I thought I was

Paxil to Wellbutrin to Effexor December 4, 2004..I am very impressed with this med (75mg 1x)!  Just over a month and I am feeling just as good, if not better than I ever felt on Paxil, and Paxil improved my life 100%!  I am still suffering side effects from Wellbutrin SR which I stopped on November 3rd, so I am not sure if any of the side effects may also be caused by Effexor. I have self-medicated with Effexor a couple times by taking 75mgs in the morning and another at noon and it seemed to work much better.  I will talk to my doc in a couple of days to ask if I can up my dose officially.  Good luck to all and I will update my experience in a month or so.=============================================January 7...I still have very good results from this med..doc has incremently upped my dosage from 75 to 112 to 150 and as of yesterday I am  now at 225.  I did well at 112 and 150 but doc thinks I need a little more punch as I am still having some cycles of bad/negative thoughts and am low on motivation/energy, also my sleep pattern seems to have him concerned.  I say I am doing fantastic on this med compared to the past year when Paxil pooped out and Wellbutrin barely scratched the surface of my problems.Good luck to all.========================February 17...After PDoc appt this month we decided to up my dose again, this time 150 mgs twice a day, I am feeling great but motivation and energy still down on the 225, we are hoping this will crank me up a little more, sleep is a bit better, less naps on he weekends but still more than occasionally,waking at night, not being able to go back to sleep, the PDoc has me on Lorazepam as needed for that and also to use for stressful situations, I have only needed it for sleep so far, as the Effexor is doing very well keeping my panic/anxiety under control.  The cost rating has changed for me because I changed Insurance companies, WOW, it's expensive now, but some of my other medical costs have reduced.  Luck to All!
effexor	Depression	2005-02-17 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Paxil to Wellbutrin to Effexor December 4, 2004..I am very impressed with this med (75mg 1x)!  Just over a month and I am feeling just as good, if not better than I ever felt on Paxil, and Paxil improved my life 100%!  I am still suffering side effects from Wellbutrin SR which I stopped on November 3rd, so I am not sure if any of the side effects may also be caused by Effexor. I have self-medicated with Effexor a couple times by taking 75mgs in the morning and another at noon and it seemed to work much better.  I will talk to my doc in a couple of days to ask if I can up my dose officially.

Effexor is the drug from Hell Effexor is, without question, the most Hellish drug I've ever taken - I ended up in the emergency room when the quack I was seeing took me off - cold turkey - and then wouldn't return any phone calls as I went through HORRIBLE withdrawals. I dropped that quack and found someone competent. Even then, it took FOREVER to get off of Effexor - even missing a dose by a few hours resulted in HORRIBLE side effects - vertigo, nausea, throbbing head, spinning sensations. The FDA should BAN this drug.

good for anxiety at higher dosages I was switched from lexapro, wellbutrin, and risperdal to effexor.  My doctor felt that if I was on the right antidepressant I wouldn't have to take anything else.  Effexor has been excellant for depression but is just ok for my anxiety.  When I'm in the office or in a stressful situation I want to take xanax.  I'm trying to take xanax less but don't feel good in a stressful situation without it.Feb 2005I am now taking 225mg effexor and the increased dosage has helped my anxiety.  I find that I am tired but it is worth it to have the decrease in anxiety.  I rarely need to supplement with xanax now.  My mood seems to be more depressed at the higher dosage but anxiety has decreased.

The trouble with half life... I have classic narcolepsy (the full tetrad)and was prescribed Effexor for cataplexy control. At 150 mg I still had enough cataplexy that my neurologist felt that an increase was warrented, and I was moved to 225mg per day.  Big mistake, I lost chunks of time and felt like I was toxic.  I chose to not medicate (I had taken Prozac briefly and simply stopped the med)because each increase in the Effexor waranted an increase in EDS meds (for me Adderall--not time release), since AD drugs act as downer and increase sleepiness.  So I was unsure as to which med was causing the memory problems and cloudy brain feeling.  It would have been great if someone had mentioned the half life difference between Prozac and Effexor.  Here I sit almost a week later, after horrible rebound cataplexy, brain zaps, muscle spasms,etc. at 75 mg am and 75mg pm.  At least I no longer think I am losing my mind.  I also know which was the culprit of my problems...drum roll please, Effexor!  I was actually withdrawing during the entire time I took the med, because I was unable to consistently take it at the same time.  I just love how Big Pharma marketed this drug.  You see, the shorter half life made it easier for patients (read: consumers) to increase to the level that would be beneficial, so quicker results.  But on the backside Wyeth really got smart (read: increased target market and consequently profit), because that shorter half life is notorious for being a &quot;hook&quot;.  I will tell you that the withdrawl (which Wyeth terms as &quot;discontinuation syndrome&quot;, because to employ the term withdrawal would to conced culpability)was hellacious for me. Next week I step to 75 a day, then a week later to nada.  At the end of the day, I guess I have turned into a skeptic of all AD medications, since I have never taken them for depression.  Besides the famous maker of Prozac, Eli Lilly, held the patent for LSD in the US.  Things that make you go hmmmm.  For anyone withdrawing, do

Side Effects I've been up and down on Effexor for depression and anxiety-- 75mg, then slowly to 300, then an overdose (no lasting damage), then back down to 150.  It works for the depression, more or less, but not the anxiety at this level.  Worse, though, is the return of side effects-- nausea and headache, most notably-- for at least 10 days if I forget to take a pill for one day.  Sleep is also elusive; I'm averaging about 5 hrs./night.

effexor effexor was a very good option for my fibro pain for many months.When cymbalta came on the market I was weaned off of effexor gradually but even that produced stuttering in my speech, electric like shock feelings in my head and face and very intense headaches with flashes of lightning in my eyes!Very scary drug to get off of.  I would not recommend this drug.

Effexor I have taken Effexor Xr for over 5 years now.  The only side effect I have experienced is weight gain.  I do have horrible withdrawl symptoms if I am even a few hours late taking it. Over the years I've had to have the dose increased of course. I take 525mg now.

Works, but requires patience Was suffering from major depression and panic disorder for 6 months.  Was put on 75 mg of Effexor XR and increased 37.5 mg every week until I reached 300 mg.  It worked when I finally reached 300 mg (about 6-8 weeks).  It was like I was a whole new person.  But this med can make your depression and/or anxiety worse when you first start to take it, but that will go away.  This is really a wonder drug, but on the other hand it is HELL to come off of, so you must taper off slowly lest you like brain zaps and dizziness.

Problems with Effexor Lasted on Effexor only three days. Unfortunately one of the less common side effects of Effexor is that it can actually cause prostatitis! A chemically-induced form of inflammed prostate. I not only got it but got it immediately. Stopped it after third day after speaking with my urologist who informed me that prostatitis not only caused by bacteria, etc., but could be induced by many various chemicals... including this one! The prostatitis consisted of extreme swelling, painful urethra symptoms (at all times) and severe difficulty urinating. Actually took a couple weeks or more for side effect to subside after stopping product.

Brief Respites in my Depression I have been on 225mg of Effexor for depression that has lasted 7 months.  I was on Mitrazapine before that and that did nothing to help.  I have since spoken to a neurologist in Austria and he has advised me that my depression is most likely Serotonin related as I lasted 5 years without depression whilst using Celexa.  He has explained to me that Effexor does block the re-uptake of serotonin but not as effectively as the SSRI's do.  it takes 450mg effexor to be as potent with serotonin as 40mg Prozac.  I had no noticeable side effects with Effexor apart from head zaps when I drank alcohol (the same sensation as when you come off an SSRI).  It took about 4-5 weeks for me to have a window in my depression, I just noticed I was enjoying having a conversation to a lady in a shop.. however the depression was still there.  It did not last long, I would be back down there the next day, it followed a pattern, bearable days for 3-5 days and then hell for 3-5 days.  The depression did not go away and after over 3 months of being on the medication I have decided to try an SSRI.  I am two weeks into cross tapering, reducing the effexor and introducing the SSRI and I am at last feeling positive in the morning when I wake up.  I don't know if its the SSRI that's kicking in, the reduced effexor being more effective for me or a mixture of the two.  Something is making my depression better and right now I am terrified with what I need to do .i.e. increase SSRI/decrease Effexor in case the depression gets worse again.  Only time will tell.

Effexor XR...Whew! I was diagnosed with AD/HD, clinical depression and Social Anxiety Disorder. A little bit of everything. I started taking this at a dosage of 35 mg a day for 7 days and then onto 75mg one times a day for an additional two weeks. My depressions have subsided, my anxieties are still apparent but as each day passes I feel it less and less, which is a blessing....however I have to tell you, this drug is stronger than I anticipated. In the first 7 days, I was sick to my stomach non-stop. I had several occurrences of severe body chills, nausea &amp; night sweats on the 4th day. It scared me. I had difficulty sleeping since, and the stomach pains decreased, but I was still have slight nausea. After raising the dosage, I was still having issues with sleeping at a decent time, and staying awake during the day. But one thing that bothers me are the hand tremors. Never felt like this before in my life! I have a follow up appointment with my doctor in a week, and I am hoping by then this has relaxed a little.My suggestion, everyone is different and some drugs that work for you may not for someone else. Dealing with anti-depressants in general is a case of trial and error, until you find something that fits you. I don't think this fits me well, but only time will tell. Side effects sometimes subside, but who knows how long it will last?

After raising the dosage, I was still having issues with sleeping at a decent time, and staying awake during the day. But one thing that bothers me are the hand tremors. Never felt like this before in my life! I have a follow up appointment with my doctor in a week, and I am hoping by then this has relaxed a little.My suggestion, everyone is different and some drugs that work for you may not for someone else. Dealing with anti-depressants in general is a case of trial and error, until you find something that fits you. I don't think this fits me well, but only time will tell. Side effects sometimes subside, but who knows how long it will last?

effexor Since I have lupus  the problem for me is fatigue and I think effexor is helping me. At the same time I'm trying to stay away of household chemicals and avoiding all kind of chemicals in cosmetics, food,..Taking effexor and staying away from chemicals is making me feel much better.

Got off of it After reading so much about the difficulty of getting off of Effexor, I, finally, was able (after many failed tries) to pull myself off of it a few months ago and I feel, mentally, like myself again.  I was prescribed Effexor as a buffer to increase the effectiveness of pain medications for my diagnosis.  In all honesty, it isn't worth it for the trouble I went through getting off of it.  My diagnosis is as follows: (via mri tests)several bulging discs in cervical and lumbar regions of back, beginning of osteoporosis, three pinched nerves/stenosis in cervical region, bone spurring in cervical region, Fibromyalgia (severe), arthritis (via x-rays), high blood pressure, chronic pain.I hope this information helps you.

Not Impressed Jan 4: I decided to get off this and the psychological withdrawal was awful. Paxil helped. Obviously Effexor helps some people. It didn't do much for me. Dec 11: I remain unimpressed. The doc upped the dosage to 150 alleging that eventually an &quot;energizing&quot; effect would kick in. Huh? All I want to do is sleep, sleep, sleep. I have no energy or motivation to do anything else.Dec 2: Just back from doc. He says the Effexor begins to work on serotonin first, ergo the sedation. It takes longer to effect the norepinephrine. My problem is with both chemicals. So I'm going to give this another try for longer and at a higher dose to give it a chance to act on the norepinephrine. PS; Dysthymia is a bitch. At least if you're severely depressed people know there's something wrong. If you're &quot;merely&quot; dysthymic, you're berated to &quot;just grow up&quot; or whatever. You agree and berate yourself rather than taking your problem seriously enough to seek help. I'm actually relieved to find I have an identifiable disorder rather than &quot;lack of ambition&quot; and all the other moralistic labels that dysthymia provokes.Previous Post: I felt upbeat the first couple of days on 37. Then blah. Went to 75. After a few days, blah again. I'm afraid of investing more time in this medication and getting the same non-result... only to also suffer the terrible withdrawals that so many others have cautioned about. THREE WEEKS: I just stopped taking this. I had no withdrawal problems, but I never had withdrawal problems with any SSRI. I'm considering Wellbutrin because all of the SSRI's make me feel zonked.

Long term use causes problems! I was prescribed effexor xr for anxiety and mild depression. After working up to 150 mg, my depression was worse (and instead of thinking it might be because of the drug) so my psychiatrist increased my dosage to 225mg.  This worked well for about six months, but soon I started to develop severe joint pain throughout my body.  Nothing relieved the pain, stretching, massage, pain reliver, ice, heat, etc.  I soon found out that many people on effexor for over a year also developed horrible pain and were being diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and arthritis.  I am now trying to wean myself off of this drug and the process is hell.  I am sick, dizzy, in pain, feel nervous, have vertigo and extreme nausea, and wierd brain zaps.My suggestion is DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!  Your brain becomes addicted to it.  If you miss even one dose you feel the same withdrawal symptoms I am experiencing now!  Try natural methods, yoga, meditation, courses on handling life, etc. but do not mess up your brain with these drugs@

Horrible, horrible withdrawal I had a terrible time on this med as well as getting off of it!  Brain shocks,etc.  Though it did decrease my anxiety considerably (I was in fog land much of the time!) withdrawal symptoms were horribly long-term.

Effexor XR works! Side Effects Bearable After trying Paxil (too many side effects) and Zoloft (didn't work) for my anxiety disorder/OCD, I was relieved when my doctor put me on Effexor and it worked! I've been taking it for 2 months, and my constant worrying has settled down and my panic attacks have all but disappeared.I have had some side effects, though none too terrible. For the first month I had a lack of appetite (helped me to lose the 5 lbs I put on with Paxil) but my appetite has since returned. It also causes insomnia (worse than I had before). I had been taking Ambien, but that stopped working when I started the Effexor.  I now take 50mg of Trazadone at night, which has helped unbelievably. Though others have mentioned a problem, I have had no sexual side effects whatsoever. When I choose to stop taking effexor, I will be sure to taper off very slowly. I have not missed a dose yet, so I have not experienced withdrawal symptoms. I did have some brain zaps and headaches/dizziness when I stopped taking Paxil, but that comes with the territory.

excellant for depression I was switched from lexapro,wellbutrin,risperdal to effexor because my doctor thought that if I was taking the correct antidepressant I shouldn't need to take anything else.  I have found effexor to be excellant in treating depression.  This is my worst time of year and last year at this time I had severe suicidal depression.  Effexor has almost eliminated my severe depression.  Every once in a while I will have a crying spell but prior to this I would cry day after day.

effexor xl I have clinical depression from which I have suffered all my life. I struggled with many different medications over the years and have been taking Effexor XL for about two years and plain Effexor before that. This medication has stabilised me and I lead a pretty normal life, able to take life's knocks without crashing into depression. When the drug is not working properly (there are days when this happens) I come to realise just how much I owe to this medication. My major symptom of the depression returning is irritability and a complete inability to cope with frustration, which leads to childish temper tantrums, of which I am very ashamed. Fortunately  my anger is never aimed at others, but more at myself and at inanimate objects. The medication is for me very 'time of day sensitive'. I have found that if I take 150mg at about 2:00pm each day, I remain stable. Should I forget, I take only 75mg (after 5pm) and strangely enough, there are no major withdrawal symptoms (maybe a few migraine-like flashes now and then) and the following day all I need to do is to resume the normal intake. However, if I forget two days entirely, there are unpleasant withdrawal symptoms of the type well noted in this forum. I have to say that in my experience, there is no single area of medication which is so completely individually-reactive than anti-depressants. So to those of you still struggling, don't give up. Especially ask your doctor if you can experiment with intake times and see what happens. This is what has made the most difference to me, finding the right time of day to take the Effexor. Hope this review helps someone!

Can this medication possibly cause fibromyalgia? I was taking Effexor XR for depression, borderline disorder.. I hear a lot about weight gain, but I actually had lost 10 pounds when I started it. I couldn't tell if it helped so much as certain things were going okay in my life around the time I started taking it.When I didn't take it for a week (forgetfulness or what have you) I experienced terribly vivid nightmares like every night, and I started getting headaches. I took it again for a month after that, but stopped after that for whatever reason. Since then, I've gained back those 10 pounds as well.I stumbled across this site while researching fibromyalgia, as lately I'm experiencing all the symptoms. While researching the cause, I found something talking about serotonin and neurons, which immediately made me think of the effexor. It caused bizarre side effects before, so I thought I'd look into it. I was surprised to find people with fibromyalgia take it to remedy the pain. I didn't have these symptoms at all until after I stopped taking it.. I was hoping someone might have a similar experience so I know whether or not it's a withdrawal side effect.

Not great, not terrible. I don't know, I'm still on the fence with this one.  I wonder if maybe I need to have the dosage increased?  It helps with my depression some (not as good as paxil) but does nothing for my constant irritability.  Also, have had to start blood pressure medicine since I've began Effexor treatment.  But, low sexual side effects.  Of course not the case with the blood pressure pill so I suppose I should just go back to paxil!  With all the talk about withdrawls, I'm nervous about increasing dosage and wonder if I should &quot;get out&quot; while I can.  Anyone with input and a similar situation please email me!

With all the talk about withdrawls, I'm nervous about increasing dosage and wonder if I should &quot;get out&quot; while I can.  Anyone with input and a similar situation please email me!

Good med but raised my blood pressure Effexor was my first choice when my dr. told me I had to stop Serzone.  It affects the same neurotransmitters and so I thought it would work well.  It made me feel quite good as far as depression and anxiety were concerned.  My mood improved a great deal.  I started having insomnia but I never felt tired so it didn't really bother me.  When I first started it, I had horrible constipation, but I started mixing psyllium husks in with my yogurt smoothies and that alleviated the problem.  The only serious problem was that after a couple months, my blood pressure started hitting about 142/90.  It got to the point where I decided I had to stop taking it because that was just too high, especially for someone who averages about 110/70.  After I came off of it, I realized how much I'd missed sleeping through the night, so in retrospect, I'd say that was a negative too.  However at the time, it didn't bother me a bit!  My caution to people taking this med would be to just monitor your blood pressure periodically.  Otherwise I thought it was a good med.

57 years old and still crazy after all these years Was on prozac for 3 years before i crashed. Got a goose w/ 150 mg effex. Two years later crashed and went to 300 mg and came back but not all the way. Had to quit work last year after last crash but turns out luck gave me a great [but skeptical] wife who supports me in the manner i had become accustomed to. I definitely had gom syndrome [grumpy old man]. Still sleeping more than 8 hrs per day but is manageable. Vivid and strange dreams, decreased mental ability [spend a lot of time retracking my steps to find something i lost], decreased but not unsatisfying libido,30 lbs. gained, and decreased ability to deal with selfish, unreasonable people. I don't understand why so many people try to go off  effex. if it is working. The withdrawal stories scare the xxxx out of me. Strangely, I have a great relationship w/4 kids,2 grandkids, and Jesus. I am a volunteer for hospice and play golf regularly. LIFE IS GOOD BUT NOT ENDLESS.

Useless for me I have tried both Effexor and Effexor XR. On regular Effexor I was up to 150 mg. Neither did a thing for me, though I guess they work for some people.  No side effects, which I guess is good, but no benefit either.

How dare they prescribe effexor... ...for fatigue, fibromyalgia, hot flashes, or perimenopause?  How can it be legal as I know it cannot be moral to allow this strong drug to be sold by drug representatives to family practice physicians and internists all over the country as a panacea for whatever ails us?I had no idea why I had gained 15 pounds that I could not lose to save my life, could not get off the sofa for two years in spite of my normally active lifestyle and became more and more fatigued as time passed.  I assumed that it had something to do with getting older.  Then one morning a little over two months ago it dawned on me that it might have something to do with the Effexor that had long ago been prescribed to me for the very fatigue that I was experiencing.   I decided to stop taking it.  I've been sick as a dog ever since, but the original symptoms disappeared.My current highly educated internist is not aware of exactly how sick I would become.  The literature does not indicate that I would get this sick.  No one should have prescribed this drug to me nor to anyone like me, yet it is given to many with similar symptoms and other things that doctors just don't know how to treat every day.  Oh, and that fatigue that the original family practice guy gave me the EffexorXR for in the first place?  That turned out to be a thyroid deficiency.  Great, huh?I'm left with what feels like a hole in my stomach and shattered nerves up my neck and back. Worse is that I know I'm not the only one that it has happened to.This needs to stop!I've just been reading all of these posts and wondering:  Is this what caused the problem that my dentist seemed to ask me about with the teeth grinding thing?  I hadn't been aware of it, but he insisted on my getting a night guards a couple of years ago. Good grief!  I am so not a fan of this drug.  I wish I knew more before I had taken it so that I could have opted out of Effexor hell.

Effexor XR ----the demon! I am 34 yrs. old, a wife of 10 years and mother to two wonderful girls.  This drug has placed it's toll on my entire life.  It did help with the depression but seemed to increase my anxiety. Over the last 6 mos. of taking this drug I have been tested for several neuroloigical diseases.  This medication has given me extreme fatigue....My entire family has suffered while I bearly make it through each day.    I am currently trying to wean off of this medication.  I have never felt so bad in all of my life.  I am down to 37.5 mg. per day and each morning I awaken to &quot;electrical shocks&quot; covering my whole body.  I can bearly walk and have been bed ridden on several occasions from severe dizziness, headaches and nausea.  I pray to God each day that I will succeed at coming off of this medication.     I am a healthcare professional and have seen a lot of medications causing a lot of side effects.  I think that this medication should be taken off the market due to it's severe side effects.  I am sure that none of these side effects could be life threatening but according to the way I am feeling now---I would rather be dead.

It seemed like a miracle at first.(I don't remember dosage &amp; side effects were ratty at the beginning...SSRI headache &amp; dizziness)It did help my anxiety tremendously (tho I did still take Xanax occasionally ) &amp; several months into taking it I was feeling so good I decided it was time to quit smoking. What a mistake ! It seemed never to really work right again. I was a very heavy smoker &amp; have no idea what went wrong...Too much stress ? I just never got &quot;the honeymoon&quot; feeling back again so stopped taking it............Later on , back on the SSRI treadmill, I tried again. This time on XP. It just never helped me enough , and even tho side effects were much less on XP. I couldn't justify the cost with the minimal benefits. .............I'm on Lexapro and Xanax now and that works for me better than any other drug therapy I've tried...

Effexor Rocks I am a 55 year old married with kids male who has suffered from depression for 25 plus years. In the old days tricyclics relieved my condition but the side effects were bad for me. My psychiatrist was a very wonderful bloke (so good I haven't had to see him for 5 years) put me on effexor as soon as it came out. So, I have taken it for years, easy to take and when the XR came out even easier.What can I say about it? It gave me all the good effects of the tricyclics without the bad effects. It is a medication you take to alleviate depression without feeling medicated. There is no drama to it (which will not please some people), but for people who accept their condition and just want to get on with living a normal life without even thinking about depression for weeks on end, effexor rocks.Withdrawal - forget a dose and you sure know about it. But heck - I just want to feel a like a normal unmedicated guy (which is how effexor makes me feel), so why stop taking it. I am resolved to the fact I need it until the day I die, the same way a diabetic needs his insulin.Best thing about it: Friends telling me I am like my &quot;old self&quot; whatever that is.Worst thing about it: Libido reduction. I could time this with the 3 times a day regimen but with XR is more difficult. But I can still &quot;cut the grass&quot; in the mornings before my after breakfast capsule. No such thing as a free lunch!As someone who has been diagnosed as schizophrenic, bi-polar and clinically depressed: as someone who has been in psychiatric clinics, cognitive therapy and group therapy: as someone who has been on every mood disorder medication possible (including lithium) what can I say? Effexor has been the only medication which has made the state of my mental health a non-issue for me and more importantly, my family.

Brutal Withdrawals! Ex is like selling your Soul First the good then the bad. I have been taking Effexor for a number of years now. 75-150mg/day depending on how I feel. Pluses, Effexor helped a lot where all the other anti-ds failed. Much of the malaise and lack of concentration are fairly well controlled. Tinnitus still an issue as is some chronic pain. Mood swings more evened out. Generally it has controlled my chronic depression (monopolar) well. HOWEVER. The negative side. Whoa! There are withdrawals that are just brutal. Miss a dose or two and the punishment begins. First there is an electric shock like feeling with a ziiit-zfiit sound in my brain and the whole world seems to jump and rotate a few degrees to one side and back. Apparently others have named this brain shivers. Then I feel like my head is full of animals. Then I begin go get very - - very hostile, even dangerous. Was never like this before I started Effexor. If I stop taking this stuff,  this and more starts up within 36 hours or so. Taking the Effexor again will halt this but it seems like the withdrawals make it so that one can never get off this stuff even if the depression is going away. Jonesing on this stuff is very unpleasant.---Update..While it was at first quite effective in lifting or controlling monopolar depression where several other drugs failed; the price was quite high. Yes it fixed and controlled the depression. Yes it fixed the concentration laps that were part of the depression but over all I think it made things worse. But the sopping the drug became out of the question. Have now become quite dependent for the lack of a better word. Side effects in inducing but not limited to low libido, night seats and weird dreams, flattened emotional state, strange pains, heightened instances of anxiety, etc. If the drug is forgotten or tapered to too low a level the withdrawals kick in with a vengeance. There is the horrific withdrawals that includes some of the above plus

Generally it has controlled my chronic depression (monopolar) well. HOWEVER. The negative side. Whoa! There are withdrawals that are just brutal. Miss a dose or two and the punishment begins. First there is an electric shock like feeling with a ziiit-zfiit sound in my brain and the whole world seems to jump and rotate a few degrees to one side and back. Apparently others have named this brain shivers. Then I feel like my head is full of animals. Then I begin go get very - - very hostile, even dangerous. Was never like this before I started Effexor. If I stop taking this stuff,  this and more starts up within 36 hours or so. Taking the Effexor again will halt this but it seems like the withdrawals make it so that one can never get off this stuff even if the depression is going away. Jonesing on this stuff is very unpleasant.---Update..While it was at first quite effective in lifting or controlling monopolar depression where several other drugs failed; the price was quite high. Yes it fixed and controlled the depression. Yes it fixed the concentration laps that were part of the depression but over all I think it made things worse. But the sopping the drug became out of the question. Have now become quite dependent for the lack of a better word. Side effects in inducing but not limited to low libido, night seats and weird dreams, flattened emotional state, strange pains, heightened instances of anxiety, etc. If the drug is forgotten or tapered to too low a level the withdrawals kick in with a vengeance. There is the horrific withdrawals that includes some of the above plus

Horrible side effects; no improvement for me Hello,Before giving my review I Effexor, I want to say that every anti-depressant works differently for different people.  If Effexor is something promising for you, then, please, don't let my review stop you from giving it a try.That said... Effexor is notorious for causing migraines and flu-like symptoms.  I experienced both.  What's worse is that these symptoms become worse when a person tries to discontinue use.  Some people have reported having to take off weeks of work to recover.  In my case, I had terrible headaches, and I was an emotional wreck.  I could barely function for a week or so coming off of Effexor, and I still consider it to be one of my &quot;demon&quot; drug experiences.

Bladder dysfunction &amp; hospitilization After reaching therapeutic dose, I was no longer depressed but then I developed urinary retention resulting in abrupt discontinuance of Effexor and a 2 week hospitalization.  In addition, my right eye developed a continuous 24/7-eyelid tremor and blurred vision that caused me to have to see a neuro-ophthalmologist. After 2 weeks in the hospital, my bladder began to function normally.This was the worst drug related experience of my life.

good for a few months, then VERY BAD During the first 4 weeks of taking Effexor, I didn't really notice anything, except extreme nausea in the first week and sleepiness starting in the second week.  Dosage was increased to 75 mg three times a day over a 6 week period.  At this point I finally noticed some improvement in my depression.  By 8 weeks I was a very happy camper, maybe too happy sometimes.  However, this happy time lasted only about three or four months.  After that it was all down hill.  Not only did my depression gradually return, but the sleepiness side effect got out of control.  I almost lost my job.  To give you an idea of how bad it got, on my days off I would sleep sixteen hours a day.  On the days I had to work, I would get about ten hours of sleep and could hardly wait to go home to go back to sleep again.  I had to stop taking Effexor.  I decreased my dosage over three weeks.  It was pure hell.  Every time I decreased my dosage, I would have one day of uncontrollable crying and seriously wanting to die for 2 or 3 days.  I was also very nauseous.  I will NEVER take another SSNRI or SSRI again!  I've been taking one 150 mg Buproprion SR a day since August, and I'm doing fine.  I think part of my depression was/is from quitting smoking two and a half years ago.  I smoked for twenty years and finally quit using Bupropion.  I wrote a rating on that also.

Effexor I've been on Effexor for several years now.  My Dr put me on it after I stopped my addiction to opiates.  It took us several combinatins with other medications too till I finally found one that actually worked.  I take 5 37.5XR.  This with Wellbutrin finally made me feel &quot;normal&quot;.

Effexor Raises BP - which is WHY it HELPS Effexor was only helpful for CFIDS/FM or 'depression' because it has a side effect of RAISING BLOOD PRESSURE, and since I had PTSD &amp; panic attacks which were actually found to be NMH (Neurally Mediated Hypertension) - blood pressure drop caused by adrenaline (stress /shock induced)!!!  Once I got that understood &amp; under control &amp; also got anti-viral treatment, NO MORE DEPRESSION for almost 10 years now!!!! Also look into low blood volume, as I had that un-Dx'd too.  I take electrolyte water (SmartWater or FruitWater, 20oz daily, sip slowly) to moderate it also.  People with CFIDS &amp;/or Fibromyalgia typically have this! Also avoid triggers (toxins, perfumes, standing for more than 10 min, stress/adrenaline, etc).

Effexor I've been using Effexor for a month.  Only side effect is insomnia.  I switched from evening dosage to first thing in the AM.  Also, take an antihistamine for sleep.  No weight problems, no stomach upset.Very effective at releaving depression and sadness.  Am more receptive to therapy.

Effexor - A New World This drug has worked for me when others wouldn't -Paxil, Zoloft, Lithium and Elavil.  My main syptoms were: long term depression, anxiety, excessive worrying, insomnia, rages and mood swings.I feel like a new person and can now relax and enjoy life.  My insomnia is gone - used to average 5-6 hrs a night (if I was lucky) and can now sleep 8 or more (awakenings during the night are no longer a problem for me I can quickly go back to sleep.  The only side effects that I experienced were in the first few weeks - spaciness, intenstinal upsets and a bit of a speedy feeling.(my Dr. started me on 37.5 mg for first couple of weeks and then increased to 75 mg).  Sex has not been a problem since taking this med.  If anything my orgasms are more intense.  I do dream more but I don't find the dreams disturbing.

effexor did miracles for pain and  fatigue I have had CFIDS for over 3 years, and the symptoms have been progressing. This last year pain has become much worse, as well as stomach problems. I continue having cyclic viremas (flu-like symptoms) which unfortunately last sometimes for 3 months.  My CFIDS begun with a bad flu-cold and awful confusion in the afternoon, with deep fatigue.The year before I had chemotherapy, with shingles in the 4th cycle, and 6 weeks of radiation. My cancer is in remission, but living with CFIDS has been a rough ride.Effexor was prescribed to me by a rheumatologist for pain 2 months ago, the overall muscular and bone pain. Effexor DID wonders for me, and made me realize that pain IS regulated by brain. I always have known it, but feeling it is another thing. Effexor did help with pain in legs-feet and arm-hands. I have felt my feet with pleasure for the first time in years. My feet were quite numb before, but I felt the pains. Now I feel the pleasure of putting my socks on or taking a warm bath.Effexor did not helped with my spine pain, which usually progresses from the bottom up to the neck and can be very unpleasant, strong, burning. I begun taking Neurontin 3 days ago, on the assumption that this pain in the spine is post-herpetic. i had shingles 4 years ago.Effexor also helped with my sleep, and anxiety disorder. After a life of living with untreated anxiety, i realize now how important it is to attack this problem early in life, as untreated it leads to self-medicating substance abuse and organic illness.i am grateful for something to finally really help. I understand Effexor is not meant to help everything - my viremas are still quite debilitating, and so is post-exersional fatigue, but it is a new world to wake up without pain in the morning. Even when I do not fell 100%, I often fell like jump, dance, run.I have been taking Trazodone 50-100mg for sleep and it does help falling asleep, perhaps with Effex

Please avoid this drug! I have been taking anit-ds for over a decade and of the five drugs I have been on, none affected me the way this one did. I had to discontinue use because of &quot;cognitive slowdown.&quot; I forgot things constantly and it got steadily worse. Eventually I was having trouble remembering simple nouns. Getting off this drug was pure hell, one of the most difficult things I have ever undertaken, and two other people I know have had faced similar challenges. The rebound depression was unreal, I felt totally sick, I was so dizzy I was nauseated all the time and I came off it very slowly. I dropped my dose over the course of nearly 6 weekends. The worst part is that now that I am off it I feel like my tolerance for anxiety has been permanently tweaked. It's been nearly two years since I quit and still, when I get anxious my mind races in a way that I never experienced prior to this drug. It is really disappointing, and that is about the mildest way I can describe it. I hate over litigation, but I would sue the pants of this company if it could take this drug off the market. I know that all anti-ds have side effects and I am willing to put up with a lot. I have been hospitalized a couple times and anything is better than being depressed, except being on Effexor. It seems to have more bad press than anything but Paxil, and that leads me to think that my experiences were not completely out of the norm.

Beware: Withdrawals In retrospect I can see that I've been suffering from recurrent depression since high school (about 12 years ago), but I was never properly diagnosed until it got wretched and awful and painfully bad seven months ago. It felt like life was attacking me from every possible angle and going on Effexor was a wonderful relief. Felt like some heavy cloak had been lifted from me and I was able to deal with difficulties going on in my life as well as function in my work with children - I'm a teacher - as well as in my demanding master's program. Unfortunately, I stopped teaching in my district and, now being unemployed, have zero health benefits. In short, my prescription ran out, so I tried to wean myself. BAD IDEA. Please do not do this. I have suffered from unbearable withdrawals over the past week - it feels like much longer -  such as night sweats, nausea, vertigo-like dizzy spells, general feeling of bleh, and, yes, that ugly devil-headed monster: depression. Fortunately, my boyfriend got me an appointment with his psychiatrist to get me back in to be evaluated and hopefully get a new Rx for the drug. I haven't tried any other anti-depressants, as this has seemed to work pretty well for me. Maybe it lost a bit of its effectiveness the last month or two I was on it, but that could also have been other changes in my life affecting things. Does anybody else out there feel angry about having to take an anti-depressant? I do. And I don't like the idea of either A)having to be on this the rest of my life, or B) going through withdrawals that make me want to lay very still and disappear from existence once I decide to go off it again. Any feedback would be welcome.

Long-Term Effexor Success I have been taking Effexor since 1998, I believe.  First I was treated for post-partum depression at a dosage of 75mg.  In addition, I needed estrogen replacement therapy to address menopausal levels of estradiol according to blood tests.  I discontinued both treatments (over time)after six months with no withdrawal issues.  Since that time I have experienced bouts of depression (of varying severity) and each time have increased my dosage.  Most recently I am at 300mg of Effexor XR daily.  In addition, I take Trazodone and Klonopin at night to assist with restful sleep.Effexor has been extraordinarily effective for me with very few side effects (dry mouth, some initial anxiety upon dose increase).  I am quite wary of discontinuance given all of the withdrawal issues outlined here and by many others.  I did however address my concerns with my Pdoc who indicated that slow titration thru decreasing dosage and adding Prozac during the withdrawal process only has been very effective.  I have found other websites that provide this same prescription for Effexor withdrawal.We all have to find the combination of meds, talk therapy, support groups, and other things (ERT and light therapy for me) so that we attack our depression from all angles.  If you're looking for a support group try Recovery, Inc. which is based on cognitive behavioral therapy and has meetings all over the country/world.

Give it a trial if you must... This drug is likely the most 'potent' of the SNRIs.  Fun fact: It's a chemical second cousin to MDMA (Yes.. xtc).   It is generally profoundly effective for anyone who takes it, the problem is whether or not the side effects are worth the benefits.  I cannot say whether or not it is effective as a long term solution for anxiety or depression.  I took it for a full month course, tapering up and then immediately back down.  After three weeks of terrible insomnia and GI problems I decided this one wasn't for me...  I have also read several reports that it has some terrible withdrawals if you take it long enough.  If I could take back time I would have skipped this one.

Not Effective Effexor was ineffective on my depression and anxiety. Unpleasant side effects included severe intestinal gas, messy and unpleasant &quot;waste output&quot; and night sweats. I was able to lose a small amount of weight on this as opposed to Zoloft. I decided to stop wasting time and money on this stuff as it just didn't work. I'm now going through withdrawal from this stuff and it's been a nightmare - nausea, headaches, body shakes, nervousness, dizziness, and a general feeling like nobody likes me, everybody hates me, guess I'll go eat worms. I even had to put off a trip out of state to visit friends because of these withdrawal symptoms. If it works for you, great, but it certainly didn't like me.

Don't take it for relief of hot flashes I wish I had read this site before experimenting with Effexor XR. My doctor prescribed Effexor as a nonhormonal relief for hot flashes and the insomnia that accompany them at night. The recommendation to use Effexor for this purpose is backed up in Dr. Susan Love's book &quot;Dr. Susan Love's Menopause and Hormone Book.&quot; Studies show reduction of hot flashes by 40 percent more than a placebo. However, after 3 months usage, and increasing to 150 for a month, I have had very little relief of hot flashes and insomnia worsened. I took two weeks to taper from 150 to 75 to 37.5 before stopping this past week. It has been AWFUL! Dizziness, queasy stomach, nightmares,and insomnia is worse than ever. I take a Xanax to help me get to sleep, and it works very well, but then I am drowsy during the day. I don't know when this is going to end! After a year and a half off of PremPro, I am going back on the new low-dose, half of what I had taken for 3 years. There is no natural or nonhormonal drug that works for me. I came across a web site that claims to be a petition from users of Effexor to Wyeth-Ayerst Labs. to be more forthcoming about the withdrawal problems after tapering back or abruptly discontinuing Effexor. My advice is: find something else.

Effexor worked for me I am taking Effexor, Lamictal, and Seroquel for my bipolar disorder, and the Effexor has pretty much eliminated my depression.

EffexorXR I have been taking 75mg of EffexorXR for anxiety and panic disorder for 16 months.  Side-effects included slight jitters for the first few days, but once that wore off, I have experienced nothing but positive results.  I began seeing improvements within one-two weeks and by six months of treatment, all my symptoms were in complete remission.  The stress I endured prior to treatment, made my libido fairly non-existant.  After treatment,  my libido zipped back up to normal, because I was living an axiety/stress-free life!  It's allowed me to do all the things I enjoy in life, without the worry of a panic attack or anxious discomfort in crowds/public!

Not effective for CFS management I was put on Effexor by my doctor to help manage my Chronic Fatigue. Initially I was put on a very small dose (1/2 37.5mg tablet a day) and it seemed to help my fatigue. I had more energy, but I also had a major side effect for the first 2 weeks. Because I wasn't depressed the antidepressants actually caused a few manic episodes. Luckily they subsided after my body adjusted to the increased levels of seratonin. My doctor increased my dosage each week. After about a month Effexor stopped helping my Chronic Fatigue no matter how much the dosage was increased. I would not recommend Effexor for managing Chronic Fatigue.

use as a last resort i will admit that this drug pulled me out of my depression the quickest out of all i've tried, but there were some major drawbacks.for one, i wasn't on a mood stabilizer and so this med pushed me into mania.  none of it was that irritable, icky mania, but let's just say that a year and a half later i'm still paying of my credit card bills.first week or two were laden w/ insomnia, shakiness, general anxiety.worst part?  weaning yourself off of it.be prepared for intense headaches, nausea, lightheadedness and a little bit of dissociation.i ended up having to open up the capsules and just dump out a few beads over every few days... i thought i was weaned off because i had gone 2 days without it only to find that i wasn't AT ALL.my husband and i were sitting at a movie theatre half an hour away from home and he actually had to DRIVE BACK home to get me an effexor, which i promptly broke open, took about 4 beads, and felt better.now THAT is some crazy weaning, folks.

Missed doses I have been on Effexor for 7 months, and have found it to be very useful in relieving my symptoms of depression.  I haven't experienced any side effects, expect when I miss doses.  I often stay at my boyfriend's house (quite a distance from my own) and have forgotten to bring my pills with me.  Well I missed 5 days of taking the pills and on the 4th day, I felt horrible.  I felt extremely exhausted, and a strange dizzy feeling.  So whatever you do, don't miss any doses.

Don't stop this abruptly! Works great for my depression. I was on Prozac for many years for depression until I got dx with Bipolar Disorder a few years ago. The prozac wasn't working anymore and then I was put on many different antidepressants which never worked for me. Effexor worked right away. I might have put weight on from it...not sure what came first, me getting older and finally adding weight to my always slender frame, or the different meds and pigging out, or from just being a couch potato. I did stop taking this abruptly and WOW what a headache! Could not get out of bed for three days until it occured to me that I had played Doctor once again (I'm a nurse) and then took the Effexor and immediately I felt better! I am now listening to my Doctors (and my body) The Effexor has really helped me but everyone is different.

Bittersweet I've been on paxil, prozac, and celexa, and so far effexor is the only medication that has given me some relief. That doesn't mean I'm depression free though. Sometimes I'm just not able to function and dread having to interact with people. Still, I have a lot more productive days on this drug than I had on the other ones. Only now are the side effects starting to bother me. I will have rapid heart beats and throbbing headaches for no reason and I have had a few severe anxiety attacks. I wouldn't reccommed it unless you're aware of the side effects and prepared to deal with them.

Mixed Feelings I had been on several SSRIs before going on to Effexor.  Of the SSRIs I used, this was the most effective in helping stabilise (note that I don't say lift) my mood, BUT it was also the one that I experienced the most side effects from.I had extreme sweating (even in cold weather), felt nauseous constantly, experienced 'head-shakes' (sort of, but not exactly dizziness - it's similar,  but feels more like a switch is being toggled on and off in your brain), could only sleep with sleeping tablets, felt very irritable and 'twitchy' all the time and was super-anxious.When I did sleep, I would have extremely vivid, nightmarish dreams.  My partner says that I talked in my sleep constantly, often screamed and yelled, and could become quite violent in my sleep depending on what I was dreaming about (I apparently punched him while I was asleep on at least 2 occasions).  I have since found out that some other people who have been on Effexor have had similar experiences.Although Effexor didn't percievably lift my mood or get me to the point of being 'functional' again, it stabilised me enough that other forms of treatment (eg. therapy &amp; aromatherapy) could begin to be effective.   However, the side effects were more than I could bear long term, and eventually I made the decision to wean myself off them and use other forms of treatment instead.  Having said that, though, I would still recommend that a person with severe depression take an SSRI like Effexor to stop them spiralling downwards and to stabilise them BEFORE trying other methods. NB: DO NOT stop this medication suddenly, as there can be adverse effects.

Effexor works well, despite side effects Effexor has been helping my anxiety and depression for 8 months now. At first I felt a bit nauseous, but that has long since passed. I do notice weight gain and sweating to be the main side effects that I have...but due to my increased happiness and decreased fatigue, I still consider this drug very very worthwhile!

So far effective with very few side effects Based on other reviews and things I'd heard, I was somewhat apprehensive about bad side effects from Effexor.  So far I have not noticed any but slight sleepiness, which I alleviated by taking it at night rather than in the morning.  Also now that I am up to 150 mg (for 3 weeks now after ramping up slowly for 3 weeks...1 wk @ 37.5, 1 wk @ 75, 1 wk @ 112.5 first) I think the sleepiness is a little less than at lower dosages, perhaps as the norepinephrine effects begin to kick in.I chose Effexor for the SNRI component as Wellbutrin had really been helping me but I am allergic to it (I get skin rashes).  So far my mood is very good - not euphoric, but stable and upbeat.  When I was first ramping up I felt extreme anxiety right before I was supposed to take it (it &quot;let me know&quot; it was time...) but that has waned since my dosage has stayed the same for a few weeks.  I will re-review after a while if it changes effectiveness, but so far it works much better for me than an SSRI (Celexa) alone.  I hope I don't have the weight gain issue I had on Celexa; so far I'm about the same and have actually just increased my exercise regimen so perhaps that will help.N/A for Cost Effectiveness since my copay is the same for all of these medications.I should also mention that I take 36 mg Concera (time-released Ritalin) for ADD during the day, and that may contribute to my lack of daytime sleepiness.

worked okay for a couple of months This drug worked great for the first couple of months i used it.  I had used two other SSRIs before and this is the first one I had success with.  With the exception of making me a little dizzy, it worked great and helped relieve my anxiety.  After a couple months, however, I became very jitty, anxious, and had trouble sleeping.  Its effectiveness seemed to disappear.  Now I'm trying to get off of it, and the withdrawal effects are terrible - lots of depression and anxiety.  Effexor is great for a short period of time, but I don't suggest taking it over the long term!

It helps I have been taking Effexor for a year now and I find that I feel better. Not great but better :)My mind can tell me if I'm late taking this medication. This is the hardest part of taking this drug. My brain feels like a computer downloading or uploading information. I hate the feeling I get so I take the medication and in just a short time I feel ok. If I leave the house I make sure I have them on me. Sometimes I spend the night away from home and I panic if I don't have my meds in the morning. Heck...I could not drive home if I did not take it.

Effexor really helped me. When I first started having panic attacks I didn't know what they were.  After multiple trips to the er and the doctor's office a friend of mine told me she thought I was having an anxiety problem.  I was 30 yrs old and had never had a problem before.  I was started on effexor and within 4 wks I could tell a differnce and after 6 weeks my panic attacks were under control. I haven't experienced any side effects and my family is finally back to normal. One word of caution though...this medicine can cause your blood pressure to go up...so if you have hypertension it may not be a good choice.

?????????? I took Eskalith CR for about six months or so and the only thing I can say about it is nothing at all. It had no affect on my mental state; as for physical, well, that's a different story. I already suffer from edema and take water pills regularly but when I started taking Eskalith, I swelled up like a balloon. My skin became so stretched due to the enormous water retention that it actually started to split open! My doctor,who was seeing me on a weekly basis, didn't believe that I was even taking the Eskalith because she said that in all her years of practice she had never seen anybody not respond to it at all. That was until I was admitted into the mental hospital and she saw that I was taking the medication every day and it still did nothing to me. So I went off of it and she put me on something else.

One of the best I started taking Effexor XR a couple of years ago, and have had very good results with it. I have tried almost every drug there is on the market for Bipolar Disorder, and found that Effexor works the best for me. I am very thankful for it. I have experienced the withdrawal syndrome-which was not good, only because I forgot to take it one day. However, I feel that the benefits of Effexor are too profound for me to ever want to stop taking it. I have been hospitalized in the past for suicide attempts, etc. and with Effexor I have held the same job for over three years and have not experienced suicidal ideations which used to plague me constantly. Needless to say, I have not had to be hospitalized these years on Effexor either. So, for me...Effexor is a wonder drug!

Tried Effexor Twice I used Effexor twice, in combination with Remeron.  Effexor helped after about the first month, but the side effects started to become bigger and the antidepressant benefits diminished at the same time.  I call it SideEFFEXOR. My side effects were: shakiness, skin left off medicine odor, foggy, headache, energized/insomnia, and increased blood pressure at high dose.  Although when the SSRI's don't work, and you can't tolerate a Tricyclic antidepressant, Effexor is the next best thing.  Discontinuation is a long and major ordeal.

Seems to be working We just upped the dose to the next level a week ago, but it seems to make me more animated and less morose.  Vivid dreams are frequent, but that's fine with me.  It does change my sense of taste and smell to a degree, but less than Lexapro.  I'm still fatigued and suffering from insomnia, but I've been like that for over 10 years, and it's not going to change overnight.

withdrawal symptoms After taking effexor xr for 6 months the situations causing my depression were remedied otherwise. When I tried to stop taking the medication, 4 days without medication, I became extremely dizzy and had excessive night sweats. I have called dr to be slowly weaned from this medication but have read many horror stories about never getting away from withdrawal symptoms. If taking this medication or thinking of taking it please get all the info about stopping this drug in the future. If I had known the severity of the withdrawal symptoms I would have opted for another antdepressant.

my son Jake Effexor was a drug my son was put on for Bipolar disorder. This drug made my son sleep almost through the whole summer. Every time we traveled in the car, Jake fell asleep. He fell asleep at home frequently too. He did not have many mood problems-because he couldn't stay awake!Kel.

Effexor side effects Works good for raising my mood, but way too many side effects, peeing too much, sweating, dry mouth, fast heart beat.

Mixed Emotions Out of all the antidepressants I've tried, this one works best for me.  However, the jaw clenching is horrific. I also experience insomnia, but the Effexor counters that because I still have energy.  It's weird.  It's almost like an amphetamine.Anyway, I take this in addition to Xanax (highly rated).  Apparently I'm depressed because every doctor wants to prescribe me an antidepressant.   I am a very upbeat, outgoing person, but the doctors insists that I am depressed.  Even though I smile and laugh, I'm apparently crying on the inside.  That's what I've been told even though I do everything but scream...I AM NOT DEPRESSED!  I suffer from anxiety attacks. I've tried four different doctors who were not associated, and I always get a diagnosis of depression w/GAD, and a prescription for antidepressants.  It seems like the whole world is on antidepressants.  Its harder to get penicillin for a virus, than it is an antidepressant.I understand doctors reluctance to prescribe a benzo, but if they work better for the patient than an antidepressant, than why can't they listen to their patients??  I only take my Xanax when needed. I always have some left when my prescription should have ran out.  I show this to my doctor so he can see I don't abuse it.  I like the Effexor as far as it does seem to give me a heightened since of perception, I just get scared/frustrated with the jaw clenching, yawning and insomnia, that I go off of it sporadically.  I mainly stay on the Effexor to appease my doctor so that he will let me continue with my Xanax.

Effexor XR for EDS I've been complaining of excessive daytime sleepiness for years..  since i was a teenager. I'm now 32 &amp; finally talked to my Dr about it. She prescribed Effexor XR due to its stimulant effect. I also complained of low libido. She said that this would help it. Well.. she was right on both counts. I don't worry about falling asleep at the wheel anymore and my husband thinks someone has taken over my mind due to the need for more *relations*..  we're making up for lost time. LOL! I thought my Dr was nuts for RX Effexor XR to me for these two reasons.. turns out she knew what she was talking about.. I am VERY surprised at  how it's helped me. It's pretty expensive, though. Runs around 100 to 118.00 depending on where you get it for a 30 day supply. So hopefully if you do end up getting this then you'll have Insurance. Ask for samples from the Dr first. My Dr gave me 5 weeks worth. Also..  i have read that coming off the Effexor is quite difficult. I hope it continues to help me so that I won't have to experience any of the withdrawals. Then again.. if you follow the Drs advice on coming off of it then you should be okay. Can't think of anything else to say about it. Oh. I've been taking it for 2 months now. It helped the EDS by day 2 &amp; the libido by week 4. I only felt a slight bit of nausia when i began the med and a little bit of constipation. You can always eat fiber to help with that.

Effexor - Is it effective I've been taking this for several months, and am not sure as to how effective it is.  One big negative is the sexual dysfunction side effect.  I am now also taking welbutrin but may go back for another change.

Effexor I took this for a long time, then about a year ago it quit working for me. After trying many things (mostly SSRI's) I'm back on it again, though I have to wonder if trying all of those SSRI's didn't bring on bipolar disorder. I'm not sure it's helping; had to reduce it from 225mg to 150mg b/c it was causing mania.

HATE    I hate this drug.  It is bad enough to depend on a drug because I am bipolar, but to be chemically addicted as well IS BEYOND BELIEF.  I have tolerated and subdued my feeling about this because the drug has been effective.  But can you imagine what it is like to be stuck somewhere over night and having to run to a pharmacy and be for a pill so you don't experience withdrawal!My current cocktail is Effexor, lithium and lamictal.  The idea was (is?)to add the Lamictal and lower the Effexor.  But trying to reduce form 75mg to 35.5 mg induced the withdrawal symptoms. There was an additional weight gain (first weight gain was from lithium) and extreme tiredness.  I found myself falling assssssssleep at the wheel while driving or having a very difficult time at work staying awake.  I fell asleep at meetings and snored!  I wound up having to take provigil when i needed to drive the car.

Effexor This is the only antidepressant that works for me and I have tried many.  I believe it is the dual effect on both the seratonin and norepinephine recpetors that enhances its effectiveness.  I am a bipolar patient and the drug has not produced hypomanic or manic symptoms and I have been using the drug since 1990.

Working Pretty Well I've used Effexor XR for a little over a year now, and it's working pretty well. I'm starting to notice some breakthrough symptoms, so maybe it's time for a dose bump. Early side effects included jaw clenching and insomnia. Gone now. Weight gain has been a problem, but everything makes me gain weight, so no big surprise there.

Mania and bad withdrawal This medicine put me in the hospital because of a manic episode I experienced while taking it.  After I got off of it having endured nausea and other awful side effects, I did come down from the mania.  I realized that when I felt less depressed on the Effexor XR that I was building up to a manic episode.  It wasn't helpful for my anxiety.

triggered manic episodes Took as treatment for depression but after the second week and increased dosage to 75mg XR, I had manic episodes, practically no sleep for a week and totally wired like I was on amphetamines. Eventually my mood turned into an irritable one, and I was strangely aggressive.  Moved to Zoloft instead yet still had manic episodes, but not as bad as Effexor.  Now using Zyprexa and Zoloft and feel great. Zoloft DID fix the depression, though.  I felt energized and positive after weeks of crying my eyes out everyday in depression.  It was a huge relief, just not the right medicine for bipolar as I discovered the hard way.

Effexor I started using Effexor for depression although I am also dealing with other problems.  For me, I haven't seen significant, noticeable improvements in myself since I've started it.  Maybe a few positive spurts here and there, but they always fade away and go back to depression.  I think I am going to discontinue the drug soon.  But, do not take this rating the wrong way, because different medications work for different people and I think effexor is a great medication to take because it has a low amount of side effects.  The only major side effect I experience is tremors in my hands and the rest of my body is shaky in general.  That is why I would recommend effexor over some of the other antidepressants, because they have a higher number of side effects and more serious side effects as well.
effexor	Depression	2004-09-04 00:00:00		2.0	3.5	3.0	2.5	Effexor I started using Effexor for depression although I am also dealing with other problems.  For me, I haven't seen significant, noticeable improvements in myself since I've started it.  Maybe a few positive spurts here and there, but they always fade away and go back to depression.  I think I am going to discontinue the drug soon.

Help! My soon to be ex-husband has been taking Effexor since Mid-April.  He had an immediate negative personality change.  He has since become suicidal.  He believes that he is just a terrible person at heart and that his med has brought out the real him.  Please think long and hard before you ruin your life and all the lives of the people that love you.

Effexor I've used Effexor for several months and it takes the &quot;bite&quot; out of my attitude.  I would not call it a mood elevating drug, it's more like something that smooths out all of one's rough edges, and anxiety.

Effexor XR 225mg Daily My relationship with Effexor began over two years ago. At the time I started with Effexor, I had been suffering from a major depressive disorder for very close to two years. Although it helped somewhat, Effexor was not a wonder drug for me - the daily struggle was always there despite the relatively high dose I was taking. In terms of concrete improvement of mood, I could hardly detect any. I feel this drug enabled me to fight my battles with depression without actually taking away or alleviating the very real daily need to struggle with it. In other words, Effexor armed me with a dagger, but did not take away the war. On Effexor, I still very much had my dark days.The side effects of Effexor are not slight. Sleepiness and sedation, brain-fog, severe night sweats where I would wake up drenched and lying in puddles, strange and vivid nightmares, constipation, and, most frustrating of all, an inability to orgasm.Effexor took the edge off some of the intense and insane levels of psychic pain I was feeling, but only by rendering me somewhat sedated. It often took enormous amounts of sheer will power and determination for me to overcome the sleepy, sedated feeling every day and go out to get work done or interact with people. As for the sexual side effects, they played a huge part in sabotaging and eventually destroying a long-term relationship I was involved in at the time, especially since I was unaware that the sexual dysfunction was a cause of the medication.All that said, though, I feel Effexor did play a pivotal part in helping me cope. I was on Effexor everyday for over two years. I will never know for sure, but I may not have made it this far without Effexor, despite all its terrible side effects and the fact that it seemed to help only slightly for me. Certainly at the time I started it, the slight help it offered me was far better an option than the utter hopelessness and futility of a future filled with nothing but pain.I

A bad joke The first day I had effexor (18.75mg) I went into a stuporous shut down state after an hour of taking it. My pupils dilated .This improved as the days went by. Despite the fact that my mood improved I was racked by side effects including the well known  &quot;shocks&quot; (a flash of white light in my eyes and everything remained white for a second or two). This occurred on 18.75mg! I thought it was outrageous and advised my shrink that I was discontinuing it immediately. Then the hideous withdrawl. It took about 3 weeks and  I had to take 4 days off work and had to lie in bed. Eventually I took a small amount of Zyprexa/olanzapine (5mg) and woke up the next day feeling alot better. I have to add that I wasn't on the slow release. My father and sister are, and they find it fantastic. Different horses for different courses. But for me, it was like I was allergic to the stuff. Never again, it was like a bad joke.

Effexor It helped me but then my body got used to it.  The worst part was trying to come off of the med, it is highly addictive - you definitely have to go on something else.

Effexor's Ghosts My GP put me on Effexor for depression.  This was 8 months before I was sent to a psychiatrist who finally diagnosed me as being bipolar.  I was on Effexor for a total of three months.  During that time, I suffered tremendously.  The side-effects that were most debilitating were the dry-mouth, the horrible nightmares, and the night-time jerks.  With time, the nightmares became so horrifyingly vivid and terrifying to me, that when I was able to awaken myself from them, I would turn on all the lights in the house, huddling next to my husband on the bed in fear.  The night-time jerks increased until I began having seizures in my sleep.  I suffer from a seizure disorder, but have never in my life had seizures in my sleep.  My depression deepened due to the sleep disruption.  My doctor put me on medication to allow me to sleep, but that made me not be able to awaken myself from the evil dreams as easily.I suffered nausea and diarrhea when I began tapering off the dosage.  However, the dreams immediately began to lessen, as did my anxiety.

Clinically Depressed No More I've been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder with a mood disorder as well, my symtoms are basically my moods fluctuate between depression and anxiety.  I began taking 225mg of effexor/day a few years ago and have been relieved of depression and no longer suffered a panic attack since I've taking the medication.  I recently tried to switch to wellbutrin which didn't help me at all (Wellbutrin doesn't affect serotonin) and yes Effexor was difficult to ween off of.  However the side effects that some people experience do not happen to me.  My experience with effexor has been side affect free.

Works so far I've been on many antidepressants and after being on them for a length of time they lost their effectiveness.  So far with Effexor it's working great!  Only time will tell if it loses it's effectiveness also.I do notice that if I skip a dose I get nauseaous and VERY dizzy.  So beware of that.  At least I remember to take it if I start getting dizzy!

Please think before getting on this medicine I was diagnosed with anxiety about 2 1/2 years ago and was put on Paxil which worked ok but just wasn't quite right. My doctor put me on Effexor next. It was wonderful as far as not having panic attacks anymore but the results now are that I can't lose weight no matter what diet I am on or if I am exercising so I decided to stop the Effexor. The side effects are horrible. I am dizzy, sick, have headaches, and can't even think straight have the time,sweat all the time, high blood pressure and grinding teeth and jerking while sleeping at night, severe grouchiness and also it is an emotional roller coaster. No one tells you about the side effects of getting off medicine when you start taking it. I would rather have panic attacks every day than be on a medicine that I can not get off of. I am trying a herbal medicine called Happy Camper right now to help with some of the side effects. Please anyone who reads this please reconsider getting on any type of medicine like this it is not worth what you have to go through getting off. The doctors say that it is not addicting but I definetly disagree. It became a crutch in my life that I thought that I couldn't live without. Now I am worse off than I was in the beginning. God Bless!!

Erectile dysfunction and withdrawal: NO JOKE I was on Effexor for a year and spent the subsequent year trying to get off it. This drug, at least at 300mg a day, made a sex life impossible, so it had to go (despite the fact that it really worked for my anxiety and depression). Getting off it was no simple matter, however. My withdrawal symptoms were nothing short of nightmarish--it took me three determined attempts to finally survive them (my final and successful attempt lasted 3 weeks--it was hell!). Now that I'm off it, the libido is back, but so is the anxiety and depression, so I'm searching for an effective alternative with acceptable side FX. No simple matter, as you may well know. In summary, Effexor is an effective antianxiety med with intolerable sideFX.

Very powerful anti-depressant OK, let me start by saying i have a hardcore case of major depression and have tried various treatments for it for years.  Paxil did nothing, zoloft helped some. Prozac helped for a sort time. despramine worked mildly, ect, ect, ect. so anyway, I tried effexor xr and it has been a breakthrough for me.  it's helped very much with 20mg ritalin and 1000mg depakote. i'm back to 'normal'.  I have the energy and motivation/ambition to do the things i would have done if i wasnt so depressed before.  However,  there is  a problem.  I cant do without my effexor for even a day.  i get major headaches if i do and irritability.  Ive been told by people that prolonged periods without effexor could lead to strange 'brain squirming' sensations... eeew nasty.  but the most disconcerting thing i recently found out from the website maintained by the manufacturers of the drug is that some people get what they call 'withdrawal syndrome'.  That basically translates to mean: permanent withdrawal symptoms.  that is to say i may be chronically hooked on this sh*t for the rest of my life now since i've started to take it.  omg... help?

Best so far... I've been on Effexor for FM for several years.  It has helped much with the pain and sleeping.  I work full time and have 2 active kids.  Other meds I have tried didn't work this well.  The only thing I don't like is the cost and the weight gain.  I think it affects my sex drive too - but that could be the kids!

Works Great! Effexor has worked great for major depression.  I had a lot of success with Wellbutrin and then had a seizure due to a drug interaction with Nortryptylene.  I tried Lexapro which curbed my appetite but didn't help my depression.  I switched to Effexor, am taking 225 mg and am feeling back to my old self.  I encourage others who read the horror stories to not be afraid and to give it a try.  I've had no side effects, am losing weight and feel this drug is very effective.  Everyone's different and maybe the people who write the horrible stuff about Effexor are those who found it intolerable.  That's why I wanted to write in and share my success!

Effexor Helpful but not wonderful. I had side effects at 150mg per day. so I moved back to 75mg per day.Side effects subsided. Effexor really messed up my sleeping patterns.  I could not get sleepy until 1 AM to 3 AM in morning.

Escaping Effexor While taking this drug I have had close to no libido.  Other side effects I had were: vision problems, excessive sweating.  When I first started taking the medication I felt better, but nevertheless I had breakthrough bouts with depression and anxiety.  I just recently realized that I really don't want to be taking this medication, and I'm thankful that my doctor prescribes me Wellbutrin in order to make the withdrawal effects of Effexor more bearable.

Effexor- good and bad points I took effexor for about 13-14 months to help take the edge off of my OCD.  Whereas Effexor can be good at easing the anxiety of my problems with obsessing, it was not too effective with some of my OCD... then again I was on a low dose.  Also please be very sure to think twice before taking the medication as it can be INCREDIBLY difficult for some to wean off of (even a super low dose).  I did it the wrong way... I simply took half of the pellets out of the gelcap for about a month before stopping cold turkey... even at a low dose, this was a very big mistake as it is still cold turkey and I experienced painful withdrawals.  I also beleive that tapering off the Effexor so fast possibly kindled my untreated BP and left me vulnerable to a severe agitated depression, ironic as it sounds.  I recall being hypomanic for about a month after finishing it before stress took me out into the worst agitated depression I've ever experienced.  Was the effexor withdrawal a catalyst for this? Maybe, maybe not. The bottom line is this is a good medication, make no mistake... BUT, keep in mind that withdrawal can be difficult.

Best mood lift, problem side effects I took Effexor XR 150 mg for about a year and a half,and for several months I felt really great even during a very difficult time. Of the many anti-depressants I've tried it definitely lifted my mood the most, and I felt less sensitive and weepy than at any other time in my life.Unfortunately it began to really lose effectiveness for me at about the year mark, and my side effects bothered me enough that I was concerned about increasing the dose. Like so many a-d meds it decreased my libido a lot (sigh).  When I ramped down I noticed my sex drive increasing even as I was quite depressed.Another odd thing is that my fasting blood cholesterol went up a LOT (180 to 270)in one year while I was on Effexor. My doctor didn't catch the connection, but when I went to the Effexor XR website it listed increased cholesterol as a potential side effect. I haven't had a re-check yet, so I can't tell for sure if it's related.  That made me incredibly reluctant to up the dose to feel better.I really wish anything made me feel as good as Effexor. I may go back on eventually.

Calm Energy I've read several negative reviews/comments about Effexor, and hardly any positive, so I had to add my story. I've taken 225mg/day for about the last year (started at 37.5mg and increased from there) for OCD, GAD and secondary depression. When the OCD gets out of hand, usually due to increased stress, I supplement with Klonopin. This has been a miracle for me. It knocked the worthless/hopeless feelings out within the first 3-4 months and has significantly cut back the frequency/severity of the anxiety. Prior to Effexor, I had only received treatment from a Psychologist, but no meds. She recommended that I see a Psychiatrist and begin an antidepressant, but I wanted to avoid this if at all possible (due to insurance at the time and a bit of denial). So I continued the &quot;behavior therapy&quot; for several years, and did the best I could with that. Then the company I was working for closed, so I lost my job and became so depressed that it took every bit of energy I had to get out of bed and pick my kids up from school. I put off going to the doctor because I just couldn't motivate myself, or see the point in going. It seemed to feed off itself, the more time passed, the more withdrawn I became. I didn't think I deserved the air I was breathing. So I stayed in my house and away from other people as much as possible, which kicked the OCD into high gear. That was about two years ago, and now I what I feel is a &quot;calm energy&quot;. That's the best way I can describe it. I'm back to working full-time and running the kids here and there, etc. I didn't see how a person could have an anxiety disorder and need calming down, yet be depressed and need energizing. I thought I certainly couldn't be helped, but thankfully I was wrong. There were some side effects in the beginning, nausea, upset stomach, seeing &quot;tracers&quot; or blurriness, especially in dim light. Those are gone now for the most part.

It works for me. I have taken Effexor for two years and I glad to have my life back. Depression took me down a long road of denial and suicide attempts. After one month I felt back to normal. The cost has proven to be a challenge. I have had several periods without medical insurance and the purchase price is very high. But the price is worth keeping my life. I have gone off of it several times for a week or two at a time and I can definitely tell the difference. Not to mention I experienced these wierd almost electrical feelings shooting through my body.

Read this if you are considering taking XR 8/4/04- I began my adventure with depression and anxiety on May 5.  I had no prior treatment for depression and anxiety.  My doctor prescribed 20mg Prozac.  The depression and anxiety subsided substantially.  I felt great, really great, but had absolutely no sex drive.  On July 7, I began Effexor XR 37.5mg for the first week and increasing to 75mg after that.  I was restless at night; not sleeping at all, interrupted sleep, tossing and turning, and night sweats.  I was anxious during the day.  I felt like I was on speed.  I had heart palpitations, mild dizziness, and inability to focus.  I was constantly fatigued.  After about 2 weeks of Effexor XR I began having mild anxiety attacks in the afternoons that seemed to increase in severity daily.  I met with my doctor more frequently.  I thought this would stop after a few weeks, but it seemed to get worse.  I went back to the doctor 8/3 shortly following a severe panic attack at work.  (My coworkers probably think Im completely insane.)  The side effects are not be the same for everyone, but please be cautious with this drug.

Glad I Quit When I Did I had searched for years for &quot;my&quot; perfect anti-depressant.  I finally found it in Wellbutrin.  However after being on it for less than a year I moved to England only to discover they don't prescribe it for depression, smoking cessation only.  This is when I got on Effexor.  It helped with the depression after about 3 months with not too many terrible side effects.  But getting OFF....oh my God.   H E L P !  Is this normal?  I started tapering off by taking 1/2 dose for about 10 days, then went to 1/2 dose every other day for a week.  I've been off it completely for 2 weeks and having migraine headaches from hell, unbelievable FATIGUE, body aches....i feel as tho i have aged 15 years in 2 weeks and at my age, i can't afford that crap !Have others experienced these same side effects?

Lexapro to Effexor...Life is good. I have GAD. I was on Paxil 25mg for about two years.  I gained 45 pounds, so my psydoc thought I should go to Lexapro.  I had tried Wellbutrin, but I had gotten an Allergic reaction.  I was on Lexapro 10mg for a little over three months.  I experienced fogginess and a severe headache also pretty bad stomach cramping.  I also gained another five pounds.  I was irritable and constantly tired.  Two naps a day, and I was still in bed at 9pm.Then my doctor prescribed Effexor.  I had two friends who went on Effexor after Celexa gave them gi upset.  They love Effexor.  One is at 75mg a day, and the other is at 150mg.  They skip doses every now and then, and they have never had any of the withdrawal symptoms mentioned here.  I was a little hesitant because I've read such bad news about it on the internet.  But, even before I weaned myself from Lexapro (5mg three days) I went and took my first Effexor.  The first day I slept.  I think it was more the Lexapro than the Effexor.  The second day I was raring to go.  No side effects at all.  As a matter of fact, the fogginess was subsiding, and so was the sleepiness.  I was feeling more myself than when I was on Paxil!The third day was fine also.  As for anxiety?  I usually get anxious just thinking about planes or having one of my kids get ill.  Well, one of my kids had to receive his immunizations (which would have caused me to panic big time), but I was rational and calm (just what he needed).  Hardly any bad thoughts entered, and the ones that did creep in, I knew I could deal with the situation.    I am getting my house clean.  Before I was so tired that doing a load of laundry was a chore.  I feel as though I am still myself with my emotions intact.  Before, I was a zombie.  I truly feel as though this is who I am, or was before my anxieties started taking over my life.As for sex?  With Paxil and Lexapro, I was just too darn tired.  The drive was still there.

Suffered from depression all of my adult life. since 19 now, 37.  1st anti depressant was given to me after I had suffered for 7 years, almost housebound - clomipramine, was fantastic..the real me without all the added 'extras' but put on 4 stone (dress size 10 - 22) within a few months, after a while this became a major issue, so I was put on Seroxat (paroxetine) didn't feel as well, but still after 7 years of nightmare it was good enough, felt I could at least function.   Stayed on that for 10 yrs until I finally had to admit, as I was about to lose my 3rd long term relationship with the man whom I had decided to finally try to have children with...that I was just not normal enough to be with another person.  I tried to get help- in uk, Nation Health Service - you need help now? unfortunately u wait 6 months to see a psychiatrist -  was put on Venlaflaxine (Effexor) 75mg initially, 1st  3, 4 days losing my mind, then 150mg better, then up to 225 very anxious, and having obsessive thoughts losing it  - unfortunately my partner just couldn't take any more - I totally crack up.  Now on imipramine for 1 week, but the effects of coming off the Effexor are still foremost.  Have not felt this bad since I was 19.  Please, if there is an alternative, stay away from Effexor.  Don't know yet what will happen with imipramine. I'm very drowsy, sound like ozzy ozbourne when i speak!  Stay away from Effexor.

MDMA (ECSTACY), HYPOTHYROIDISM, EFFEXOR Okay, first off I would like to say that I have tried only one recreational drug... ever. This is 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine, also known as MDMA, also known as ecstacy.. the raver's drug of choice. I have only done it five times, which can seem like a lot to someone who has never tried it. I must say that effexor is the closest thing to MDMA I have ever tried in an antidepressant, minus the majorly increased heart rate. I even feel like I have what are called &quot;roll headaches&quot; a few hours after I have taken it (where it feels like the back of my head is sort of hollow... like an indefinable area of my head is aching). My pupils are dilated, just like on MDMA; I am definitely more chatty, like on MDMA; lights seem more beautiful, like on MDMA; I feel dizzy and a bit spaced out for a while and the world just seems to be a brighter, happier place. I have also been on Prozac before I tried MDMA for the first time but I do not recall anything like this! So it makes you wonder what it's actually doing to your brain for the effects to be so similar to a schedule 1 drug. I will never do MDMA again, and I plan to never take effexor again, either. The effects of both are so similar it scares me to take this medication.I complained of being tired all the time, and of having symptoms of depression and anxiety to my doctor, and he suggested that I have some blood work done to test for HYPOTHYROIDISM. AM I EVER GLAD HE DID THAT!! Turns out, that was the problem all along! NOT depression or anxiety, so the effexor was not even needed. I bet all of you didn't know that thyroid disorders are one of the most misdiagnosed conditions ever!!! A lot of the depression and anxiety cases in America today are a result of unbalanced thyroid levels. I encourage all of you to have your thyroid checked. When your thyroid levels are off, EVERYTHING in your body is off, including the serotonin, norephinephrine, and dopamine levels in your br

Worked wonders but the side effects!!! I used Effexor 75 mg for two years.  I was extremely depressed when I began using the drug and the depression lifted and has not returned.  However, I gained almost 20 pounds, I have been feeling tired and have had swollen lymph nodes for the last several months, with severe flu-like symptoms.  My doctor did not know what was wrong and was going to perform a biopsy when I saw some literature about effexor side efects.  I began slowly stopping the drug and the lymph node has gotten smaller and the negative side effects lessened dramatically.  Although it helped my depression, I cannot wait to be off of this drug.  The side effects are worse than the depression, especially the weight gain and flu-like symptoms!!

addictive this was the fourth anti-depressant i was prescribed over a 4.5 year period - actual problem was hyperparathyroidism resolved through successful surgery - ongoing side effects of Effexor XR included high blood pressure, anxiety, inability to concentrate - compounded by extremely unpleasant gastro-intestinal distress upon startup and discontinuance - every anti-depressant is ADDICTIVE - i cannot recommend any except for most extreme cases of bi-polar illnesses.

withdrawal symptoms I don't normally have withdrawal symptoms, but I had them with Effexor XR.  I would never take the drug again because of the difficult withdrawal. I had both vomiting &amp; diarrhea for a couple of weeks, even with gradual decrease in dosage.

Brought me out the quickest! Effexor jolted me out of depression quicker than any other antidepressant I tried.  However, being bipolar, I was thrust into hypomania repeatedly while on this drug; therefore, it was eventually decided to discontinue this treatment.  Great drug, however, for depression, in my experience.

Effexor This is an excellent drug for both depression and chronic fatique. I experienced little to no side effects and an immediate boost in my energy level and concentration. I do not think this drug is very effective with treating anxiety - other drugs may need to be added like xanax or klonopin.

Venlafaxine 225mg 4 years plus I've been on 225mg Venalfaxine slow release for 4 years. It got me back to work after 8 months absence, and I've been working ever since.I still get depressed, but not so bad that I can't go to work. I'm also on Lithium, and it's hard to know which has the most benefit, as both seem to work well for me.My side effects are weight gain and frequent urination, but I think this is a small price to pay for being able to go to work to feed the family.I'm now hoping for something to deal with the residual depression, and am starting out on quetiapine.

Effexor My only fear is how to pay for it when my insurance no longer covers it.  I feel I cannot move to another state and lose insurance due to high cost.  Another fear are the problems people report in getting off it.  I tried a slightly lower dose and felt very sick the first day.

Effexor For Me I've been on Effexor just over 5yrs, and I have found, for me, that it works best when taken with a mood stabilizer. The only times I have experienced any side effects were when I first started taking it, but after a while the side effects subside.

More isn't always better Effexor helped me gain energy and I felt less depressed; however, when my dose was increased from three 75mg to FOUR 75mg a day I became overly frightened.  After being embarrassed several times (and it happening by self also) I asked to decrease my dose.  I would be somewhere and some routine thing would occur and I would jump.

What's a shrink really for? I had a pretty good experience with effexor.  For three years 300 mg xr stablized my mood and dealt with my depression.  I did suffer some side effects (which might be muddled because I was taking Wellbutrin as well) including night sweats, distortion of vision, headaches if I didn't get regular sleep.  All of which I could deal with pretty reasonably.  After three years I decided to wean myself off of my medication (with the support of a psychologist) because I felt like I needed a frame of reference.  I started with the effexor.  I went from 300mg to 225 and after 11 days went down another 75 mg and seemed to be doing fine.  I was experiencing some irritability and some sleeplessness and quite a boost to my libido (I didn't know I wanted it until I got it back. hehe).  Two days after the 44th day when I went down to nothing, I fell extremely ill.  I had waves of extreme nausea, extreme sensitivity to smell and temperatures, chills, diarreah, 'brain shivers,' extreme hunger, a big lack of coordination, sleeplessness, nightmares, weird feelings of being slightly electrocuted, twitching, sweating, being really giddy and nervous, harsh stomach cramps, headaches, and that's only the symptoms that I can describe.  It's been going on for five days and is just starting to subside.  In any case, I can deal with all this.  It's hard, but I can.  I'm just wondering what a shrink is for if not to inform me that this might happen?  I understand that medications have different effects on different people, but after doing my homework, I have found out that effexor is quite well known for it's terrible withdrawal.  He had suggested I taper in half the time even.  I'm seriously considering asking for my money back.  I've also heard other horror stories from my friends who've come off of it about their doctors telling them that it'd be ok to quit cold turkey.    How can I make sure my shrink isn't a quack?

very addictive I've been on this drug on two separate occassions, once by itself, and once with wellbutrin. Both times were hard coming off, but the second time was terrible, the withdrawal symptoms are numerous and very intense. The irony I suppose, is the fact that I'm going back on the drug, as it has seemed to be the most effective at treating my depression. The only side-effects I've noticed with it have been a slight decrease in sex drive, and minor sedation.

Back on Effexor XR I started taking Effexor XR for the first time in Oct 2002 and it took some time to get to the dosage which made me feel the best I ever felt in a long time (225mgs). Then after being on it for a year I started to become manic where I didn't or couldn't sleep at all...My Seroquel wasn't even working, So we decided to take me off of it in Dec of 2003 and just keep me on a mood stabilizer (Zonegran)...Big Mistake!! I have spent the beginning of 2004 in a Severe Major Depression...So he slowly put me on Zoloft, that didn't work...We decided to go back on Effexor xr and I am finally having more good days than bad.This second time around with Effexor XR hasn't worked as well then the first time maybe because I went so deep into a severe depression..I had to go up to 300mgs but now back down to 225mgs because the side effect of anxiety was driving me crazy.....But I will never go off Effexor again unless they come out with something really great, and I won't go off of the Effexor all together without some other antidepressant going into my system.....

I have spent the beginning of 2004 in a Severe Major Depression...So he slowly put me on Zoloft, that didn't work...We decided to go back on Effexor xr and I am finally having more good days than bad.This second time around with Effexor XR hasn't worked as well then the first time maybe because I went so deep into a severe depression..I had to go up to 300mgs but now back down to 225mgs because the side effect of anxiety was driving me crazy.....But I will never go off Effexor again unless they come out with something really great, and I won't go off of the Effexor all together without some other antidepressant going into my system.....

Not for Me I started using this medication (225mg am) after a 3 year stretch of Zoloft had run its course.  After 6-8 weeks I continue to be depressed with no notable changes from how I felt with the ineffective Zoloft.  One good thing for me was lack of side effects.  I am switching to Wellbutrin or may end up combining the two.Update:  June 25th 2004 I have been off Effexor now for about a week.  After my last review, I added Wellbutrin and remained on Effexor XR (150mg am)for six months.  The effects of this medication for depression never did work for me.  The Wellbutrin gave me energy to get things done, but I would still have multiple crying spells at any given day, time, or place.  Last week I came off of both drugs and had a three-day withdrawal period that was absolutely horrid.  I survived it by taking 20mg of Prozac each day.  One day I added a Benedryl and another day I had to take a Xanax for the anxiety.  Apparently I am lucky it was only 3 days.Of note, I gained 9-10 pounds during my six months on Effexor.  This was a first for me!My new regimen is Prozac 20mg daily.  That's it.Simple, easy, and effective.Hope that helps.

works...but not forever HORRIBLE WITHDRAWL UPDATE:I began to slip down into depression and also began to have anxiety again after about a year.  I tried quitting this medicine a few times but withdrawl is horrible.  I quit again a week ago to switch meds and went into a suicide mode.  Thank god I had my family here and am on a new anti depressant that seems to help.  I had sweating, nausea, loss of appetite, dizziness, crying and anger spells, loss of taste in food, flashes of light in my eyes.  Thank god new drug kicked in because I think the withdrawl from this would have killed me had it not helped.  Be very careful with this drug and make sure when you quit you have someone to look after you and take care of you when you become sick.  Expect to take days off of work as well.  I'll never try it again, its not worth it.I am taking Effexor with depakote for bipolar disorder.  At first I had some nervousness and nausea a few hours after I took it but then it just went away and now I'm just fine.  I have not gotten suicidal and I am loving life again! I WANT to go out, I LOVE to work and I joke and smile....I am back to how I felt when I was 17! There has also been a significant decrease in my anxiety..I acually feel normal for once..I don't get stressed out from NOISE anymore.  (TV would stress me out if it was too loud...that's how bad I was) Ive been on this medication about 11 weeks and it remains effective and it seems as though I've only gotten better.  Though I still have some mild depression around my period it is a blessing to me.  Also I have had no weight gain.  VERY VERY GOOD!!!  LOVE IT!

Efexxor Terrible side effects causing me to abandon treatment with this drug.  On day 8 I was actively hallucinating. I felt detached and unreal.  Efexxor also caused agitation and insomnia.  Just the relief from discontinuing it helped improve my depression.

A withdrawal nightmare!! I've been on Effexor for four years. Two years ago I tried to wean off per Doc's instructions, in ONE WEEK. DO NOT DO THIS if you want to try another med. DO NOT. Literature reveals several situations of severe withdrawal effects with Effexor----they are right. I felt like I had been on heroin and was dying for a fix.  I had to go back on it while figuring out another strategy. So, I got my husband's grain/gram scale for reloading and what I have to do is take .2 grains off every two weeks. I reduced my initial dose in half by doing this with no side effects, even though it took several weeks. I'm still weaning off it. Some lucky people never have withdrawal effects, others do. I was unlucky. Also, Effexor has deleterious effects on sex drive for many people. This is not a plus for someone who is already depressed.  Best of luck.

Never again! Effexor was prescribed for me when Prozac didn't work.  My psychiatrist had decided after a 15 minute interview that my previous diagnosis of bipolar was wrong.  I took this drug for several years, even though it didn't seem to help with symptoms.  OCD ramped up and when I complained to the doctor he said not to worry about it unless I was getting into financial trouble.  Those are lost years and I can't really tell you how they were spent.   The final blow was when my father had a serious accident and I drove to Seattle to see him.  The stress while there was too much and I ended up having a huge fight with my kids, leaving Seattle at midnight, sobbing uncontrollably and seriously thinking of letting the car veer off a cliff.  If my dog hadn't been with me, I am sure I wouldn't be here now.  I weaned myself off the Effexor and found a new doctor.  It was like waking from a dream world into a nightmare of mismanaged finances, where I almost lost my home and I did lose my car.  I have since read that antidepressants are contraindicated for bipolar disorder.

Works....sort of I was taking Effexor with Depakote for about a year for depression and anxiety.  Due to EXTREME weight gain with depakote my doctor decided it was time to take me off of it and tried me on Effexor alone.  Without the Depakote, it didn't do too much for anxiety.  It seemed to be pretty good for my depression but over night it stopped working and I became very depressed.  It worked well in conjunction with depakote but didn't do much without it.  Plus getting off of this stuff is the worst. Id seriously only recommend this if it were a last resort and you are having trouble with other medications.  Withdrawal is terrible, and not worth it in my opinion.

great medication, but some weight gain I have been on effexor for about 2 and a half years.  I have OCD and some depression as a result.  The medicine is outstanding in treating these conditions.  It literally made every symptom go away and the good thing about it is that I still have a high level of energy on it and also don't feel &quot;numb.&quot;  I was on prozac and I tried zoloft and paxil.  Of those three, Prozac was the best but they all made me feel spaced out and unable to do my job/etc. On prozac I slept all day.  Anyway, the one thing about effexor is the weight gain.  I was always a very very thin person.  I exercise a lot, I'm a runner, etc. but yet slowly I've gained 15 lbs on effexor.  Not a lot but enough to make me dislike it.  Anyway, so after 2 and a half years I just switched to Lexapro.  I've been on it for a month now and it seems to be helping a lot and I've lost 2 lbs.  We'll see how it goes.  Will check back here in a few months and give an update under Lexapro.

So far so good *************** UPDATE *****************I have been on 1 x 37.5XR in the am and 1 x 75mgXR in the pm.  Depression has really eased (except when I have PMS!).  Only been suicidal once or twice in the past 2-3 months since changing to Efflexor.  ****************************************I had been complaining to doctors for approx 2-3 years about constantly feeling tired.  It had been getting worse and worse.  But they couldn't find anything wrong.  I was advised to take everything under the sun (eg. Co Enzyme Q10, Zinc supplements etc...) but nothing worked.  I suspected Chronic Fatigue but I didn't want to suggest that to my doctor because I thought he'd think I was a hypochondriac.  2 months ago I went to a neurologist who conducts sleep studies to see if that was the cause of my tiredness.  He concluded that I sleep fine, no sleep apnea or anything.  But he diagnosed me as having chronic fatigue.  Finally I had someone validate my feelings and recognise there was actually something wrong.  What a relief.I had been on Zoloft for quite a few years for depression, so my Dr took me off that &amp; suggested I use Effexor instead because it assists in chronic fatigue.  I've been on it for 3 weeks now.  I have been started on a low dose and next week will go up to a dose of 37.5mg in AM and 75mg in PM.  But I'm already seeing positive effects.  Twice at work this week I experienced &quot;episodes&quot; where I wasn't &quot;foggy&quot; and I seemed to have energy and my brain actually worked.  WOW!!! How exciting.  Unfortunately each episode only lasted about 1-2 hours, but it is an exciting start.  I am still rather moody &amp; have bouts where I feel depressed, but I'm hoping the higher dose I start on next week will solve that.  I'm so glad I got off Zoloft.

What a relief.I had been on Zoloft for quite a few years for depression, so my Dr took me off that &amp; suggested I use Effexor instead because it assists in chronic fatigue.  I've been on it for 3 weeks now.  I have been started on a low dose and next week will go up to a dose of 37.5mg in AM and 75mg in PM.  But I'm already seeing positive effects.  Twice at work this week I experienced &quot;episodes&quot; where I wasn't &quot;foggy&quot; and I seemed to have energy and my brain actually worked.  WOW!!! How exciting.  Unfortunately each episode only lasted about 1-2 hours, but it is an exciting start.  I am still rather moody &amp; have bouts where I feel depressed, but I'm hoping the higher dose I start on next week will solve that.  I'm so glad I got off Zoloft.  It wasn't til I got off it that I realised that it was the cause of my daily headaches!  I haven't had one since changing to effexor.  Also, Zoloft had stopped being effective for my depression.  I was having suicidal thoughts daily (&amp; I was on 150mg of Zoloft!).  On effexor I have been feeling down but I can't recall having a suicidal thought since I started on it.  It is wonderful so far.  I'll update you when I have been on the higher dose for a little while &amp; let you know how I'm going.  Bye for
effexor	Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; CFIDS; M.E.)	2004-06-18 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	1.5	3.5	So far so good I had been complaining to doctors for approx 2-3 years about constantly feeling tired.  It had been getting worse and worse.  But they couldn't find anything wrong.  I was advised to take everything under the sun (eg. Co Enzyme Q10, Zinc supplements etc...) but nothing worked.  I suspected Chronic Fatigue but I didn't want to suggest that to my doctor because I thought he'd think I was a hypochondriac.  2 months ago I went to a neurologist who conducts sleep studies to see if that was the cause of my tiredness.  He concluded that I sleep fine, no sleep apnea or anything.  But he diagnosed me as having chronic fatigue.

Recovery, Inc better than meds. I have Major Depression &amp; Panic/Anxiety/Social Phobia Disorder &amp; cannot take anything that increases my serotonin levels. I have tried many SSRI's (I will post a similar or same rating under everything I have tried), but find they cause me headaches. Paxil, Pamelor &amp; Elavil caused severe fatigue. Elavil caused weight gain. Effexor was hard to wean off of &amp; I  switched to Paxil...thank goodness I was only on both for 3-4 months each. Effexor did not actually cause any side effects until I tried to stop. WellButrin (not an SSRI) did not cause me headaches or fatigue but did make me agitated. Only Prozac had some positive effect, but I had to stop due to headaches. I may try Zoloft &amp; clonipine, eventually...but am scared of getting severe fatigue or headaches back. I find prayer helpful. Also, everyone with even the mildest anxiety issues should go to Recovery Inc. meetings.

St Johns Wort WORKS BETTER I had a severe life change and became very depressed 9 mos ago.  I started the effexor xr at 75 and increased up to 450 over that time period.  Nothing really changed, it did help my highs and lows not to be so severe.  The first 2 months were terrible I just stayed in bed-tired.  I experienced terrible head aches, increased desire for starch and sugar ( although I did stop drinking alcohol completely-may have effected the whole sugar thing).  Stopping was not that easy because of the headaches, it took two concerted efforts-finally with a workout of walking I was able to get off of it.  I still struggle with Depression and I am looking for something else right now.  I could be misdiagnosed because bi-polar is sounding more like me.

Be careful of your poor heart when taking this med While I was on Effexor for my severe Anorexia, I noticed that my already rapid heart rate began speeding up even more, so fast in fact that on various occasions I ended up in the emergency room, hooked up to a heart monitor, IV, and pulse box with the alarm going off incessantly as my heart rate peaked at around 180 beats per minute and remained there for several hours. I was immediately given an EKG which pretty much showed various problems in my heart's electrical system. Whether these were caused by Effexor or not, I don't know....but I DO know that Effexor is a dangerous drug for some of us who are in unstable cardiac situations because it can cause an increase in both heart rate and blood pressure...the latter one of the two may be a could effect for some of us suffering from an eating disorder because hypotension is a common medical problem resulting from it, but if you are like me and also have tachycardia (fast heart rate) stay away from Effexor!!! It's just too much of a risk to be playing games with your weakened heart like this! Be careful!

Very beneficial Effexor has really improved my depression. At first I was on 150mg but had a two-month recurrence of depression six months ago. Now I take 225mg per day and I feel lively and energetic and have plenty of energy and enthusiasm. The only problems are side-effects of dizzyness when standing up suddenly sometimes followed by visual disturbances with flashing lights. I would rather have these side-effects than the depression however.

Nearly died without it I was on 150mg for 2 years and doing ok. Changed jobs/insurance/and doctor. New doctor cut me down to half my dosage. I forgot all about it. I forgot everything! A year later I couldn't keep awake on the job. I went out to my car to sleep at lunch! I was tired, depressed, confused, spirling downward. When I told my doctor, his advice was &quot;get another doctor. I don't believe in this stuff.&quot;What stuff? I had even forgotten I use to be on a higher dose. So got &quot;newer&quot; doctor. This one  listened to me and figured out what was going on. Increased my dosage back to old levels and within a week I was thinking again. Within a month I was no longer sleeping during lunch.When I saw how dosage could affect mood I asked newer doctor to up dosage again and see if we could find an optimal level this time. That worked! The higher dosage cleared my head even more, so I realized I had &quot;settled&quot; for too low dosage even with my old doc. When my newer doc got me up to the max dosage, I said I'm better but there is still some confusion, depression, lack of focus. Can we go higher? He said no, but we can add something. So we added wellbutrin. Boy was that a revelation! That worked even better than upping dosage on effexor. It seemed to work on another part of the depression. So I knew I had more than just one neurotranmitter problem. Makes sense now. Finally we added remeron, which is fantastic stuff! But effexor is my basic &quot;floor&quot; medicine for depression. If I go a few days without it ('cause I'm down with the flu and can't stand to take any more pills) I begin to feel myself slipping. I get back on my effexor quick before I slide back into depression.Effexor seems to be my major mood elevator. The other medicines work on cognition for me, but it's effexor that keeps me out of depression.I had some nausea with it at the start (been 6 years now) but I was so desperate then I stuck with it and nausea went away eventually. Don't remember

2nd try at SSRI I started on Luvox for a couple of years for GAD. Worked great but was always sleepy. On my own I cut back to half dosage, after a couple of months I had a terrible re-occurance of Anxiety which could not be solved by even going back to my orginal dosage. I suffered for about 4 months and had a Physc recommend Effexor XR,. Started at 37.5 and eventually went to 150. Have been fine ever since with no side effects. But if you miss a dose for some reason there are some weird dizziness side effects.

Venlafaxine 75mg  I was prescribed venlafaxine (efexor) to deal with generalised anxiety disorder. When the anxiety was at its worst it almost felt like being attacked. I felt so terrified I couldn't eat properly for quite a while. Before starting venlafaxine, I took cipramil for about 6 weeks which only seemed to increase my anxiety and repetitive, damaging thoughts. I was in a chronic state of anxiety and verging on suicidal. With venlafaxine, I noticed a positive effect within a week or two. There are no miracle cures for longstanding anxiety but it really took the edge off the panic and allowed me to resume functionality. It helped me stay in control and blunted the horrible images and thoughts.The down side was that I was unable to sleep properly without taking nightol so I was quite lethargic a lot of the time. Also, if a dosage was missed it resulted in headaches and a odd kind of dizziness that can only be described as a head rush.I stopped taking it about three months ago now. Venlafaxine really worked for me but it is not a long term cure. Anxiety disorders are cognitive orientated so the repetitive thoughts and attendant anxiety do persist to some degree after the drug stops. It was a bit of a shock for me but, I would say to anyone in the same position, the real world is just a bit of a shock and you do build resilience to the anxiety in time. I am still a lot better than I was this time last year. Anxiety is part of my life but it isn't my whole life.

made me sick as a dog my body did not respond well to this med.  within 24 hrs. developed ha, nausea, dizziness, tremor, cold sweats, diarrhea, and insomnia.  thought it was the flu, but after several day of no let up, i stopped the med and was back to normal within a day.  had the same response to trazadone, serzone, zyprexa, topamaxx, carbatrol, depakote.  md said this was not med related but due to a liver enzyme deficiency on my part (guess he knows what he's talking about.)

If You Need It, It flat out Works I started having daily panic issues about 18 months ago, and have been on effexor ever since.  It is the second such drug of this type I have taken, the first was Paxil...and boy has it helped me.  No more Panic, manageable anxiety, thank god!!! Don't thank him too fast...it has taken me roughly a year to effectively develop effexor hygiene, the primary ingredient of which is remembering to take it.  If I forgot my Paxil, I wouldn't have thought twice (in fact I simply stopped taking it!), yet effexor definitely lets u know it when you forget, even by a few hours (the XR negates much of this uninvited withdrawal, as it really takes a day for you to start feeling weird).  Also I have varied between 75 and 225 mg a day, XR and non, finally settling in at 112.5 XR in the AM.  I've been getting the best results since I added Remeron (15mg) as a sleeping aid and adjunct anti-anxeity/depression agent.Boy is it expensive though...I have great insurance and its still like 100 a month!!!!

Also I have varied between 75 and 225 mg a day, XR and non, finally settling in at 112.5 XR in the AM.  I've been getting the best results since I added Remeron (15mg) as a sleeping aid and adjunct anti-anxeity/depression agent.Boy is it expensive though...I have great insurance and its still like 100 a month!!!!

Didn't have a good experience I felt rather ill on this.  The side effects made me feel weak and I kept having sweats.  I had to come off the higher dose as I felt so ill.

Effexor I have gained over 50 pounds since on effexor and it has slowed my metabolism down severely. It is quite effective in treating my depression but I keep gaining weight and that makes me feel worse about myself.

Partial Response with Effexor Effexor gives me a partial benefit in combination with 450mg/day of Wellbutrin (bupropion) and 45mg/day of remeron (mirtazapine). I couldn't tolerate the sedation from the remeron without the effexor. Initially I was on only 75mg/day (about six months). Now I'm on 150mg/day. I seem to get more benefit at the higher dose, but the sexual side effects are dose-dependant and don't diminish over time. So it's harder to orgasm at 150mg than at 75mg/day. The biggest drawback is cost. I pay cash, and 150mg/day costs me $95/month at Costco. My doc even suggested a further increase to 300mg/day on top of the other two, but I can't afford the cost. I would discontinue this in a minute if I had a better alternative. Maybe the new SNRI will work better when FDA approves later this year. Generic Effexor should be here in a year or two, that will help.

Effexor I regularly cut myself for nearly eight years, beginning at age 12 and ending [hopefully] for good just last year.  Once I became just too much to live with and put a strain on my parents' marriage, at 16 my mother took me to see a psychiatrist. After maxing out what I could take of Paxil, he added Effexor. I took the two together for two years, and I rarely encountered relapses.  The ugly truth is that when I first began Effexor, I was in bed for three days with a migraine.  I've always suffered from them, so I may have just been more vulnerable to it; none were as bad as that one, however.  Times when I would try to quit, or even if I forgot to take a couple doses, the pain and associated illnesses would return, so I was more or less forced by my body to continue taking them until I finally decided to try and take matters into my own hands.  I haven't taken Effexor for some time now, but I certainly don't believe I would be in the position to help myself had I not taken it.  Since the Effexor was paired with Paxil, I can't speak for its effects alone.  I can, however, say that when I began feeling better was after adding Effexor.  Paxil could sometimes give me a speed effect, but the Effexor just made me feel sort of balanced and &quot;normal.&quot;

Effexor, more like ineffexor... I took effexor for 8 months.  Right from the start I thought something was wrong.  But I had only take antidepressants once before and that was a tricyclic for only a week.Effexor made me tried and sleepy during the day, irritated my anxiety and disturbed my sleep.  It made me nauseous and headachy and lessened my motivation.Of course there could be all sorts of factors contributing why it didn't work for me, i.e I didn't get therapy at the time, I was overworked and stressed at the time and in a hard job.  I was also experiencing relationship and health problems.By the time I quit effexor XR I had upped my dosage to 225mg, which was giving me terrible gut aches.  Giving up effexor is really unpleasant.  Not only will you feel the normal depression, but headaches will intensify, you will be chronically nauseous and VERY irritable. Best to be on holidays with a very well warned family/friend circle/spouse/children.  It's not fun at all.

Effexor 300mg/day Effexor is probably a great drug for depression, but for my Bipolar II is not helpful and may probably contributed to feelings of anxiety and a little paranoia. I was taking Zyprexa and Effexor at the same time and felt much better after discontinuing the Effexor. I am not writing this to discourage anyone with depression from taking Effexor, which I think may well be a terrific med, but rather to warn anyone suffering from Bipolar to consider how Effexor might be effecting them negatively.

The side effects are a pain It took me a long time to get used to effexor, and now it looks like it is going to take a long time to get off effexor.  My side effects for going on effexor include insomnia, jerkiness and sweating.  Now that i'm discontinuing effexor the above side effects have mellowed; however, I now have a new side effect-irritability that is intense about a week after I decrease my dose.  My highest dose being 300mgs per day and now at 150mgs per day.  I'm decreasing 75mgs every two weeks, but I may stay at 150 for a while.Oh, I almost forgot the sexual side effects.  When increasing my dosage over the first 6 months or so I had temporary problems with getting and maintaining erections.  This passed with a short time.  The other problem was it took a lonnng time to have an orgasm.  Over time this also has passed, and neither has been a problem while tapering.

Withdrawal is a NIGHTMARE I wanted to take prozac because it had been effective in the past for my depression.  My MD insisted that Effexor was more effective, less likely to cause weight gain, and would help with my lethargy.  Well, what really happened...First, I'll believe that weight gain is less of a problem because Effexor is really hard on the stomach causing nausea and vomiting. It has not helped with depression and in fact has made me more lethargic than ever.  I have frequent, frightning dreams that disrupt my sleep. And, I have experience night sweats since I started taking this drug.The worst part is that now I have to take it!  If I forget to take a dose (I am on 150mg once daily), I lose an entire day to disorientation and a horrible sensation of electric shocks in my arms, legs, neck, and face. I can't stand these sensations. A missed dose seems to make my senses heightened so that noises, light, and tactile stimuli are so bothersome. Until, that is, I take the next dose and get some sleep. I recently got a step down pack from my doctor, but I am scared!

A lot of side effects but the mood is good! I have been using Effexor for about 4 months now. At first I had TERRIBLE constipation so I stopped taking the pill after 5 days. My Dr. convinced me to go back and to take laxatives. Now I take natural laxatives almost every day and I have solved that problem. I immediately started to feel a change in mood, and so did everyone else around me. It especially helped my social anxiety. I became much more friendly and in general just a nicer person. I have now been on it for 4 months and my mood is almost always very good. Even the emotional symptoms of my PMS are much better. I used to almost commit suicide every time I was expecting my period. As for the side effects.....at first I got nauseous all the time so my appetite went down and I lost some weight. But now, even though I am still nauseous for a few hours after I take the pill, I am eating all the time and I always crave sweets and carbs so I have gained a lot of weight. The worst side effect in my opinion is that I have almost no sex drive and I have great difficulty reaching orgasm. I used to love sex, and even when I was terribly depressed, I always had great sex. Now its very frustrating. It takes ages to reach orgasm. My boyfriend has been very patient but he gets tired. Sometimes we just give up. When I do finally climax its not as strong as it used to be. I used to be multi-orgasmic and now just having one is like a miracle The other side effects are that I am very tired all the time and sleep a lot. I also have very, very weird and sometimes scary dreams. I dream that Im killing people, being raped or being killed. I even started keeping a dream diary because the dreams freak me out. One other weird side effect I have noticed is that my period cycles have changed. Although the emotional symptoms of my PMS are much better, the physical ones have gotten worse. I know this sounds very strange but I now get cramps for a week BEFORE my period. I n

Effexor XR - the good, the bad and the ugly I hate those people who go on a rampage trying to convince everyone not to take a certain medication due to their horrific experience with it, so I will try not to be one.  This drug could be a miracle for a lot of people.  So you get a good idea... I've taken Celexa, Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Trazodone, Remeron, Xanax, Lithium, Seroquel and Effexor.  I'm currently on Effexor (75mg, just came down from 112.5mg.. the info i entered did not have an option for 3 pills, once a day..), Wellbutrin (200mg) and Seroquel (50mg).Effexor was the last med I started, which was about a month and a half ago.  I started immediately on 75mg because I was switching cold turkey from Lexapro (Doctor's orders!).  I went up to 112.5 either 1 or 2 weeks later. I had been so scared of this drug before due to all the horror stories of electric shocks, nausea, the works.  I've been through the electric shock thing once when quitting celexa cold turkey (i do NOT recommend it!!), so I was not in a hurry to do it again.  I should separate this since it's something good and I know that if you are reading this, that's what you are looking for.  Now, Effexor hasn't helped my symptoms, but I have not gained/lost weight, I have not been nauseas (and that comes easily to me), I have not had any of the killer side effects that most people do.  I consider myself to be pretty susceptible to side effects and this one has treated me well ... welllll... except for the big one.  The reason why I am now tapering off of Effexor....Since going up to my max dosage of 112.5 mg, I have thought a lot about death.  I don't mean that in the philosophical sense.  Prior to Effexor, I'd wanted to cease to exist, or just disappear into thin air.  I didn't want to live, but i didn't want to DIE.  We all toy with the idea of suicide sometimes, but after taking Effexor, I became almost obsessed with it.  Now, instead of my previous feelings of wanting to disappear, but

Just hope you never have to stop taking it! I have mixed feelings about Effexor, which is never a good thing in my opinion.  If a significant part of you is dissatisfied with a medication, maybe you shouldn't be taking it.  With that said...When I started taking Effexor it was great! It took care of my depression and anxiety quickly and effectively.  But I soon began to notice that if I was late taking my pills (3 75mg XR/day) sometimes by as little as one hour I'd become crazy dizzy.  I also began to put on weight, a lot of it.  I was constantly hungry and craved sugar like it was some sort of narcotic.  And forget about taking this if you don't have insurance!  It's about $300 a month!!!After about a year of this and after becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the medication, my depression and anxiety began to reappear.  Rather than increase my dose, my doctor suggested that I try Wellbutrin instead.  Now, I haven't been on it long enough to really accurately have a solid opinion of Wellbutrin, but a few things have changed...1.  cravings and constant hunger?  gone!  I have candy in my house that has been here since I started the wellbutrin 3 weeks ago!  When I was on Effexor, it wouldn't have lasted 3 days!  And I've already started to lose the 60+ lbs I put on in the year I was on Effexor.  2.  I have my old energy back!  With Effexor I was always tired and wanted to sit back and not do anything (which sounds surprisingly like depression, I know, but the sadness wasn't there).  I haven't had coffee in a week because I haven't been insanely tired every day.3.  Effexor withdrawal symptoms.  WATCH OUT!!!  This stuff is REALLY hard on your body and brain when you are being taken off of it.

Effexor Xr is making a difference I started taking 75mg. of Effexor XR about six weeks ago. I was told that it takes 4 weeks to take effect, I saw a difference after the second week. Although there wasn't a large change in the pain there was in the fatigue. I'm sleeping more, my mind's clear again, I don't break down crying every time I talk about my condition, I'm starting to get on with my life again, I have an interest in whats happening in my family again, the leg spasms have decreased at night. I need to note that my Rheumatologist and I in the beginning stopped all my other meds. except for the 50mg.of Pamelor I was taking for migraines. Then started new medications one at a time a few weeks apart so that if I had any side effects we would know which one it was from (this was every hard at first but worth it in the end). Long story short when I started the Effexor XR I was already on the Pamelor for a few months so for me it could be a combo of the two.

Don't miss your dose or quit taking this!!! I was off and on Effexor 3 times over the course of several years.  It was the first drug I took after being diagnosed with BPII that actually helped.  BUT--If you miss your dose by more than a couple of hours, you may pay for it.  Got HORRIBLE headaches, sort of like &quot;brain cramps&quot; which started at the base of my neck and worked their way up.  Trying to get off it was like having the DTs!!!  I thought I would lose my mind--finally resorted to opening capsules and just trying to take a few grains to get by.  Had the headaches and brain cramps off and on for a couple of years after quitting.  And forget trying to have an orgasm!!  Gained weight, too.

It worked! This was the only anti-depressant in a long line of them that worked. I lost weight on it, my energy levels were at an all time high! The cost in Australia is low as it is a subsidised med. I am bipolar but never had a mania induced by effexor. I would recommend trying it - for me it worked a little at 150mg a day and worked excellent on 300mg a day, and started working after less than a week!!

WAS ENOUGH TO CURB MY DEPRESSION UNTIL I WAS INJURED AT WORK AND ALL THE TRAUMA THAT I HAVE AND AM STILL GOING THROUGH MY DOCTOR HAD TO INCREASE MY DOSAGE WITH 75 MORE MG. WHICH SEEMS TO HELP FAIRLY WELL. I COULD NOT FUNCTION WITHOUT TAKING EFFEXOR EVERYDAY. BELIEVE ME I HAVE TRIED AND MY DEPRESSION HITS ME LIKE A ROCK AND I THEN KNOW THAT I CAN'T DO WITH OUT THEM.

Worked Great, just Don't Miss a Dose I'm surprised to see so many people claiming that a pill has wrecked their life. EffexorXR has worked wonders for me, with no side effects to speak of. 2 x 150mgs once a day at bedtime with food.A dialog about your panic around taking medications really isn't very helpful. Stick to the topic at hand and hope that someone learns from your responsible experience taking psych meds.Hi, recently diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder in addition to Adult ADD. I've taken Effexor tablets in the past they do upset your stomach quite a bit, with the XR version, I generally don't have any trouble if I take it on a full stomach. I strongly suggest that anyone taking EffexorXR gets a pill minder, those plastic things with a little space for each day of the week. I've missed a dose or two in the past and felt pretty crappy, my friends noticed it as well. Currently on 2 x 150mg XR taken before bedtime. In the past I've tried quite a few SSRI's. EffexorXR has worked the best out of all of the others, like Celexa, Serzone, Paxil, and Zoloft. Effexor's one main advantage, so my psychiatrist says is that it has a bit of a kick to it, such that anyone with a strong anxiety disorder, probably wouldn't do well on it. I'm male 39, also take Dexedrine.

Some awful side effects Effexor can have a terrible effect on sex drive, and ability to orgasm. It often keeps me awake at night, and really doesn't do much for depression, and makes my anxiety worse...however, I don't want to go off it until I find meds that work. I've heard that going off Effexor is very difficult, and I don't look foward to dealing with that! If you don't have insurance, don't bother with it, it's VERY expensive! I think I pay over 300$ a month for it with no insurance.

Worked at first, then detrimental When I was first on this med, it worked like a charm. I felt like i could take on anything. but as time went on, I got back into self-mutilation and started contemplating suicide. now that I look back, I never cut myself more than when I was on effexor xr.Another less serious pitfall of effexor xr was that I got stomach cramps and diarrhea after eating spicy foods.

Effexor XR works for me Hi! I have been taking effexor xr 75mg once a day since 1/01/04. It has been a wonderful help to me. It took about two weeks for me to feel better. The side effects for me haven't been bad. Right at first I had dry mouth but that passed and the not wanting to eat passed. I have been taking the 75mg until today. My doctor has decided to up my dosage to 150mg a day. My stress level is high right now and my energy level is very low. I have been having trouble sleeping and I had a full blown anxiety attack twice last week. So bad I was ready to go to the hospital. My doctor thinks that upping my effexor to 150mg for a few months and then going back to 75mg will help. He also gave me Restoril to help me sleep when I can't seem too. My personal feelings on effexor xr are that this medication has done wonderful things for me. I know the horror stories about effexor and I just wanted to let people know that it has done great things for me. Thanks!

Serious Side Effects and Awful Withdrawal I was put on this medication by a Pain Management Center.  I must say that, for that purpose, it is fairly effective.  That's not necessarily a good thing, really.  It &quot;numbs&quot; your mind and senses.I suppose I had an increase in energy; but I don't know - I don't know!For me, it literally caused personality changes.  I found myself being rather rude (when provoked; normally I wouldn't get involved) and quite irritable and even losing my temper at times; add to that a sort of &quot;I couldn't care less&quot; attitude.If that wasn't bad enough, I had the most awful experience trying to wean myself off of it.  I had terrible nausea, difficulty focusing my eyes, headaches and &quot;brain shocks&quot; (that was SCARY).  And this was after tapering for two months!  I got down to where I would stop altogether; last about three days and become violently ill.  In desperation, I would take some Effexor.  I would feel fine in a couple of hours.  This went on for weeks and weeks.  I was down to taking only about 1/8 of a capsule every three days and STILL I would become intolerably ill.  Finally I thought to try taking some Prozac I'd had prior to the Effexor.  That did work and stopped the cycle after some 4 months.  Phew.  Never again, short of being suicidal.

Effexor I have tried every SSRI out there, (hated the comatose feelings they gave me). The Effexor worked wonders for me, but the sexual side effects and weight gain made me decide to go from 150 mg to 75 mg.  The decreased dosage withdrawal was horrible, so I took a few months to taper down.  Very slowly.  I had to measure the contents of each capsule and take a tiny bit more out each week.  It never failed, on day 3 after the decrease, I would cry a lot and be so sad.  Then the next day I was fine.  Every week. Taking out such a small amount.  My life is going really well now, so I'm hoping to taper off completely over the summer.  I am also on wellbutrin 150, and that is great for me.

Effexor XR for Anxiety I was prescribed Effexor XR for major depression. It did nothing at all for the depression; I was in fact suicidal five months later. It did however stop the anxiety symptom I had the most difficulty dealing with. And that was the endless loop of awful things that might happen. Even when I knew my fears were groundless, I could not stop the visualizations.I also take Klonopin for muscle jerks, and it has an anti-anxiety effect. But did not reduce the visuals that bothered me so.

Surprise!  It's working!!! I am now up to 112.5mg (37.5mg X 3) of Effexor along with 25mg of Zoloft.  It's working without many side effects.  Recently, I had general blood tests done and found out my thyroid wasn't working up to par.  I've started thyroid replacement and the Effexor seems to be working more effectively now.

effectiveness vs. withdrawals I started on effexor xr about 6 1/2 mos ago. None of the other anti-depressants I had been taking  worked for very long either but none of the others with the exception of paxil (which I took for almost one year) produced the withdrawal side effects that effexor &amp; paxil have. Due to loss of health insurance &amp; the lack of effectiveness I decided to wean myself off of effexor. I started about 3 weeks ago. I can describe the withdrawals of BOTH effexor &amp; paxil as 10 times the WORST hangover ever experienced. With nausea, diaherra, headache, insomnia, shakes/tremors, anxiety, body aches, TERRIBLE dizziness, hot/cold sweats, flu symptoms, bright light blindness &amp; sickness. It feels as though your eyes are going in different directions and you cannot move your head fast or it feels as though you have had a concussion. Unable to eat properly and heartburn exgaggerated to the point of anything you eat immediately causes heartburn. Milk is the only thing I could drink/eat without some kind of hearburn. Also, coffee stimulates the withdrawals. Just when I thought I was almost through the worst, drank my usual morning coffee...within minutes the dreaded dizziness would come back and pretty much make my day useless. It is my opinion that the health professionals SHOULD warn people of these withdrawals..it is not fair that they DO NOT. But I should have recognized that would happen after what happened to me when I missed just two pills. The dizziness is just un-bearable!!!  It is very hard to explain to those that have never taken anti-depressants such as my husband. He does not believe in drugs of ANY kind. He believes that just getting outside will help all of my symptoms and it is very hard to explain. I would rate the length of effectiveness versus the withdrawals and the price (w/o insurance from $158 to over $300) just not worth it. The withdrawals are enough to put you RIGHT back in the same frame of mind you were in before you st

Effectiveness of Effexor with Wellbutrin 200mg/day Effexor has helped me a great deal in combination with Wellbutrin, Klonopin for anxiety, and Concerta for ADD. I believe that it was the recent diagnosis of ADD and the addition of the Concerta that has helped me the most. I no longer have the suicidal thoughts that plagued me for 22 years.

horrible side effects! got absolutely sick with this.  tried taking it, suffering thru the side effects to see if they would disappear once i got used to it.  instead, it made me worse--crazier--because it caused such insomnia and anxiety!  2 separate times i tried to start it up, each time with the same horrible restlessness, anxiety, and stomach pain!

Not sure whether this really helped or not I took Effexor for several months about 1 1/2 years ago.  I had been on it off and on before that. (doctors always seem to want to prescribe whatever the &quot;flavor of the month&quot; is, even if it means switching someone to different meds all the time) I was on it a couple of years ago primarily because of being told that that was the safest one to take while breastfeeding my baby.  Six months ago I was taken off of it by a new doctor who told me Effexor was the worst one for a Bipolar patient to take (so why did the previous doctors have me on it???)  This is one that I didn't really notice ANY side effects from, though, so that's definitely in its favor.  Whether it was effective or not, I'm not sure, 'cause sometimes it doesn't seem to matter what they put me on, it's not going to help.  Be careful coming off of this one, though -- if you don't do it slowly, that's when you can run into problems.

overall very well tolerated i've been on effexor for years and only recently needed to up my dosage from 150mg. in the morning and 75mg. in afternoon to 150mg. twice a day. not bad. i was on zoloft before effexor and the effectiveness of zoloft wore off. i had little energy on the zoloft but once i was put on the effexor i found myself having more energy in the afternoons - which was a big problem for me. i also have rhuematoid arthritis and so my energy level is a large part of my treatment. i find the sexual side effects to be little if any - which is always a problem for females on antidepressents.

What a godsend!! A few months after my mom died, I decided I needed to go back on meds. I started seeing a new doctor, who was very concerned she find the right meds.  She put me on Effexor XR at 37.5 mgs for the 1st week then 75mgs after. Everyone noticed a difference in me right away. The only side effect that I had was yawning. (thats a weird one). I had energy, I became me again. During this time I lost 20 lbs. (not sure if it was this med or the fact I watched what I was eating). I really have begun to like myself. I am more into sex than with any other meds, I want to do things. I feel great. I have been at 75mgs for 4 months. I do feel I need to bump up to the next dose. But otherwise I truly feel fantastic. I have also learned that there is nothing to be ashamed of about suffering from depression. Effexor has really helped me with my whole life and my marriage. My husband says I am &quot;ME&quot; again. And I love me now!!!!!9/28/03 About a month ago I increased my dose to 150 mgs. Started really having a hard time with my moms death. I feel so much better. I do notice that I get tired during the day and if a am late with a dose, my body warns me. But I have a smile on my face and it is all worth it.4.13.04 I have been on the Effexor XR @ 150mgs a day. I have to take it in the AM because if I forget my dose and take it in the PM, I CAN NOT sleep. I have gained my weight back that I had originally lost. I do feel like me again except for the NO SEX DRIVE part. If I miss a dose, my head lets me know with the withdrawal symptoms, the brain tingles. I would like to change meds for something that doesn't hinder your sex drive but I am afraid of the withdrawals. But I do have a smile on my face, I am less easy stressed and I feel good, so I guess it is worth it.

Effexor not worth the hassle or the price I was started on Effexor after having a suicidal episode in '95 which placed me in the hospital.  Drove home on the medication and felt like I was in a &quot;fog&quot; and &quot;drugged out of my mind&quot;.  The first two weeks on this medication were hellacious with the nausea and confusion and tiredness.  Once stabilized everything was ok, except the nausea on the tablet form.  Once we started on the XR Form then the weight gain started and what was known as depression, then escalated into BP2 disorder.   I am now weaning off this freaking drug and I hope the weight gain will dissipate as well.  Tired of being fat and unhappy.

effexor xr Antidepressants, I've tried many with side effects including drowsiness, forcing myself to get thru the day at work, not wanting to do the things that I used to love to do. I felt calm but with lack of energy until I started on effexor xr. I now can't wait for the new day to start. I want to be doing things all of the time. Work is FUN and I feel at peace at the end of the day.

Worked okay, but withdrawal was murder I began taking Effexor in college for depression and anxiety.  It worked okay for the depression, although I still had a few episodes while taking it.  It worked much better for anxiety; I didn't realize how well until I got off the medicine.  I want to warn everyone: If you plan on taking Effexor, you better plan on making it a life decision.  I finally decided to get off the medicine because it was ridiculously expensive and had two weeks of pure Hell.  I was weaned off, arguably too quickly, but I have never felt so terrible in my life.  I wish my psychiatrist had warned me beforehand about what the process of withdrawal would bring.  If he had, I probably never would have taken it to begin with.  There weren't any terrible side effects from it, besides a slightly lessened sexual desire.  I am off daily meds, except Atarax for sleep (I've had terrible insomnia my entire life).  I do NOT recommend Effexor.

effexor xr Antidepressants, I've tried many with side effects including drowsiness, forcing myself to get thru the day at work, not wanting to do the things that I used to love to do. I felt calm but with lack of energy until I started on effexor xr. I now can't wait for the new day to start. I want to be doing things all of the time. Work is FUN and I feel at peace at the end of the day.

Worked okay, but withdrawal was murder I began taking Effexor in college for depression and anxiety.  It worked okay for the depression, although I still had a few episodes while taking it.  It worked much better for anxiety; I didn't realize how well until I got off the medicine.  I want to warn everyone: If you plan on taking Effexor, you better plan on making it a life decision.  I finally decided to get off the medicine because it was ridiculously expensive and had two weeks of pure Hell.  I was weaned off, arguably too quickly, but I have never felt so terrible in my life.  I wish my psychiatrist had warned me beforehand about what the process of withdrawal would bring.  If he had, I probably never would have taken it to begin with.  There weren't any terrible side effects from it, besides a slightly lessened sexual desire.  I am off daily meds, except Atarax for sleep (I've had terrible insomnia my entire life).  I do NOT recommend Effexor.

Effexor XR I was switched to Effexor XR after having good results with Prozac for 12 years. My Internist thought I was depressed and the Prozac was no longer working. I thought I was frustrated and physically ill, not depressed. I had been recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, was not responding well to any treatment, and trying to adjust to the fact that my life and my families had just completely changed for ever.I was quite pleased the Effexor XR all but eliminated the anxiety and panic attacks. I did not notice the slide into deep depression until about six months after starting the Effexor XR, when I started making definite plans to end my life. Suicide did not seem to be a big deal to me, and I had an awful time understanding why anyone else would care. I was referred to a Psychiatrist for a med evaluation. Because the Effexor XR was controlling the anxiety, he decided to continue it and add Wellbutrin.Now, four months later, I am on 150mg Wellbutrin twice a day and 300mg Effexor XR once a day. I am not suicidal any longer, but that is probably the best I can say for this combination. It is hard to remember the mid day dose, and has had little effect on the depression.

EFFEXOR XR Used this med for 1 year after which side effects were more prominent and med less effective.  Came off over 3 weeks but was left with severe withdrawal symptoms. Severe swelling of legs and knees/ankles, arthritic pain as well as gastro-intestinal pain which persisted for months afterward.  Had not suffered any of these problems before taking Effexor XR.

Effexor I find that I get quite weepy if I forget to take this for any length of time. Otherwise, I think that after trying about 6 or 7 kinds of anti-depressants, this one is working the best. I feel more like myself than I have in a long time and am very glad to have finally found something that helps! BTW, my depression is caused by genetics and a fried thyroid gland, if that makes any difference.

Effexor For me Effexor was a nightmare.It did little to lift the depression and I hated the side effects.  I broke out in foul smelling sweats and had headaches and weird sensations in the brain.  It took months to taper down and I experienced unpleasant withdrawal effects.

Effective but Elevated my Blood Pressure Effexor XR was one of the more effective treatments I have received for my Recurrent Severe Major Depressive Disorder. I occassionally would still get suicidal thougths while on it but not as frequently as previously.  The doctor had been considering increasing my dosage of Effexor XR higher than 300 mg to deal with them.  But because I developed high blood pressure most likely from the use of Effexor XR, he took me off Effexor XR.When I forgot to take my Effexor XR for a day, I developed severe withdrawal symptoms.  So you must take this daily to avoid that. You must also wean off it very slowly to avoid the withdrawal symptoms.

I'm on the fence about Effexor for FMS I am nineteen years old and have been on 150mg of Effexor XR for two years now for my FMS.  Although I don't find it does much for the pain, it has made a noticeable difference in my fatigue.  However, I don't know if it has been necessarily been a good change.  While I am no longer completely incapacitated by my fatigue, I now have such trouble falling alseep that for the past two months I have only been sleeping every second or third night.  If I can get my sleep problems under control I will probably stay on it, but if not I will have to try something new.  And facing the difficult withdrawal associated with stopping Effexor treatment makes this an even more stressful decision.  If you have FMS, I recommend Effexor as a last resort.

effexor=nightmare I have been on effexor for a couple of months.  I decided to go off of it, due to feeling tired all the time.  The withdrawls are horrific!!!!  I would rather be depressed than go through this again....I feel &quot;spaced out&quot;, have the brain shivers, very edgy, nauseated, migraine, vomiting, and the list goes on....Of course the doctor and pharmacist never told me about the horrible withdrawals that people go through.  I would recommend that people talk to their doctor before taking this medication.  I would recommend not ever taking it!!!!

Effexor made my depression worse I have had problems with depression all my life and have always had success with Wellbutrin. For some reason though, I get lazy and stop taking it and the depression always comes back eventually. A new family physican I recently saw prescribed Wellbutrin XL 300mg/1xday and Effexor. I started the Effexor at 37.5 and was taking 375mg/day at the end. Within two weeks of taking the Effexor, I became more depressed and suicidal, to the point that I could not function and could not work. I told the doctor treating me that I felt the Effexor was making me worse. He told me that was impossible and kept increasing my dosage. After 2 months of progressively worsening depression and constant thoughts of suicide, I decided to go to an actual psychiatrist for specialized advice. He too told me it was impossible that it could be making me worse and increased the dosage. After two weeks at a dosage of 375mg/day, I went back to the shrink insisting I be taken off of the Effexor. Of course then and only then am I informed of the &quot;discontinuation symptoms&quot;...I call it withdrawal. I began tapering off and was fine until I completely stopped and became physically ill for about a week. Despite the negative experience coming off the drug, I immediately began to feel better mentally as soon as I began tapering off. Now I am totally off of the effexor and feel great on just the Wellbutrin. The lesson I learned from this is to always listen to your own body and trust your instincts about your treatment and the meds you are taking. I don't care what any doctor says, the effexor made me worse and came close to causing me to take my life. Always listen to your body...regardless of what the docs say. They do the best they can, but the don't know everything so we ultimately have to take responsility for our own health and treatment methods.

Not so happy... Tried Effexor for a few months. Worked for the first few weeks, but shortly after I experienced some bad sexual side effects. Also had some weird, unwanted thoughts.. Every time I closed my eyes I saw myself giving lemons to deer??!!? Couldn't figure it out. Luckily my unwanted thoughts were benign. Stopped taking Effexor as a result of personal experience and recent bad press. Switched to some herbal supplements to see what happens.

Miracle drug Effexor saved my life.  I started taking Effexor when I was 20 lbs underweight and purging upwards of 10x/day.  Within six months of being on Effexor, my purging gradually reduced to 1x/day.  A year later I was purging rarely, if ever, and as of now (3 years later) it has been 2 years since my last purge.It is amazing how Effexor helped to reduce my anxiety and obsessive thoughts over food.  I would literally be dead if it weren't for Effexor.I am now off of Effexor-coming off of it is not so much fun, but if your doctor tapers your dosage gradually, it is not too bad.

A year later I was purging rarely, if ever, and as of now (3 years later) it has been 2 years since my last purge.It is amazing how Effexor helped to reduce my anxiety and obsessive thoughts over food.  I would literally be dead if it weren't for Effexor.I am now off of Effexor-coming off of it is not so much fun, but if your doctor tapers your dosage gradually, it is not too bad.

Like Licking a 9 volt battery I thought I was nuts with coming off this drug. I kept trying to explain to my doctor what was going on and it was so hard to put into words. Then one day i was reading and saw the comparison to licking a 9 volt battery. I'm sure a lot of you know what licking a battery feels like as a kid. I was trying to tell him as if my brain was shutting down for a split second. It's good to try and tell or even write on a site like this how you feel. When you are out there and you feel like you are the ONLY one with the effects...then all of a sudden..BAM..there is someone else..and another, then suddenly you are not alone anymore. But needless to say, I'm off Effxor and I STILL have that side effect. I even read somewhere it might be a lifetime of that feeling and there might be some danage to the brain cells. I have been fighting depression since 91...maybe I should stop fighting and face that it is a part of my life. I wouldn't tell anyone to go on this one.&quot;MY LIFE SHOULD NOT BE BASED ON A PAIN SCALE!&quot;

EffexorXR I was on 450mg EffexorXR for 2 years. Whilst taking it I thought I felt better, however I had abnormal behaviours. I acted out suicide attempts that I had previously only thought about. I also behaved in strange ways, and while doing so, although I knew it was strange, I could not stop. I know this sounds weird. But I believed I had to do these things. I weened off EffexorXR 2 months ago. I took 4 weeks to do so. For the first 25 days - no side effects. Then WHAM, vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, sweats alternating with chills - I thought Iwas dying. I checked myself into hospital, but they disregarded me, believing that I was acting out still (acting out vomiting, diarrhoea??). My doctor was on holiday, so there was no help, so I got someone to take me home where I was able to be sick alone. It has been 8 weeks since that happened, and I am now on Edronax. I haven't acted out at all, or even thought about it during this time. I am very depressed and my Dr is telling me to give the Edronax some time to work, which I am. I would never, never advise anyone to take EffexorXR. I have tried lots of types of antidepressant medications over the years, but none had such violent effects on me.

Effexor should not be on the Market. I'm proud to say that I am off this terrible drug. It has been 4 months and the discontinuation effects were a nightmare! I had weird electrical sensations all over my body, insomnia, nausea, and acute anxiety. I would suggest psychotherapy and behavior modification to anyone considering medication.  Tackling those issues may be tough but that's where the true liberation lies.

Saved my Life I started taking effexor almost one year ago.  I must say it has saved my life.  The side effects are a fine trade off, if it means I do not want to die on a regular basis with no &quot;true&quot; reason.  My main concern with this drug is the lack of sex drive.  However, I will not take my self off this drug since I believe I would only return to the state I lived in for years on end.  I must say going back to that is ONE MILLION times worse than not having a sex drive.  I am hoping that soon there will be something I can take to counter this side effect.. but until then I will continue to LIVE!  (For the first few month I experienced very strong nightmares which have now turned into bizzare dreams I have learned to enjoy)

Does help with energy Although with daily use it becomes a little hard to tell, I think I've gotten a good energy boost from Effexor.  I started taking it more to help with depression, but I was counting on some help with the fatigue too.  I like the time release capsule as I did notice some stomach irritation with the regular tablet, and the effect did seem to wane by late afternoon.  Only side-effect that is noticeable is a definite lessening of libido.

Effective for 8 years now UPDATE: 8 years later Effexor still works fine for me. I think its main benefits are that it reduces my mild melancholia, and tendency towards anxiety and irritability. Libido definitely lessened, but that is the only side effect I notice. Overall, definitely worth it.I've taken Effexor for several years for the depression that has accompanied my Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  It has worked well - I can see the glass half-full as opposed to half empty - and has also helped to give me an energy boost.  A year or so ago I switched to the time-release version as I was noticing that the regular 37.5 tablet was causing my stomach some problems.  The time-release solved that, and I only need to take it once a day with breakfast.  No negative affect on my sleeping that I can notice.  The Effexor has definitely had the negative side-effect of greatly reducing my libido though.  I am also concerned that it will be difficult to wean myself from the medication some day.  All in all though I have to admit that it has helped me weather the frustrations of CFS pretty well, and I am very grateful that I'm living in a time when medications like Effexor are available.

Side effects came later/terrible withdrawal Initially I found venlafaxine helpful as I was in a withdrawn depressive state, and it gave me more &quot;go&quot; and drive. However, I felt that the depression was still under a more &quot;coping exterior&quot;. BUT then side effects got terrible, after about three months. Decided to come off, but terrible &quot;withdrawal&quot; symptoms, even missing one dose. Dissociation/muscle tremors/&quot;electrical&quot; shock type feels/dyskinias. The more I tapered down the dose, the odder I felt.Read on the net, that taking ONE dose of prozac could help the withdrawal symptoms. It DID. If the withdrawal effects were 8/10 before, the ONE dose of prozac reduced to 2/10. Took a second single dose of prozac after three days, as withdrawal from venlafaxine returned a little, and then was able to &quot;cold turkey&quot; off venlafaxine without too much further trouble.I believe the helpfulness of single doses of prozac is because of prozac's long &quot;half-life&quot;, which helps the body cope with the &quot;craving&quot; that the short half-life of venlafaxine carries.

it helped me in the past After my first child was born in 2001, I tried Paxil and Serzone, both of which I couldn't take the side effects.  But Effexor really helped me and the side effects were low.  So it was natural for me to give it another try after my 2nd child was born in 2003, but it didn't seem to help this time.  Maybe it was because of my hormones or maybe the effectiveness of Effexor decreases with time.  I have been on Wellbutrin XL for about 5 weeks now, with not much improvement.  But I would recommend Effexor, it just wasn't for me this time around.

YUK!!! My experience with effexor was such that I will never take the drug again. I could not eat or sleep, I shook constantly (tremors) and i felt very anxious. I was taking sedatives to sleep and they would not work with this drug. I would start to fall asleep and jerk awake, my head jerked, then my shoulder, etc. It was like torture for me. the doc wanted to raise the dose and I refused. So we changed to something else (Paxil). I like Celexa better for pain control but it can be depressing if you take alot of other sedatives with it. Understand that I am extremely sensitive to drugs, even&quot;natural&quot; ones so this is probably not a common response. But anyone having an anxiety problem or CNS problem might need to be cautious about using this drug.

Do Not Take This Poison!!!!! I was given Effexor after a 10 minute discussion with my doctor where I mentioned I had been having some minor anxiety.  I told him I had taken Serzone before and had a bad reaction, but he assurred me that Effexor was different.  It sure was!  I took one 37.5 pill at 5PM and at 2AM that morning I awoke with a jolt, felt like my head was going to explode and was having the worst anxiety I've ever felt.  That was 7 weeks ago and I'm still suffering these symptoms.  I've all all bloodwork and an MRI done---everything is negative.  My doc. thinks it was an extreme reaction to the Effexor. Obviously!! Do LOTS of research on this medication before you take it and BEWARE!!!!!!

Incredible I started taking effexor in December for treatment of depression, and it has proven to be incredible. I have taken many different anti-depressants including prozac, wellbutrin, and paxil cr, and this is the only medication that has made any difference. I love it! Depression runs in my family; all of my aunts and female cousins on my mother's side, including my mother and I stuggle with depression, and once I began taking effexor I told them all about it. Since then they've all switched and notice an enormous difference. Effexor works, it's cost effective if you have health insurance, and since I began taking it there have been absolutely NO side effects. I would recommend this medication to anyone.

Effexor for FMS fatigue I have been using Effexor XR for over a year.  My rheumatologist prescribed it for me after a prolonged period of almost debilitating fatigue.  I was able to go to work, but I would be so tired by the afternoons, I was unable to run errands or do household chores after work.  This went on for over a year. Starting off at 25mg, I didn't see any improvement until we got up to the 75mg dose.  It wasn't a complete help for the fatigue, but it was an improvement.   Instead of only being able to do things one or two days a week, I eventually was having four or five productive days a week.  And best of all, I had enough energy to go on vacation in 2003.  I didn't bother in 2002, because I didn't want to go somewhere when I didn't have the  energy to do anything, and also because I used a lot of my vacation time to leave work early on especially bad days.Currently, I feel like I'm tipping back towards more fatigue again, but I'm hoping it is just a seasonal variance that will improve again once the weather gets warmer and I can take up afternoon walks outside.  I have also been having a problem with insomnia.  I can get to sleep fine, but starting in August, I would wake up in the early morning (3 to 5am) and be unable to  get back to sleep.  We aren't sure if this is a side effect of the Effexor, or something else.  I started taking something else for that, and it has improved almost 100%.I re-evaluate my dosage with my rheumy in the beginning of April.I'm not sure if it has contributed to the reduction in FMS pain, or if I have just been avoiding activities because of the fatigue.  I was able to go on some good hikes last summer.  One especially was very physically demanding (A lot of stairs down and up in a valley, and uneven rocky trails) but the aftereffects only lasted for about two days.

One especially was very physically demanding (A lot of stairs down and up in a valley, and uneven rocky trails) but the aftereffects only lasted for about two days.  I thought that was almost like I was a normal person ;)The main downside is the price.  Even with my health insurance paying a good p

Effexor XR Has Really Helped Me I have been taking Effexor XR for a little over a year now.  Before the Effoxor I had been taking Paxil, however I had some side effect with Paxil that were less than helpful.  I was really sleepy all the time and sluggish, which at the same time I had a lot of anxiety.With the Effexor XR I feel much calmer and more able to relax, which I believe helps my Fibromyalgia in a big way.  When I get pain, I tend to scrunch all up from it.  This of course makes my muscles tense and tight, which causes the pain to be worse.  Effexor helps that not to happen any more.  I can use relaxation methods and feel real relief.  Also, I no longer have anxiety attacks except perhaps once every six months or so, and then it has to be something really big to trigger it.  I have also been able to work harder in therapy with the Effexor, as I feel a calmness that I did not have before which allows me to do the work I need to do with out paying for it with such terrible pain in my body.Effexor is an excellent drug for me.  It works and I have no side effects from it whatsoever.  I do agree however that there are very difficult side effects that come from stopping it completely and not tappering off.  I get my Effexor through a special program, and one time I found myself completely out of it.  It was only for two days, but I had a lot of really high anxiety, pains in my stomach, terrible headaches, etc. in just that short time.  The only problem I have with Effexor XR is the cost.  I am on disabilty, and the cost is way out of my reach.  If my psydoc had not helped me get on this special program, I would not be able to take it and receive the benefits it brings me.  That, I know, is the story with many drugs -- costs too high for the average consummer.  I am grateful for the program I am on, but it does make me wonder how, if they can lower the cost for me and for others, why they cannot just lower the cost of the drug for everyone....Thank y

I stopped using Effexor, and regretted it. I had taken Effexor effectively for a 2+ years, but eventually got to the point that I wasn't feeling very well and so I thought it wasn't doing much for me anymore.  I gradually stopped taking it (and yes, the withdrawal was terrible) in preparation for starting on an MAOI.  It wasn't too long before I learned the hard way that the Effexor had been the only thing keeping me out of a big, dark hole.I started the Effexor again, this time in conjunction with Wellbutrin.  (When my prescribing physician gave me the samples of Effexor to ramp up on it again, I took the boxes in my hands and said to them, &quot;I'm sorry I ever doubted you.&quot;)  The combination started working very quickly, and has given me more relief than I have experienced in years.  I am finally crawling out of depression.I should note that at the same time that I started the Effexor / Wellbutrin combo, I entered a &quot;partial hospitalization program&quot; in the psychiatric department of a local hospital.  (Partial means you don't sleep there.  It's kind of like day care for the mentally ill.)  The program was fantastic, and I feel it worked with the medications to bring me to this point of recovery.I experienced some nasty side effects from Effexor, some of which are ongoing.  It makes me sleepy to the point of being just about narcoleptic.  I take Dexedrine to compensate for that.  For the first few months I took it, it caused strong muscle spasms, particularly when I sat still for a while, or was laying in bed.  Some spasms were stong enough to jerk me awake just when I was starting to drop off to sleep.

the old standard I try various antidepressants as they come out and this works best for me. It tends to make it hard for me to get up in the morning, has sexual side effects and contributes to my weight but all AD's do that to me. It is hard to stop if I decide to go without meds for awhile and I always have to take zoloft for if I stop the Effexor. Stopping Effexor without immediately switching to another AD is almost impossible.

effexor Effexor XR is the best drug at relieving depression overall. I've tried Pamelor, Paxil, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Provigil, Remeron, Celexa, and Lexapro. Effexor XR also has the bonus of relieving anxiety disorders. Benefits do not wane, I've taken it for three years at various dosages. For me, 150mg/day is marginally depressed, 225mg/day is a happy medium, and 300mg/day makes me too edgy. A great combination with Wellbutrin or Provigil in case you have depression with fatigue, but I had to stop the Provigil--it brings on headaches after 3-4 days of use. Now I rely on an Effexor XR 225mg/day and Wellbutrin 300mg/day combo and it is truly life-changing. Now for the down side--if you ever decide to stop Effexor XR to try another drug, the withdrawals are horrible. You feel like a zombie with the flu. However, the drug works so well for me, that after all the withdrawals and a marginally successful trial of Lexapro, I went back to Effexor XR gladly. After two days I felt normal again. This drug alters your chemistry in a different way than all the others I have tried. It is truly great for me, but it is a jealous friend--try to dump it, and you will feel repercussions.

effexor I like the drug because it doesn't let you forget it- you can feel if you skip a dose. It does lower the sex drive of the user, but then so does depression.After over 20 years of having depression, it's the medication that has worked the best for me.

Effexor is great! Weaning off is the worst. Effexor is a 10+ in relieving my depressive/anxiety symptoms.. unfortunately.. the withdrawal is a -20 giving this medication an overall -10 in my book and not worth another trial.  Here is something I wrote in my journal about the withdrawal (I later found that benadryl and antivert helped to relieve the withdrawal so definitely use that if you're weaning off this med). It took me 4 months or so before i started to feel &quot;normal&quot;:So umm... I've been trying to wean myself off this medication called Effexor. (It's an SSRI-antidepressant... no I'm not depressed anymore, which is why Im trying to get off it). The reason I mention this is because it seems that doctors are either not informed or they're keeping withdrawal effects a secret...??? I've been aware of the withdrawal of Effexor when I would occasionally miss a dose and go into hours of &quot;lightening bolts&quot; in my head.... well after much research on the net... apparently, Effexor is the worst SSRI to wean off of... Figures!!So anyway, let me tell you the experience I've been having since Wednesday (last dose was on Tuesday).. Also, keep in mind that I knew about these withdrawals and tapered the dose for 4 weeks before Tuesday.... I've already mentioned the lightening bolts... you can only imagine what these feel like... a lightening bolt surging through your body starting from your head down to your toes... just grab some tweezers and stick them into an electrical socket.. that's what Im feeling about every 2 minutes of the day.. then add some tunnel vision to that.. basically unless I keep my eyes still, the lightening bolts don't stop, so I'm only able to focus ahead... I'm only able to talk to people for 2 minutes at a time because every bolt disorients me and I forget what I was talking about. So, for about 2-3 seconds at a time I will have occasional blackouts...

Works for me I've been on 375 mg. a day for almost 3 years. I take 225 mg. before bed and 150 mg. in the morning. I've been battling major depression for over 20 years and have been on every 'new' antidepressant there has been over that course of time. Effexor has been working for me - at least for the past 3 years. I'm hopeful I'll continue to benefit from its effects for many more years.

Effexor XR Some people love it some people hate it. I happen to be one that loves it. Ok I miss my sex life but it is worth it to me to feel normal again. I stopped taking it once just because I felt it didn't work.I am famous for not staying on meds. I went to 75 mgs per day for one week then cold turkey. Not one single withdrawal effect. After I stopped it for a while I realized just how much it helped. The combo that works for me is 150 mgs per day of Effexor /2-6 Mg. Diazapam (valium) as needed /and I am just now starting on Zonegran. THAT is the one that scares me so I am waiting to see how that goes. Would I recommend Effexor.. Highly. But we are all different. I have heard horror stories but not experienced them myself. Although the first 4 weeks I lived in the bathroom that does pass (pardon the pun)Oh and when I went off it I stayed off it for 2 months. In that time I gained 40 pounds.

Effex-not After 3weeks on 150mg I thought I was back in the land of the living. This lasted less than a week and symptoms regressed. Doc increased dose to 225mg which did not seem to make any positve difference and my sleeping paterns worsened, anxiety increased as did suicidal thoughts. After 3 months Doc decided to change med to Avanza (Mirtazapine) and I am withdrawing from Effexor now. Doc allowed 8 days for change over. I am on day 8 and will not be starting Avanza yet due to the terrible withdrawal symptoms - lack of sleep, dizziness, Tinitus, headaches, muscle aches and feeling spaced out. I hope these won't last too long.

Worked at First I have tried more than one person should ever have to of antidepressants, add meds, bi-polar meds. About 10 days of starting with 75mg 2x daily I felt so ambitious and organized and overall sense of well being it was fantastic. I ask my psychiatrist if I would remain to fell this way he said yes ( I guess thinking mind over matter would be effective with me). Any way that did not happen. So I went to a higher dosage (150mg xr 3x daily more then the normal limit and it seemed to help for a while but not anymore. I still am depressed, fatigued and have my ADD systems. I have ask to try yet something else and my psyc. will not do so. I believe it is due to the terrible side effects that I have been reading about.

pooped out on me! I was on effexor for about 3 years. I had to keep increasing the dose every so often until I was up to 300mg per day. In the beginning it was a godsend.......stopped my panic attacks and generalized anxiety. Stopped working after a while though.  Had start up side effects that lasted for about 2 months of dry mouth, headache, nausea or no appetite and vivid dreams, all went away with time.

Effexor dangerous for my child!!! Wrong dosage sorry!! My 8 year old was taking 3 37.5 mg capsules every am. She started having psychotic episodes after about 6 months, so we took her off, were told no effects or no withdrawals...BULL! She is miserable, but already acting better after one and a half weeks. Tummy cramps, nausea, headaches, moodswings, crying spells, shakes, like she's coming off heroin or something! DO NOT take effexor or mostly DO NOT put your child on it unless EXTREMELY necessary! It's been the worst experience for our family!

Happy My sister has been on effexor for a long period of time and told me about it and I have been on effexor now for about a month and I am up to 300mg. The only side effect that I have come across is that I have more hot flashes, but it helps keep me awake and keeps my anxiety under control. I am also on seroquel and klonopin and tegretol. I am bipolar with other major problems along with post traumatic syndrome. So long as I stay on my medication I can live an almost normal life.

Attacks are gone After having severe anxiety attacks my doctor put me on Effexor. It took about 4 months before all attacks have gone. Side effects are cold feet and hands, vivid dreaming once in a while, body twitching sometimes.My side effects change all the time, I had no vivid dreaming or twitching until about 5 months of taking Effexor. I'm thinking about switching to Wellbutrin soon as requested by my doctor.

I don't think I'll ever be normal again! I've been using Exfexor for several years. The first year I was increased from 75mg to 300mg. I had the normal side effects, but I pressed on hoping for the best. Once I got to the 300mg dosage, I thought this was a miracle drug! I felt better than I had for years. But - the miracle is over! I started feeling dizzy, loss of concentration, emotionally out of control, irritated, had sexual disfunction, fatigue, migraine like headaches with horrible brain &amp; body surges. My Psychiatrist prescribed Xanax &amp; Ambien. This helped, but still didn't completely solve the problem. The next step was to add Lexapro. This just compounded the problem. Then we tried upping the dosage to 375mg. This was the worst decision yet. The medication cost $500.00 for the one month and turned me into a zombie!!  Scared and frustrated I would never be normal again, I started to reduce my meds myself. I thought that had to be better than what I was going through. I'm now going to a different doctor who has me on Effexor 225mg with 150mg of Welbutrin XL. We're planning on slowly reducing and eliminating Effexor all together. I believe this drug has permanently altered my brain. I wouldn't recommend anyone to take such high doses without looking up all the side effects from patients that have taken it - not what the Dr says the side effects are (after all, they're not taking it so how would they know).I just want to feel good without taking a handful of drugs to conteract the side effects.

Thank you for my life back!!!!!!!!!!! I was taking at least 10-15 different drugs for Bi-Polar Disorder Type II (rapid cycler), dysthemic depression.  I have had 24 electro-convulsive shock treatments.  I was finally put on the miracle drug Effexor.  I took small doses at first and I now take 375mg/day.  It has given my life back to me.  I have been taking it for about 3 years now.  I want to thank the makers of effexor xr for the wonderful drug that gives me a chance at life.  I lead a very normal life as long as I continue my medications.  Sometimes during extreme stress I forget to take my medication for 2 or 3 days.  I feel myself slipping backwards in to my depression.  I think because I take such a high dosage that I do feel out of sorts with just missing it on a short time basis.  Thank you for my life back!!!!!!!!!!!

be careful with withdrawals I took effexor xr for about 7 months and I had hand tremor, I was constantly tired, and towards the end it became less and less effective.And my hands were shaking so bad I could not even eat a bowl of soup or hold a cup of coffee.But by far the worst thing I found about this medication was the withdrawals.  You must be weaned off of it VERY slowly.  It took me three weeks and I had the following symptoms: cold sweats, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, all over body pain, dizziness, and terrible headaches.  I wouldn't wish anyone to ever have to go through what I did with this med.

The Best of the New Antidepressants Switching from Paxil to Effexor was a much needed change.  Paxil had done well by me before, but was not equipped to handle life situations at the time.  I knew immediately Effexor was more effective, and as I increased the dose, I felt more &quot;normal&quot; than ever before.  Side effects were mild including decreased libido.  I wish they made a 225mg pill though.  Best of all though, you'll know within two weeks of reaching your target dose if Effexor will work for you which is why it is so often prescribed in Inpatient facilities.

Turned it Off Not until I reached peak dosage of 300mg a day did my anxiety and OCD simply shut off.  It's was like being able to look at a situation, a realize that you're not reacting like you normally would and be happy about it.  They should offer more pill sizes though because the maximum FDA recommended dose is 225mg which can only be achieved by taking 3 75mg capsules a day which costs around 300 bucks.  Try a 225mg PILL!

FDA PLEASE BAN THIS DRUG This is the worst drug I have ever taken in my life.  I have taken Paxil, which I thought had terrible side effects and withdrawal effects, but compared nothing to the hell which Effexor made my life.  I have taken Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Wellbutrin, Seroquel, and Lamictal.  This drug should not be taken by anyone.  If you plan to try this drug make it a life-time committment because the withdrawal was the worst experience I've ever had physically.  I was incapacitated for three weeks after having a severe violent episode ending in self-harm, hospitalization, and nearly the loss of my wife, children, and home.  I lost my job and have been out of work for 2 months since taking this drug.The side effects included: dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, intense suicidal thoughts, self-harm, stomach cramps, and headaches.The withdrawal side effects put me in bed for three weeks.  I could not eat solid food for ten days, had body and head shocks, vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhoids, huddled over cramping (which felt like my stomach was being rung out like a wet towel).  I had no energy and went into my most severe  depression.Bipolar patients beware!!!!!!!!!!!!  I suffered the most severe mania followed by the most severe depression I have ever suffered, both of which were life-threatening.This drug should not be available to anyone.  The whole catch with this drug for the pharmaceutical company is that people continue taking the drug to avoid the withdrawal's hellish existence.  Most doctors are ignorant to the severity of the danger of using this drug.  It is the pharmaceutical rep's job to push his or her product on doctor's by providing perks (dinners, sporting event tickets, catered lunches, and even cash - for giving &quot;speeches&quot;).  The drug company, it's representatives, and many doctors are concerned more with money than good healthcare.  This is not to discredit the entire medical community, there are very reputible doctors out

Didn't feel a difference My actual dosage was 375mg a day, three 75mg capsules in the a.m., and 2 in the evening, but the dosage schedule above didn't have that as an option.  I tried it for such a long time.  My shrink saw something I didn't, I guess.  But since I've discontinued it (almost a year), and been on NO antidepressants, I feel better.  I think it helped getting a new shrink.  I don't feel like there was any difference at all.

effe(???)xor I don't think that this drug justifies its name. It did help for anxiety and agitation but nothing for depression even even after being on around 200mg for 2 months. 225mg made me worse and I couldn't stand that dose. On the other hand pretty good tolerability - no sleepiness, no other bothersome side effects. Even with very gradual tapering over 1 month I still had withdrawals like dizziness, nausea, headaches, shake, brain zaps that cannot be justified by the time that I 've been on it (&lt; 6 months) or the effect it had on me. Now 10 days off the drug the withdrawals still haven't gone but I 'm still trying to be patient because there are very annoying. I think this drug must be used only short term like benzodiazepines for no more than 2 months. That's the only way people will be spared this drug's terrible withdrawal.

Wanted to die I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, was on effexor and klonopin, made me so nervous and withdrawn. When I tapered off of it I had electric shock like feelings in my head and was so shaky and ill feeling I wanted to die, had to take up to 4mgs xanax a day to counter act the effects of the withdrawal. Terrible drug, I was a total wreck from this stuff.

Effexor is a miracle drug I was depressed for over 5 years when my doctor finally suggested Effexor. She had given up on me. She wanted me to have ECT but I refused. I felt the effect of Effexor after the first dose. My best friend said it was like night and day and she could tell over the phone after the first dose also. Thank you Effexor for finally pulling me out of a long and deep depression.

effexor in need of augmentation Effexor helped(fairly well) my severe depression at first, but not as dramatically as lithium carbonate.  It was somewhat incapacitating at first.I just wanted to lay on the floor forever, like I belonged in an opium den.  After a few months, it doesn't seem to be doing much on its own, but in combo with buspirone and/or lithium and/or especially 400mg Sam-e it seems a necessary part of my treatment.  Sam-e augmentation of effexor may be comparable to the more common wellbutrin augmentation.  I don't know which is more cost-effective, but it's worth checking.  BuSpar eases the sexual side-effects of effexor.  Ejaculatory delay was main one for me--not bad since the depression brought prematurity into my life.  Trismus (jaw tension) and tremor are my other main side-effects of effexor.  Troublesome, but do-able.  Promising, but not really as a monotherapy for me (bipolar-II w/ atypical depr.).  A unipolar depr. friend's been on it for a year and likes it, apart from the libido-lowering.  She's gonna try the wellbutrin or buspar or gingko strategies to combat this.

Effexor I've tried Tofranil and Anafranil in the past and it made me sleep 18 hours a day. I lost a lot of weight and eventually I was able to go back to work. Later I started to pick at the heels of my feet until I could peel the skin right off of them. I had to wear bandages instead of shoes and I could hardly walk. I got off them all together and learned to cope with my problems.After 10 years and I'm under more stress and changes in my life that I feel no control over, the depression has come back. I'm on 75mg once a day for the past 6 days and seem to be able to function without the crying. I need to deal with my situation before it takes any more out of me. I've been trying to lose weight for the past 6 months with no success but since the depression I have a lost a total of 15 pounds. 10 since I started taking Effexor.Check out my profile for more details.

Effexor is awful I am Bipolar2. I was put on Effexor-XR at 37.5mg as I was being taken off of 175mg of Imipramine after 19 years of use.  Adjusted weekly, I began getting nauseous when I reached 150mg daily.  I was weaned off slowly and after four weeks the nausea went away. (I may have started feeling better, briefly, or I may have hoped I would feel better.) Thinking that the withdrawal of the imipramine might have caused the nausea, I started taking the Effexor again.  After 4 days at 37.5mg, the nausea started again. I mmediately went off and after 12 days, the nausea is still with me. What a horrible experience this has been.

Effexor seems to work I've tried numerous anti-depressants: prozac, paxil, fluvox, to name a few. I've been on effexor off and on for about three years, and i think it works (as much as i can say any of my medications are working).Recently my dose was upped gradually from 150 mg a day to 300 mg a day. It made a huge difference, as before that i had been so depressed that i wasn't getting out of bed, at all.I was a little worried about the higher dose but it really seemed to work - before that i was ready to go off effexor and try something new

Hoped it would work I requested Effexor from my Dr. and took it for a little over a month. It did nothing to help my mood or pain. I even felt a little worse. My son is taking it and says it doesn't help either. but continues anyway. Go figure. So far the only drug having any beneficial effect is still Prozac. I am going to try Zoloft and if that doesnt work back to Prozac for me.

I was ready to give up on psych meds... Over the past 3 years I failed Wellbutrin and Celexa, but then my Dr. suggested Effexor and so far so good. It's been about 6 months and I've had my ups and downs but no major setbacks. Worst side-effects; sexual dysfunction, thirst/dry mouth and beware of missing a dose, you will feel very ill! For sexual dysfunction, I combined Effexor with Buspar (30mg) and that took care of the problem completely but I noticed increased insomnia and nightmares so I'm off Buspar for the time being. My Dr. mentioned other options such as Viagra, but I don't know...Has anyone else tried other treatments for sexual dysfunction on effexor?

Ugh... Was on this for about 6 weeks. My depressed pal had a stash of free samples of this stuff and I started taking it in July. Don't remember the exact dose. Sex drive took a nose dive--or should I say, the desire was still there but the &quot;resolution&quot; was not accessible. Very frustrating to me and my gf at the time. I also quit drinking coffee (was up to four cups a day) in August while on this stuff. Weaned off caffeine and had only a day of headaches. MAYBE the Effexor helped with that? I dunno.I will say my aggitation eased off and I didn't have any explosive anger episodes while on it. That was good, but the sex drive thing was bad.

Come off or stay on? I have been taking Effexor XR 75mg for a bit over a year and recently have developed extreme anxiety resulting in panic attacks and crying fits. After some messing around I finally got my doctor to lower my dose in the hope that I would eventually come off altogether. She has given me plain old Effexor (NOT XR as before!) and everytime I take a tablet I spend the next 3-4 hours trying to hold in any food i may have eaten. I'm not sure if the nausea is better or worse than the lightheadedness and zappy feelings i get all through my body if i simply don't take the pills. Today is my second day without them, so I'll see how I go.

Works for me I have been cut off by the insurance carrier and have to discontinue this medication on my own. I have been doing a lot of Internet research and have found it is cost prohibitive (hundreds of dollars a month) and have read a lot of horror stories about side effects. While the medication was extremely effective for me, I can now attribute it to my hot flashes, night sweats, brittle nails, and EXTREME weight gain. I am very apprehensive about the discontinuation symptoms (this is a highly addictive drug) but will be relieved to no longer be inexplicably 40 pounds overweight (not to mention dependant on a drug).

Side effects on first day My Doc put me on Effexor 75mgs once a day!  Within 1 hour of the first dose, I had blurred vision, severe nausea, racing intrusive thoughts!  I was in bed all day because of the nausea and blurred vision!  I was also up all night with insomnia!  I think he gave me a way too high of a dose to start with!  I quit taking it after that reaction!  Just remember we all react differently to each antidepressant, since we all have unique brain chemistry, so this may work wonders for someone else!

Effexor I've been taking Effexor for a little over a year now, I've been as high as 225mg and as low as 75mg.  150 seems pretty good for me.  I don't have nearly the severity of depression I used to, and the bouts of depression are shorter in duration. I've managed to make it a year without suicidal ideations, which is good considering I used to think of it at least every other day.  My only complaint is if I go over five hours past the time I'm supposed to take my meds I start to get sick (dizzy, nausea) so I have to keep spare meds in my purse. I'm going to start CBT with my Effexor soon, so hopefully I won't have to try any more drugs.

Effexor - Wonder Drug? Hello to all,I never have felt so content in my life as I did the first week that I began taking 37.5 mg per day of Effexor XR. Soon, though, I had to take more and more to get it to work until I was taking an unsafe dosage. Why??? It was so nice for a while! It did make me constipated, but it worked well.

Effexor XR is pooping out For 3 or 4 months I've been taking Effexor XR and Remeron 30 at night. The effexor worked great but now is pooping out and the worst side effect was impotence and lack of achieving orgasm. I haven't had an orgasm since I began the Effexor. Before the Effexor I was taking Remeron 30 for several months alone and that did not cause sexual side effects but alone it didn't work for my depression very well. I'm thinking of asking the doc to change me over to Lexapro as it seems to be widely regarded as an SSRI with the fewest side effects. Some reports still say that it can cause sexual side effects and weight gain. I hope it doesn't. I briefly tried Lexapro before but only 5 mg. Stopped because a half dose 5mg didn't last for 24 hrs. Then again I didn't let it build in my system for more than a couple of days.Update: My doc wants to raise the dosage I'm taking to 150 mg a day. He is of the belief that at least 50% of his patients improve from the sexual side effects of the drug at this level. I have never heard of this. He says that serotonin is somewhat reduced and norepinephrine is increased. I'll update agin when I have a result.

Does work but handle with care (esp withdrawal) I was on Effexor for pretty well 2 years. On the plus side, it clearly helped pull me out of a very vicious depression, with only limited side effects while I was taking it... However, I really want to say that this is a very powerful drug which, while it clearly helps, is not to be taken lightly. The withdrawal - even with very slow, measured and controlled tapering - was at times horrifically unpleasant. Now, in retrospect, I believe that this was the price to pay for having gotten better but at the time it was very difficult and uncomfortable, not only for me, but also for those around me. I really do believe in the benefits of anti-depressants but I guess I am saying that they should only be taken if they are really really needed. They are not sweets! If you are suffering from a very mild condition and your doctor wants to put you on a low dose of effexor, I would strongly recommend that you try to exhaust all other paths before starting (therapy, diet, exercise etc). If, however, you are seriously depressed/suicidal then follow your doctors advice and absolutely take this drug. It does work and you can worry about the withdrawal later. Above all, don't be alone. If you are coming off Effexor, be honest to those around you about what is happening. You will be amazed at how caring and understanding even those who you thought would have no idea about depression can be. Remember, depression is not shameful, it happens to the best of us and it is very treatable. I hope you all find the strength to do so and the peace of mind every single person deserves.
effexor	Depression	2003-11-21 00:00:00		3.5	0.5	2.0	2.5	Does work but handle with care (esp withdrawal) I was on Effexor for pretty well 2 years. On the plus side, it clearly helped pull me out of a very vicious depression, with only limited side effects while I was taking it... However, I really want to say that this is a very powerful drug which, while it clearly helps, is not to be taken lightly.

I'm very happy with it The first 14 days were hell, but after I have finally gotten on a steady dose and take it at night I feel great! I finally am starting to feel like my self again. It has only been a few weeks, so I may find down the road that this isnt the drug for me but so far it looks much more promising than any of the others I have tried.

Effexor - good for depression I currently take 225 mgs of Effexor once a day in the evening.  Effexor has been effective in treating my depression; however, the side-effects are making it difficult to stay on.  My most troubling side effect is day time sleepiness.  I have experienced this with almost every antidepressant I have taken.   I take Effexor in the evening, but still I am tired in the day.  I take Wellbutrin in the morning and afternoon, and that helps somewhat.  Initially, I had no appetite and was a bit quesy, but that went away.  If you don't have problems with sleepiness, I suggest taking Effexor.I am adding an addition to my review.  I am now weaning off of Effexor and I felt that I should comment on the process.  I strongly suggest weaning as opposed to a &quot;cold turkey&quot; approach.  I have been weaning for two months now, and just when I thought I was free to live my life without Effexor, the withdrawl set in BIG TIME.  I experienced brain shivers and zapping sensations like never before.  Flu - like symptoms set in and I really felt as if I wasn't part of this world.  Finally, I took some Effexor to ease the pain.  I now open up the capsules, and take 1/2 to a 1/4.  One day hoping to completely free myself of this nightmare.

New On Effexor - Cautiously Optimistic My mother has taken Effexor for years with great results, so I decided to try it after several months of using a combination of Wellbutrin (up to 400mg daily) and Lexapro (up to 20mg daily), both of which yielded inconclusive results. Wellbutrin did help with concentration but made me shaky at higher dosages and seemed to make me more anxious and prone to outbursts, along with being more garrulous, for better or worse. I've been taking the Effexor midday with a meal, having gotten a bit naseous w/o food, yet I'm feeling rather tired all the time and am sleeping an hour or so more than usual, so I'm thinking about taking the dosage at night to minimize daytime weariness. I have felt a bit more content but perhaps at the risk of feeling too numb and distant. The jury is still out, as I've only taken Effexor for a week, and the dosage is at the low end of the therapeutic range (it's expensive!) Lower libido on Lexapro wasn't assuaged with Wellbutrin. That said, I'd be curious to hear if anyone has had success with Effexor and Wellbutrin.

Effexor XR Effexor XR was one of the first medications I was prescribed. It seemed to reve up my rapid cycling nature so that I was soon taking Lithium and Neurontin.  When you take many medications, it's impossible to know which one does what to you.  Definitely I have some sexual side effects and some weight gain which could be from Effexor or any of them. Fatigue is another one that may be caused by Effexor; fatigue is something I Really suffer from.

The worst medication in the world I tried Effexor for a few months, after failing with Paxil and Zoloft.  I felt poisoned, and every symptom of my depression was intensified.  To make matters worse, it was so addictive that I had to be weened off it for a month and a half.

watch out - don't quit cold turkey i hate to say it but, when quitting cold turkey, things get much worse before they get better. when i &quot;detoxed&quot; off of effexor, it was as if i was coming off of heroin. (i once before tried to quit and couldn't. i was sick, nauseous, dizzy, achy. the only thing that make me feel human again was effexor.)someone i know works for the company who makes effexor and said one can't just quit effexor. be prepared to do it over the course of a week. first GRADUALLY reduce the amount taken. you will have to open up the capsules and take smaller and smaller doses of the tiny, tiny &quot;beads&quot;. when it comes time to stop, be prepared to do so over a weekend when you can kinda veg. u will still feel kinda lousy when u do stop but it is tolerable.

Switched to try Lexapro No meds are great until they come in a patch that lasts for a few weeks!  That will help those of us who have the memory of a pea.Made my memory worse.Other than that, really helped reduce my distractibility (damm those crying babies!)The right dose kept me centered.

Effexor I do like this. The side effects are a little tough. My mouth is extremely dry, my appetite is nothing. I was well underweight to begin with.This med is being used with Prozac for anorexia. The illogical side of me loves it! Because, I have NO appetite at all. It's easy to deny food. However, not very wise. I do feel more mentally stable on this. Calmer, less blue. But, the side effects are rough. I do like that I feel &quot;all in one&quot;. No drugged feeling w the XR. Just use caution if you are underweight. I have lost 16 lbs. in a month and a few days. Please be wise. It will help your depression.

Effexor....best so far I have been on Effexor for over 9 years after trying Prozac, Paxil, &amp; Zoloft.  Paxil worked for a few weeks, but it just didn't seem to be doing the job I needed.  Effexor seems to be the right chemical makeup for me and when I need to I &quot;bump&quot; it up a little.  I maintain a steady dose of 75mg a day, but have worked up to 300mg and back down steadily with no problem.  That was during my most severe time.  Usually I just need to go up from 75mg to 150mg and back down.  I only have 2 problems with Effexor: withdrawal and cost.  If I am late taking my daily dose, I start to have little tingles (like when your foot falls asleep and prickles when the blood is filling back up).  These little shocks occur in different sides of my scalp and face.  I'd like to think I could get off Effexor, but the withdrawals are too mentally painful.

Stopped anxiety attacks, but side effects I have suffered with anxiety for the past 5 years. I can't tell you how it all started, except I was going through an a lot of changes in my life at that time. But, I too have tried several different drugs for this. It seemed like after using the drug for awhile, my body chemistry would get use to it, then I would start having the anxiety attacks. They are very scary! I have been rushed to the hospital on several occasions thinking I was going to die, not knowing what was happening to me. However, now I understand what is happening and can somewhat have control. I have been on effexor for a little over a year. I don't have the anxiety attacks, but, I do have a lot of side effects, like, headaches, dry mouth, stomach pain, weight gain, no sexual desire. I then got very discouraged with the side effects and decided to stop taking the drugs, without a doctors advice, WOW, that was a big mistake, I thought I was going to lose my mind. Hope this has helped someone to understand to keep it under control with the doctors advice.  Take care!  Gloria

Killer withdrawal Effexor was definitely effective at relieving some symptoms of depression.  Side effects - sexual dysfunction, extreme sweating, difficulty urinating, nausea, and night spasms - became intolerable.  Withdrawal was the worse, though.  Despite tapering off slowly, I was constantly dizzy, nauseous, and had episodes of seizure-like jolts (referred to as &quot;brain shivers&quot; by others).

Effexor calms me I have bipolar disorder and I have been taking 225mg of Effexor XR for about two years.  I started taking it because I always felt nervous and &quot;scared&quot;. It has done a wonderful job to treat those feelings.  I have had no problems or side effects with it, except maybe a little more weight gain.  Not much though.  It's hard to say, really, because I'm taking other medications as well.

I'm hopeful I was just switched to Effexor XR from Lexapro (it did nothing for me) and I'm hopeful I've finally found something that will work. So far its too early to notice any change but I haven't noticed any side effects which is a good thing. I noticed that my prescription would cost me about $280 for a months supply if it wasn't for my insurance. *jeez* Its very easy to take and I like the fact that I can take it all at once instead of multiple times during the day. My psychiatrist is trying to up my dose to 300mg as soon as possible, so every two days I'm supposed to add on another capsule to the regime. I'll update once I get further along in my treatment with this AD. UPDATE: Slight improvement noticed but still depressed overall.

It takes You out of depression and I did not feel any side effects except lower libido- that was obvious.It wokrs much better than imipramine in a way that it does not take You into mania.Otherwise I think I am ADD so even when out of depression and not in mania there is still things to think about, and effexor does not help much there.

effexor xr THIS has really helped my chronic fatigue symptoms. I did without it for 2 months and CFS was awful, went back on; within a week no pain and lots of energy.

Just Don't Do It! I totally regret switching from Wellbutrin to Effexor.  Since Wellbutrin didn't have an extended release pill, I kept forgetting to take my other Wellbutrin and thought the idea of only having to take 1 pill per day versus 2 would make my hectic life a little simpler.  Boy, was I wrong!!  After starting Effexor I had the worse case of diarrhea.  Not to mention my lack of sex drive.  I was sleepy and tired all the time and had to go inpatient for a few days after having suicidal thoughts/gestures. I will never take or recommend this drug to anyone.  If the medication you are taking works, stick with it, regardless of the inconvenience it might cause in your life.

VERY BAD WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS I had taken Prozac a few times over the past 10 years and have always had success with it, and never withdrawal problems. (In fact I had also tried Paxil and maybe Wellbutrin briefly, with no major side effects, so this thing I'm going through now was NOT expected). A few months ago I felt maybe the generic version of Prozac I had recently switched to was not as effective (has anyone else felt that way??), or that maybe I needed an increased dosage. The doctor, instead, recommended I switch to EFFEXOR XR. I had seen so many glowing advertisements for it about how wonderful it is, so I agreed. After 3 months I asked to go back on Prozac because I felt absolutely no benefit from the Effexor. I was going cold turkey and going right back to my 20mg of Prozac. After consulting with the other doctors in the office, my doctor agreed that would be okay, since the Prozac would help eliminate any Effexor side effects. The very day I skipped my Effexor dose (150mg) I started feeling &quot;shocks&quot;. No one else has described their's quite the same as I would describe mine, but I believe it's still the effects of Effexor. My &quot;shocks&quot; occur when I move my head...I feel these little jolts that seem to be in my nerve endings throughout my body. They only last a second, but happen again after I move. Of course the only way to keep still is be laying down in bed, so these shocks happen a lot. On day 2 I was still getting the shocks, but also feeling flu-like symptoms. Day 3 was the same, and I couldn't even get myself to work. Today, Day 4, I still feel a more subtle version of the shocks, but also feel very tired, weak and light-headed/woozy. It sucks, to put it bluntly.I guess the bottom line is Effexor is doing a good job of winning over new patients, but no one (except for a few message boards) is stepping up to discuss the withdrawal side effects. This was a complete &quot;shock&quot; to me. It will eventually catch up to the general public, I hope. It is ob

Effexor put a monkey on my back... Over the years, Effexor's ability to control (not eliminate) my depressive symptoms has been bested only by Parnate, an antidepressant in the MAO inhibitor class whose diet restrictions seem to terrify current-day pdocs from prescribing it more often out out of fear of potential liability problems. That said, I would not consider taking Effexor any longer than 2, maybe 3 months if by that time it has yet to provide you with acceptable relief from your systems. Trying to get off this stuff, even through very gradual reduction of doses, has on numerous occasions left me feeling so uncomfortable as to lead me to up my dose back to previous high therapeutic levels. The manufacturer did'nt disclose this 'withdrawal' syndrome potential when I first started taking Effexor.  They do now - Read it!

Effexor lives up to its name Hi There, I am a long time survivor of severe panic disorder and deep depression and have taken pretty much every antidepressant on the market  except for Lexapro (a derivative of Celexa) and Celexa.My pattern of mental illness was one of first somnolence, lack of interest in life, then panic attacks would hit full blown which landed me in the hospital until I began to recognize and use cognitive skills to work through the agonizing 20 or so minutes of the worse fear I have ever known.  Then my world would fall apart as depression would settle in..if nothing was done, agoraphobia followed.  Over the years I have learned to NOT give up.  I have taken Pamelor, Prozac, etc..etc...(Prozac being the best drug ever as far as feeling good) but one of the worse for side effects.  This drug tended to put me in the bed with flu like symptoms for about one week, orgasms were non existent and my small frame went from 125 to 156...but hey I was at least not loosing my mind?I have tried just about all of the antidepressants..EFFEXOR lives up to its name.  It does have some side effects ...sexual, weight gain, fatigue, headaches, but the depression does go away and the desire to live returns.  Motivation returns and that is a pretty good feeling!!! However, I would not return to it as there are other drugs better now with a lot less side effects, however I cannot knock it as I was very thankful for it at the time. Although Serzone (Nafazadone for generic) has been black boxed by the FDA and taken off the market in Europe and understandably so as liver damage can be scary this is however, my drug of choice for now.  This  is my second time using it.  I first used it in 1997 for three years and then stopped as I felt I needed a break from  the drug and my stress level had dropped tremendously. (I knew that when the next life defining moment happened I would need it again) But I went drug free for three years!! However, I know that there are

Effexor This is the only A_D on market that consistently helps me.I havve been on a 20 year merry go round of meds and docs.I remember when Prozac hit the market and made Lilly multy-BILLIONS of dollars the first couple years before copycats zoloft and paxil came uot.They would all help for short times,and play out.I tryed many tricyclics with little response.Doc wanted me to try lexapro,and in 3-4 months was in jail for causing them to fear for safety.This was unlike my personality,and scared me greatly.I got an apt.with anather pdoc,her very first question was why the lexepro? She then marked it off my chart and informed me it had aggressive result in some(NOT ALL!)patients.Thats the short version of why I keep my meds to a min. now.Effexor and xanax SR,and I've been fairly happy,and stable for the first time in a long time.

Both Friend and Foe    I have two seperate experiences with Effexor. I can not accurately tell you what my dosing was, but it was within normal range.    At 17, it was the first antidepressant that I was put on and I found it remarkably helpful. (It was the only med I took at that time.) One of the main things I remember was that I suddely was able to make eye contact with ease. I didn't feel so shy and that was incredibly liberating.   It did however, kill my libido entirely. I no longer had any interest in even discussing sex - this was not normal for me.    Twice I ended up in the ER because I ran out of meds and was not able to get a refill before I was caught up in horrible symptoms of withdrawal (this included stomach aches, nausaea (sp), and a feeling of being disonnected...like I had no core.) I couldn't think straight and became extremely irrational. It was frightening and weird and at that time it wasn't acknowledged that Effexor could cause such side effects.      If I was so much as an hour late on a dose, it began. It's a hard feeling to describe and the only thing that comes to mind is that it felt weird. (It took many more hours before it was full blown withdrawal.)    I had to be weaned off of it slowly.     The second time, Effexor XR was added to two other psych meds I was taking. I did notice a lessening of libido, but not nearly as significant as the first time. I did not have any withdrawal symptoms. I'm not sure how effective it was that second time because I went off of all meds soon after starting it.    When

It was not the best  for me I tried effexor xr for 7 weeks. It helped with anxiety but the depression was always there and I felt I had to fight it constantly. Also fear of withdraw made me not want to continue taking it especially when a dose increase was suggested. I tapered on to lexapro and it seems to have being having a better effect on the depression after on two weeks.

Cannot be without it Effexor has made my life bearable in that I no longer suddenly burst into uncontrollable tears at my situation. And I have none of the side effects that so often accompany an anti-depressant. I no longer feel the terrrible stress that I had felt before I began the Effexor.  I do not know whether the Effexor has made any difference in pain level or flexibility, but I am no longer so terribly concerned about my situation.

Effexor side effects I had absolutely NO desire for sex on Effexor.  EVERYTHING was stripped away...want, desire, orgasms...everything was gone!  I was like a zombie!

effexor I took effexor for a couple of years, aside from the sexual side effects it worked really well for me.  Sadly about 6 months ago I started to slip and increasing the dose was not effective so now I am on celexa and starting to feel better.  I have been on many drugs over the past 10 years and have had some success, but for only a limited amount of time.

Effexor XR I take Effexor XR for pain. Been taking it for several years. I do notice the weight gain, but this also comes with all the other medications I take.

Effexor I switched from Zoloft to Effexor when Zoloft was losing it's effectiveness. The Zoloft was very good for about a year. The Effexor did help, however, I developed debilitating memory problems, short and long term.  It was difficult to function with my work.  I am now weaning off of this drug very slowly, because the withdrawal symptoms are bad.  My withdrawal process will be 2-3 months long.  I'm am now at 37.5 every 2 1/2 days.  I will be finished in about 2 weeks.  I am now taking Buspar which I hope will be enough.  So far, I'm ok.  I use other proactive means to help the depression, a little exercize, uplifting music, prayer, support groups.

Effexor I took effexor for one week, and it was the worst medication Ive even taken... I experienced slow speech, ticks and black outs.I had to discontinue this medication right away.This medication may work for others.But for me, it was a nightmare!I'd rather stick to my 40 mg of prozac.With prozac, I don't experience side effects other then drowsiness.And it's just as,if not more effective with my depression

Fibromyalgia with Chronic Tension Headaches I began taking the Effexor XR at the lowest dosage and gradually increased the dosage to 150 mg.  In the beginning, the effects of the Effexor XR seemed to be helping me.  I was told that I would experience some fatigue and sleepiness at first and then it would pass.  I managed to get through the work week and would find myself on the couch all weekend.  For the next 5-6 weekends, I ended up in the bed with absolutely no motivation whatsoever to get up and get dressed - too much energy required. I also noticed quite a bit of mental fog.  I decided to taper down to 75 mg and felt a small amount of relief, but still no motivation (drained).  I tapered to the smallest dose and then completely off.  I had read so many wonderful things about Effexor XR, but was personally disappointed.

Wonder drug I have been using Effexor XR since being diagnosed with CFS/EBV in 1999. I tried to go off of it once, and returned to my hellish nightmare. Since returning to use, I have been better, able to function daily, little to no side effects, nothing worries me, or troubles me. I feel Effexor has saved my quality of life.

Effexor It didn't help with the fatigue or joint pain.  It helped a little with the mind fog except it caused me to be dizzy.  I was on it for 9 months and I was so glad when my doctor let me stop taking it.  I felt so much better off of Effexor than I did on.

This is ONE NASTY DRUG! I do not mean to scare anyone, but I weaned off this drug for 8 weeks and still had horrible side effects. I literally could not drive or do anything that required intense thought. I had what I can only describe as &quot;brain jolts&quot; which felt like a small shock surging through your head. It took almost a year for all of the withdrawal symptoms to subside. If you are currently taking this drug the best way to come off is by using Prozac. Prozac takes away the symptoms as you wean down and then eventually you can come off the Prozac without any problems.This company should have been sued!!

Effexor I went into a full-blown mancic episode while taking Effexor (I had no previous history of mania).  I was singing, dancing, and talking to myself in public places.  The anxiety was terrible and I ended up having an alcoholic relapse after 18 years of sobriety.  Withdrawal from the drug was very uncomfortable.

Works for me! Effexor has been very helpful in treating my chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety...especially the OCD.  It has kept recurring eating disorder thoughts at bay.  Things don't seem so emotionally overwhelming when I am on effexor.  I have been on every other antidepressant and this has been the best of them all.  Life is just more manageable!!  However, I recommend keeping an extra dose with you at all times since missing a dose does cause considerable side effects.  That is the only downside to this drug.

My experience with Effexor I was prescribed a low dosage of Effexor because I was having some physical health problems due to anxiety.  I took it for four months and it was tremendously helpful during the time I took it.  A few weeks ago I stopped taking it and while I didn't have any trouble with the anxiety coming back after I discontinued use, the withdrawal from the drug was very unpleasant.  After reading some of the other ratings here, I guess I'm lucky that it only lasted about a week.  Every time I stood up my head would spin.  I would randomly get the vertigo feeling for no apparent reason, as well.  The only thing that was really amusing about it is that I work in a courthouse and when I'd stumble past the security officers I'd think to myself, &quot;No, officer, I'm not drunk, I'm just withdrawing from a psychotropic drug.&quot;

IT works but you may have to press for high dose Hi, there!  I take effexor SR 150 mg 4X a day. In Europe, daily dosages of 600 to 800 mg. are quite common, but not here, so you'll need an informed doc if the usual American doses don't do the trick for you. The side effects are unpleasant (sweating, blurry vision sometimes, occasional insomnia) but if you are resistant to most depression meds, as I am (plus I go completely manic with SRI's such as prozac and zoloft) effexor is definitely worth a shot -- and the best thing, to me, is that you can tell if it's working within a couple of weeks, max (usually within days!)I believe it may have literally saved my life this time as my depression was so severe I was completely bedridden and had few thoughts that weren't suicidal ideation, which began going away within 24 hours when I restarted effexor (I also take 150-300 mg of Wellbutrin a day, plus trazedone to sleep, but the effexor is the essential one).I have not had as much hell going off it as other people who posted here, and this may be because I asked my doctor for clonazepam (which is also somewhat addicting -- but nowhere near so much as xanax). Naturally I wish I didn't have to be on any meds at all, let alone this huge cocktail, but so far alternative remedies such as taking the amino acid tyrosine (five capsules three times a day) have proved insufficient, as has kava and saint john's wart. However, having read that some of you have had success with Clarocet NRI, I'm going to give that a shot, as the manufacturer states you can overlap it with prescription antidepressants.

Carefully Consider Before Starting Effexor I took Prozac on and off for 9 years. Last year I developed memory problems. I finally figured out it was the Prozac. It took me 4 months before my memory was back to normal.I have suffered from moderate to severe depression most of my life so I THOUGHT I needed to go on another antidepressant. 1st mistake. (Actually my first mistake was ever taking the Prozac in the first place. It wiped out my motivation, caused weight gain, sweating, and had sexual side affects.) My doc started me on Effexor 3 months ago. BIG MISTAKE! I never sweated so much in my life and I don't sweat now unless I'm exercising. I ate everything in sight. It WAS energizing. I got a lot of stuff done and for that it was useful. I also couldn't sleep at night so I had to start taking another med to get a decent night's sleep.I decided it was time to stop taking the Effexor. Thanks to the people who post on this website, I realized that I might be in for trouble when it came to getting off this drug. I only read one post where the person had NO problems getting off EFFEXOR. My therapist told me not everyone has the withdrawal syndrome. My doc told me that if I have any dizziness to take 37.5 mg. What my doc apparently doesn't know is JUST HOW SEVERE THE WITHDRAWAL FROM THIS DRUG CAN BE.I am now down to 37.5 mg. Last dose was 4 days ago. My legs ache, joints are sore, I'm dizzy, very irritable, can't sleep, heart palpitations, anxious, mood swings, you name, I've got it :) Last night I decided to go for a walk. I had to come back because I was afraid I'd fall, that's how dizzy I was.I'm thinking about going &quot;cold turkey&quot; off the 37.5. I wouldn't consider doing this on a higher dose.This has been a valuable learning experience for me. NO MORE ANTIDEPRESSANTS OF ANY KIND, for me, thank you. I'm going to work out at the gym, meditate, eat a whole foods diet, and heal my candida/leaky gut problem, all of which cause depression and anxi

Unless you plan on staying on it..... DO NOT take it. I took Effexor XR (75mg) once a day for a total of 2.5 months. The withdrawal effects when discontinuing use of this drug are pure hell.  I've recently switched to Wellbutrin SR (150mg 2x day) and have yet to experience any effect from it. The Effexor withdrawals have produced dizziness, I'm lethargic, confused, anxious and irritable. It is no fun :-(  I also had a really hard time achieving an orgasm while taking Effexor..a REAL hard time.  I wasn't 'happy' when I was on it, I was pretty numb to things. It did give me energy, reduced my anxiety and depression and made me feel 'human' again. Initially, there is insomnia, but that went away after about two weeks.  Oh and sweating? I never used to sweat as much as I did while taking this drug. Perhaps that's  another reason why I lost weight on this drug. It suppressed my appetite and made me sweat! As I said, unless you plan no staying on it indefinitely, do NOT take it. Try somethin' else. This should really be your last resort.

wonder drug i was on Zoloft for about 5 years. in concern with my sever fatigue, my new psychologist changed me over to Effexor. it changed my life. i actually got some ENERGY back! PLUS i could think straight for the first time in forever. it was wonderful. the only side effect is that my anxiety is much higher now. plus the effectivenes has worn off, slightly as time goes by. With my new found energy i went back to work- and now have started to completely relapse.Bad idea. don't push it even if you do start to feel better!

Effexor I have had three seperate courses of this drug and each time it has made me manic after a period of time. The last two times it put me in the hospital.I took 300mg a day, it was easy to take and I don't remember any other side effects beside the mania...but that was enough!!

Effexor XR I was prescribed this after Paxil quit working. It does seem to have less sexual side effects than Paxil. It doesn't do a whole lot for me as far as anxiety goes and I have put on weight and seem to want to eat anything in sight :&gt;( . I plan to try Lexapro next.

Epilepsy I got serious epilepsy symptoms as a result of taking Effexor.  When I first started taking it I got tired, then I got so tired I couldnt stay awake, started to sleep for 24 - 36 hours at a time, then I started to have convulsions in my sleep, then I started to have them when I was awake, so I came off of Effexor.

Started out so well... but then... When I first started Effexor 8 months ago it felt like a miracle drug.  The few side effects seemed totally worth it, since it gave me day after day of relaxed, depression and panic-free living for the first time in my entire life!  Amazing.  But then...I've been getting sudden terrible headaches (never had them before, and now 4 times in 3 months), along with nausea and vomiting (I hadn't thrown up for 15 or 20 years) and dizziness, and my blood pressure has gone up about 25 points.  I'm dealing with these as separate issues at the moment, but I think they're related to the drug, especially after what I've read here.So, sadly, I'm planning to go off it.  I've found a new doc (the old one just doesn't seem to know enough about the powerful effects of this drug) and will do a very gradual cutting down of my dosage (which has never been high - I must be pretty sensitive to it, because it had such an immediate and strong positive effect for me).  I'm apprehensive about the withdrawal, but I've already lost 2 days of work to the intense headaches and vomiting, and anyway, I don't want to stay with a drug that has that kind of withdrawal effects.  Kind of proves how strong it is!  This was the first brain drug I've been on, and it changed my life in positive ways.  I sure hope I can find a substitute, preferably natural...

Off Effexor for good! I am not on Effexor any longer. Tuesday will be exactly 2 months that I've been pill free and most of the side effects are gone except for the anxiety and not having much of an appetite. The first few weeks were hell. I'm still experiencing some anxiety and stomach aches, but everything else is gone. This drug has scared me away from every drug out there. I am hesitant about taking Tylenol now!! I took the drug for almost 3 years, so I'm sure it will take some time to get out of my body for good. Hope everyone is well!!

Works miracles for me I have a generalized anxiety disorder, I think stemming from MS.  I can wake from sleep in a panic attack, and for many years panic attacks and anxiety made me miserable.  I would take Xanax but that added to my already present fatigue.I started taking Effexor and in a few weeks I was a new person.  I was able to function normally, go places, live normally without fear of breaking out suddenly in a cold sweat, feeling faint, etc.  My anxiety attacks happened at random, for no reason, and I think they are related to MS as I have bad mood swings, minute by minute as well.The Effexor changed my life.  I have periodically gone off it to give my body a break, and will do well for a while, but eventually I start getting anxiety symptoms again..  so I am back on the Effexor.Bad thing: It does make me feel &quot;flat&quot;.. not happy, not sad, just flat and emotionless.  But in order to control the mood swings and anxiety, I guess it's the price you pay.

What a jerk This was started for me in the hospital. It gave me myoclonic jerking. It was so bad I was given an EEG.  They had to stop the EEG because I couldn't stop jerking.  Then they stopped the effexor and the jerking stopped. Don't know if it would have been effective, wasn't on it long enough. My current pdoc calls it &quot;side-effexor.&quot;

My Head hurts, I'm tired, and I can't sleep Effexor XR is my first trial at solving my depression and social anxiety syndrome.  I have been on it a week so far.  I have had some effectiveness, my fiancee has noticed a change for the good, however the side effects are horrible.  I cannot sleep, yet I am dangerously tired.  I take asprin every 4 hours to combat migrane headaches, and my vision has even been affected.  The sexual disorders are very prevalent, to the point of almost no arousal at all.I have no other drugs to compare this to, however at this point I would be happier being depressed than to be slightly less depressed with the constant tiredness I have with Effexor.  Man I hope I make it through a meeting I have scheduled for tomorrow......

Use with a mood stabilizer Effexor works quite well to relieve depressive episodes, but unless I am taking lithium and depakote as well, it almost always makes me go manic.  It also makes me sweat profusely.  I actually had to take an extra shirt and undershirt to work with me because I'd sweat through a first one by lunchtime.

Effexor Do not miss any dose on the medicine at all.  I missed one day and got really sick.   So far i think it is working for me.  I did drive far the other day which is something I have been so scared to do for 3 years now.  And I am a lot more confident in myself.  I think it helps some wih my anxiety.  As well as the depression from the chronic pain.  And it also helps the pain itself by resetting pain receptors, and nerves where the pain is. So far i like it.

Increased dosage and still doing good (May 7, 2003) I began taking effexor rather enthusiastically on Monday. It has been 11 days on the pill and to be quite honest I feel pretty darn good! I hadn't read a lot about the product- though my cousin had been a sales rep for the product. My doctor recommended it for me because; trazadone is great to help me sleep but that's all I do, zoloft was too surreal, I HATED the paxil nightmares and sweats, Lexapro gave my all kinds of side effects including a strange allergic type/sexual dysfunction reaction.The first day i took effexor at 5 pm and I immediately passed out on the couch... then again the night before had been spent crying and breaking ceramic statues. When i woke I did feel some nausea... but i was calm... For the first time in 72 hours I was calm.... A break was unbroken and I was me again- only better. The past two days have been great. I've experienced only slight nausea (PLEASE make sure you eat with this pill! My nausea is slight with food- but I'm sure taking it without food Id be hugging a toilet). Well actually speaking of toilets- be sure to drink some gatoraid with this one-cause the first two nights I did have- eek - diarrhea!  When I am not wearing coke bottle glasses- I wear high prescription contacts- and with this drug my eyesight has been blurred off and on (definition  of blurred- couldn't read anything- even if i squint my eyes)...  So that is pretty annoying- you pay so much to get your sight fixed and then it gets ruined again because you have an anxiety/depression/ocd disorder! I also have hand tremors that begin about 3 hours after I take the pill. I also begin to feel a little shaky and cringey around the 4th hour.  (Imagine a low dose of strychnine coursing through your veins) I also feel a little dizzy and spacey at times, but for now I'm just enjoying it.... I could see it getting on my nerves if it lasts for much longer though. So far my sexual drive has actually been increased from

Withdrawal I cannot believe that getting off an antidepressant which is supposed to be 'non-addictive' is so horrific. I ended up being hospitalised after stopping 'cold turkey'. By the way I was told to stop 'cold turkey' by a neurologist (because I suffer from Migraines) who never knew that stopping Effexor would have any withdrawal effects!!!!

Wishful thinking ALMOST a knight in shining armour. At 225 mg, I felt great! I have 10 years of taking numerous SSRI's that couldn't come close. Finally... but wait! The headaches, stomach cramps, 8 weeks of constant diarrhea, outrageous sweating, the tremors in my hands, anxiety attacks,  they got the better of me and I gave up. I just weaned off Effexor over the last 2 weeks and had a terrible &quot;withdrawal?&quot; last week going from mania to suicidal, with in-the-mud depression, sprinkled with anxiety attacks, all in a few days. Quite expensive without good insurance! Best of luck if you're on this.

The headaches, stomach cramps, 8 weeks of constant diarrhea, outrageous sweating, the tremors in my hands, anxiety attacks,  they got the better of me and I gave up. I just weaned off Effexor over the last 2 weeks and had a terrible &quot;withdrawal?&quot; last week going from mania to suicidal, with in-the-mud depression, sprinkled with anxiety attacks, all in a few days. Quite expensive without good insurance! Best of luck if you're on this.

no good for anxiety I was prescribed Effexor XR for my anxiety - Ill tell you right now that I regret taking it.  This medication flew my anxiety through the roof.  It was almost like taking an amphetamine or something.  This stuff might somehow work for some peoples anxiety - but I think this medication is horrible for anxiety sufferers and dont recommend it at all!!

Going back on Haven't been on Effexor in 6 years. I had an OK effect from it then. (still better than other AD's. I tried Lexapro for 5 weeks with NO effects and the only side-effect was NO Orgasm. Now, I am willing to take all the side-effects because I am not able to function at all, so there is nothing to lose, literally, only gain. I dont care about withdrawl. Last time I just weened of it over 4 weeks and had no problems.I hope it gives me some motivation. I believe it did last time.

effexor xr i have been taking 300 mg of effexor xr for 2 years now and no longer think it is working as it once was.  I am bipolar and have been on almost every antidepressant out there.  effexor xr seemed to be my miracle drug for the past 2 years. Suddenly in the past 3 months it seems as if the drug is no longer effective on my manic and depressive episodes.  i seem to be more manic and then rapidly shift into debilitating depression.  i am scared to switch since it took so long for me to get used to effexor xr.  also, whenever i cannot afford effexor, i go through terribly extreme withdrawal.  i do not recommend long term use, though.the only good thing is that i lost weight while taking it.

It's worth it to me. I started taking Effexor 6 years ago and saw dramatic effcts within 3 days.  During the first 6 months I felt better than I ever had.  Since then the effects have slipped quite a bit and I have tried almost every other AD in combination with Effexor-XR.  Also, have added various stimulants and sleep medications.  I have gone off Effexor one time, and I have forgotten doses, and I have had terrible withdrawl symptoms: nausea, headache, shakiness, flu-like.  I don't understand why the effectiveness changed so much!?!

Effexor and weight gain I was on effexor for 16 months. I was put on it to treat my depression that was brought on by an eating disorder (anorexia). I gained approx 20 lbs in 6 months. (this is a horrible experience for someone with an eating disorder). I gained all this weight despite weight training and cardio 3-5 times a week. I tried excessive dieting and very healthy eating. In both cases I continued to gain weight. I took myself off them about 2 months ago. The withdrawal was difficult but I was determined to be myself without Effexor. Since I have been off them I lost 4 lbs. I understand that I do not have to be as small as I was when I was sick but there is no reason I cannot be a healthy 125lbs. (I am currently 5'5 and 134lbs). I would like to know other people's experiences with this issue. Did they ever lose the weight after stopping effexor? I also read that it can take 4-6 months for my metabolism to get back to normal. Is this true? The 4 pounds that I have lost are by no means my answer. It still doesn't make sense with my food intake (approx 1500 cals/day), amount of water I drink (3 ltrs/day) and exercise (now 4-5 times per weekl) that I currently do. It is impossible how I didn't lose more than that in that amount of time. Please help...

Effexor did it for me I love this drug.  After trying Prozac, Paxil, Wellbutrin and a few others...Effexor was like a dream.  I am thrilled it has worked to help me become more centralized, think more effectively and sleep a bit better.  It helps me focas to control my mood swings as well.  I only wish it were a bit cheaper on my insurance plan.

Effexor XR I tried many antidepressants before using Effexor XR. With my many autoimmune illnesses as well as fibro, it seems that I am faced with new challenges each day. Effexor is the only medicine that helps relieve the depression that goes along with having multiple illnesses. It helps me to function more normally.

Very effective I have been on Effexor XR for almost a year and found it to be very effective in combatting my symptoms of depression. I can feel happy again and enjoy the things I used to. I experienced only minor side effects such as minor nausea for the first week or two of treatment, and occasional difficulty with short term memory. The only major side effect I have experienced has been a severe lack of sexual desire, which has been very stressful on my relationship. My husband has encouraged me to continue my use of Effexor, however, because he has seen the vast improvement of my well-being. We are currently seeking solutions to deal with the sexual side effect.

Was afraid ... Before my psychatrist suggested Effexor XR, I read everything on this site and was sort of put off!!  Seems many of the people have not had great success with this drug.  I went ahead and started it, while weaning off Lexapro (which did nothing for me), and have found that after more than a month, I really like this medication.  I asked my pdoc to add Wellbutrin to the mix and I now take 150 mg. of it along with the Effexor XR and I feel even better.  I have more motivation, my libido is returning and I have a positive outlook on life.  All things I had almost forgotten were out there for me!  I hope I've finally found the magic mix!!

Works well for my moderate, generalized anxiety I experience a moderate level of generalized anxiety and have ADD. I do find the Effexor helps reduce the &quot;unwanted&quot; and non-specific anxiety in my life.  Before Effexor I would experience anxiety over vague or relatively minor issues.  That anxiety tended to paralyze my ability to act or address those issues.I take 375 mg of the XR form in the morning.(I also take 60 mg Adderall daily and 1500 mg L-Tryptophan* at night.  The Tryptophan is most likely contributing in some form to my reaction to the Effexor.)I've tried Buspar and did not find it effective.Side Effects:I do experience a number of side effects I feel are attrributable to Effexor (perhaps compounded by the Tryptophan I take.)Although I'd obviously prefer not to have them, I currently feel Effexor's side effects are outweighed by the benefits I experience.--Weight gain.  I've gained approximately 25 lbs. since I've started taking Effexor.  I would only partially attribute the weight gain to Effexor.  Lack of sufficient exercise is the other culprit.  (Luckily I'm tall.)--Moderate reduction in sexual libido.--Increased tendency to lose my train of thought.--I get hot/sweat more easily.--Mild hand tremors - most noticable when I haven't eaten.--More vivid dreams.*I feel L-Tryptophan improves the quality of my sleep.  However, note that the FDA has expressed concerns about the safety of this supplement.

Withdrawal nightmare! I was treated with Effexor XR after being on Prozac for years, and just not feeling too great..I then asked DR for Wellbutrin, and DR took me off Effexor, in a 4-5 day period..it was a living hell, I don't know how I made it to work and back every day that first week..the head pain, dizziness, nausea, and muscle aches were worse than anything I've ever experienced. I'm now on week 4 of withdrawal and taking 20 mgs of Prozac again to relieve the symptoms, and finally starting feel somewhat better. I would not recommend this drug to anyone!!!

MIXED EMOTIONS I was put on Effexor XR for Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  It will admit that it did take away my anxiety symptoms, but it kind of made those 8 months on it a blur.  I went from caring about things too much to not caring about them at all.  I think my doctor had me on too high of a dose.  Coming off of it was hell.  Became really depressed, major insomnia, headaches, etc.  Almost had to go to the hospital.  Once it got out of my system (about a month) I was fine.  For about 8 months I hadn't any problems with my anxiety until recently.  I'm now looking at a herbal remedies and therapy instead of medication.

MIXED EMOTIONS I was put on Effexor XR for Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  It will admit that it did take away my anxiety symptoms, but it kind of made those 8 months on it a blur.  I went from caring about things too much to not caring about them at all.  I think my doctor had me on too high of a dose.  Coming off of it was hell.  Became really depressed, major insomnia, headaches, etc.  Almost had to go to the hospital.  Once it got out of my system (about a month) I was fine.  For about 8 months I hadn't any problems with my anxiety until recently.  I'm now looking at a herbal remedies and therapy instead of medication.

Affected memory, thought clarity I had been taking 150 mg. of Effexor xr for a couple of years and have recently decided to dose down and get off the drug.  I found Effexor to be very effective in treating my chronic depression, imparting a general feeling of well-being and occasional euphoria. I did experience fatigue and a loss of sexual desire, but these side effects are common to most of the ADs available and are generally more acceptable than the condition they treat. The side effects that concerned me more, and that ultimately led to my decision to get off the drug, were blurred vision and problems with memory and thought clarity. On a daily basis I would be in mid-sentence and would either completely lose my train of thought or experience a frustrating inability to mentally find the word I wanted to say - even if was a simple word or a person's name. I also noticed short term memory loss - I had to start writing things down so that I wouldn't forget them after 5 minutes had passed. I mentioned this to my prescribing physician and he dismissed my concerns and intimated that all people start to experience these problems as we get older. I was 34 years old at the time, and I disagree with my doctor that my symptoms were age-related. I decided to dose off the med slowly over a 6 week period, but still experienced the withdrawal symptoms described by others on this site - though they were manageable. I have been AD free for 3 weeks and have noticed symptoms of depression returning - mainly misplaced and overblown bouts of irritability and anger. My fuzzy thinking and blurred vision have not completely left me and I wonder if they are going to be permanent or if they will eventually improve.  I am searching for an alternate solution, and am considering going back to Prozac or Zoloft which I have taken in the past, but quit due to the sexual side effects. I think that Effexor is a fast-acting and very effective AD for many people, but its effect on cognitive fun

Essential I'm too scared to try a different precription and chance that it may be uneffective. I can notice a difference if I miss just 2 days of meds. At one time I had the flu and couldn't keep anything down, so I went a week and half without it. I went from stable to suicidal in less than 14 days. Its very very effective, so effective that I cannot dream of not taking it. I get flu shots every year.

Effexor was not good for me I was on Effexor for four months. I took one, and because of the side effects I didn't take another one until I contacted my doctor again. When I took the first one, my mind was racing, I couldn't sit still and I wanted to jump out of my skin, it made me sweat, it made me dizzy and I couldn't sleep for two days.After I talked to my doctor about it, I agreed to try it again at a lower dosage, 37.5 mg instead of the 75 I started on.I didn't get the bad side effects I got when I took it the first time, but I did get an upset stomach that lasted for the next four months. It worked on the depression for about three weeks, and then it stopped. When I decided to stop taking it, the withdrawl symptoms were worse that they had been with other medications, and they lasted nearly a month.

Sigh... Yet another three months wasting my time on a medication when I may as well have been taking a sugar pill.  Over several months my dose got up to 450mg / day, and I experienced no anxiety relief... but at least I also experienced no side effects.

Effexor XR Been taking these for about 5 years, side effects of nausea, dizzinesss, sweating lasted about 2 1/2 months. After that they work great for my Severe Depression, anxiety/panic disorder. Dosage took about 1 year to get it perfect, worst part of them is in my case I gained about 50 lbs, and no libido, and I can NOT miss a dose or I feel awful!!  Weight gain is temporary with proper diet and I am still fighting the libido thing. Still works after 5 years, which is a plus.

No more sex for me!! Actually, what I mean is that I have lost ALL of my libido and my husband is bummed, but patient. I spoke to a former pharm. rep. and she admitted that Effexor has the highest libido loss ratings of ALL of the SSRI's out there, and I've been on them ALL---[Prozac; Paxil] for 12 years until switching to this. Unfortunately, Effexor is the best at preventing me from putting a gun to my head but I miss my sex drive. Anyone else out there have this problem?Regarding Effexor and hellish withdrawal symptoms---I found an excellent site. Check out www.drugawareness.org There you will find hundreds of testimonials regarding the addictive nature [physical addiction] of all SSRI's, especially Effexor. Like I posted before, I tried to get off of it but failed. Please be aware of the physical addictivness of this drug before you take it for too long. THe longer you take it the harder it is to get off it. No MD will EVER tell you this. I am so angry that I ever got on this in the first place, EVEN THO it basically &quot;cured&quot; my depression and it keeps me from jumping off the roof. I feel weird about being forever dependent on a mind altering drug. Maria

my opinion I found Effexor(XR) to be more helpful than any of the other SSRI-type drugs. I had been on Zoloft for over 10 yrs and it worked great. Then it started to lose effectiveness and I totally plummeted before I seeked help. I went through Celexa and Paxil and Prozac with no avail. I tried the Effexor and got some relief, however was still not doing well, so they upped my dosage. I am on 225mg daily and it seemed to do OK, however I still had raging mood swings, so they put me on a low dose of Depakote to help relieve those. Anyway, back to the Effexor, I noticed major insomnia when I first started taking it and also appetite loss, but those subsided quickly. I now have no side effects and am functioning well all due in major part to the Effexor!

Effexor XR very effective for me I have tried serzone, paxil, remeron, zoloft, buspar, and finally effexor xr for depression + generalized anxiety. Paxil, zoloft, and other SSRIs had severe sexual side effects. Remeron and serzone were effective for the depression, but did not help my anxiety level in any way. Effexor XR gives me the most effective treatment for depression AND anxiety with only mild side effects.

Works great but going on and off are rough When I started going on the medication my panic disorder became worse than ever.  I had attacks that were so bad people had to peel me off the ceiling.  But after a few days things got great and my attacks completely disappeared after a month.  I had some side effects - tremors - that disappeared within a couple of days.I'm now a week off the drug and I'm experiencing quite a few side-effects.  Vertigo, shocks running through my body and general tremors.

Made the body aches go away I was miserable with the constant aches and pains all over my body and wanted to try a tricyclic once I realised it was fibromyalgia, but was given Effexor instead, which also works on the noadrenaline receptors like tricyclics but doesn't have as many side effects. I felt better almost right away and suddenly my whole life seemed a bit more manageable - I could actually think about something besides how much pain I was in. The only side effect I had was profuse sweating at 300mg, but am now taking 225mg and the problem is gone (and is still nealry as effective). I'm also taking Avanza for depression and insomnia, and it has the added benefit of also reducing sweating, as does probanthine (normally used for epileptic seizures).

hmm i have not experienced any unpleasant side effects while on effexor, nor from missing doses when i forget to take it. or from accidentally taking extra doses.only problem i've had is the effects wearing off after long term use thus needing to increase the dose.have not tried to stop taking it though

worked the first time.. The first time I was on effexor it worked well for me. I was fatigued and my emotions were blunted, but I wasn't hopeless.  I did a very slow wean off the drug, but flunked. So I went back on the drug and it did not work the same way and it made my heart race. So I had to find a new antidepressant.

Watch your blood pressure Effexor was highly effective for my depression, but I had a potentially fatal side effect. I took 300mg /day right after coming out of the hospital. Within a few weeks of beginning treatment, my blood pressure shot up to 175/110 (normal for me is about 120/70).  This side effect is listed in the PDR, but is not common.  I had to get my (then) doctor to take my BP himself to make him believe me!  He had me take a calcium channel blocker to combat the high BP.  When I switched to my current MD, he immediately stopped the Effexor.  Also, the sexual side effects were disastrous, and nothing helped.

The antidepressive effect is very well but... After using a very weak antidepressant called Deanxit, my doctor prescribed Effexor for me. Although I began with a very little dose of 37.5mg the side effects were rather strong (above all trembling). But after awhile they disappeared and I have to say that the antidepressive effect of Effexor is really brilliant, I've never felt so well for a long time.But I initially took the antidepressant in order to fight against my chronic fatigue, from which I have been suffering more than 7 years now. And it is said that Effexor is rather activating than sedating. On the contrary, I was just as tired as before and in addition to this I suffered from insomnia more than before...I found several confirmation that Effexor is not the right AD if you are suffering from insomnia. It's said that Effexor even suppresses completely rem sleep and awakenings during the night are more often. If you are suffering from depression in combination with insomnia/chronic fatigue I recommend Remereon to you. It's right that it is more sedating at the beginning of treatment but at the same time you get a real good sleep. I read several studies concerning Remeron and I can only confirm that it prolongs important sleep stages (1,2,3) and rem latency is even decreased...

Effexor is the best I have seen so far While Effexor hasn't been extremely effective for me, I have been resistant to most anti-depressant treatments and Effexor has been the most effective for me. The most serious side effect is if I miss my daily dose, I become extremely depressed, tired, shaky, etc.

TAKE THIS IF ALL OTHER 1000 TYPES DON'T WORK Take this drug only if you want to get divorced, loose your job, want to kill your baby, and find the inside of the toilet bowel as attractive as your husband. One of the side effects of bipolar is memory impairment of which the makers of this drug should know...well then why is it if your a few hours late taking it you are as bad as you were before diagnosis. Late to take, see the toilet bowel rings, miss one you are cranky, sad , hateful, off the deep end...save your money skip it...your sex drive will thank you(one year no sex).

Bad Side Effects My boyfriend is actually taking this med. He loves the way it deals with the depression - says he can really tell a difference. The problem is the weight loss, stomachaches and sleeplessness he goes through daily. He's never been very heavy, and works a manual labor job, so he gets a workout everyday - the drug either makes him feel not hungry, or sick to his stomach. We haven't had a meal together in about 10 months. We also don't sleep together anymore because his sleep pattern is so screwy now. He gets tired suddenly in the middle of the day, naps for hours, sleeps through the alarm... then is wide awake throughout the night. Sometimes when he is tired, he just can't fall asleep. He was never ever like this before the pill. Now we are debating - is this worth it? He is 6'1 and weighs about 155. It may be helping his depression, but it is starting to ruin our relationship, as we can never eat together or sleep in the same bed. (which really is the time most couple spend the most time together daily...)If you are overweight, then try it out, but if you don't need to lose weight, then stay away.

bad effexor! i suffer from major depression with anxiety, and have pretty much taken every antidepessant out there. my doctor prescribed effexor and after gaining too much weight was only more depressed and started tapering myself off. well, i'm frigging dying. i've also been in recovery for years, and have done my share of detox and i've never experienced a withdrawal like this in my life. body shocks, brain shivers, crying, suicidal thoughts, rages and more. i know i'll live through this but is the worst experience so far. my doctor wants me to stay on effexor and start taking wellbutrin but this is one of those times i am positive doctor doesn't know best. i'm just taking wellbutrin now and taking this a minute at a time.

less obnoxious unless you forget it I was started on this when the rTMS treatment alone was not enough, and I was at nadir in March 2001. The rTMS helped speed its effectiveness, and in two days I came out of my tailspin. This was before my dx of BPII. One odd side effect or benefit is that the bridge of my nose swelled when I was having a sinus headache, and I was finally aware how many of my headaches were SINUS and not tension...Pdoc had no explanation for that.sexual side effects were less for me than with others, as far as I could tell, my libido being mostly dead at the time I started.I hate the woozies I got when I was late taking it, although after a year or more on it (I never was on more than 75 mg. of the XR version, and mostly have been on 37.5 XR or 25 plain), managed to skip a day here and there without noticing any woozies.I am also on Topamax; wish to get off it due to cognition disruption, and wonder if Abilify would take over both meds' functions.

Effexor XR I took Effexor for 1.5 yrs; previously tried Prozac, Zoloft and Celexa. Did not notice a difference in mood except for weight gain while on Effexor but Dr. suggested I stay on it anyway. I decided to abruptly end the medication myself and after 2 wks am still experiencing chronic fatigue and dizziness. I will NEVER rely on an anti-depressant again...It is in my opinion that drugs are not the cure so I am using my own discipline to control unhappiness and reading books on how to overcome this &quot;sad&quot; state.

Effexor Withdrawal I've been on Effexor XR for about nine months. Doctor began tapering me off. I went off Zoloft with no probs, but the Effexor has been a nightmare.Discontinuation Effects (a euphemism if Iever heard one) began immediately, with dizziness and vivid dreams. As the dosage decreased, severe vertigo and hot flashes were added to the mix. I fell several times from loss of balance. Coordination was affected.I'm completely off now, and the withdrawal symptoms continue. I was prescribed this for chronic pain (fibromyalgia) but the side effects when discontinuing as worse than the pain ever was.I would urge extreme caution if your doctor wants you to take this drug. There are certainly cases so extreme it's worth the risk, but I wonder if this and SSRIs in general are not too easily prescribed. The withdrawal is very real and disabling. Pardon my typos, my coordination is still poor.

Effexor depression effective but with side effects I took 150 mg Effexor twice a day. I originally started out using 37.5 then up to 75mg until I reached the effective 300 mgs total in the day. It definitely worked for my clinical depression (having used Wellbutrin, Paxil, Prozac and Serzone before). It took several months to get to the &quot;right&quot; mix of 300 mg and the disappearance of my depression. HOWEVER, the major side effect of &quot;sweats&quot; was unbearable. Standing in front of the air conditioning unit or fan was a daily routine. Perspiration was dripping off me even in the winter. I slept at night with a fan blowing on me. I was constantly hot. Pity as the medication was effective for depression. I never noticed any anxiety - in fact, I was fatigued a lot. And I did have a harmless sense of disassociation at times. I had to stop after using Effexor 4-5 months and switch back to the standard Prozac which has no side effects for me.

Works great but withdrawal is pretty rough I believe I was on Effexor since about 4/2002, if my prescription history is correct. That would mean I was on it for some thirteen months or so. I took Effexor to treat generalized anxiety that I have experienced off and on throughout my life. In terms of its effectiveness, it is truly an amazing drug. It really made me feel absolutely incredible about each and every day, and my feelings of anxiety were gone; I felt utterly in control of my emotions and my reactions to events. Despite a feeling almost akin to euphoria, I was still completely rational; in fact, I would say that I could concentrate and work harder than I had ever worked in my life.After having been on Effexor XR for a few months, at some point I developed heightened (but borderline) blood pressure. I am young (27) and of an appropriate weight for my height (about 6'5&quot; / ~200 lbs.), so after watching my blood pressure carefully for a few months on the advice of my doctor and after giving him my &quot;log&quot; of my blood pressure over those months, he suggested that I stop the Effexor. Although you typically see an increase in blood pressure early on while taking a medication, he said that in some cases it can appear later. As a result, about a month ago I started tapering off my dosage, which had been 150 mg / day. The next week I took 112.5 mg / day, the week after that 75 mg / day, and finally during the last week I took 37.5 mg / day. All throughout the tapering off period I still felt rather good and didn't notice any particular problems other than some slight nervousness in the 37.5 mg / day week, but then when I stopped the dosage things got a little rough.As of tomorrow, I will have been off of it for one week, and that week has been pretty difficult. About two days after I stopped Effexor all together, I started experiencing &quot;flu-like&quot; symptoms that included chills, slight nausea, and confusion. The nausea continued as an occasional queasines

Best and worst yet Possibly due to genetic predisposition, 20 years of alcohol &amp; drug abuse, multiple and severe head injury and an insanely dysfunctional childhood or all or none of these reasons I have had a consensus of diagnosis for lifelong and permanent severe clinical depression. I have run the gamut of all types and most individual medications available and at times of course made attempts to forego medication altogether. In my experience I have found that as far SSRIs are concerned the SSNRI &quot;Effexor XR&quot; to be the most effective. As others here have attested too, it seems to have a very &quot;well rounded&quot; affect on most or all depressive symptoms and connected disorders. For me this meant a full functioning life as well as a period of normalcy long enough for me to do some effective therapy and substance abuse recovery. It also gave me an opportunity to address some long term health issues and learn to take care of myself in a matter addressing the total acceptance of a long term illness. For the bad news it only lasted about 4 years at which time I had surpassed the manufacturers recommended maximum dose by 150mg a day and by the time it was no longer effective for my depression, may have also been associated with severe migraine headaches. The withdrawal symptoms from it aint no joke either and took a couple of weeks for me. Only Paxil CR has been worse which was, along with concomitant Wellbutrin SR, the replacement used on me after Effexor XR. As a footnote the Paxil/Wellbutrin replacement only lasted 2 years and after a brief go on my own I've been put on MAOIs as a last resort. I am a construction worker and I am in fantastic physical condition. I am 43 years old and am told I look around 30.

effexor	Depression	2003-05-26 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	4.0	4.5	Best and worst yet Possibly due to genetic predisposition, 20 years of alcohol &amp; drug abuse, multiple and severe head injury and an insanely dysfunctional childhood or all or none of these reasons I have had a consensus of diagnosis for lifelong and permanent severe clinical depression. I have run the gamut of all types and most individual medications available and at times of course made attempts to forego medication altogether. In my experience I have found that as far SSRIs are concerned the SSNRI &quot;Effexor XR&quot; to be the most effective. As others here have attested too, it seems to have a very &quot;well rounded&quot; affect on most or all depressive symptoms and connected disorders. For me this meant a full functioning life as well as a period of normalcy long enough for me to do some effective therapy and substance abuse recovery.

Dry mouth It gave me dry mouth, so I was drinking up to 5, 6 litres of water a day, which then meant I had to take frequent bathroom trips. I gave up after two and a half weeks.

Prescribed for Major Depression I had been taking zoloft when the it just pooped out on me and I started having overwhelming suicidal thoughts. Effexor was prescribed, which was a good deal in keeping me up, but the side effects, I experienced were; lightheadness, nausea, blurred vision, headaches, abdomnen pain and tremors.  I finally gave up on it when the symptoms would not end.  It was difficult getting off as well. Whatever side-effects I had, intensified. However, I was more productive.  The benefits just didn't outweigh the side-effects for me.  Hope this helps, CC

Effexor is bad... I have had two separate times I have taken this med.  The first time, I went to my dr about post-partum dep., which was pretty severe.  He prescribed me 75mg Effexor and sleeping pills, which seemed to work wonders, in the beginning. I soon started having compulsive thoughts and high anxiety (I was afraid to drive, because I would imagine us getting in an awful accident, and when I say imagine, I mean in DETAIL).  When I discussed this with my dr, he put me on Zyprexa 5mg.  This did help with the anxiousness, in that I couldn't be anxious while sleeping!  We experimented with Remeron which made me feel very zombie like.  The second day, I developed a rash, so we discontinued it.  At this point, I was done being a guinea pig, and decided to get off meds all together. I weaned myself off in about 3 weeks, and the withdrawal was THE worst thing I've ever been through.  I had more mental withdrawal, crying, deep depression, rages, and suicidal ideation.  It lasted about two weeks, and afterwards I was doing 'o.k.'.  About a year later, the depression returned ten-fold.  I went back to the dr, hoping to get something to get some energy, and he again put me on Effexor.  This was 6 months ago, I am up to 300 mg and my side effects include: headaches, dizziness, trouble urinating, bruising, general acheness, loss of libido, insomnia, bouts of over-sleeping and recently have noticed a 'nervous' air to myself, feeling 'on edge', but with no energy.  I have decided to find a new dr, and have her help wean me off this drug.

effexor with bipolar I was given Effexor for depression, but it didn't help me. We didn't know at the time that I was Bipolar, and it only served to spin me into a manic phase. I was feeling GREAT!! and screaming when I spoke along with being way more animated than a person is supposed to be. I was then spun out of the manic phase and into a very deep depression. My boss took me out of work and told me that if my behavior didn't stop (I assume the laughing loudly and the screaming/talking), I would be fired. Not exactly a good med for Bipolar, I think, but perhaps a better one if you have depression only.

Minimal dose of Buspar helped with side effects My experience after 2 months is that Effexor 75mg is so far the most suitableantidepressant for me. I've tried Prozac and Paxil as well. Recently, 2 weeksago, when my doctor added a minimal dose of Buspar to my treatment the sexualside effects have also decreased notably.

Effexor Somewhat Helpful I have been on a number of different antidepressants and was switched to Effexor this past year. Cost is not a problem because I get it free from the County Mental Health Center. I think it has been a little more effective than the others, but not greatly so. I don't know that I've noticed any side effects, but I am fortunate in that I don't often have negative side effects with most prescriptions.

An Ineffective Treatment for Panic Disorder I was put on Effexor XR (venlafaxine extended release) for my panic disorder, as well as my clinical depression.  I did not notice ANY antidepressant effects until I reached 150 mg/day, and I NEVER noticed any help whatsoever with my anxiety/panic.  Truth be told, this was not very effective for ME, but everyone is different.

effexor helpful  I started on effexor because I was unable to sleep or eat and I started itching due to being so upset over some personal issues.While I would prefer not to take any medications, effexor has helped me as I attempt to handle things. The only side effect that I have experienced is an increase in my sex drive so I try to exercise more!

Taking 225mg. in the morning... It has been almost 6 months since I starting AD's. First, I was on Lexapro...started out on 50mg, then went up to 100mg, that did nothing, with pretty bad side effects. Then, I went to Zoloft...from 25mg all the way up to 200mg, still nothing but side effects. I just started Effexor, 225mg...and everytime I try a new med, I get my hopes up only to be let down which just adds to my depression. I have asked my doctor, &quot;do you know of anything that is guaranteed to work&quot;, and he said that everyone is different and you have to experiment to find out what will work for me. However, I've spent 6 months trying to find out what works, how much longer do I have to wait?

Works well but... the d*** side effects!! I would have a blinding headache with nausea and vomiting at least once every couple of months (occasionally from taking it on an empty stomach, but sometimes when I followed directions). and felt a disturbing &quot;rush&quot; of the medicine taking affect when things went right. I switched to Remeron after less than a year when I started noticing changes in my vision.

Effexor Celexa was my first medication prescribed, which helped tremendously with the depression, but kept me from sleeping at night and no libido whatsoever!  My doctor switched me to Effexor and that was even worse....had absolutely no libido at all and it was all I could do to drag myself out of bed in the mornings!  I always felt so tired and run down!  I could have slept 24/7!  I also gained so much weight that I weighed more than I ever have in my life!  The withdrawal effects of this medication were HORRENDOUS, and I will never take it again!

Effexor is great for a quick uplifter fix. If you want to get up and out of your depression quickly, then use Effexor. This magical miracle med worked for me within the first month. The problem is, that it stops working after 6 months. I had to take a few breaks from it (and go back on it). This became hard on my system, as there can be some horrific withdrawl symptoms if you go off of it too fast. I never had any side effects, otherwise.

anxiety &amp; depression worse than ever i have been on effexor only 4 days but my anxiety and depression has become worse. I've had 4 panic attacks compared to maybe once a month before i started taking this med. i called my dr and she told me its part of the side affects that will go away after about 3 weeks. So you have to get worse before you get better? no thank you i have flushed my pills and will find a different dr. I just feel really weird on this medication. I would not recommend it to anyone.

Effexor XR Hell Warning:a) This product is limited clinically to reducing anxiety. In fact, it increased at some dosages. I started out at 375mg and just lately weaned off to 0.b) careful when coming off of usage, missing dosage, or reducing. It feels like the worst hangover you ever had, fluish symptoms, and general uneasiness. In addition, your mental responses are slowed.In short, there has to be a better serotonin / AD solution. This one is hell!

great, if you don't miss a dose having suffered from severe depression for most of my life, i have tried a number of different medications and Rx cocktails with varying degrees of success and many unpleasant side effects. this one works the best so far. i'm by no means cured, but for the first time in nearly a decade i'm able to relate to people who DON'T wish they were dead, thanks to effexor. i don't remember any significant side effects in adjusting to effexor. if i miss a day i suffer profoundly: shakes, sweating, unexplained mood swings, nausea, uncontrollable crying, and dizziness. all in all, though, i highly recommend it. just don't skip any doses!

Effexor XR I was started on Effexor XR after having suffered through a nightmare with Lexapro. I read all the info I could find about this SSNRI, and learned about the possible withdrawal issues. It made me a bit concerned, but I figured I'd give it a shot. I'd already been through hell with and without meds, so I was ready to face anything. As it turned out, Effexor XR helps alot. I noticed a calmer feeling right away, and little by little, saw my anxiety subdued. I could stand in long lines in a store or sit in my classes without getting irrationally worked up.My depression was helped alot too. I almost felt so good that I was worried the feelings were false-I wanted to be happier, but not a zombie. However, I gradually realized that my emotions were balancing. I would be sad, but only when it was appropriate.I have had some side-effects, but they were minimal. Nausea and lack of appetite were issues at first, but those soon abated. I also had sleep issues, but then I started my dose in the morning, so that was remedied. I also had one or two anxiety overloads (shakes and general nervouseness) in the first 2 weeks, but that hasn't happened since. Overall, Effexor XR has been the best for me, so hopefully it will keep working.

Side effects of Effexor I was prescribed Effexor for Bipolar Disorder,and PMS...the first month I was on it, it was great-the second month, I started getting moody on it, and by the third month, I was having full blown anger attacks, severe depression and horrid crying spells that made me lose my job.  I also gained about 10 pounds on it in those 3 months. I quit taking it, and suffered even worse anger attacks, crying spells, and depression for no less than 2 weeks after stopping it.

severe withdrawal Effexor was not very effective and when I tried to get off of it, I had severe withdrawel and ended up in the ER with terrible tremors.  I decreased the dosages as I should have but still could not get off of it completely for several weeks.  Terrible experience!!!

Stay Away I took Effexor for almost a year.  It didn't work and my Dr. kept increasing the dose. The side effects were HORRIFYING.  I had brain shivers, soft vision and the worst was the anxiety it taught my brain.  I was on it when it first came out and no one believed me about the side effects.  My Dr. thought I was making it up. It got so bad I had to go off it and it took me months for it to leave my system.  I had to go to a neurologist because it was so bad.  My depression never lifted and now I have anxiety disorder that I can't seem to kick. Stay away from this drug. I know the FDA fined the pharm company because they didn't do enough clinical trials. It has been over 2 years since I took it and am afraid to take any other antidepressants because of the side effects. My anxiety never left and I was told that antidepressants &quot;teach&quot; your nerotransmitters different patterens each time you take an antidepressant and it can't be reversed.  BEWARE OF THIS DRUG.

Can u help me out? What do u think?Hey all, I was prescribed Lexapro@10mg. about 2 months ago, after a nasty bout with the ex:( Anyway, seemed to help for awhile. Then saw doc and he increased to 15mg. No real improvement there. Had already lost about 20 lbs. due to anxiety, whatever, before. Now he switched me to Effexor XR, as he says the Lexapro isn't really helping. Didn't worry about it until I started reading about the side effects (weight gain) and the horrific withdrawal symptoms! Do you all think I should just stick with the Lexapro and up the dose, before switching to the more radical Effexor? I find it kind of scary. Also have had to take Ambien to sleep at nights, and now up to 2 pills a night? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!!! Thanks:)

4 years on Effexor XR I was on Effexor XR for four years altogether. The main side-effects, for me: headaches, occasional nausea [I had to stop eating certain foods, for example], weight gain, and a massive decrease in libido. The headaches went away after about two years, and they would be less frequent if I made sure I was adequately hydrated. My sex life suffered, it's true. Due to the drug I couldn't really maintain an erection or have an orgasm unless it was by masturbation. Even then the orgasm was not fulfilling in any way. During the four years I spent on the drug I gained about 50 pounds. I have lost most of that since I stopped taking it. My sex drive has also returned to normal. I have been completely off Effexor for 21 days now. I was taking 75 mg a day, I tapered to two weeks of 37.5 daily, and then stopped altogether. The most persistent side effect of the withdrawal were of course the brain shivers - the short, intense bursts of dizziness, like electric shocks going through my brain and body. Those disappeared almost completely after one week of being completely off the medication. They still appear every now and then when I am especially tired, or upset, but they aren't anywhere near as powerful as they used to be. Now, three weeks into the period of not taking any antidepressants, I am beginning to experience  other symptoms: nausea, flu-like aches and tiredness, anxiety, and a low level of depression. These just started two days ago. So from the period of completely stopping the drug until 19 days later, I didn't have any PSYCHOLOGICAL effects whatsoever. I didn't feel particularly anxious, nervous or depressed. The reason, I believe, that I was able to stop taking Effexor is that I completely changed my life. I exercise now 2 to 2.5 hours a day, splitting up the exercise routines in the morning and night, and spending half of the time on aerobic [stationary bike riding] and the other half on weight lifting. I also eat much better now, being a vega

Effexor XR About one hour before I get out of bed in the morning my husband leaves for work, as he leaves he dispenses my morning meds to me so they are working when I have to get up with the kids. It works out very well. I have Fibromyalgia and depression. I take Effexor XR 300mg, Methodone 10mg,  Zanaflex 4mg, and Provigil 100mg all before I get out of bed.  The Effexor really helps to lift my mood, face my pain, greet my 4 children with a smile and have a positive morning with them before they go off to school. Instead of Mom pulling the covers over her head and not getting out of bed.

From Severe Clinical Depression to Wellness I have been on Effexor for just about 3 years now.At that time I was diagnosed as having severe clinical depression. I had always been a 'sad' person...you know, in a room with a group of people having fun and still being sad. Finally the day came when suicidal thoughts were all that filled my head. Thankfully my family sought help for me. Effexor has been a 'God send' to me. My sadness is gone and I can now finally enjoy my life. I'm not saying that Effexor is without it's problems. If I miss a dose, I become very dizzy and light headed. It's also done a number on my stomach. I developed a rash some months ago that I'm sure was from the Effexor. Thankfully it is gone now. Aside from these side effects I can honestly say that it has helped me immensely. My doctor tells me that I will have to be on it for the rest of my life. I can handle that. If you take Effexor, just make sure you take it on a full stomach and don't miss a dose! If you do eventually get off of it, please, please follow your doctors advice. Don't just stop taking it. To stop taking it without gradually cutting the dosage down over months can really be horrific. All in all, I would recommend it to anyone who has severe clinical depression. It helped bring out the real me! One more thing....Effexor is expensive, so hopefully like me, you have an insurance plan that covers 100% of prescriptions!

A dark and lonely pit of pain and terror I said I was feeling &quot;a little down&quot; and less than 5 minutes later had my free samples and RX. &quot;What the heck, I'll give it a try&quot;, I thought as I left the doctors office. She said it was completely safe and NON ADDICTIVE--LIES! It did seem to help for the first few months (less worry and obessing over trivial matters), but the days of insomnia followed by 12-15hr/night sleep-a-thons finally began to take thier toll. I became concerned. &quot;Let's increase the dose&quot; was the answer. Problems became worse of course and the brain zaps started to appear at the higher doses. &quot;Give it more time&quot; I stupidly did. I cared about nothing, became detached from myself and began to experience signs of sexual addiction yet could no longer achieve a full erection or orgasm. Finally, I'd had enough. &quot;Taper slowly&quot; I did (over a month of stepping down gradually). Now on day 5 with none and am in the throws of the most hideous withdrawal imaginable. Constant feeling of sheer terror, burning hot all the time, extreme nausea, and the dreaded &quot;brain shivers&quot; that I fear will never go away. Please PLEASE do yourself a favor and DO NOT TAKE this putrid evil soul-raping killer poison unless you have NO other alternative. Thanks to finding some great online support groups for Effexor survivors, I'm praying my nightmare will soon be over. However, my life is changed forever as a result of this barbaric medicine. I will never stop telling others of the agony I have endured as a result of Effexor &quot;posioning&quot;. No one should have to endure the agony that now consumes my every moment.

Satan's Drug STAY AWAY FROM THIS.  The withdrawal is horrifying.  Read the websites about withdrawal on the web.  I had dizziness (which sucks considering I already have MS that has dizziness),&quot;brain shivers&quot; aka electrical currents through my body and head, and problems with speech.  I cannot express the evil of this drug.  Please try to find something else.  My withdrawal is almost over, after tapering off the drug and having to take benadryl for the withdrawal symptoms.   Good luck.

Did nothing for me I used this med with high hopes due to its &quot;two-pronged&quot; approach, after years of Prozac that had stopped working.  Effexor did nothing for me.  During its use, I began to have a sense of unreality and walked in a daze, which of course only deepened the depression.  But who knows? Maybe it works for others.

Effexor Gave Me  Back A  Life  -- No Kidding l0 years ago I became ill suddenly with a respiratory virus.  It was the beginning of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and my life changed overnight - literally.  I cannot even list all the symptoms I had, but dizziness, loss of balance, extreme fatigue (bedridden 2-1/2 years), inability to read/drive, depression, concentration, inability to do simple math problems, memory problems, headaches. etc.     My doctor diagnosed CFS immediately and tried a few antidepressants but I had unusual side effects with all of them; and then when he gave me Effexor, the next week I told him that I wouldn't trade it for a million dollars! It gave me my life back.  It took away the dizziness and loss of balance, and gave me some concentration ability back, as well as increased energy and less depression.      My husband had been offered a job in another city and initially (before Effexor) he turned it down because I was so bedridden, I could not even move there (even with paid movers doing the move for us).  By a miracle, the same job became available again after I started Effexor, and I said, &quot;Yes!&quot;  I'm glad we made the move.      Last year I tried to lower my dose to 75 mg. once a day, and I just became more and more incapacitated (again)     Without this drug, I would truly still be bedridden, and I know it.  I don't like to think a drug is what is keeping me going, but my experiment in dosage proved it to me. I was at the lower dose three months or more, so I know it wasn't just withdrawal.  I had a subtle but steady decline in functioning level (including depression) until I upped the dosage again.     Although I'm still quite ill with CFS (can't work), I can function at a higher level than without Effexor.  I know it's EXTREMELY expensive, but thank God for our insurance!  The only side effect I have is sexual, and considering how much it helps me in other ways, I can live with that one.

couldn't get out of bed This drug may have worked, but it made me so nauseus the dr. had to prescribe compazine (for sailors!) just so I could function.  It was horrible.  All I did was sleep in fetal position wishing I would throw up.

Leonie After one tablet I had a severe bout of vertigo.  My daughter phoned my dr and I was asked to come to the surgery for observation.  I had no way of getting there - driving was out of the question. This symptom lasted until late in the day.  I didn't take another one.

effexor i had a worthless run with lexapro and had to make an emergency visit to my psychiatric nurse.  she put me on the effexor because she said it works faster.  within three days my crying had stopped.  i immediately had trouble with being hungry all the time and i gained five pounds right away.  since i hadn't increased my eating i didn't understand that.  plus i felt bloated so when the pharmasist pointed out that edma was a side effect then i knew i wasn't imaging the puffy face.  i never did get to the feeling better point.  i just wasn't feeling bad, more apathetic than anything.  i switched taking it to night cause i could not wake up in the day even when i doubled up my adderal dosage.  i was still taking the wellbutrin too.  when i put on five more pounds i was freaked.  i managed to get four of them off and yesterday she decided we would wean me off the effexor.  im so relieved.

effexor I took effexor for a few months several years ago. I was a total basket case.  I attended my grandsons' birth, can't even remember being there, let alone how I got there!  ( I drove, scary huh?)  I couldn't remember anything,  lost everything,  couldn't make any decisions,  was basically a space cadet! Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Bad Side-effects! I wasn't on this drug long enough to rate how it helps with depression--the side-effects were so severe that I had to discontinue use after a few days (they were horrible!)

WITHDRAWALS ARE HORRIBLE - DO NOT USE I first tried Effexor in college.  It worked better than Prozac, and seemed to work reliably, causing only ejaculatory delay and some constipation at first.  After I had to go off it then, I went on it again when I got insurance to cover it a couple years later.  It worked again, but I noticed a definite withdrawal syndrome if I missed a couple doses (this was the worst when it coincided with a flu that I had in which I couldn't keep anything, even a capsule, down). Then I had to go off it again, and I went back on it again a few months ago after Wellbutrin stopped working.  I've been using the XR version at a pretty high dose (300+mg/day).  Initially it worked, but after a few months it stopped working (this seems to be very common in serotonergic antidepressants, indeed, in all antidepressants as far as I can tell).  It produced a horrible ejaculatory delay that I tried to stop with 2 different drugs (ReQuip and Wellbutrin), but it never was resolved.  Eventually the ejaculatory delay progressed into some strange split of ejaculation and orgasm, in which I would begin ejaculating prior to experiencing orgasm. Basically I was 'leaking' before 'shooting.'  This was very unpleasant.  And then the Effexor just stopped working for my depression altogether, in spite of the fact that it was buttressed with Wellbutrin AND Strattera (a NA-reuptake blocker used to treat ADD).  So a few days ago I decided, against my better judgment and knowledge of the withdrawal effects, to stop all the medications, as they simply did not work.  I have been going through the Effexor withdrawal since.  Effexor withdrawal is horrible and very common, it seems.  My experience is that it causes flu-like symptoms, general malaise, nausea, headache, diarrhea and and odd dizziness, a strange feeling centered in your head.  After a few days the dizziness remains, and I'm hoping for it to go away very soon.  I've been able to come off Effexor pretty easil

Effexor This medication worked great the first few months and then started losing its effectiveness.  Now all the medication does for me is take the edge off enough to get me through the day.

I want my life back I cannot begin to say how horrible Effexor has made me feel. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and I can't wait to get off of it! I was put on it to relieve anxiety and help me with depression after my mother died and several other trauma's in 2002. My side effects were absolutely awful! Now I get to experience this withdrawal. It's sad!

Lost my sex drive This drug did help with bipolar disorder, however I completely lost my sex drive. I have always been a highly sexual person, and with the meds, I stopped thinking about it and wanting it altogether. I guess it depends how you view the outcome, but it sure felt good to experience orgasm again.

Effexor XR Kruse i have come to the conclusion that effexor is asome like some don't like drug. It happens to be the only anti-depressant that works for me, and it actually helps with my GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) If I miss 2 days worth though I get extemly sick. It has many side-effects, but sometime you have to deal with it. I take 325mg.

A 'not so good' experience I tried Effexor for a few weeks last fall and hated it. It made me edgy and short-tempered. I felt very negative and quick to argue. It reminded me of the side effects I experienced with Prozac which I had taken for about 5 months in 1995. I discontinued Effexor immediately and returned to Zoloft.

Effexor XR works! I heard a lot of negatives regarding Effexor XR. I was really afraid to try it. I was so glad I did. It's extremely effective for both depression and anxiety. I have been taking for over a year and am thrilled with the results. I even made a trip to Rome, Italy. I previously had thought I never would make it to Europe due to my panic attacks. I didn't have a one.  I flew from Miami to Paris then from Paris to Rome. I can't wait to go on my next trip!  I'm living life!

Effexor XR Effexor xr has worked very well for me.  I had depression/anxiety and it took away all the &quot;bad&quot; feelings I had..such as lack of concentration, unrealistic fears, not able to hold onto thoughts, rapid pulse.  The only side affect I've had is loss of energy and my appetite decreased some. I'm most grateful for this medication.

Effexor - CFIDS I was on Effexor for ~2 years.  It was quite effective for my depression but it aggravated my GI pain/dysfunction.  It also shut down my metabolism so that I gained 45 pounds. I gained weight while following a nutritionist diet plan and exercising.  So, I switched to Prozac.

Strange side effects I have been on many different medications for depression over several years.  I had been doing well for a while using Prozac and Wellbutrin, but the effectiveness was wearing off, so my PA switched me to Effexor.  While weaning off the other meds my mood stayed fairly stable, sad but not miserable. When I was on only the Effexor my mood went south and the side effects became horrible.  I gained 4 pounds in 2 weeks, and could not sleep at night.  I had very restless legs at night which kept me awake. I was tired all day and couldn't do much of anything except lay in bed.  I had very negative sexual side effects also.  I had the mild sexual side effects with other AD, but I could not &quot;finish&quot; for anything.  My PA has switched me to Lexapro.  I know it takes time to find the right fit and everyone reacts different to different meds, so I hope this will work out better.

It made me normal again. When I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia back in June of 2002, I honestly did not think that any pill could help me with my various pains and problems.  After several days on 75 mgs of Effexor XR, my life began to normalize.  After several months I decided that I wanted to get off the Effexor XR and go it alone.  During the second week of the &quot;weaning&quot; process, two days into my 25 mgs a day, I began to feel very lousy. The brain fog, aches and stiffness were begining to re-visit me.  After calling my doctor today, I picked up my 75 mg capsules and will start back on the therapy tomorrow.  The only reason I wanted off the meds is so I could drink alcoholic beverages.  Since Effexor works through the liver, I did not want to disregard the instructions and drink alcohol while I was on it.  I will gladly give up booze for the rest of my life if the Fibro misery will stay away with the Effexor.  After starting the pills in June I began to lose a great deal of weight with very minimal exercise and just eating better. In October, I was diagnosed with a hyperactive Thyroid and have been told I have Graves Disease too.  There is a sneaking suspicion that the Fibro and Graves go hand in hand so in addition to the Effexor, I take 150 mgs of PTU twice  a day for the past two months.  Next week I go to doctor to see if my TSH levels have dropped any.  My weight is stablized and I look much better.  If you have any experiences with Effexor similar to mine, I would be very interested in hearing about them.

Effexor I use 112.5mg and it helps keep my energy at a good level most of the time. It's not a miracle cure, but along with Elavil, the Effexor seems to help in general. When I lower the dose to 75mg., I start to feel very depressed and discouraged. I, too, gained weight..... oh well...

I feel more like me ... ... but only when I get the dose and the timings right! I find I have to split the dose over the day, and missing a pill has a dire effect. I was on Citalopram before - didn't seem to matter if I missed a few pills - and am still finding the (almost) instant results on Efexor a bit freaky. I'm also experiencing far more side effects - sleepiness, visual disturbances, etc. Because Efexor works better for me - when I get it right - I intend to stick with it until I recover. For a beginner, though, I figure the Citalopram could be better. When you're very depressed, it's hard to get your doses right, and the last thing you need are weirdo side-effects. Efexor seems better, to me, once you're depressed but not debilitated.Cheers!

Effexor for Fibromyalgia Effexor didn't help my fibromyalgia at all. It didn't touch any of my fibro symptoms. I stopped taking it after 8 weeks because it provided me no benefit whatsoever. The one good thing about this medicine is that I did not have any side effects to this antidepressant, unlike every other one I've been on so far.

Withdrawal!! Didn't work for me.  I lost over 40 pounds in 3 months, and saw an increase in anxiety, and my depression.  What bugs me the most about this medication are the ridiculous withdrawal effects when trying to wean off of this... Insomnia, abdominal pain and an intense feeling of having my head shocked whenever I moved (this is not a joke, and even common!!)

Very Scary Med After trying pretty much every SSRI for Anxiety / Panic -- My Dr suggested I try Effexor-- after anxiety got very bad after the birth of my son .  I tried it for 3 days -- and had to stop . the side effects were so terrible-- they included -- severe night sweats, shaking, delusional thoughts, and upset stomach ....

Effexor made me feel CRAZY!! I took Effexor for one day and thought I was having a heart attack!  I honestly felt like I was on some sort of hallucinagenic and couldn't &quot;come down.&quot;  Unfortunately, it was &quot;time-release&quot; so I had to get in bed and stay there all day so that I could remain calm. I felt like my heart was beating out of my chest and everything around me was spinning. HORRIBLE experience with Effexor.

not for me I was only on effexor for about a month, I started feeling more suicidal and was crying a lot, I know each medication works differently each person, but my main complaint is the withdrawl symptoms I had when I stopped after tappering. I had vertigo, electric shocks, shakes.I looked around on line and found many people had bad withdrawls fron this drug. When I've started knew drugs I just looked them up to see what they were, I never thought about looking up what happens when you come off. Now I know to check, with every medication a person tries you never know which will work and with bp I've noticed you switch around a lot, my advice is look up this drug with withdrawls, it's amazing, maybe you'll think twice before starting, even if it would work, eventually you have to stop this drug.

I had vertigo, electric shocks, shakes.I looked around on line and found many people had bad withdrawls fron this drug.

Effexor Tremors? Effexor XR was the first anti-depressant that I have ever taken. Within one to two weeks I developed a tremor in my left hand.  This was in 2001.  I discontinued the drug after only three or four weeks of use.  The problem is that I still have the tremor.  I'm researching to find out if there is a link between this drug and permanent tremors.  Has anyone else had the same experience?

Tired, but not depressed I was prescribed Effexor for depression and anxiety about 6 weeks ago.  Started on 37.5mgXR, then gradually increased to 150mgXR.  I had a problem sleeping for about a week after the increased dosage but that has seemed to disappear now.  My doctor prescribed Ambien for the short-term until I start sleeping on  my own, which helped.  My moods have leveled out significantly--I no longer &quot;blow-up&quot; every day like I used to &amp; I generally have a feeling of calmness &amp; well-being, I also have had a decrease in appetite which is good in my case. HOWEVER I am EXTREMELY tired on this medication (with or without the Ambien).  My psychiatrist found this to be an unusual side-effect of the Effexor, saying that most of her patients feel more alert on this med.  I have been reading otherwise though, so I am calling her today to see if she will prescribe Provigil to see if it helps with my excessive sleepiness &amp; lethargy.  I DO have insurance to cover all of this (Thank GOD!).  Will keep you posted to see if this helps!

Nothing again! I am so sick of false hope. The promise that this one is different, it is going to help.  Well it did not. It did not make any difference at all. Effexor did not bring on a manic episode so I guess that is a good thing. But it is not for me.

Worst thing I've ever taken I was taking Effexor one year ago.  I don't recall the dosage, but I believe I was taking it for about a week.  My level of anxiety increased each day I took it.  I was sleeping poorly, and waking up early unable to get back to sleep.  I finally had to take myself to a suicide prevention center, where I was crying uncontrollably and pacing endlessly.  I immediately stopped taking Effexor, and these symptoms subsided within a day or so.

this has been updated Ok--have not had any major side effects...yet.I also take 100mg Zoloft, 5mcg cytomel, 10mg ambien, and ativan as needed.  Only thing.....the nightmares....I had one last night where someone was slitting my throat and I could actually *feel* myself choking on my own blood.  Not fun at all.  They are so vivid that you would swear that they were real. ALos gives you really bad constipation.  Now I'd like to go off of it, but I'm freaked out about discontinuation side effects.  Ugh.Note-This is several days after I wrote this.  I had my doc dicontinue it, but she didn't recommend dosing off slowly!  With my remaining pills, (XR), I have been opening the capsule, and decreasing the amount myself.  I don't think I'm having withdrawal, but I'm glad I'm not taking it anymore.Update:  Forget what I said about withdrawal......I've missed three days of work this week, have a splitting headache and feel like i'm going insane...can't stop weird thoughts from going through my head...can't relax...this med sucks....it should be taken off the market

effexor This med. has changed my life. I have never had any side effects. I have been taking it for over2 years, on 375mg a day.I also take klonopine 1mg a day in divded dosage and buspar 15mg 3 times a day. I am having more trouble with anxiety than depression right now. But effexor accompanied with the ant-anxiety meds does the trick for me.

nightmares The drug worked better than alot I have been on (Celexa, Prozac, Welbutrin, Remeron) but I couldn't stand the nightmares. After six months I was exhausted from lack of sleep because the nightmares were so bad I stayed up instead of going back to sleep and chancing another nightmare.

Side effects I have been fighting depression for a year now after mt dad's sudden death and my family moving 600 miles from my mom and other family a month following that.  I just began seeing my dr about this problem 5 weeks ago.  I took Effexor XR for 4 weeks and saw minor mood improvement, but not all that effective-maybe not enough time, but  I decided to try something else b/c of the sexual SE and the constant drowsiness with Effexor.  I had aweful time getting out of the bed and no interest in sex.  My doctor switched me to Lexapro @ 5 mg/day. I have had terrible nightmares-highly unusual for me past few nights and uncontrolllable crying that is a new symptom for me and he incresed  me to 10 mg a day. After reading others stories I think SE from getting off Effexor. Definately feel better already.  My mood has improved considerably in less than a week. Too soon to tell, but I do already feel increased libido! Praise God!

Effectless Effexor I don't know...I was on Prozac for several years after life long depression and it worked great. But then my insurance was dropped, and my doctor was able to switch me to Effexor by supplying free samples. But..it doesn't SEEM to have any effect and I wonder if it's just in my head. HAH. I don't feel better and feel more easily depressed than I used to. Life situations (new job, relationship problems, money trouble) are not as easily faced now as when I was on Prozac. I'm sad and unmotivated all over again...but now, I have REAL problems and not just the ones that were a result of faulty perceptions. I almost don't know how to cope anymore..and feel helpless. Effexor has had virtually no effect on me...I hate that the capsules are semi-empty..it's an annoyance, so I fill them up with contents from another capsule. But, since I have no faith in the med, I forget to take them...and hence, the return of my depression.

Excellent for Depression, but causes sleepiness I love Effexor because it has completely changed my personality. I am much more relaxed, and can get along with my family members much better. I am also much less irritable and agitated. However, Effexor makes me very sleepy, and as a result I have to take Provigil, which helps keep me awake. I am very reluctant to go off of Effexor because it has worked so well, and has caused such few side effects (besides the extreme fatigue). Unlike some medicines I have taken, Effexor has not caused nausea, dry mouth, or unstable emotions. I highly recommend it.

Effexor My experience with Effexor was a nightmare.  As my doctor continued to increase my dosage I noticed my anxiety levels going through the roof.  Yet my doctor adamantly stated that this could not be a side effect of Effexor.  I got to the point that I could not sit still, was unable to do normal tasks at my job, had to leave the room in tears, and had many other bad side effects.  Still my doctor refused to prescribe a different antidepressant.  I finally changed doctors over this situation.  When my new doctor had me taper off Effexor that became a new nightmare in itself.  I was stranded out of state on a weekend without the increments of the medication that he recommended I go back up to until I returned home.  My experience is something I wouldn't wish on anyone.

It's working for now I am taking a total of 225mg in the am.  Effexor XR has been the most effective so far.. and I been on all of the std. ssri's.  Today I have had a bad day and had the first &quot;wave&quot; of depression in a couple of months.  I hope it will pass quickly.  If not, my shrink will let me up the dose.  I haven't missed any doses but I still had a couple of the &quot;electric&quot; sensations.  They all happened during one night and surprised me but it was't a huge problem.I am afraid it is going to stop working.  My metabolism/appetite is changing over the last couple of days for no apparent reason.  I am afraid that this means the beginning of the end of the good results.

Not sure how I'm doing I have taken Luvox which worked great for a while and then stopped.  Paxil gave me bad nightmares.  Effexor seems to help, but lately I've been really tired.  It is such a chore to get out of bed and spend time with my family.  I have been taking the medicine at breakfast.  This week I'm taking it later in the day.  Each day I get one hour later because I get really dizzy and foggy if I go too long without it.  I hope taking it later will let me have some energy during the day.  I have a few habits that I was hoping this medicine would remedy.  I pull out my hair to the point I have bald spots.  I also have a &quot;nervous tick&quot; where I shake my head.  Anyone else fighting these demons?

Effexor - is it a good drug? I was on Effexor for about a year, and I started feeling a lot better, however, I also gained 20 lbs., so I asked my physician to switch me back to an all time favorite, Prozac.  I had been on that before and decided to try it again.Effexor is a great drug with no side effects for myself, except the weight gain.  I am a bit overweight as it is, I couldn't take gaining any more weight.

Effexor This medicine did help a little. It really upset my stomach though and my Dr. told me to take some over the counter medicine to counteract what the drug was doing to my stomach. Nothing really helped and I got tired of my stomach hurting 24/7. I finally made an appointment after 9 months w/my doctor, did my own research, and told him what I wanted to try and he agreed w/me.

Effexor Nightmare I was put on Effexor for what at the time was thought to be anxiety and depression.  I now know it was CFIDS.  I noticed little effect on the lowest dosage, but as my doctor continued to increase it I felt like I lost control of my body.  My anxiety went through the roof, I could not sit still, my emotions were all over the place.  It was like living in a nightmare that never ended.  Even when I told my doctor about these side effects he responded that they couldn't be from the Effexor.  After a lot of research I believe they were indeed caused by it.  To make matters worse it is very difficult to come off this drug.  I would not wish what happened to me with Effexor on anyone.

Effexor flu I had never taken any anti-depressants until last year. I have a very high stress job and it did work well. I felt very nauseated for the first 2 months, and looked great---I lost 15lbs. But after a while, I lost my ambition to do anything, and now I'm trying to get off this drug, and it is hell! I feel all the bad side effects. I only hope it doesn't last long. I did some &quot;drugs&quot; back in the 60's and THEY weren't this bad!

Awful Experience I was on effexor for approximately 2 months &amp; never slept. No matter when I took my dosages I could not fall asleep unless I took xanax or some other sleep aid. I also had *electrical shocks* in my feet ... that I still have after 9 months of stopping this drug! When I first started taking effexor, I had thoughts of suicide, but they did subside after a few days. It was the lack of sleep that did the most harm. I do not do well without sleep. I was up all night &amp; went several days with no sleep. I did not want to become addicted to xanax, so tried several OTC sleep aids - which helped give me a few hours sleep. However, I did not notice any help with my depression - I was too tired to notice any good effects. And I was switched because other AD's caused lack of libido - again, I was too tired to notice whether my libido was back or not. I could have cared less if it was - all I wanted to do was sleep. It was just a horrible drug for me and I will never take it again. As for cost effectiveness, I have a med co-pay on my insurance &amp; have no idea of out-of-pocket expenses.

WITHDRAWAL 22, female, bipolar II-Seriously...if anyone is currently taking Effexor and plans to stop, WEAN YOURSELF OFF AS SLOWLY AS YOU CAN!!!!!!!  I stopped taking it (150 mg total) abrubtly (as we bipolars often do...) and felt as if I had a horrible virus.  (vomiting, diarrhea, EXTREME nausea, weakness, headache, etc...)  I am now taking only 75 mg 1X daily and plan to stay on it in conjunction with Seroquel (25 mg 1X nightly).  The low dose is effective for me because I am extremely sensitive to medications.  I hope this helps...

Effexor HELL! I have only been on effexor 1 month, and already been twice to the emergency room, with life threatening symptoms.!!. I have dysthimic depression, all my life. I have tried all the SSRI's, with no major problems, so I thought, effexor would be ok. Side effects almost killed me. I felt like I was having a heart attack or stroke. Heart palpatations, arm went numb, leg numbness, blinding headache, blurred vision, major stomach pain, tremors, dizzy. I expected some side effects but I dont want to die first.  I told my doctor the side effects, and she put me on 75mg, but still the effects. BYE, BYE effexor, I would rather have depression!!

Effexor I am Bipolar &amp; I have taken Effexor for a little over a year, along with Depakote (Valproic Acid), Klonopin, Topamax, and Sonata (for sleep).  At 1st it seemed to work...like the million other anti-depressants I have taken, but now it seems it just isn't working anymore.  I have felt depressed to the point of feeling suicidal, so I have been switched to Lexapro as my new anti-depressant.  I think some meds work great for a while then the body adjusts and you have to switch.

So far the best I have been on Effexor for 5 weeks now and love it.  I had previously tried Paxil last year for 4-5 months and was so miserable on it that I weaned myself off of it.  Paxil was a nightmare.  It was very aware of being on medication while I was taking it. W/Effexor it is totally different my anxiety lowered almost the first day of taking it and now my mood has really leveled out.  I am feeling really normal. No more racing thoughts, worrying, sadness, etc. I have also lost 5 lbs. Initial side effects were blurred vision, metal taste in my mouth, little out of touch with reality (that only lasted a few days), nauseau, stomach upset, dizziness. All of that stuff went away after the first 3 weeks. Now I have to remind myself to eat at mealtime. It really helped me where Paxil was a nightmare.

Efexor XR I have recently decreased the dose from 300 mg/day to 150 mg/day and feel much better. On the higher dose I was experiencing severe joint pain, painful, irregular periods and an increased serum cholesterol level. I feel quite normal now, although I lack the energy that I had.  I also know when I have missed a dose when I experience headaches, dizziness and shakiness.

Effexor and weight I am being treated for major deppression, post tramatic stress and anxiety. I've been on effexor for almost a year. I like the drug itself.  For the most part it has helped me more than any other, but the side effects make me want to go off of it. The worst one is the weight gain, I've gained over 40 pounds in less than a year. I also have headaches and have trouble sleeping at times. To me I'd rather be crazy and skinny than crazy and fat, weight is a big issue with me...you know the self esteem thing. I have even been eating healthy and working out and I still keep gaining. I take 300mg/day.

be careful this drug brought me on a level to fight my anxiety, i did really well on it and found new love and i am soon to be having a baby. i really want to come off the drug, but i find it quite hard, i used to be on two 37.5mg tablets a day but over a few months i managed to cut this down to one a day and then one every other day, but when i went to one every 2 days i started getting some strange familiar feelings of anxiety and dread back so i have again uped my dose to one a day, i really want to live my life without the aid of this drug, but i think there should be more research done into the withdraw effects, be careful when using. i haven't seen any good reports on people who have recovered and are now off the drug on this site.

LIVING HELL!!!! This medication was a living hell for me. I was taking it for anxiety/depression! It made my anxiety 100 times worse.. panic attacks so bad i couldn't lay down or sit down with out panicking.. i couldn't sleep.. i walked circles.. i cried... i took it for 11 days.. and slept 2 hours in those 11 days.. I ended up in the psych ward because of the panic/ anxiety and lack of sleep.. it was pure hell! When i first started on the smallest dose it seemed ok.. but as soon as i went up like the standard protocol.. i was a mess... I would never recommend this medication to anyone! In fact I warn people about it.. it was so bad, I have been so scared to ever take a medication again... finally Dr has talked me into lexapro i had it sitting on my counter for 2 weeks be fore i got the guts to take it... that's how screwed up and scared the effexor made me.. i have been taking the lexapro for 6 days now and so far no side effects that i cant live with.. well see how this one works..

Why cause depressed people to gain weight? I have suffered from depression for over 10 years. I tried Zoloft first, but the sexual side effects were really bad. I tried Welbutrin, but it was not strong enough for my level of depression. I have been on Effexor for a while now, and due to that damn drug, I have gained over 30 pounds! How stupid is my doctor, he gave me Effexor increases weight gain AND Zyrtec (for my ecxema) that causes increased appetite. I'm already depressed due to life itself, and now I feel like crap cause I've gotten so big and none of my clothes fit! I'm now going to try Lexapro. Wish me luck!

What a headache! I really was sold on this being a great med for my panic and depression (a contradiction?) - and waited for 4weeks to get some beneficial relief.  Side effects (headache, sexual disfunction and enhanced panic) simply outweighed the benefits promised by Effexor.  I stopped after 3mos with no benefit and more headaches than 1 big bottle of aspirin can handle.

Effexor Effexor helped save my life really. Prozac didn't work, in fact I think it made me worse because it stopped me sleeping altogether. After about 5 days on Effexor I began to sleep again. Add in about 2 years hard work and counseling and here I am to tell the tale. Also the side effects when coming off them are quite strange but they do go away after a while. I was quite unstable on my feet for about a fortnight.

Too many side effects  This medication worked very well  for my depression best of all the medications  I have been on which is why I stayed on it for so long despite the very nasty side effects I was having...My side effects were very severe nausea if I did not eat I would actually vomit and would feel ill for three days... always had to take on a full stomach.Yawning.. I could not stop and this did not go away as expected.. more annoying than anything else.No Sex drive.No Appetite - lost weight which  for me was good.The worst side effect and also rare according to my Doctor was I developed Severe posterior Cervical Ridgidity..  this was the side effect that ultimately caused me to tell my Doctor I could no longer take the medication.Once I stopped it the cervical complaints resolved and have not returned.

Effexor and Withdrawal I have been taking Effexor for about 18 months now.  I have tried to go off of it several times with my doctor lowering my dosage.  I take a fairly low dose as it is.  The withdrawal symptoms of effexor are pure hell.  Had I known this I would never had started taking it.  If I miss my dose by even a few hours I start having withdrawals.  They start by a very fuzzy, heavy, disoriented feeling in your head.  I am unable to concentrate.  I feel like yelling at anyone who talks to me.  Then the nightmares come.  They are doozies.  Effexor also has made me very lethargic.  I just don't have the energy to even play with my child.  I can't go through the day without a nap.  I've gained almost 15 pounds that I'm unable to take off.  I would give about anything to be able to go off of this medication without the physical and psychological hell it puts me through.  Please think twice before taking it.

The Good and the Bad.. A clinic physician started me on samples of EffexorXR when I was in college.  I started slowly and built up to 75mg a day.  My anxiety almost immediately subsided.  The drug seemed amazing, until the side effects hit.  I often suffered cases of sleep paralysis.  When the dosage was increased to 150 mg I began having heart palpitations, increased sleep paralysis and &quot;brain shocks&quot; (a side effect which seems to be exclusive to Effexor - users will know just what I mean by the term).  I didn't have any insurance at the time and didn't realize how expensive the drug was going to be once the samples ran out (sure, that was probably half my fault).  Because of this, I immediately had to get off of the drug because I couldn't afford to sustain treatment and went through several nights of LIVING HELL!  I wound up having to get several pills filled and taper off very slowly.  This is an extremely strong medication and should be prescribed and taken ONLY with constant medical supervision as the drug enters your system extremely fast, causing swift and extreme withdrawal symptoms - including severe depression in some cases.  Generally speaking, Effexor XR is a really effective drug, but definitely not to be lightly taken or casually prescribed by college clinic physicians to patients not familiar with the effects and ramifications of the drug.  Additionally, the low score concerning cost effectiveness in my rating has to deal with lack of insurance on my part.  The drug seems to be covered my standard HMO insurance, but if you're planning to pay out of pocket, get ready to pay standard antidepressant drugs costs  in excess of $100 a month.

effexor I have been using effexor for several years now after zoloft didnt do the trick. I have to say that at the start, my depression was greatly relieved by this drug. The side effects to the libido were awful but one lives with it if you dont feel like killing yourself.. Now I am going to try something new Lexapro...The effexor just doesnt seem to take the edge off anymore and I have had more events in the past six months than before. This was a godsend at the time but it just isnt doing it anymore..

Body Shocks Effexor XR worked well as far anti-depressants go. Had blurred vison as a side effect. I would never ever take it again. The after effects were the worst experience of my life. After I stopped taking it or missed a dose I would have horrific nightmares! I would also get these electric shock like pulses going through my whole body and brain. What a nightmare. Never again!!!The after effects lasted for months.

effexor xr have previously tried prozac, which made me constantly tired, then, celexa which made me eat all the time which made me even more depressed. My doctor wouldnt change the celexa so I changed my doctor.This was the best move I ever made, my new doctor put me on 37.5 mg effexor xr I felt an improvement almost straight away, but over a period of a few weeks my dose was increased until I was on 250 mg. This dose worked for me and now I have reduced the dose to 175 mg and still feel great, I can honestly say I did not have any side effects apart from feeling nauseous when I first started the medication but this quickly wore off after 2 or 3 days.  It is wonderful to wake in the morning and NOT think 'not another day'.

Effexor XR Much better than Zoloft, which I took 5 years ago.Only problem is trouble getting to and staying asleep. Being 49, and female could be a problem with menopause. But the effect on treating my depression is very good. I've recommended it to my daughters doctors and they are being helped by it also.

Love it I have been on Effexor for 3 months now and it has changed my life. I would recommend it for anyone suffering depression/anxiety...I have tried Celexa and Zoloft with out them working. The only side affect that has tracked me down is sweating. But even that seems to be subsiding. My life feels normal for the 1st time ever, I am sleeping well, have a good sex life with my husband, can get my house cleaned and children what they need and still have energy after all of that!

Effexor I have been on Effexor for several weeks now to treat my depression, and so far this is simply THE BEST antidepressant medication out there for my depression. I was on Effexor XR and I had multiple side effects from it...extreme diarrhea, and nausea problems. I feel less tense and less irritable, and moody, and believe me...my moods were getting the best of me. My moodswings were like a disease eating up the inside of my body, causing my loved ones to not be around me, including my fiance, and without the treatment of my Effexor, I honestly believe that I would have lost my relationship and my engagement to my fiance. I feel like more myself, my fiance and my family can tell a big difference in me. I feel more like myself again; I feel revived and more happier than I have ever been in my entire life with the help of taking Effexor. It is like a miracle drug for me. Please do not stop making Effexor. Although I do realize that one should not become totally dependant on the use of antidepreesants to treat their depression, they should have faith, and turn their problems over to GOD. He is there for us all. That is what I did, and with faith in believing that I can beat this depression and with the help of taking my Effexor, I feel as though I will be able to lead a normal and healthy life, and my fiance Mike is EXTREMELY supportive.
effexor	Depression	2002-09-20 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	Effexor I have been on Effexor for several weeks now to treat my depression, and so far this is simply THE BEST antidepressant medication out there for my depression. I was on Effexor XR and I had multiple side effects from it...extreme diarrhea, and nausea problems. I feel less tense and less irritable, and moody, and believe me...my moods were getting the best of me. My moodswings were like a disease eating up the inside of my body, causing my loved ones to not be around me, including my fiance, and without the treatment of my Effexor, I honestly believe that I would have lost my relationship and my engagement to my fiance. I feel like more myself, my fiance and my family can tell a big difference in me. I feel more like myself again; I feel revived and more happier than I have ever been in my entire life with the help of taking Effexor. It is like a miracle drug for me. Please do not stop making Effexor.

Effexor I would not say Effexor is ineffective; I can see where it would work well for some people.  My doctor gave it to me on a trial and error basis, and I didn't feel much different.  I continued to have insomnia and the anxieties I was dealing with were still able to get to me.  I had random vomiting prior to starting on Effexor, and it did get rid of that, but I continue to have headaches.  I'm now on Geodon (ziprasidone)and Sonata (zaleplon).  We'll see how this goes.

More Energy /No Sleep I have been taking Effexor XR for 4 months now. It is the first AD I have tried. It has helped me get through the day when before I did not want to get up and go to work in the morning. It has also improved my concentration so I can accomplish something and I have more energy instead of being so tired. The initial side effects were hard to get through: headaches, sleeplessness, caffeine-like jittery tension, but these subsided as I became accustomed to the drug, although I still have some bad headaches. I also had a few brief episodes of extreme irritability but they did not continue. The one big problem for me that I have not been able to take is insomnia. I have tried several additional AD's at bedtime to help me sleep- trazadone and then Elavil. Neither one gave me a good night's sleep. In fact the Trazadone gave me a foggy hangover that never let up and worked against the Effexor by making me less alert during the day. I am still searching for something to help me sleep and I have concerns that it is the Effexor itself that is keeping me from sleeping. I am also taking hormones and that has helped a little. If anyone has overcome this problem. Please share what you know.

Effexor This medicine has been very effect in treating the depression that comes with hormonal imbalancesof PMS &amp; early menopause. Migraines are almost a faded memory, mood swings are few &amp; far between, work-related stress diminshed. The joy of life hasreturned and it is good!The other side of the coin.....Weight gain (ugh.....35lbs)loss of sex drive,and the side-effect ofmissing a dose.This medicine has been a God sent...an ansewer to prayer.Side-effects have been minimal for me.Even knowing the difficulty of getting off this medicine,I would do it all over again.Over-heard a co-worker say &quot;you know,Mary's not such a bad person.She has really changed.&quot; That's great news to me

Doing pretty good, now I started taking Effexor about 5 months ago. At first it was 37.5 mg for 2 weeks and gradually ended up at 300 mg a day. I'd have to say that every week I'd experience a different or ongoing side effect that'd really suck but they'd subside after a few weeks or so. I've mostly noticed the headaches-start early afternoon till I fall asleep at night, but nothing that 2 aspirin couldn't cure. I also experienced constant racing thoughts that I had NO control over, which affected my sleep. Now I have to take an insomnia med too. Over all I feel that this has been a good drug for me. In the past I've tried Prozac, Zoloft, Louvox and Wellbutrin; which I'm still taking now.(also 300 mg a day!) Without my wonderful dog Missy and then these drugs I'd have killed myself many years ago. I've been classified as severally depressed for over 10 years now. But it's slowly getting better...I guess. I'm just beginning to work with a woman doing some RET (rapid eye therapy) and some cranial sacral work. I'm very excited about how this will all turn out in the next 3-8 months. I'll keep you updated, from what I've read and been told by close and trusted friends is that these therapies will incredibly advance my work on depression and PTSD. (I was sexually, physically and emotionally abused for 90% of my childhood) I'm so very sick of being depressed and exhausted. I'm also dealing with a new marriage (about 20 months now) and it's been very difficult. I haven't held a &quot;real&quot; job for over 2? years or so. I can't seem to tolerate all the shortcomings of the people I'd work with. I'm a very hard worker but I need constant mental stimulation so I guess I'm basically screwed right now huh? Anyways, sorry to type your eyes off, but I do think this drug has many good aspects, you just have to be patient. It usually takes up to 8 weeks to feel the full affect of the drug. And by all means, DO NOT just stop taking it, any drug for that matter. You need to slowly tap

Effexor made me anorexic I can't exactly remember too clearly exactly how I felt on Effexor, but I do know that I developed anorexia while taking Effexor, mentally and physically. I don't think that was the main reason I discontinued the venlafaxine. I believe I also felt very manic.

I experience it's theraputic effect for depression rather well- yet have never experienced any noticeable effect for any subgroup of anxiety disorders with 3 years use. To Date, I continue with Benzodiazepines as one alternative for G.A.D. Perhaps Lexapro may offer a new advantage as well asother SSRIs &amp; other mood stabilizers as I continue my appointments with Psych. (Have not been prescribed Celexa) Pregabalin is interesting having not responded to Neurontin.

effexor-xr Effexor has been working ok, but only been on it one month. I don't like the sexual side effects:I can be feeling very sexual for a few days then suddenly drop to no desire at all. Orgasms harder to have, sometimes can't achieve one at all. My moods are not as drastic, I feel more optimistic, and cope better with daily stresses. I also like the reduction in my appetite, since depression at times has me eating compulsively.

withdrawal I have been sev. depressed most of my life and had bouts of anorexia as well.After taking several drugs throughout my life I seem to reach a plateau and have needed to change to a new drug treatment.Effexor was my latest drug treatment.  It seemed at first that the sun would shine again...but then the side effects hit. The worst being headache from AM through PM, lack of sleep, and vomiting.When taken off the Effexor my HELL began and has not quit.My Doctor, after being on the drug for just one month, has been weaning me for 10 days now.  The Brain Shivers are the worse part. Then Hot and Cold periods, Nausea, Crying, Out of Control Feelings, My Peripheral Vision makes me Dizzy, Night Terrors, and On and On!!!Had I known all the side effects I would NEVER have started this drug, especially because I do tend to reach a plateau with most treatments.I wish Doctors would research the withdrawal of drug treatments as much as they do the benefits!!

Effexor for cognitive function/mood swings I've been taking Effexor for about 2 years now (actually prescribed for fibromyalgia but also beneficial for MS-like symptoms), and while I still have to make lists to help me remember what needs to be done, it has helped trendously to help me function and interact with others. Without it I could barely follow a conversation, was confused much of the time, and startled easily; I panicked every time the phone rang and had mood swings and crying jags. The Effexor has stabilized my mood swings, reduced the stress, helped me cope, and improved my concentration. It hasn't cured the symptoms mentioned, but it has certainly helped to give me back a more functional life! However, without insurance I wouldn't be able to afford it.

EffexorXR This was one of several AD's I took to try and treat the BPII symptoms I experience. It was fairly effective at first, but seemed to wear off later in the treatment period. I changed to another drug as a result.

GAD, Depression, and Effexor XR I'm actually on a dosage of 112.5 mg, once a day. It has been AWESOME in helping me deal with my GAD and Depression, both of which I've been diagnosed with since January of 2002. I first tried Celexa (SSRI), and it was no where NEAR effective in my treatment. Unlike most SSRI's, EffexorXR affects both Serotonin AND norepinepherine reuptake. As I've looked more deeply into those neurotransmitters and what exactly each does in the body, the effects of Effexor on these is PERFECT for what I need to progress into remission of both my GAD and Depression (i.e., irritability, racing thoughts, aggression, inability to eat, insomnia, etc.). Effexor is also the FIRST drug the FDA approved for treating both Generalized Anxiety Disorder AND Depression. I highly reccomend it, or at least looking into it as a possible remedy for you. It has given me hope where no other medicine has.

effexor I switched to effexor about a month ago from remeron (2 months) and zoloft/wellbutrin (years). Started at 37.5, then 75, now 75 2 x daily. Initial week was tough (pain, diahrea, anxiety) but now I feel pretty good. My appetite and weight  is down which is ok since I had gained weight with remeron, and sexual desire/performance is down (male) compared with remeron, which was the only advantage of remeron vs. all the other antidepressants. I'm now getting a good night's sleep and feel rested and ready to wake up at a reasonable hour, my anxiety is gone, and I'm not fatiqued. Note that I also work-out hard (aerobics and weight training) 4-5 times per week which is a major help for depression and self image, and I get testosterone injections weekly which have been a big help.

Effexor XR I credit Effexor XR with initially saving my life, but it stopped working for me.  After 1 1/2 years of use, at continuously higher dosages Effexor started to lose its ability to help with depression - my pdoc said after so long at high dosages, effexor xr can begin to have the OPPOSITE EFFECT on persons with bp.  I used this with serequel but am now on neither of them, and am trying the new classes of mood stabilizers.

Effex1 Effexor helped me get out of major depression, and I was happy it didn't have many side-effects, then I didn't take it for 2 days. This drug works great, but the withdrawl is horrible. If you use this drug and decide to stop, you might want to gradually reduce the dose.

Effexor XR I have been taking Effexor XR for 3 weeks now.  When I started it was in a bad way.  I had been taking Paxil for several years and didn't like the weight gain so my DR switched me to Buspar.  The weight gain was worse.  Like an idiot I just stopped taking anything.  It took six weeks but I hit bottom.  Effexor XR has just started working to some degree.  I still suffer with anxiety attacks when I wake up and there is a lot of heartburn associated with taking it.  But I am a lot better.

Effexor works okay I have been taking 300mg of the XR for several years, after having tried Prozac (worked for about 1 week), Zoloft (did not handle anxiety), Paxil (a disaster), Nardil and others. The Effexor does keep me on an even keel, but I would not say that it has eliminated my depression. The best I can say is that it keeps it under control. I am still looking for a better med or combo of meds to feel &quot;normal&quot;.

Thank God for Effexor After being treated with a laundry list of all known anti-depressants, my life was saved when my doctor finally put me on effexor.  It took some time to get the dosage correct, but once it was taken to a very high level (450mg)...my outlook on everything changed.  I am now much better and much &quot;less depressed&quot;.  In fact, I have recently been &quot;weaned&quot; down to a mere 275mg/day.  I am grateful for this drug.  I wouldn't be able to survive everyday.

So far so good I have had excellent results with Effexor - I am very pleased with it.  I have recommended it to family and friends that have experienced unpleasant side effects and/or ineffectiveness with their prescribed medications.  I experience a slight drowsiness - but it isn't a major problem.  I am hoping that this will continue to work for me as it has made a huge difference in the quality of my life.  Many Thanks

Effexor XR I started taking Effexor XR again after 1yr without taking it, I hesitated restarting the medication because of the horrible withdrawal I had the first time I discontinued the medication.  I am also taking lamictal, xanax, and adderall. I started taking the lamictal because I was showing no progress on the effexor.  I am going to ask my doctor if I can stop my effexor because I feel it is pointless.  I am not looking forward to the withdrawal.  I believe the lamictal has given me back my life.

Non effective for me I was on Effexor XR for 7 months...felt miserable- nausea, nervous &amp; anxiety, shakes/trembles &amp; cried almost daily during the entire time of dosage. My depression has improved only slightly, still am not functioning normal.  FINALLY, my psydr is slowing tapering me off. I still have shakes/trembles..I will never use it again.

stopped working for me I started on Effexor-XR as soon as it came out, and the results were fantastic. I had none of the tenseness that Prozac had caused, and none of the sedation of Paxil. It worked very well for me until one year ago, when my depression increased AND my side effects increased. Upping the dosage caused more side effects (tremors, nausea, sleep problems) and didn't help the depression. Added Wellbutrin - no help. Finally decided to go back to Prozac which had worked well on my depression many years ago.... BUT----getting off Effexor was a NIGHTMARE. I was anxious, paranoid, suicidal, nauseated...I couldn't face the world for weeks. I tapered off extremely slowly (and titrated up on Prozac slowly)...but you need to be VERY careful when getting off this med.  I did not feel like myself again for about three months. ALSO, every antidepressant I've tried SINCE Effexor now also causes anxiety....something I've never had a problem with. I worry that Effexor really messed up my brain circuitry!

effexor Effexor was excellent for depression but had the side effect of causing mania, and a nasty withdrawl.My son was in a major depression when he started Effexor. The depression lifted after about one month but soon after caused mania even at a lower dose. We are now weaning him off. The withdrawal to lower doses causes severe flu type symptoms. He's miserable. He's down to 37.5 this week.

Effexor XR I like the extended release because it alleviates the nasty stomach-related side effects.  However, I am finding that the medication itself seems to stop working after some time, and I am regressing to my prior state.

Worked So Far Recently, last Oct. I began to fall into a DEEP depression. I isolated myself, became an introvert, and felt helpless to dig myself out of it. I knew something had to be done, so i saw a &quot;shrink&quot; - she perscribed Effexor. I started at 50mg for a week then 75mg then ultimately 150mg. During my &quot;dark time&quot; which lasted a pathetic 7 months, I never left my house alone, I always left with my mother, and this wasn't frequent, this was just up to the store and such. Well anyway, to sum it up, I have found Effexor effective in helping me to get out of the house solo and trying to move on with my life one step at a time. I only had initial side effects such as nausea and headaches but other than that my situation has improved immensely compared to what it was. Effexor isn't for everyone but it has helped me so far for the almost 3 months I have been on it.

Fairly Effective Effexor has worked pretty well for me.  When I first started on it, I had a lot of side effects - dizziness, hot flashes, dry mouth, sedation, etc.  Once my body became acclimated, though, I don't have any side effects at all.  The only real problem I have with it is that it causes major withdrawal symptoms if you miss more than one dose.  I forgot my meds when I went away for the weekend, and by the time I got home, I was sick to my stomach, had a major headache, was sweating, and had the shakes.  REMEMBER TO TAKE IT WITH YOU EVERYWHERE and it will treat you well.

At first it was amazing and i thought i had discovered a miracle, then after about 4 months it wasn't as effective. i tried taking a higher dose and it still wasn't helping, so i just stopped taking it and the withdrawal is soooo bad, i can not explain. its been about a week now since i have stopped and I have flu-like symptoms, severe body aches, irritability, crying spells, dizziness, upset stomach, moodswings. i feel like i'm going through puberty again with all of my emotions out of control.

effexor has it's benefits and drawbacks i was on effexor for approx. two years. i was on 300 mgs. for the past year. for the most part, the drug worked great. my mood lifted considerably and i suffered no ill side effects. however, i went off of it because i started to take adderall xr for add. when i found that adderall worked even better in lifting my mood (and that it is used to treat depression), i didn't see any point in continuing with the effexor. unfortunately, the effects of effexor withdrawl were disastrous. i experienced flu like symptoms with severe nausea and dizziness    to the point where i had to go on prozac in order to ease the transition which did the trick. one thing i should mention about my experience with effexor is that it does have a tendency to make people gain weight. during the time i was on it (two yrs) i probably gained about 45 pounds.  so if that's something you're worried about, you may want to take that into consideration. it didn't really bother me -- but that's just me.

Downside:  If I forget to take it I have very strange dreams and have &quot;crashed&quot; after forgetting to take it for 3 days.  So must sustain the dose unless taken off gradually.

not the one for me I have tried many kinds of anti-depressants before I found the one that worked. This was one that did not. I used it years ago, didnt help my depression, and caused unbearable joint pain, where I couldnt bend over, and I am only in my 20's. Some people say it is the only one that helps, but it does not help all. Keep trying others if it does not help you.

Too Many Side Effects For Me I had to stop Effexor at 187.5 mg., despite me and my pdoc wanting to go up to 225 mg. I was experiencing too many side effects (lots of tremors) that were outweighing the negligible results I was getting from the drug.

Energy, energy, give me energy I've been battling FMS for years, but only recently with the help of a physician.  I'm fortunate to have found someone who will really work with me on trying new meds and therapies to make me feel better.After finally getting my sleep reasonably under control, I found that I was still unable to find much energy during the day.  After a series of trials, my doc and I tried Effexor.  75 mg in the morning when I first get up has added significantly to my energy level.  It took about 6 weeks to really feel the effects, but now I'm feeling better than I have in years.  My boss and my friends have all noticed as well, asking what I changed that has made such a difference!!I'm still tired and in pain and wouldn't consider my FMS well managed yet, but we are on the right road.  Effexor has made a big improvement in my energy level.Seems a bit strange that I would need one thing to help me sleep at night and another to give me energy during the day, thankfully, at least those options are open!

Effexor I was actually on 4 75mg xr tabs 4 times a day-but no option for it. Effexor-dose doubled in anticipation of an oncoming episode of depression....FAILURE. It has done nothing for it. In fact, I ended up with serotonin syndrome. Parkinsons-like shaking, diarreah, convulsions-ALL of which were ignored by my psychiatrist until I found out about the disorder and realized that is what was happening. The dosage was immediately dropped to 2 37.5 mg xr tabs per day. The withdrawls are unfathomable. I was not expecting anything as such. I am in confusion, agony, horror all of the time. I expected withdrawls like I experienced from Paxil. WRONG WRONG WRONG. This is unbearable. I have never in my life experienced anything so tormentous. Good luck to all taking it. I hope you have success with this drug.

The big gun. Does the job with minimal side effects by comparison. Can cause sedation and/or mania in the beginning of dosing until you become used to dosage. A bit of CNS slowing and reflex slowing. Only downfall is with short half-life (missed dosage), withdrawl is horrible. Withdrawl includes dizziness, anxiety, numbness in extremities, etc. You will remember to take your meds. 225mg daily

Does what I want, but not without side effects I actually take 225 mg of this a day... two 75 mg pills in the morning, but that wasn't an option in the pulldown menu.  Effexor does what I want it to do.  It controls my anxiety and depression as well as I could expect a medication to do.  However, it has a very short half-life and if I miss a dose or two, I go into severe withdrawal that makes me so dizzy I can barely walk, and unable to stop sobbing for no reason at all.  Effexor also comes with name brand prices, of course, and is not available in generic form.

LifeSaver When I started taking Effexor in Feb 95, I couldn't imagine getting my life back. Nothing else I'd taken had really helped. Even friends &amp; family noticed a VAST improvement soon after my dose was up at 75mg 3x/day. When XR came out, I went to that, and found I was more able to be compliant. I was put up to 300mg/day in Nov99, and was again glad it still worked. Sometimes I get the odd side effect, like *VIVID* dreams I have trouble awakening from, but that's NOTHING compared to what I have back. My migraines improved, my sleep improved, everything, but most of all my depression &amp; symptoms are now under control and I have my life back!

Best for me for depression . . .  . . . but not good with weight gain and withdrawal symptoms.  Started on 37.5 mg and went up to 75 mg.  I tapered back down to the starting dose because I didn't like the weight gain.  It pretty much doesn't give me much other side effects while taking it (after the first week or two your body gets used to it).  There is some drowsiness experienced with it as well, but I think Paxil made me more tired.  The weight gain might have been initially caused by the Paxil, but Effexor XR (which is suppose to make you LOST weight, if anything) isn't doing anything good for my weight.  This may be because of the low dosage I'm on.  In this case, the higher the dosage, maybe the more likely you'll lose weight, but I have heard that this in not the case with many people.  I find this side effect unacceptable, and had just recently tried to get off of it.  The discontinuation symptoms were much the same as the Paxil (except no irregular heartbeats), and my brain really felt like mush in my skull.  I was crying uncontrollably after being off of the lowest dosage for a day.  My doctor tried swiching me onto 50 mg of Serzone, taking this at the same time for a week as taking the Effexor.  The Serzone, however, seemed to be making a mess of my stomach, and was way too sedating (Effexor hadn't been quite that sedating).  I tried that a week, and went back on the baby dose of Effexor.  I seemed to only get side effects when I didn't have ANY of it in my body.  Going from 75 mg to 37.5 mg didn't seem to be a problem, but even after being on the starter dose for three weeks, I still had a problem even skipping a day.Now, I'm looking into alternative supplements to see if it lessons the withdrawals.  Doctors aren't very knowledgeable, or willing to impart information about what you're getting into with side effects and discontinuation symptoms.

Effexor Hi, I take Effexor tablets, 25mg. four times a day and 5 times a day on my two weeks of PMS. I love this medication. I have been on so many antidepressants for the last 15 years and none worked well or long enough. The first one that really helped me was Zoloft but it dampened my sex drive which Effexor does not plus Zoloft stopped working after two years. I have been on Effexor probably three years now with good results though am wondering now if I may need a dose increase? Could just be a bad day I am having? I think this medication is especially good for those like me that have been treatment resistent. Of course each antidepressant affects each person differently from what I have read. I can't tolerate Prozac, but have some friends that love it. So it is kind of trial and error in my opinion. The only thing bad I have heard about Effexor is it maybe difficult to come off of, the withdraw symptoms are bad. But for me this is not an option, I know I will probably always be on some kind of antidepressant, I have not been able to go long without one before becoming very depressed with suicidal thoughts. I am doing great now and I hope it continues to work for me.Deb.:)

Effexor I take 3x75mg=225 mg of Effexor a day. One in the AM and two in the PM. It works very well. I also take Xanax. I am troubled by the loss of libido, however, my husband more so than I. Cuz when you have lost your libido, you don't know you have lost it. But entering menopause might be a contributing factor also. I have a good insurance so cost effectiveness is not a very large factor for me. Barbara

effexor-xr	Depression	2012-01-18 00:00:00		3.5	2.0	1.5	2.0	Effexor 150 XR was good for me, I took it for 10 years. The first time I used it a huge firework dud that went off in my head. Only problem the small side effects were kicking in. I found I was always peeing my pants, it would come on fast, no time to run to the bathroom. Gaining 100 pounds. No sex urges. Eventually you loose taste in food. Everything starts to taste the same. I would eat until I was full.After about 6 years taking it, my mind went into a dark place. All I could think of was when am I going to die.I was taken off Effexor, because it got to expensive. $200. that was too much for me. Now, I take a drug that only costs me $4. It is wonderful. I'm losing weight. I don't pee my pants any more. Food taste so good. I find I don't have to eat at much. It's good for a couple of years. Just remember there are a lot of drugs out there that you can take. Now, I see the world in a whole different way. Happy all the time, along with happy dreams.
effexor-xr	Depression	2012-01-14 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	This drug has help me with mood swings and depression. My  only issues have been if I skip a dose. I take my pill (Venlafaxine) before I go to bed (150 mg @ 10:00 pm) . If I forget to take it then I dream strange dreams not bad dreams just strange. Also I feel like I have a very bad sinus infection until the pill starts to take effect. What I have discovered from this is to be sure too take my dose on time each night.
effexor-xr	Depression	2012-01-12 00:00:00		4.5	1.0	2.5	3.0	As a 22 year old college student struggling with depression, I found Effexor made those bad feelings go away. I had been prescribed to a few other antidepressants before Effexor but none helped as much. Feeling normal again was great... As long as I didn't miss the scheduled time to take my pills by more than a hour. The massive headaches I got daily were good reminders to take those magic 3 pills every night... Untill the 1 night I felt to lazy to wake up and take them at te onset of my headache... The next day I got very dizzy so I laid down and my head felt like waves were rushing through it. The supposed Effexor brain zaps are no lie. They sent me to the er that day and the doctors could do nothing for me. After that I decided to wean off them for good. I did it the exact way the doctor told me to. I'm now 2 days off completely and my head feels fuzzy. It's almost a bad drunk feeling. This type of effect on my brain isn't worth the happy feelings,
effexor-xr	Depression	2011-12-07 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	4.5	5.0	I have been on this medication for about  6 years and it has saved my life!!!  Sure, I have some side effects.. but it is nothing compared to the terrible anxiety and depression I had. I'm a new woman and much happier in my life than I ever was before this medication, and I will continue to stay on this for the rest of my life if I have to. Don't let people scare you. If we have to live, we might as well be happy, and if this medication works, then it is a &quot;miracle&quot; pill. I take the generic tablet 75mg once a day.

Within 2 weeks I was smiling and even going shopping and before I had not left the house in several months. I ran out for about a week and my mood did a 360. But once I was back on them, it only took about 3-4 days to get things normal again.I have been taking Effexor XR 37.5 twice a day for 8 years now.
effexor-xr	Depression	2011-02-10 00:00:00		5.0	3.5	5.0	5.0	i have severe depression with sad and gad. this medication has given my life back to me, after at least 30 years of trying various other anti-depressive medications. improvement seems to go up a level every year or so removing anxiety and sad and gad symptoms, along with slowly improving major depressive symptoms. this medication is especially effective if depression is coupled with sad and gad and/or generalized anxiety. it can be almost non-effective or cause side effects with folks that have other reasons for there depressive condition. for me it is a life saver. effexor xr, 300mg daily, used 6.5 years.
effexor-xr	Depression	2010-12-13 00:00:00		3.5	3.0	4.0	4.0	Have been on the generic form of Effexor XR for several years. Doesn't seem to be as effective and I am taking 150 mg daily.  I would like to change to another drug as I most likely will get depressed and also have anxiety.  I do not want to take another pill in addition to Effexor.  Effexor has put weight on me and causes constipation.  Can you recommend another drug that may work for me?  Thanks, Carole
effexor-xr	Depression	2010-12-08 00:00:00		5.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	I've been on Effexor Xr 37.5mg. daily.  I am going through treatment for breast cancer, so you can imagine that I am feeling a bit depressed. I also was having panic attacks for no reason. This drug has eliminated the panic attacks all together and I feel much more even tempered. I am feeling fatigued, but I'm sure the effects of chemo are to blame. I hope when all this is over I will not need to continue with the drug and I hope the withdrawal effects are not too bad since I am on a low dose.
effexor-xr	Depression	2010-12-08 00:00:00		2.5	3.0	5.0	3.0	I just started Effexor XR 150mg per day and noticed very little interest in wanting to do anything still.  I have tried Prozac, Zoloft, and Seroquel XR to calm my PTSD symptoms and nothing has ever worked and now I can Effexor XR to that list of medications that do not work for PTSD trauma symptoms.

effexor-xr	Menopause	2010-12-01 00:00:00		5.0	2.5	5.0	3.5	Going through the change of life, Dr. put me on Effexor XR,  I was having horrible mood swings and could not stand to be around my own self!!!Ahhhh it felt wonderful to be my old self again. The side effects? I gained 50lbs in 18 months. ugh. I had many &quot;stroke&quot; like systems. I think that was due to the fact I would forget to take a pill.  You will also have from the base of your skull up to the top of your head a quick jolt of like hot lighting?. That is also a side effect. I got off of them due to the weight gain. Im ready to gain the weight back!!! I want to feel normal again Effexor XR!! 2 thumbs up!
effexor-xr	Depression	2010-11-12 00:00:00		4.5	5.0	5.0	4.5	I have been on Effexor Xr for about 5 years. This is the only antidepressant I feel has worked for me. Most antidepression have put me in a manic state for a long time. I still have depression but I feel on a daily basis this drug has helped alot. No side effects for me but a bit of clumsines.I would recomment it only some drugs work for others and do not for others.

effexor-xr	Depression	2010-10-11 00:00:00		4.5	4.0	3.5	4.5	i've been on effexor xr for about four years. the only side effect i've ever had is dizziness, but that was attributed to my weight loss. i had been 232 lbs and taking 150mg, but i had lap band surgery, and lost 30 lbs in a few months. we realized that the appropriate dose for a 232 lb woman might not be the same as for a 175 lb woman that i am  now, so i'm now on 112.5 mg (1- 75mg and 1-37.5 mg pill)the &quot;withdrawal&quot; symptoms are killer!! i'm horrible about remembering to take my medication, so i like that effexor MAKES me take it- if i miss a dose, i feel like hell. i keep a dose in the car and in my purse at all times just in case. that's really the only downsidei have personally noticed a huge reaction with the appetite suppressant side effect, even before my weight loss surgery, which was nice.
effexor-xr	Depression	2010-10-05 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	4.0	5.0	I take 37.5mg for the last 2 and a half years. It works very well for me. I remember being in a fog and feeling very disconnected from myself for the first week. The only trouble that I have had with this medication is that as much as it helped me to not feel too down - it does not let me feel excited or really happy.  So my Psychiatrist put me on Generic Wellbutrin as well.  This combination has been a life saver.  I am now a better mother, wife, and friend. It took about 2 years for me to get comfortable and really begin to feel the full affects of the treatment. After living for 43 years with numerous suicidal thoughts throughout every single day, I now can go for weeks at a time without having one thought of suicide. :D

effexor-xr	Depression	2010-09-25 00:00:00		2.5	4.0	5.0	4.0	the side effects only lasted 3 days from what i remember.(totally laid out on my mom's kitchen floor, zero appetite) don't let these pills get stuck in your throat! thats hours of heartburn!  i've been taking effexorxr(75mg) 8 years now. (just effexor(75mg) 2 years before that) i don't feel any better but i don't feel any worse. unfortunately i forget to take them almost all the time, maybe i'll remember tomorrow. it seems to work better for me than zoloft did.
effexor-xr	Depression	2010-08-11 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I tried a couple of other anti-depressants before I tried Effexor XR. I had no luck with either. Since starting Effexor XR 9 1/2 years ago,I have had no side-effects and it has helped greatly. I take 37.5 mg.
effexor-xr	Depression	2010-06-18 00:00:00		5.0	2.0	3.0	3.0	works great for depression and anxiety once your body is used to the meds. Had strong side effects like tiredness, muscle shocks etc. It seems very unorganic and if you stop it, do it very slowly. If the side effects wouldn't be so severe, I would love effexor, it totally works. Made me relaxed and at ease all the time, wonderful!
effexor-xr	Anxiety	2010-06-08 00:00:00		5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	I have been on this medication now for a few years and found that it has helped my quality of life tremendously! I felt so good that I thought I didn't need it anymore and weind myself off and once it was out of my system I found that I was way better off being on it. I only take 37.5mg a day and have found that there were no real side effects than the others I have tried on the market. I would recommend the use of this medication to anyone who is like me that has anxiety and depression issues. I would recommend starting out on a lower dose and move up if the lowest does doesn't work. Don't start out high at first because with any drug you need to see what will work with your body and alot of Dr.'s think to put you up on a high dose but everyone is different and the high does didn't work for me.

effexor-xr	Depression	2010-06-07 00:00:00		0.5	2.0	3.0	0.5	I've tried all sorts of meds for depression and panic disorder. I am currently on prescibed 600mg. Apparently I have since learnt that this is more than a dosage should be described. I feel worse after 2 years on it and have attempted suicde x4 times ( definately not my normal personality at all) I am currently about to wean off this medication (I am on others) I suffer depression, panic attacks and agrophobia, this medication has not helped at all after 3 years. I'm worried of withdrawals

effexor-xr	Depression	2010-04-07 00:00:00		4.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	I am 52 and have taken medication for depression since about 1991, so I have taken a few different medications, including Zoloft and Paxil. I have been taking Effexor for about six years. It's been very effective for me and has caused the least side effects of all the drugs I have taken. I was taking 150 mg daily, but I was getting more days feeling depressed, so my doctor increased it to 225 mg and I am doing well. However, it's difficult to judge what will work for you based on someone else's experience because antidepressants can work very differently in different people.

After trying many other meds I was put onto Venlafaxine (Effexor XR). I noticed no difference at all til I was on a dose of 300mg. However looking back what I think made the difference was circumstantial. I kept going down and being depressed so am coming off this drug. Little did I know that many people find this extremely hard to do! I'm doing it very slowly- 37,5mg per week, and so far have had no side effects at all coming off, except being really anxious and wound up. Being on a cocktail of meds it's hard to say if it gave me any side effects or whether they came from a combination of drugs. The only SE that I know definitely came from this drug was sweating a lot more (ew!!!) I'm looking forward to this going!

I started taking Effexor XR back in mid February 2009 for severe anxiety. I started with 37.5 mg for two weeks and then my doctor raised my dosage to 75 mg a day. I started to feel slightly better around April but I was still struggling with pretty bad anxiety. Meanwhile as soon as I started the medication I felt pretty sluggish and it was hard for me to get out of bed in the morning.  My head felt &quot;cloudy.&quot; Also, I still had my libido but achieving an orgasm was nearly impossible :(  We raised my dosage to 112.5 mg/day and then after a few weeks we lowered back down to 75 mg(112.5 wasn't making a difference from the 75 mg)..However I was only surviving still instead of living. Finally about a month ago I decided that Effexor was not really working for me and I tapered off. I took 37.5 mg a day for 2 1/2 weeks and had no withdrawal symptoms besides the fact that I still had my anxiety(I guess not everyone gets them).

I have never been clinically depressed, but my pain clinic started me on Effexor to help with FMS.  I have taken it for 5 years now.  After the initial adjustment, I found that I slept more soundly and had more energy during my waking hours.  I'm not sure how much it's actually helping me now, but I do know that this medication can be hard to get off of.  I have no reason to want to quit taking it, but I know that if I miss more than 2 days I will get &quot;withdrawal&quot; symptoms - tingling sensations, pins and needles in my hands, lightheadedness, buzzing in my ears.  I think if I did decide to stop taking it I would have to wean it off over a month or 2, like when I started taking it only in reverse.

I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder over 8 years ago and I have been taking Effexor XR for 7 years and it saved my life. My doctor tried numerous anti-anxiety medications and this is the only one, aside from Xanax, that has worked. Effexor helps me live my day-to-day life with less worry and panic and far less paranoia than I used to experience, I have so much more confidence when facing the world. This medication is not good for directly treating panic attacks, it just helps in preventing them and subsiding daily worry. It may not work for everyone, - if your dose is too high it may make you jittery and agitated, if your dose is too low you may only get the negative side effects and not experience the anxiety reduction, but if you've tried several meds to no avail then give this one a go, and have your MD help with adjusting the right dosage for you. It has saved my life and my mind and kept me from losing my family to my own depression and anxiety!

I was placed on Effexor XR 150mg 3 weeks ago. After one week my doc upped the dosage to 300mg. After about 2 weeks of being on effexor, my depression not only failed to get better, but became progressively worse with every passing day until I tried to take my own life at 2.5 weeks. Along with the suicidal thoughts, I experienced rapid weight loss, decreased appetite (lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks) and terrible migraines. Went to doc with all of the negative information and he placed me on Zoloft. I have experienced a 180 degree turn around and feel better than I ever have. I am experiencing no side effects, and my apetite has returned to normal. Anxiety is still very often, but I take a .5mg Klonopin to help with that and it works like a charm. Effexor nearly made me take my own life, and I would never reccomend this for anyone.

I took effexor XR for approx 7 months.  I started low and worked up to 150 mg.  On the 150mg dose, I had daily problems with not being able to stay awake, and headaches/migraines.  I stepped back down and those side effects only occured when i forgot a dose, however, at 75 mg I was still having panic attacks and depressive episodes.  These combined with the high cost forced me to seek other treatment.

I started taking it after leaving the hospital for severe depepession.  There I was diagnosed with Fibro and put on Effexor.  I started at 150 mg and then went up to 225 mg.  I notice a huge difference now having been off the medication for a month, due to financial reasons.  Now I see that I can't afford to not be on this medication.  The only side effects were restless leg and drowsiness in the beginning.  I also had to force myself to eat as it took away any and all desire to.  For me, that was the a horrible thing.

after taking this drug for 2 years it now contrls my life. the brain shocks,nightmares,mucle spasms,errectile disfunction and unconrolled anger have drivin me insane. it has helped with my anexiety but it has put me into a state of depression i cant climb out of. it is the hardest task to try to come off these drugs and forget having sex while on them. The stress this medication brings in my opinion is not worth it. it has effected me my family and friends and if i didint have the good lord above looking over me i wouldnt have made it this far.

I took Zoloft for a few months for major depression. It helped very little and I felt tired and lethargic from it, plus stlill depressed. With Effexor I felt signifcantly better within a few days. Depression is gone, plusI have significantly more energy, motivation, and general sense of wellbeing than I have had in many years. I had alot of side effects witjh Zoloft but very little with Effexor. Just a bit of constipation, occasiolnal lightheadedness, excessive sweating. Compared  to the agony of depression the side effects are a small price to pay. I always take it on time so I wouldn't know about whtdrawal symtpoms, but I have every intention of takiing it on time.

I actually take Effexor as part of my chronic pain treatment regimen.  I take it 2x per day and find it easy on the system, overall.  Sometimes it makes me a little hyper, but that's the ADD in me...  I don't know how this is supposed to treat nerve pain, or how it works at all.  But if nothing else, I'm usually in a really good mood.  Even when I should be sad.  I guess that's a good thing.  So for depression, I do recommend it.

My doctor prescribed this medicine to me after trying a couple of others that eventually stopped working for me. I suggest not taking this medicine unless you can handle the side effects with ease. It made me feel awful from the get go. Upset stomach, headache, tired, aching body. Basically all I wanted to do was lay in bed because I felt awful. If you are on it I suggest not missing a dose cuz it is 10 times worse. I was on this for 2 months and then I had to be weaned off of it for 2 weeks. I always tell anyone who is switching meds to make sure their dr does not prescribe them this.

I've tried everything to treat my bipolar disorder type II.  I've read all of the bad raves about Efexor but have nothing BUT good to say about it.  So what if it affects my libido (sometimes), I'd rather be happy most of the time and sex is only a small part of my life anyway.  The worst side effect would be the sweating.  I do find it embarrassing, but cope by ensuring I always have a pretty handkerchief or face flannel with me wherever I go and by carrying a bottle of fresh water which also helps to cool me down.  If I forget to take my meds, I get a bit light-headed.  I too tend to sleep a lot but I can anticipate an attack of &quot;the tireds&quot; and try to gear my daily activities towards how I'm feeling at any given time.Overall, my condition itself is so debilitating BY itself that even a small help towards normality is better than nothing so a few side effects are a small price to pay.I love my &quot;happy pills&quot;!!

It really makes a difference in my overall wellbeing, however the side effects are sort of a pain... NO SEX DRIVE WHATSOEVER! Also, I have no trouble sleeping, if anything, I could sleep all day. Not sure if it's the meds or the depression. It did completely stop my daily crying spells and got me back to work!

Basically plateaued and hit my max with Lexapro - and I was switched to Effexor XR, at the initial dose of 75mg. Seems to work fine but there are nasty side effects if you slip off the med - the worst being is what several call &quot;The Head Shakes.&quot; Trust me, it's no fun. It has a quick wash-out perio\d, so stay on top of it. A few months back I had noticed the &quot;Head Creeps&quot; crawling in and complimented my 75mg with another 37.5mg, which has me at a daily dose of 112.5mg. Do the research...  this means I'm right in-between affecting the Serotonin-norepinephrine levels. It does well for me, as I compliment it with 2mg Klonopin and every other day with Betaseron (Beta is for my RRMS). For someone as unstable as I was - THIS IS A GODSEND (FOR NOW....??!)

Overall this has been a good treatment, especially considering that other medications either had no effect or produced facial ticks. For side effects I've had some dry mouth, and at the end of the work day if I'm sitting down at a lecture I'll fall asleep; then again maybe I'm not getting enough sleep! For any indications of constipation I always take 300mg Omega 3 and that makes it a lot easier. I'm taking 225mg/day. Unfortunately I have to pay for 2 prescriptions, e.g., 150 + 75, since there is no 225mg pill. This is extreme highway robbery on the part of the drug company and feel it should be their responsibility for absorbing the extra cost if they're not going to make my dosage in one pill. The drug lobby is strong and effective. They ply their congressmen with rich meals, trips, prostitutes, and other gifts, so the constituents end up paying for what the drug companies should.

Doesn't work for me. Kills libido. Forget having sex. Significantly raises my blood pressure. I have never taken a medication that helps with my depression, although I have been taking various meds and combinations of meds for over 40 years. In my case, meds are highly overated. Recent studies in conjunction with the FDA show that only 50% of depressed people are helped by meds.My next step is to try rTMS  or DBS or MRS Don't try VNS (Vagus Nerve Stimulation).  It is very low in efficacy, very expensive, requires invasive surgery, and may take up to two years to help, if at all. ECT will be my last option. It still has potential serious side effects (mild or severe memory loss, and becoming a zombie). ECT is the most effective treatment available for depression at this time. DBS offers more promise than ECT with less side effects, but is not FDA-approved for depression, and involves brain surgery.  I have given up on meds. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) may hold promise.

I take Effexor XR 75 for GAD - Generalized Anxiety Disorder and OCD. In the interest of full disclosure, I do have ADHD which contributes to these conditions. I previously took Prozac for GAD/OCD - it worked much better, but I was allergic to the medication. I have no had a panic attack, since the medication became effective. I have also noticed less OCD symptoms- no counting, no feeling of the need to run home and make sure everything is turned off.... but I agree with the previous poster - sweating - and hot flashes are an issue with this medication. Make sure you speak to your doctor and research this drug BEFORE you take it. It helps, but the hot flashes and night sweats are hell...

I've been taking Effexor XR for 4 months and am now taking 150mg.  My dose was stepped up 37.5mgs at a time &amp; was advised to step down the same way. Reading the other posts, it seems those with the most negative experiences are at or near the maximum dosage, so I'll try to avoid increasing if possible.  I have experienced some withdrawal with missed doses, causing dizziness &amp; nasty headaches.  The only other downside is nausea if I take the pills without a glass of milk, piece of toast, etc.  For me, the benefits far outweigh the side effects.  For the first time in 25 years I don't cry myself to sleep or beg God to take me home.  I don't have a continuous tape of failures and dread playing in my head.  But I can still FEEL.  I can still cry at sad movies, experience anger, and joy.  It just isn't a boulder on my chest all the time anymore.  While I still face some pretty crappy moments in life (as we all do), I'm much better equiped to live my life now.

Effexor is the only med I can stand, I suffer from all side effects of every med I've been on.  It does cause a raise in blood pressure at times, speeds up heartbeat.  Makes you feel like you've been run over by a mac truck.  Have no engery and always tired. Dr said all these med's work for most people but I'm the odd one, I get all the side effects of every med.  I have to choose the battle I can best handle, even though this one has more side effects.  Jump  at the sight of a shawdow, see things that arn't there. Blurred vision.  Everything I had before the med, but much better.  But after years of being on it, I feel like crap everyday

I feel it is effective,  I feel that Doctors need strict  and inforceable guidelines ( none of this 48 hr refill  time required  should apply) regaurding side effects, BEFORE being allowed to write a script. As great and effective as it may be , if i have know the effects of a missed or skipped dose, I do believe i never would have started it . I suggest  to anyone , try others first , the chance of  ever feeling the side  effect is not worth it!!!!!!!!!! it is HELL!

Effexor XR has been a very effective treatment for my depression-dominant bipolar II disorder.  I take 150 mg daily.  I have had recurring moderate to major depressive episodes for most of my life and I have tried many  antidepressants over the years.  Effexor XR has been by far the most helpful for me, and I find that it has not lost effectivity over time as many other meds have for me.  The side effects at the 150mg dose are quite manageable for me.  Persistent mild headache and tight jaw lasted for about the first month of taking it and then subsided.  I haven't had any sexual side effects unlike the SSRI's I have taken.  I get nauseated if I take my dose without food or with coffee, but this is MUCH more manageable with XR than it was when I took the non-time release Effexor.  I do get some dicontinuation side effects (vertigo, muscle twitching) if I miss even one dose, and on occasion I have missed two doses which made me feel very sick.

(I take 75mg/day for extreme mood swings/depression)I concur with the prior post that Effexor is very effective for serious, life-long mental health issues but should be considered very careful since it is virtually impossible to get off it.  I also have no side effects at all until I forget a dose - then I get the dreaded &quot;brain zaps&quot; (hard to describe, but feels like painful misfiring of neurons in your head), palpitations and acute panic.  While I'm very pleased with its effectiveness, I do wish I had been equipped with more information about the serious withdrawal issue before making the decision to try Effexor over alternate treatments.

When I first started this medication, after a few weeks I have to say that my worrying, and etc., was better. Now that I'm on my second rx for effexor xr, I have began to experience &quot;extreme&quot; sweating. It's terribly bothersome, and embarassing. My clothes are soaking, and it does no good to shower, thoough of course I still do!  I intend to call my doctor today, as I can no longer tolerate this particular side effect.

I finally tried Effexor after several other antidepressants.  With Effexor XR and psychotherapy I am happier than I ever dreamed I could be.  The only side effect I have is that I sometimes experience a kind of &quot;buzzing&quot; in my head.  This is mild and never interferes with whatever I'm doing.  The only annoyance with Effexor is that it must be taken with food or causes an upset stomach. This can be inconvenient since I prefer to take it first thing in the morning and last thing before bed.  I entend to continue to take Effexor into the future. I don't want a relapse of the terrible depression!

Don't start this med unless you are committed to it. The withdrawals will dog-done near make you wish you were DEAD. If you miss even a day or so of it it will make you very... VERY....sick. It is a med FOR LIFE..... not for the blues, ONLY for serious issues and to stay on....... forever; you don't want to go off this med... but it is the best med for bipolar issues ever; I've been on everything else already. NOTHING can do what this med can do for you....

I did not see the drug tramadol on the list, but it does wonders for my sleep and pain.

If I don't take it I'm awake at 4am and unable to get back to sleep. I've had no side effects except if I have more than 2 alcholic drinks my heart races. This isn't a big deal for me as I only drink the occasional glass of wine.
elavil	Fibromyalgia	2011-05-04 00:00:00		4.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	I have had no side effects to this medication, and find that it helps me to fall asleep and stay asleep for at least 1/2 the night at 50mg.  The 100mg dosage left me too groggy the next day.  My doc also prescribed flexeril 5mg (a muscle relaxer, and zoloft 50mg (an additional antidepressent), these three drugs seem to work most nights to allow me to get to sleep and stay asleep, but I still find that I am in pain in the early morning hours particularly in my shoulders, arms, and hands, making it difficult to fall back asleep.  He has also prescribed tramadol 50mg (a non-narcotic pain reliever) for the morning pain.  Tramadol is especially good for people with bowel disorders, as it is one of these easiest on the digestive system.

I spent 3 months going from my PCP, an ENT, and a Dentist.  I was diagnosed and treated for sinus infections, Eustacian tube disorder, and TMJ. None worked.  Finally my PCP tried the Elavil and found I was having chronic tension headaches.  I found relief in the first week.

Taking for GAD and it works wonders.  It raised my blood pressure and heart rate so I stopped taking it and tried other medications.   I found I had elevated heart rate and blood pressure even without medications.  The Dr. put me on propranolol and my blood pressure is now normal.  SSRIs, Buspar, Trazodone did not work so I went back on Elavil and it works wonders.  It also reduces my tinnitus (ringing in my ear)

I have used Elavil for about two years, on and off. I was prescribed this medication for a condition called Cluster headaches. Well this medicine worked like a miracle, the next morning after taking the Evail I didn’t have a migraine and I had been having them like clockwork for about two weeks!! Although this is an anti-depressant, (I wasn’t depressed,) this medicine did boost my moods and made me feel much better throughout the day. This medicine has been claimed to make some people gain weight but I work out at least three to four times a week and have not gained any weight. Works wonders and if you eat healthy and work out you shouldn’t see that drastic weight gain that everyone mentions!

I was proscribed this drug in the early 80's for severe depression. I know now that I was suffering from BPD. While on Elavil, my symptoms got worse, including psychotic episodes, and I only stopped using the drug after a failed suicide attempt - an overdose of Elavil - that landed me in the emergency room and a mental hospital for 2 weeks. I am shocked to be reading that I should not have been proscribed this drug and that I was misdiagnosed at that time.

I started on 10mg/day of generic Elavil (amytriptyline) at bedtime and felt the effects almost immediately. The first couple of days I did feel the drowsy side effects but they wore off soon. Now I sleep much better than I have in a decade. I don't wake up feeling like I got run over by a truck. As for pain... it hasn't taken my pain down too noticeably, but my main complaint with FMS has always been fatigue. Elavil has helped with that significantly. Definitely try this before the other treatments out there since it is so inexpensive.

I had horrible side effects including rapid weight gain, severe migraines to the point of having to go to the hospital, My hair would fall out in huge clumps.  Now, when I speak of weight gain - let me also add that I was so nauseous that I barely ate anything.  But, in the year that I was on Elavil I gained over 100 pounds in 8 months!  And, it did not help my fibro at all.  I stuck with it for another 6 months after that out of sheer desperation hoping that it would work and the side effects would lessen but, it never did.

This was a disaster for me. The only way that I can sleep is  with 3 mg of Lunesta each night. My gastroenterologisr suggested that I try Elavil as a substutiute. I slept abouit 3 hours that night. Then he suggested that I take both of  of them, with simialar results.

Amitriptylline for early-morning insomnia in menopause About 2 years before menopause, I started waking between 3:00 and 4:00 AM and not being able to get back to sleep.  It was a long-term problem, happened in times of no stress, clearly related to menopause, my doctor and I think.  Estrogen did not work, short trials of temazepam did not work, Benadryl taken in the night stopped working. None of the self-care relaxation tecniques worked. I found that most advice to the sleepless is for people who sometimes can't get to sleep, not for people who wake up too soon every night. Amitriptylline has worked like a charm. It is safe to take for an extended period--I've been taking it for over 10 years and have actually decreased the dose since first taking it.  I did have the side effect of fainting, twice in the first month.  After that I have had no problems at all, including no weight gain.

Amitriptyline When first begin you feel very tired all the time.  That does wear off.  Most people I know gainweight, I did!  I did sleep well on the medication.  I am now on Xanax which works much better and I can take during the daytime for anxiety as well asbedtime to  help me relax for a good nights sleep.

Side Effects sent me to the Emergency Room Because of Elavil's constipating effect (dr advised taking nothing for constipation)----at age of 55 I went to the ER with a burst appendix.  They took 10 hours to admit me and do massive emergency operation [gangrene abdomen] and said they just barely saved my life.  They jerked me off Elavil cold turkey and I never slept again, not for weeks, not until I had a psychotic break [my first] and had to go into a mental hospital for a week.

Good for more than depression I originally started amitriptyline at a dosage that wasn't theraputic for mental disorders, as a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome.  Since it worked well for that, my shrink at the time just increased my dose and made it my main anti-depressant, although I eventually switched to the related nortriptyline.  SSRIs have never done a thing for me,  I have had much more success with TCIs.  I did have dry mouth, difficulty swallowing and constipation - but I have for the past 10+ years - I generally take from 7-11 different prescription meds every day, for mental, gastroenterological, sleep, and biochemical disorders, so who really knows which drug is causing which side affect, unless something new happens with a brand new med.  I would recommend this, and nortriptyline, particularly to those with gastric problems.

Better for other uses than insomnia This med worked very well for me, because I was taking it for 3 reasons - insomnia, bipolar II and Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  I originally took it for insomnia, but it didn't work well enough for me.  However, my internist kept me on it because it helps with IBS, at a lower dose than needed for sleep or bipolar disorder.  Eventually I started taking therapuetic doses for bipolar, so it was helping three illnesses at once.  I've since switched to nortriptyline, which is a better antidepressent for me.  The dates up top are completely made up because I have severe memory problems, and I have no idea when it was that I took amitriptyline!

I am super sensitive to meds to begin with so why he thought for a minute I could tolerate a TCA I haven't a clue.  Probably b/c I've been through all the SSRI's and mood stabilizers.I slept for about 16 hours straight the first day.  Had an insatiable craving for junk food, especially sweets which I ate and then went back to bed.  I was lethargic all day, didn't shower for about 5 days b/c I had NO energy, had decrease in motivation for anything but sleeping and eating, and the worst of it was I felt my heart was going to beat out of my chest.  I even dropped the dosage from 25mg to 12.5mg then to 6mg.  The palpitations lessened but didn't go away.  My chest on day 4 actually hurt when I exhaled.  Not for me.  My pdoc will be pissed b/c I couldn't tolerate this med but he'll get over it, I just hope my heart does.

Child-onset insomnia is hell! I suffered for years until my doctor put me on amitriptyline. I started on 50 mg and switched to 100 a couple years later. I've stayed at 100 and it is still working. I usually drop off so suddenly, in the morning, I can't remember falling asleep.

PLEASE READ THIS ESSENTIAL INFORMATION Using Amitriptyline is an essential part of the treatment of M.E. and F.M.S. whilst no other treatment and little understanding for these conditions exists.I know it knocks us out.  That's fine, that's how it works in assisting our healing and you must give in to your condition and use Amitrip. or you stand absolutely no chance of getting well.The secret is........ DO NOT USE IT EVERY DAY.  Other than knocking me out, it causes me (for example) to be detached from my feelings (is this how it controls muscle pain?) and I become quite frustrated thus, not in touch with myself which is not healthy or satisfying in any way and I eventually become quite nasty.  It also causes me to have heart palpitations.  I know others experience the same.Use only 10mg or 25mg nightly.  Use during initial onset, when symptoms are at their worst, during flare ups/relapse and rest 'entirely'.  Do not try to be active during the days your are taking Amitriptyline treament (knock out) as you will do more harm (than good) and allow a day or two for recovery, when you come off it, before trying to be active again. M.E. is a very serious and highly debilitating condition and you MUST give in to the need for rest and knock yourself/your muscles out in this way.  You are not able to work.  You will do yourself 'serious', long term damage, never recover your intelligence, pride, self respect, i.e. never get well.  Sorry.  Also, if you are not yet in pain from M.E., you will be if you do not act now.  The 'discomfort' you are feeling now is likely to develop into agonising pain which is very difficult to control.  There is no 'official' relief from this pain, so please act now and put yourself into your own intensive care program.I was using Amitriptyline for 3 nights per week, resting for 5 days initially, every week.  Then I reduced to 2 nights and 4 days of rest.  This progressed to ocassional use of what I call 'knock out' and now it is e

Hope I took Topamax for 6 month and it didn't work for me. Now my neurologist put me on Amitriptlyne.  It seem to work, i almost didn't have any migraine for 2 months except for when i have my period.  However this last week it started again, i have a migraine for 6 days in a row and it didn't stop yet.  So that might be the end of this treatment.  I Hope not cause i had 2 great months. But there is some side effects like being sleepy all the time, weight gain and lot of appetite but it's not that bad if it works for the migraine... The Hope is gone i have the migraine back now 3 weeks in a row and those are very painful.  My neurologist belived that this medecine is no longer working.  So again i switch to valproic acid let's see if it works..

Best If Used Occasionally Amitriptyline will work quite effectively but has several unpleasant side effects (constipation,weight gain, decreased libido, dizziness after getting up suddenly). Most of these side effects disappeared after I stopped taking it nightly. Since cutting back my dose from 50mg a night  to 10mg a few times a week I have lost almost 15lbs. so the weight gain part can really sneak up on you. Amitriptyline or its cousin doxepin can both be great sedatives but should only be used occasionally.

Amitriptyline for anxiety ? I was prescribed to take 28 mg pill of Amitriptyline for night. I have this combined with SSRI (paxil) and alprazolam (Xanax-like) for anxiety. I like to take Amitrip. for night (it's sedating and it gives me good sleep) but I don't like waking up then that much. I wake up anxious, shaky and little confused(which might not be the effect of the drug), and I have problems to focus my eyes a little, and then I have bit more blurred vision in a day. And dry mouth. I'm sceptical about effects of Amitriptyline on treating anxiety.

This was a great experience I went again to the doctor about a migrane that had been going on for 6 days. I take zomig with tylnol and that was not working. He has told me repeatedly that he has done every test and they are negative. He said to try amitriptyline at 10mg at bedtime for a month to see if it helps. And by crickets it worked, not only that after a week my daily headaches where all but gone. I felt good in the morning and I am happier. My husband said that I was even more relaxed. I still took Zomig for my migranes but it was more effective.Now 3months since I stopped taking it my daily headaches have returned and I am really lagging in the morning. I,d like to try them agian when my physician returns form holidays.

Did not work for me Amitriptyline simply did not work. I was to take one x 25mg at bedtime to aid sleep, I continued to wake and get up as usual at night.The worst side effect was the following day. I would take my son to school return by 0930, sit down on the settee and not get back up until 1300.  During that time I would wake every 10 to 20 mins and try very hard to get up but I just kept failing.  After 10 days of this I contacted the GP who agreed that I should stop the Amitriptyline.  I returned to some bearable normality soon after.  About 9 months later I had an interview at a residential pain management clinic to assess my suitability for the 3 week residential course and when I told the Dr who assessed my suitability that I only took Amitriptyline for 10 days he was quite angry with me and said that it takes a month to get into the system.I think he should try living with the inability to move after sitting down.  However he did recommend me to attend the residential pain management programme. But thats another story.

A case for TCAs as opposed to SSRIs My illness started out as straight depression for many years.  It presented as Bipolar I Disorder in March of 2004.The SSRIs tend to have a paradoxical effect on me.  For instance, Prozac and Buspar make me more agitated rather than less.I've always had success with Elavil, and we are talking years here.  Most psychiatrists won't prescribe it now, but I am going to talk to mine about switching to it.

Just average I have severe insomnia due to CFS and this drug just didn't make the cut. There were side effects to start off with, mainly general groggyness, but they wore off quickly. It took about 2 weeks for it two start working but would only give me five hours sleep. When first taken it would hype me up then exactly five hours after taking it I would fall asleep easily.If I took over 25mg it made me wake up at 1/2hr intervals all night long thus not giving a very restful sleep.So as I said just average.

It is effective if you don''t mind the weight gain I stopped it because I gained 40 pounds on it almost overnight.  And I was showing signs of liver damage from the medication.  Make sure you get your lipids checked every three months!

Dead sleepy, but... This med made me very tired, almost bumping into walls with 2 (50Mg) doses. But found that I would wake up 6-8 times a night. It was easy to fall back to sleep, but the sleep didn't feel restful. Tried it three separate times for 3 days in a row, but always the same result.

Crossing my fingers...so far... some relief. Hmmm. I'm not sure what to write. I've been on this drug for a few months now, and the frequency of my ER visits have decreased dramatically. (A definite positive!) I still have nasty migraines- sometimes as many as 2/week. However, this is better than when I could count on having at least 2 a week, and maybe more.As for side effects: I went up to 50mg/day, but had sleep problems, even if the dose was split evenly between morning and evening. If I take that full dose at night, I'm up all night. If I took it in the morning, I would fall asleep. So, my neuro reduced my dose to 35mg- a 25 and a 10 mg tablet- there's no hope that you're gonna be able to cut those 25 mg tablets in half! This increases my cost to $20 a month vs. what a single copay would be for a larger amount of either tablet alone.So, I guess this is a &quot;Some good, so far&quot; review. We'll see how it does when we try to add other agents to this medication.

Elavil used for Pain The elavil is helping with the pain I have been experiencing.  I have noticed that towards the end of the day, I have more pain.  Don't know if this is from the previous days dosage wearing off, or if pain is just worse at that time.  Only side effect I see is that I sleep deeper and go to sleep faster.

side effects, dizziness It helped a bit with anxiety and sleep but also caused my dizziness to worsen so I stopped taking it after 1 month. Also caused a slight bitter taste in mouth and reduction of overall taste which isn't good because I ate less.

Elavil (amitriptyline) for arthritis pain I began Elavil 14 years ago when I went to the Arthritis Foundation in Southfield, MI. I was somewhat depressed because of  all over joint pain I was much, much better on Elavil but then I moved across country to a small town with few doctors - to sum up my story - I saw a PA who felt I should go off Elavil and try the newer SSRIs for &quot;low mood&quot;. That was three weeks ago and I have been feeling very bad, all my joints aching, broken sleep, no energy - and it suddenly dawned on me today why! I'd been on Elavil for 14 years (50 mg. at night) and to abruptly go off it was a bad idea. I cannot get in to see a doctor for two weeks so tomorrow I am going to the ER and hopefully will get help for this. I am glad to have found Remedy Find. Mitzigal

Too many side effects It helped me not have headaches (my main problem with Fibro) as severe as before I began taking it, but as the effectiveness would wear off after awhile and the dosage would be increased.  Over time I got up to 100mg/day and I wondered why I could not seem to wake or up function in the morning.  I was like a walking zombie, it caused severe Restless Leg Syndrome and weight gain.  I occassionally take one now for severe headaches and I sleep at least 24 hours, experience RLS EVERY time I take it and am hung over for at least 2 days. I wonder now how I ever functioned on 100 mg a day for as long as I did (and not loose my job!)

A godsend This drug does not help me to fall asleep, but helps to keep me asleep (particularly after a nighttime visit to the bathroom).  I have cut my dosage back to 5mg per night, but still find that I wake up and can't fall back asleep if I forget to take it.  Hard to shake it.

THIS MEDICATION WAS HORRIBLE FOR ME! I was prescribed Elavil about 6 months ago for sleep. I had chronic insomnia. It caused me to have nightmares, vivid dreams, and weight gain. I gained about 10 pounds within a couple of months. I have just come off of the medication this week and I can't sleep at all. I felt that it helped me to fall asleep but did not increase my quality of sleep. I wish I had never taken this medication. Its awful.

Works for Me! I was prescribed Amitriptyline in 1996 for sleep problems and muscle pain, which at the time I didn't know were caused by Fibromyalgia.  Within a few weeks I noticed that I was sleeping much better and my muscle pain was much less.   I tried to stop taking it a month ago as I wondered if I could cope without it,  but my muscle pain is returning and I find I wake up very easily during the night, finding it difficult to get back to sleep.  So I am going to start taking it again from tonight!   Unlike many other contributors to this website, I experienced no weight gain whatsoever.  I do get a dry mouth but that is gone by morning.  No other side effects that I know of.

Great! Well my doctor decided to let me try this because i have been in so much chronic pain so we started out on a low dose. But the problem with the medication is that it causes constipation which i have major colon issues. I used it for a month and then he said to stop taking it so i did and then i couldnt sleep so i used it sparingly. Went to my gi and they put me on a higher dose of the medication. i went from 10 to 25 everyday which caused me horrible headaches and then i was depressed within a week. So i went back to my pcp and he made me drop the dosage back to ten but we increased my anxiety medication, SO FAR SO GOOD, its been about a week and i felt 90% better within a couple of days. What a difference!

Elavil saved me I started Elavil in September of '04 after a terrible 'bout with anxiety and depression that left me sleepless for days, exhausted and literally crying every 20 minutes.  My doctor prescribed me 10mg of Elavil for the long haul (and Ambien initially which doesn't work well for me) and I've never slept better in my life.  I've been taking it for 2 years and I still sleep deeper than I have though I feel like the Elavil doesn't work quiet as well now.  10mg is a very low dosage, my Dr. has recommened uping it to 20mg-30mg at night before bed.  The only side effect I had was dizziness (the first night and then it went away) and feeling like I forgot how to urinate (it never stopped me though).  The urination thing was actually welcomed because I used to get up 2 - 3 times a night.  Now I just get up in the morning.

Very helpful if you can tolerate it! This is the first drug I recommend for anyone w/FM. I really credit it with my Fibro not getting any worse than it is, with helping my pain tolerance level, and keeping lack of sleep from being the huge problem it is for many Fibro patients. The only problem is that probably 50% of people can't tolerate it. The only annoying side-effect for me is dry mouth. It doesn't make me as sleepy as it used to, but I know it still gets me to the right level of sleep. (I've been taking it for over 2 years. I recently found that 400-800mg of Magnesium taken at bedtime seems to help bring on that &quot;sleepy&quot; feeling.)**Update**I got on an ill-conceived &quot;try and get off as many drugs as possible&quot; kick and tried to stop taking Elavil. It was then that I again became aware of what a great drug this is for Fibro. It helps my quality of sleep immensely! W/o it I couldn't sleep for days on end, and when I did I'd wake up a million times througout the night!If you can't take this, then do try some kind of anti-depressant to regulate your sleep, it will help tons.

YUCK! The doctor gave me this for major depression and anxiety. I have not taken it long enough to guage its efectiveness, but the side effects are intollerable. I feel as if I have been mildly poisoned: like the combined effects of a mild alcohol hangover with the aftereffects of LSD. (nausea, headache, eyeballs hurt, cant think straight, weakness, stomache cramps, dizzyness) I have also had both suicidal and homicidal(!?) thoughts. I have been unable to accomplish anything but the simplest tasks. Mostly I am able to watch TV, thats aboput it. I might be able to get past this eventually, but for now all I can think is that life like this is simply not worth living. SInce this is one of the first meds I have tried , I will have my doctor switch to something else.

Elavil etc Elavil was the worst medication I have ever taken. Not only did I gain weight, I was more depressed than when I started and it did absolutly nothing for my pain. Anyone I know who is on Elavil, I tell them to have their doctor wean them off of it as soon as possible. It was the worst!! The side effects are horrible. I had horrible nightmares and I would get sleep paralysis.  Or I would wake up hearing screaming, only to realize it was me.  This medication is awful and in my opinion, it's worthless!

Helped Fall Asleep But Bad Side Effects Amitriptyline helped me fall asleep. However, the side effects of grogginess during the day and dry mouth were not pleasant. I believe I also had nightmares under the medication. It was inexpensive (at least in the States), so it was at least worth a try.

helps sleep, but make you hungry I loved this med in the beginning.  After a few days of taking it I was sleeping through the night (where normally i was up using the bathroom 4 + times a night).  But I was hungry all the time.  I was on a strict diet and my boyfriend's a personal trainer so I was exercising all the time.  I just couldn't understand why I wasn't losing the weight.  Tah-dah, it's was elavil that was making me hungry all day and night!  For me it's not worth it, i'll try something else!!!

Warning: heart palpitations UPDATE Jun 2006. I am stopping this med. I had noticed upon waking up in the middle of the night to urinate, that when I stood up my heart appeared to be racing at an impossibly fast speed. I am reasonably young and atheletic so this is strange. I thought nothing of it until my new p-doc asked if I'd had an EKG prior to using amitrypiline. She said that it can cause conduction abnormalities in the heart. I stopped using it and the heart palpitations have ceased. Unfortunately, I will now have to try another strategy for sleep maintenance.days 1-2i've been using amitriptyline for 2 nights, and it seems good so far. i have slept well, for ~8 hours, with dreams. there were a few disturbances in the night, but i was able to go right back to sleep. this is in contrast to ambien or benzos, where if i wake up, i often need to take more to get back to sleep. woke up feeling normal. no side effects that i can identify yet. mood is good, probably thanks to the good sleep. seems promising!note that i am also taking lexapro 15 mg each morning.day 3still sleeping ~8 hours with elavil. however, i've noticed i tend to have some pretty intense, sort of stressful dreams. not quite nightmares. this may be due to simply being stressed out, and more aware of my dreams since i'm not taking any benzos. wake up feeling basically good.days 4-6seems like elavil is working well for me. compared to other sleep meds, seems like it doesn't force me to sleep, just allows me to sleep. i can more easily transition from waking to sleep, and back. so if something occurs in the night, it may wake me up, but i can easily get back to sleep without sparing it a thought. if i wake up to early in the am, if i just lie there, i might even catch another hour or two. this is in contrast to benzos or ambien, where if i wake, i'm up, like it or not. also don't notice any after-effects the next morning. can't name a single side effect. it's possible it may

If you like hallucinations - walking zombie How I ever drove to work on this stuff I will never know - I may have already written a review on this med...Hallucinated at night (pretty colorful moving kaleidoscopes floating in the air) - even faint hallucinating (of the same type) during a work meeting while I was trying not to fall asleep. Again, like Remeron, this med packs a punch - perhaps it works, but at what cost?

Hallucinations/Zombie Same review as a few others: hallucinations at night time - after 2 to 3 days of use - I do not remember the dosage, but PDoc always pushed....When I called at 11 pm to say I was hallucinating and seeing kalidascope things....I was told, that that can be a side affect and most of my patients like that.  I have not been diagnosed with bipolar disorder but seem to fall into that spectrum - for me, PMDD, panic, depression - xanax works best for me as needed - I am now switching over to klonopin to smooth out the drop outs of xanax - it is smoother - longer acting without the the rebound - I still take xanac as needed. Hope this helps...needless to say - I dropped Elavil - hallucinated during the day during work meetings as well - god only knows how I drove my car to work without wrecking myself or others...Meds for

Very bad reaction The first week of taking this, I could not seem to make myself wake up in the mornings.  It took me a couple of hours before I felt like my brain ever engaged and I was so tired all day long.  I was advised to try it at least for a month before deciding.  The second week, my symptoms began getting worse than before I started taking it.  I called and told the doctor that it was making me feel much worse, but they still recommended I give it a full month because it does work well for so many people.  Being the obedient person that I am, and trying to conform to the doctors wishes, I continued to take it.  By the end of the month, I could no longer sleep and still haven't gotten over that part yet (2 months after stopping) but the worsening of symptoms is finally starting to taper off some.  It really was not a good choice for me, but I understand that it has had some very beneficial effects for others.

Amitryptiline Significance?? I was put on amitryptiline about 2 months ahead of my starting to usw elmiron for my IC. I only continue to take it out of habit and it is not costing me very much for each month at the pharmacy. Basically, am toying with the idea of discontinuing use because I'm not sure what its doing for me at this point..I owe most of my treatment success for my IC to elmiron instead.

the worst ever elevil is a tricyclic antidepressant. that is a group of drugs that is known to RLSer's as poison. About 90% of people that take it, it makes their RLS worse. when I say worse, mine was so bad that I could have walked off a cliff very easily.

Excellent This was my first use of an anti-depressant.  It made me sleepy when I first started using it.  I was utterly cured by it.  Very effective.  No side effects.  However, I was given the medication again for a later supposed depression, which was a hypomanic state instead, and the Elavil flipped me into a severe mania.  The doctors wouldn't give it to me again, even though what happened is a textbook doctor error.

Worked great for 3 months I used 1.5 tablets (37.5 mg) of amitriptyline each night for about 3 months.  Got excellent, normal sleep with no observed side effects. [Except that the first couple of nights I used it I woke up feeling very groggy.  But that effect disappeared completely by the third night.] Then one night it just stopped working.  I increased the dosage to 50 mg. but without any result.  As I was unwilling to go to a higher dosage, I stopped using it entirely.  However, I intend to try it again after a couple more months.  The initial results were so good that it's defintely worth another try. If I could get it to work 3 months out of every 6, I'd be halfway to solving my insomnia problem.  37.5 mg is a comparatively low dosage (my psychiatrist regards 25 mg. as a &quot;pediatric dose&quot;) so I think it's reasonably safe.  It's also very very inexpensive.

Excellent!~ Was on it previously for many years (125 mg), discontinuing one year ago.  Resumed in january of this year at 75 mg. and it has worked extremely well. I thank God for this because nothing else was working and I was becoming increasingly depressed and suicidal.  I will increase dosage if necessary but 75 mg seems to be working quite well now.  On occasions when I am in really bad shape and the amytriptaline does not work, I supplement it with .5 mg of Ativan. Only side effects are slight weight gain and abdominal bloating but well worth it!

Great help I take three 25mg tablets at night (75 mg total) for sleep.  I have trouble falling asleep and then staying asleep.  This drug helps me not to wake up constantly throughout the night.  I can tell it works because if I forget to take the medicine I wake up off and on all night.  I usually do not realize I forgot until the next morning and then I realize I also had a rotten night of sleep.  I probably will be on this drug forever.  It also helps me not to have so many PTSD dreams.The only complaint I have is I have gained 60 lbs.  I am not sure how much of that is my fault and what part is Elavil (or Effexor).

So-So    I took Elavil a long time ago.  I suppose it improved my depression a little.  I noticed dry eyes, excess energy in aerobics class.  I took it at night and it made me oversleep.  No one told me to take it earlier in the day to prevent oversleeping.  I lost my job due to tardiness and never recovered the same level of work and went on SSDI in 1986.  I also had a diagnosis for mononucleosis at the time.  I did not notice weight gain from Elavil.     I reduced the dosage to save money.  I finally quit in 1987.  I probably had not slept well for 10 years, even with Elavil.  I started taking a 50 mg multi B-vitamin and finally started to get some improvement on depression.  I attributed this to the B-vitamin and stopping birth control pills, which block B-vitamins, tai chi exercise.     Tricyclics are prescribed at low dose for improved sleep, which should reduce pain.  I read that Flexaril is an offshoot of tricyclics.  I presume there would be remodeling of keys and keyholes in the nervous system with long term use of any psychiatric drug.     I do not recall relief from depression with Elavil.  I was even more depressed about losing my job, not having money, etc.

Dopey at first, felt great after 2 weeks I took amitriptyline for about a year about 10 years ago; I was really quite down at the time, and was suffering from insomnia, anxiety, bad dreams, moods, etc. After taking it the first night, I felt like I had a headful of treacle and was walking under water. That went away after a few days, and after two weeks, I had an &quot;epiphany&quot; moment, when I suddenly saw &quot;clear&quot; for the first time in a long time. At the same time, my anxiety and insomnia disappeared). This worked well for me for a year and then I naturally decreased and stopped with no side-effects. As to long-term efficacy, I'm now on Remeron, so...The fact that it was generic and therefore extremely cheap was also in its favour.

Helps with pain I had a really hard time when I ran out of this.  I was in pain, and it was hard to sleep.  This does help with the pain a lot, but I still have to take other things for pain occasionally.  This helps me sleep, but too much makes me groggy for the next day.

Sleepyhead I was prescribed 10mg/day at night and boy did it knock me out!  At first it wasn't too bad, after 5 days I noticed I had a hard time getting out of bed, by day 10 it was impossible and I was missing my morning class and late to work.  My sis-in-law had a terrible reaction to this - the complete opposite - up all night and horribly depressed all day.  Don't be afraid to stop it if you can't handle it - after all the cure shouldn't be worse than the disease.

At first, it was heaven! Then a downward spiral. I slooooowly titrated up from 10mg per day to 50mg per day. At around 40mg nightly, I had a 6 week complete remission from my FMS symptoms! Then, the pain started coming back. How disappointing. It definitely helped A LOT with regulating my sleep and helping me get more restful slumber. However, the downside was I couldn't keep my eyes open past 2pm. In addition, it made me have SUGAR CRAVINGS so intense that I gained a lot of weight. The worst part was that when I tried to get off it, I started having panic attacks and was diagnosed with seratonin withdrawal. So I'm still on it, tapering off 5mg at a time and hoping I don't get so messed up from it. I just want it out of my system already!

Good results I have used amitriptyline for more than 10 years without any ill effects. I take 1/2 of a 25mg pill if I wake up (usually needing to pee) with 2-3 hours of sleep time left before my alarm is to go off during the work week. I take a complete 25mg pill if I wake up with 4+ hours left before the alarm goes off.Its effectiveness and my need to use it are directly related to the severity of the depressive situations that drift in and out of my life.Most of the time, my depressing situations are relatively mild.  At those times, I find that I can boost my sleep time by about one hour.  That might give me 6 to 6.5 hours, instead of 5 to 5.5 hours.On the rare occasions when the situation is severe, I have taken 50mg, with good or fair results.

No help for FMS This didn't have any effect on my fibromyalgia, which was quite bad at the time. It did help my depression to some extent but, looking back on it, it was not worth the side effects. The worst was dry mouth--to the point where I had dental and gum problems and difficulty speaking sometimes.

Excellent for sleep and major depression For me (of all the meds I have used) Elavil is the ultimate feel-good medicine.I used it alone,and with tegretol,For 9years. My mood was good most of the time,and had little anxiety.I had extreme dry mouth(which I learned to live with.I slept like Rip Van winkle. However I gained almost 50 pounds,and became an insatiable sweets junkie.The generic pill is dirt-cheap.I still take 50mg occasionally for sleep but my depression has never responded to anything as well since.

Elavil I have stopped taking this medicine for depression and anxiety-after considerable drying out to the thinner tissues in my body!!!  Also it caused me to have too much constipation!  Also once off of it my orgasms returned to normal, I was unable to have them while on this medicine at times.  Also all the drying out in my eyes and sinuses seemed to normalize.  Also now that I am off of it my brain seems to be on a more even keel also and my full range of emotions have returned I was very NUMB while on this.  NO EMOTIONS AT ALL!  I will never take it again unless severity of my depression requires it.  I am happily back on my NATURAL ST. JOHN'S WORT and will stay with that natural therapy that I was on for many years prior to ever taking this. The St. John's Wart works for me!  Also my vaginal tissues and rectal tissues that dried out so bad have returned to normal also so be careful with this one folks!  It impacts us all differently!!!  MY prior review is below it did work well for a while----I have been on this about a month or so thus far. There are some side effects, but they are very beneficial to me.  I sleep better, my anxiety levels are down, my restless leg syndrome at night is gone, my tummy no longer cramps or hurts off and on all the time.  I seem to be more at peace when I eat. And the Elavil also helps my depression which I strongly think is directly connected to my pain and anxiety from I.B.S. SO thank GOD for this med! Finally some RELIEF! It does constipate you though and you do have to increase your fluid intake.  It has also helped me to decrease in the area of not having as many have leaks from my bladder anymore imagine that! And the bloating has also gone down! Best Wishes...Oct 28, 2005 am still taking the Elavil for many things, I.B.S., depression, insomina, restless leg syndrome, and anxiety and worry,  it works for all of them.  Noted improvement in anxiety reductions and worry a lot less now than ever.  Very much worth it to

Elavil for I.B.S. I have stoppped taking this due to thin tissues areas in my body drying out way too badly! Once I stopped taking it these areas greatly improved. Also my gastroentrologist put me on a new drug called Pamine Forte that I take twice a day and it really has helped my IBS tremedously! So anyone with IBS might want to check it out it has made huge differences with me! Pain level wise/cramp wise --diarreah no more, and digestive wise too no pain!  Talk about wonderful!  So I will not take this again unless my IBS symptoms are severe enough to warrant it, just too many side effects for me with it...especially in the drying out area! My eyes, sinuses, and vaginal tissues, skin and rectal tissues all were severely impacted. Even though I drank tons of water...I take a B stress supplement off and on for anxiety now, so this has helped a lot too with some Vit C in lower doses for better absorbtion levels with the B Stress, ...Also took some hyalauronic acid to help my thin skin tissue areas of my body heal and it worked great found it at Wal Mart great price too and worked to help my thin tissue areas heal in several weeks took it daily with food! I seem to feel better elimation wise off of the Elavil also...and my liver enzyme levels I am sure will be returning to normal too! But am taking Artichoke Leaf Extract to help repair any Liver damage this med may have caused also..I also found a fiber supplement called Fiber Choice in Orange Chewable tablets at Wal-Mart that help me to stay clear of diarreah too for those who might be interested.  So many of the fiber supplements I was allergic to and I could not take--this is the very first I have ever taken in my life that did not give me diarreah! .Just be careful with this Elavil folks!

Finally some RELIEF! It does constipate you though and you do have to increase your fluid intake.  It has also helped me to decrease in the area of not having as many have leaks from my bladder anymore imagine that! And the bloating has also gone down! Best Wishes...Oct 28, 2005 am still taking the Elavil for many things, I.B.D., depression, insomina, restless leg syndrome, and anxiety and worry,  it works for all of them.  Noted improvement in anxiety reductions and worry a lot less now than ever.  Very much worth it to
elavil	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)	2006-04-19 00:00:00		0.0	0.0	5.0	0.5	Elavil I have stopped taking this medicine for depression and anxiety-after considerable drying out to the thinner tissues in my body!!!  Also it caused me to have too much constipation!  Also once off of it my orgasms returned to normal, I was unable to have them while on this medicine at times.  Also all the drying out in my eyes and sinuses seemed to normalize.  Also now that I am off of it my brain seems to be on a more even keel also and my full range of emotions have returned I was very NUMB while on this.  NO EMOTIONS AT ALL!  I will never take it again unless severity of my depression requires it.  I am happily back on my NATURAL ST. JOHN'S WORT and will stay with that natural therapy that I was on for many years prior to ever taking this. The St. John's Wart works for me!  Also my vaginal tissues and rectal tissues that dried out so bad have returned to normal also so be careful with this one folks!  It impacts us all differently!!!  MY prior review is below it did work well for a while----I have been on this about a month or so thus far. There are some side effects, but they are very beneficial to me.  I sleep better, my anxiety levels are down, my restless leg syndrome at night is gone, my tummy no longer cramps or hurts off and on all the time.  I seem to be more at peace when I eat. And the Elavil also helps my depression which I strongly think is directly connected to my pain and anxiety from I.B.S. SO thank GOD for this med!

GREAT for pain, but side effects were tough Elavil was given to me for pain immediately upon diagnosis of IC.  It worked, even at the lowest dosage (10 mg) for pain, within a day.  That was great.  But then, I found I could not go to the bathroom!  With IC that was extremely painful.  So I had to quit Elavil, which was a disappointment.  Everyone with IC should try it.  It really works with pain, and its nonaddictive.

Helps with sleep I've been taking amitryptiline for almost 15 years and find it to be very helpful in helping me to get the deep sleep I need.  I take it at bedtime, and can usually count on 8 hours sleep from the time I take it.  The dr. first put me on 50mg per night, which was far too strong!  So I got it down to 20-30mg per night, depending on the stress level of my day.  When I wake up in the night to go to the bathroom, I can go back to bed and fall right back to sleep.  mOn the very few occasions that I've forgotten to take it, or been unable to (away from home), my night was noticably more miserable.  I've added a 50mg capsule of 5-HTP in the last year, and find that it gives it an added boost.  My dr. has told me that the amitryptiline is also helpful in migraine treatment, so I keep taking it.  The worst side effect is probably weight gain, though it hasn't been over 10 pounds and I've been at the same level now for several years.  At my age (70) I count it as insulation against the winter cold, and insurance in case of illness!  On the few occasions when I've popped in my bedtime pills instead of my morning meds (due to fibrofog), I've had a very slow day!

I was elated to find a drug that finally worked I found amitriptyline to work great for my ibs, my doctors before have tried every drug to get me some relief, my pain was severe and at one point they had me on percocet and tylenol 3's, to keep my pain undercontrol, with these drugs I could not function during the day and was unable to work, it was frustrating, I was placed on dicetel, which was a total waste of money. So when my doctor in Calgary suggested this drug, I thought what could it hurt and within a month the pain was reduced and since the pain used to wake me up nights and was the worse during the night, that was when I took amitriptyline just before bed and was able to make it through the night without waking up. I not saying I am pain free, I have bad days, but they are fewer and not as severe as before. In my eyes this drug is a miracle drug, I suffered for years and never thought any drug would work for me. I bless my doctor every day for suggesting this treatment for my ibs. As for the side effects, I never got any.

Sleep and TMJ help I have been on and off Amitriptyline since 1992. It helps with my sleep when I am having insomnia. It helps with my TMJ (muscle relaxant, so I don't grind my teeth as much). But I never noticed a help with the fatigue, etc. And the sleep help wears off after a time. But, if you have POTS, it can make your POTS symptoms worse. My doctor told me this, and we noticed a change in my POTS symptoms (they got somewhat better) when I went off of it, after 2+ years continuous use.

Help with TMJ... and tension headaches (related to TMJ), but not with migraines. I have been given Elavil for years, on and off, to try to combat a variety of symptoms/problems. The only one I find it useful for is to keep me from grinding my teeth as much at night therefore keeping my TMJ pain down during the day.

not helpful! Was prescribed this medication to take only on the onset of anxiety attack. Not effective whatsoever! Taking prescribed dose only brought on a mildly sedating effect after about an hour. Since my attacks last about an hour, this does me no good! I am then stuck with a tired feeling the remainder of the day!

?????? Havent been taking very long, and am taking in tandem with Xanax (3.5 - 4mg per day for a long time).  I dont feel that Elavil has really added any benefits to my regimen to eliminate depression &amp; anxiety.  Even though I'm on a low dose, it seems that my motor skills have been somewhat effected by the Elavil (poor coordination, some dizziness, etc), but could be Xanax tollerance effect or long-term effects of Xanax.  Sorry, but not much help....

excellent my sleep pattern has radically altered. previously i was waking at least 8 times a night [i counted and recorded this over 2 year period].i now wake 1 - 2 times and am able to get back to sleep quickly. i also use distraction technique [ a c.d. book recording] to occupy my mind. side effect - sleepiness am for 20 - 30 mins upon getting up. dry mouth, nasty tast in mouth which toothpaste and strong aniseed sweet deals with - side effect well worth the gains.

Trial Endep Worked brilliantly for pain and sleep, however, was in a continual &quot;Fog&quot; all day and this did not diminish over the three months I was on the meds.This is a real shame because I have to substitute this with three other meds. I also have peripheral neuropathy and Restless Legs Syndrome. I now use Voltaron, Madopar and Valpro plus Alapam if I have great difficulty sleeping.

I became the village idiot on Elavil Okay...so maybe I'm exaggerating a TAD. I was only on it 2 weeks but it was a 2 week nightmare! And this was on the lowest dose possible!! This particular anti depressant did NOT agree with my chemistry at all. At night, it initially knocked me out for about 4 hours of which I would have nightmares to the extent I was SCREAMING in them and woke up my family!! Scared the crap out of my husband....around 1 or 2 am I would then be hit with insomnia and tossed and turned all night with auditory hallucinations. I had several headaches. I felt like I was drunk during the day. I would get in my car to go somewhere and FORGET where I was going!! I was walking into walls and falling down the stairs! My doctor wanted me to stick it out for 2 weeks to see if I would adjust, and on day 14 I literally took a tumble down my stairs because I was so dizzy!! Never again! I wish I was one of the lucky ones that had success on Elavil, because I have been told by many other IC'rs that it changed their lives! But not me!I'm now trying Norpramin (been on 10mg for about a week), and so far so good! I'll rate it when I get about 1 month into it. It is the tricyclic that doesn't have the nasty weight gain side effect since it boosts NE levels as well as Serotonin, so keeping my fingers crossed that I find one that works and I don't become a fatty!

I gained about 20 lbs since being on it and I am already overweight, but the effects on my pain and sleep makes the good outweigh (no pun intended) the bad.

Very positive once I got the timing right Initially took too near bedtime and couldn't wake up the next morning. No problems now I take 2 hours before retiring. First few days slightly odd taste in mouth-now gone.Has helped to regulate my sleep pattern and no longer wake frequently during the night. Feel human again!Planning to replace with herbal meds to avoid psychological dependency.

Unpleasant Since I have been using amitriptyline I have been able to sleep somewhat at at night. The problems I am having is with all the side effects. I feel very frustrated and angry, I have no patience, I shake quite badly on a regular basis (hands, head, legs) and most of all I never really feel completely awake.

Trapped In A Fog This med didn't help my pain, urgency, or frequency. It also gave me very bothersome side effects. The constant sedation was literally depressing. I felt like I was trapped in a constant fog, and this was on just 10 mg. However, it's important to note that I have also bipolar disorder (type 1) in addition to IC. I believe that an important part of the reason that I had such bothersome side effects was that Amitriptyline negatively affected my bipolar disorer. Based on my own experience, I would not recommend this med for IC patients that are also bipolar.

Trapped In A Fog Well, I was actually taking Amitriptyline for the treatment of my IC and not my bipolar, but of course, it affected that as well.Basically, this med jacked me up mentally. The constant sedation was literally depressing. I felt like I was trapped in a constant fog, and this was on only TEN mg! Based on my own experience, this is not a good med to take if you're bipolar.

works great I have had so few side effects from it, it is non addictive and it puts me to sleep and keeps me asleep. When I first started taking it, for about the first week or so, it was hard to function the next day-- I was very drowsy, but that went away.  Now I only notice that I am more thirsty than usual.

It was no different than a placebo To me this was a waste of a month of treatment.  My rheumy assured me it would help with both sleep and pain despite me telling her that I had no luck with other anti-deps in the past.  The only way I was sleepy on this was when  I took it when I was already sleepy.  I still woke up quite a bit in the night and still got up not feeling rested.  A month ago, it was all my rheumy wanted to use to treat me for fibro.  Maybe if I'd taken it with muscle relaxers it would have helped...or if it had been a higher dose.

major bladder problems I was given elavil for burning neuropathic pain associated with MS.  After a few weeks of treatment, I was having trouble with my bladder - hesitancy and incomplete voiding.  My neuro had no clue and thought it was all in my head.  After reading the PDR myself, I learned urinary hesitancy is a common side effect.  I quickly stopped the med and the side effects subsided (not the neuropathic pain, I still have that).

Horrid I started out on 10mg, they had no effect. My GP put my dose up to 20mg - no effect.After I started to take 30mg a day I imeditaly started to get a drugged-up feeling.  My sleep did not improve but I found it so difficutlt to get out of bed in the morning. I deciced to give it one month.

Elavil This was my first anti-depressant. To put it bluntly, I know now why they don't use tricyclics anymore.

Elavil Elavil worked great for me for awhile. At first I was given a low dose and didn't like the way I felt in the morning (groggy). So I tried it again at a lower dose and found that I slept so much better and felt so much bette during the day.  Over time I had to increase the dosage until I was up to 75 mg per day.  The downside of this medication is that you will most probably gain weight (which I did).  But, I felt so much better.  Over time I developed a sensativity to this medication (restless leg syndrome) and had to discontinue it.  Too bad because I think it is a great medication.

Elavil seems to relax my muscles somewhat and allow me to get some rest.  I don't like the groggy feeling that it can leave me with.

RLS Elavil My doctor put me on the Elavil to help with my MS, fibromyalgia and RLS.  Though I was put on only 10mg, I found it made me very groggy the next day, so I have been cutting them in half and only taking 5mg nightly.  This has helped my depression from the pain of my FMS illness but has not helped the RLS it was prescribed for.

Elavil I began taking Elavil for Migraines taken every day in the AM, started at 75mg topped off at 150 mg. For the H/A it worked well, unless I was in &quot;my season&quot;. Or had eaten a trigger food, or come across a trigger.In 97' I had to D/C it because I developed &quot;Restless Leg Syndrome&quot;(RLS). And I found thet Elavil would trigger my RLS.As odd as it sounds RLS was the stepping stone that led me to my diagnosis of FMS in 2001.  My Doctor's Nurse, had a Sister with RLS, we tried Quinine Sulfate (which is used to treat malaria) multiple muscle relaxers, finally found one that worked, Valium. ALL the while I would be walking around the house in the middle of the night praying to God to make it STOP.Little did I know that the RLS was only the beginning of the worst disease I could have ever thought of affecting me. My Doctor's Son was married to a woman that had FMS, so my Dr. knew what to look for, he ran a full TSH screen, and referred me to a Rheumatologist to be examined for FMS. By that time my symptoms had begun to appear, odd ones at that.But luckily, I had a great Dr. That knew first hand what FMS symptoms were. I live out in the &quot;boonies&quot; so I had to drive 75 miles to go and see her. She spent 2 hours with me doing medical backround, and then the ACR trigger point test. Which I failed miserably, I had 15 of the 18 &quot;tender points&quot; Her diagnosis was that without any doubt I had FMS. I was 35 y/o. Very active, Loved my Career as an Interior Designer with more than 20 yrs experience. My Family owned an Interior Design business, and I had grown up as a protege' to take over the busines when my parents retired, to the Ranch.

Hallucinations - told not a side effect I took this for a year about 25 years ago. I was in college and very depressed after a boyfriend rejected me. I started having hallucinations after about a month. I told the pyschiatrist and she said it was not a side effect and to keep taking it. Being young, I obeyed. I had to learn to ignore hallucinations. I remember one quite distinctly. I was standing in the hall talking to a teacher and beside her was Captain Hook from Peter Pan. The hallucinations were only visual and I could tell they were hallucinations because if it moved there would be no sound at all (when captain hook walked - no sound, no breathing no rustle of his clothes for example).  The psychiatrist said they were organic rather than pychogenic for this reason... but she did not take me off of it because she insisted it was not the drug! Also it was not alleviating my depression. She said I needed to wait (after months!)  I finally confided in a teacher what was happening - a real mistake - She decided, despite my having asked her for confidentiality - that she needed to bring my hallucinations up in a faculty meeting and I got a letter telling me to take a mandatory year off - no discussion and no having me evaluated by the school health service.  That is why I did not graduate from grad school at Yale. I did not want to go deal with that small group of teachers in my specialty again after my mandatory year off.  Being pre-internet, I found a physician's desk reference at the library and read that hallucinations were a rare side effect of Elavil. I stopped seeing the Pychiatrist immediately and tapered myself off the drug. The hallucinations stopped - but I had spent a year thinking a depression was leading me to insanity and my extremely good educational opportunity was ruined by my being honest about it. I have had reoccuring depression since (probably in part because the initial episode was not really treated). Prozac helped but then became ineffective.

&quot;EVIL&quot; Evil is what I call this drug! I was on it for two days for my FMS and I thought it was going to kill me. I felt very drugged out on only 10 mg a night. I had jaw stiffness, intestine pain, sore throat, puffy face in the morning, ice pick pain in the chest and shoulder blades, intense (long, life like) dreams, I was very hungry and never felt full even after eating a lot, increased muscle pain in the morning and stiffness, my heart rate went up a little (about 100), and my blood pressure increased significantly and this was all in two days. I did feel well rested, but was in a fog most of the day. I got off this drug and I will never take it again. I am glad it helps some of you, but it is not for me. My friend has good success with it for use with her migraines. It does work well for sleep, but the side effects are the worst I have ever had with any medication. I felt so drugged out at night, it was awful.

Off and On again I was put on amitriptyline 15 years ago.  The only side effects I experienced were the rapid heart rate and the weight gain.  This drug safed my life..I suffer from fibromyalgia and panic attacks and this kept them at bay.  The monkey never left my back, but it kept him semi-still.  Then this past summer, my doctor felt, at my age I should try something else because of the rapid heart rate.  So I weaned myself off the amitriptyline and started Cymbalta.  Wonderful stuff...helped so much with the fibro pain and the monkey on my back seemed to take a vacation.  But...my GI track got off track, and after a magnatude of tests, I am back on the amitriptyline, not only for the fibro, panic attacks, but now for GI problems.  Wish I could take them both.
