Ambien for sleep I took Ambien for a few weeks and it worked really well, but when you feel sleepy, you had better have a place to fall!  Due to the cost I had to discontinue use,but would try it again if the price goes down.(and I had insurance!)

Ambien This medicine puts you to sleep really well.  It seems to regulate your sleep cycle.  It is not good to take it late in the night.  It definitely gives you side effects if you take it late.  You will feel tired the next day and you just want to sleep.  It has never caused me to feel addicted to it.  I have never had a problem feeling the need to take it all the time.

my mainstay I have taken ambien for years -probably 5 years now.  Have had periods of trying to replace it or reduce it, but my insomnia is chronic, with fibromyalgia, so this i have found to be the most reliable source of sleep in my regimen, although the length of effectiveness has dropped drastically over the years-currently gets me about 4-5 hours sleep, which I seem to function okay with.  Trying lunesta, but it seems really weak in comparison, not very effective.

Ambien This medication still worked after over 4 years of use, but since going off of it and sleeping naturally, I've discovered what the real thing, &quot;sleep&quot;, actually feels like. Ambien's &quot;sleep&quot; was chemically induced. The difference between natural sleep and Ambien's artificial sleep is quite profound. Give me natural, sleep any time. Ambien also causes weight gain over time due to hang-overs that never improve and therefore result in sluggishness and a complete halt to the &quot;spring-in-your-step&quot;.

Forgetfulness caused by ambien, ADD or old age?! I've been taking ambien for 3 full years since a death of a close family member.  I took b/t 2.5 mg (cut pill in half) up to 7.5 mg (three 1/2 doses on night b/f surgery, when traveling, or stressed out).  It worked very well for me as I took only as needed; ie: tried to fall asleep on my own w/o medication before taking half a 5 mg tablet, took another half 5 mg if I awoke or still couldn't sleep.  However, I seemed to become very forgetful and I'm not sure if that was caused by mild ADD (recently diagnosed at age 42) or daily ambien use.  For example, I left spare car keys hanging at back of car as I drove with another set.  Also, went to make a cup of tea and threw the travel sewing kit into my cup and proceeded to pour instant hot water over it instead of a teabag!  I was active duty officer in US military for several years, so I used to be much more detailed.  I wonder is my forgetfulness really mild ADD, ambien, or old age?  Now I'm giving Lunesta a try.  It's quite a bit more expensive, but worth it for a good night's sleep, I hope.  Have tried it a few nights and had to supplement with half dose of 5 mg ambien first night and slept the following two nights through the entire night.  So far, so good.  I think I'll be switching to Lunesta for long term use instead of ambien.  Only noticable side effects are bitter taste and hard to score.

Circadian Cycle I have bipolar disorder II and at one point (though not experiencing mania), I kept going to sleep later and later and later until I didn't sleep at all before going to work the next day.  It was due to several months of stress at a new job.  I was an emotional and mental wreck.  I called my boss and told him I was taking a week off.  I called my psychiatrist and made an appointment to see him.  At the time, I knew very little about being bipolar, little about the meds I was already taking and nothing about sleeping medications or how they worked.  My psychiatrist had prescribed me Lorazepam in the past, so I asked him for that to work out my sleeping issues.  He didn't want me relying on Lorazepam to sleep, instead he gave me a prescription for two weeks of Ambien (I had never heard of it - several years ago).  He didn't prescribe more because he said it could be addictive, too.  He told me if I took it for two weeks straight, my problem would be resolved and I should be back on a normal sleeping schedule.  The first night I took Ambien, I tossed and turned for a couple hours, slept fitfully and woke up a couple times, but I did sleep that night.  I was disappointed, though, and thought I'm never going to sleep regularly and soundly again. On the second night that I took Ambien, I fell asleep within an hour or so, and slept through the whole night.  I took it for 1-1/2 weeks, stopping short of the two weeks to see if I was back on schedule and would be able to sleep without the Ambien and I was!  Oh joy!  I've used it periodically since then, but the alterations in the combination of other meds treating my bipolar disorder has mostly resolved the sleeping issues I experienced back then.

Ahh, Ambien. I was given this med to help me sleep.  It has done so, without the zombifying effects I've experienced from other sleep medications.  Ambien does not knock me out quite as well as those others, and I do tend to wake up in the night sometimes.  However, I prefer this gentler, (possibly a bit less effective) medication to one that slams me with side effects the next day.

Not effective in long-term At first, I loved the ambien. I took 1/2 pill (5 mg.)I fell asleep very quickly (about 20 minutes!) and I slept fairly soundly until the morning. After about 4 weeks, I had to take 10 mg. to get this result. But as the weeks went by, (7-9 weeks)the 10 mg. stopped working. It's not really recommended to take more. Now, I was taking longer to fall asleep 1-1/2 hours and waking up wide awake at 3:00 am! This left me with about 3 hours of sleep, then about 1 hour of fitful sleep right when alarm was ready to ring. Working on other remedies now.

The Right Stuff! When I absolutely have to sleep and wake up at a certain time, Ambien is my miracle drug.  My sleep cycle is really out of whack and no matter how hard I try to force myself into a schedule, my body wants to be awake at night.  If I have an early appointment, staying up till sunrise just doesn't cut it.  But 10-15 mg. of Ambien takes care of that and leaves me with no side effects at all.  Due to the outrageous expense, I have never used Ambien on a long term basis.  Only as an emergency sleep aid when I absolutely, positively have to be somewhere in the morning.  I did discover that it is important to take it and GO TO BED!  If you try to stay up, the sleepiness will wear off after a few hours and you may not remember much about what you did, anyway.

It works I definitely sleep soundly (most of the time) with Ambien.  The biggest problems are dependency on it to sleep, and I still do not feel rested in the morning.  It could be because of my fibromyalgia, as I tend to sleep but not get the restorative sleep (a sleep study revealed my brain activity to be as if I was awake even though outwardly I was asleep).  Another friend of mine, who does not have fibromyalgia, thinks it is the greatest!

ambien i've been taking ambien for about 8 years, and its still pretty effective. i use the larger size (10mg). i break it into smaller peices, 3rds usually, and take the smaller peice as needed. at the start i used it mainly to fall back to sleep during the night. now is use it to get to sleep initially. my doc says that its the only drug that doesn't disturb normal sleep patterns, like dreaming. he has recommendsd some yoga to practice before bedtime that he says will help cut down on my need for ambien over the long run. the associated book is 'Yoga Therapy for Overcoming Insomnia.' i just bought it, so i haven't tried it yet. back to ambien: its expensive, but how do you value a good night's sleep?

Long-time Ambien user My insomnia is caused by depression, and anti-depressant meds.  I took Ambien, nightly, for two years.  I took breaks of a week, or so, every three months, to ensure I was not getting hooked.  Ambien did a good job of keeping me asleep, but I had to wait until I was nodding off before I took it, or it had no effect.  It could not take me from a mentally alert state, into sleep.  I recently switched to Lunestra.

Ambien I have taken Ambien about 5 times.  I have not had any luck with it at all.  I had to take two last night.  The first one never really put me to sleep so I took a second once about two hours after the first.  Another time I took one I slept for 3 hours and woke up wide eyed in the middle of the night.  Another time I just kept tossing and turning and felt funny.  I couldn't really sleep at all.  My personal favorite it a 50mg-100mg of Trazodone with .5mg-1mg of Xanax.  Problem, as usual, is that if you use these aids every night, you will get use to them.  Also I don't want to use Xanax anymore and have stopped using it because of its depedency/addictive issues.  What a same.

works but damn. I took Ambien for insomnia caused by major agitated depression.  When nothing (and i mean nothing) else would knock me out this would do it 100% of the time.  But at one helluva price.  Consistently and every time the next day featured some of the blackest depression i have ever known.  I eventually went with sleeping an hour a night for days on end rather than take this stuff.  Trazadone worked ~ 60% with none of the side effects.  Eventually I found an anti-depressent (Mirtazapine) that worked and cured the insomnia.

Effective, but perhaps time to be wary I haven't had the tolerance problems that other reviewers are quick to point out.  But I'm becoming keenly aware of a dependence, whether psychological or physical I'm not entirely sure.  Also, mystifying intestinal problems are telling me it's time to break free of this drug.  Otherwise, I'd have to say that it's quicker and more effective than Valium or Sonata, and for a long time I assumed there were no catches.  Some members of the medical community are beginning to warn that Ambien is really not all that different from the notorious benzodiazapines.   I'm hoping withdrawal and stoppage isn't anything like breaking a benzo habit.

May affect your psychiatric health I took Ambien twice after it was prescribed to me to treat an occasional insomnia. In both cases, the drug caused significant deviations in my psychiatric well being. These deviations manifested themselves as thoughts of suicide and violence, which were very difficult to fight with. I was very scared by these side effects and never used Ambien again. A different doctor prescribed Imovane and that works very good: I fall asleep without any weird thoughts and wake up refreshed.

Ambien Ambien was a life savior for me at first. Then after after a few weeks it got to where it only  helped some nights and then for only 2 hours or so. It is defiinitely not for long term use but it is great for up to a month I would say. I would try a longer lasting med it you have severe sleep problems or fibro.ThanksAngela

Excellent sleep aid Update 5/22/05: My faith in Ambien has been restored!  As noted below, after a half year or so of nightly use, Ambien had started to poop out on me - 5 mgs was no longer enough and I was anxious about building up more and more tolerance.  Well, at the advice of my pdoc, I cold-turkeyed the Ambien to see what would happen, and guess what, no big deal.  ONE fitful night and then I was able to sleep OK without it (however, I do take Xanax which also helps with sleep).  Anyway...I have insomnia so after about a week without the Ambien I was starting to sleep irregularly again.  I tried taking 5 mg one night a week after going off it, and guess what, it knocked me right out - no tolerance at all.  In short, for me the good news is that if I take an &quot;Ambien break&quot; I can return to the drug and it's effective as if I had not built up any tolerance.  I've been limiting my usage to 2-3 x per week and that really seems to be working in terms of not having to up it to 10 mg.  Before this experiment I was thinking about trying Lunesta, but then I saw the mediocre reviews here and also my pdoc was less than enthusiastic about Lunesta (he is familiar with it and does not think it is a good drug).  So I'm really pleased that with a little ambien break, it comes back strong and effective as when I first started it.***Update 4/4/05:  Just wanted to say that after about 6-7 months of pretty steady use, Ambien is starting to poop out on me.  For the last few months I was falling asleep quickly on 5 mg, but in the past 2 weeks 5 mg has been having no effect and it has taken 10 mg to get me to sleep.  Of course, 10 mg is a &quot;normal&quot; dose so there's nothing to be alarmed at quite yet, but it is disconcerting to see the tolerance start to build up.  I did, however, get half a year of daily use out of it before the tolerance kicked in. I will be continuing to use it at 10 mg, but when that poops out and more (15 or 20 mg) is required, I will find something else. H

Benzo Tolerance because of Ambien I was first prescribed Ambien at age 15 by a general practitioner, started on the 5 mg tablets and eased up to 10.  I took it for several months, but my tolerance built up higher, so I chose to take myself off of it and use Benadryl for my chronic insomnia.Later on in life, I started back on it -- and even after three years off of it, my tolerance was such that I couldn't take a 5 mg tablet and have any effect -- and a 10 mg barely did anything.I also noticed at that time that my benzodiazepine tolerance was through the roof -- at least for sleep-inducing properties.  I could take 4 mg of Xanax, and not be sleepy.  One night when I was very tired but couldn't wind down, a neighbor gave me two Valium 10s.  I took both, hoping it would put me down -- I ended up cleaning my apartment because I just wasn't sleepy. Ambiens not a bad drug.  But it does have some seriousissues with tolerance-inducing effects, and since itbinds selectively to one particular benzodiazepinereceptor and not the rest, when you gain a toleranceto its effects it also affects how you react to otherbenzodiazepines -- they work fine for anxiety relief,which is their primary purpose, but sleep-inducingeffects are diminished.I think it's perfect to take for very short-terminsomnia.  You absolutely MUST take it on an emptystomach, take it with a glass of water at your bed,and immediately lay down to go to sleep, and make sureyou have allotted eight to ten hours for sleep, toavoid the amnesia effects that &quot;Ambien-naive&quot;individuals have occasionally.It's been two years since I've taken any, and I wasout of town this week.  A friend had one 10 mg Ambien,and I often have worse insomnia issues in hotels.  Itook it last night, then immediately brushed teeth andlaid down.  It took between 15 and 20 minutes to fallasleep, and I employed specific breathing exercises toassist as well.  I've always noticed a slight numbingo

(mind you I had been dressed in flannel just before that) He asked me what was I gonna do when a hot ember popped out and burned me and I sighed and said I dont know and then tried to sleep. he had to carry me to bed. I woke up freezing me butt off bc It was December and I was still naked lol!Ive been on Ambien 2 years and wont change a thing though. go figure.

didn't know i was a sleepwalker i have restless leg syndrome, and could not sleep at all some nights for days, weeks, and once for approximately a month. i have had this problem for a very long time.  it will go away and come back.  sometimes i won't have a problem for over a year and it will just come back.  i have small seizures in my legs at times and it is very painful.  i was prescribed ambien in the lowest dose and after only about a month, my family noticed me getting up at night and doing strange things.  they would speak to me and i would speak back, but i did not make any sense to them.  my answers would be unrelated to their questions or comments or i would not respond at all. it did not take long for them to realize that i was sleepwalking since i had no recollections of these encounters or of anything i had said or done during the night.  i also had very strange and vivid dreams. i eventually took myself off this medication.  it did make me sleep, but i did not feel at all refreshed the next morning, and these sleepwalking episodes really scared me.  the dreams were disturbing also.  be very careful taking this medication.

Very addictive! Ive been using Ambien for about 3 years. First year took it 2-3 times week and had no problems. With time my dose has increased to 1 and half tab to two tabs for any effect . Tolerance builds up fast if taken daily. Also side effects have definitely become very problematic. Next day anxiety and memory problems really bad. Slight depression worsened dramatically with usage as well. Currently attempting to taper off but experiencing withdrawal side-effects like tremors and rebound insomnia. very addictive and lots of cognitive impairing problems. Use for short term only!

Ambien side effects Should be banned as it is highly hallcinogenic!!!and I was not aware of what I was doing. I almost killed people twice while on it. Nearly burnt down my house 5 times.  I insisted that it was good for me, so I kept taking it. I was almost dead wrong.....

Powerful, if only temporarily My review might be slightly tainted.  I had been on Prozac for 6-7 years and got off.  Was fine Jan-March, but then fell into a deep depression with anxiety.  I was waking up every night several times, couldn't get back to sleep, had horrible anxiety, etc.  This pattern increased until I asked my doctor for help.  He prescribed Lexapro and Ambien on the same day.  Well, little did I know that Lexapro could cause symptoms to get worse initially.  So I'm assuming my resistance to the Ambien may have been exacerbated by the Lexapro.However, I took 1 10mg. of Ambien while sitting in a chair next to my bed.  Not long after, I was seeing double and could hardly get myself to the bed.  Part of me was worried about how drugged I felt, but part of me was looking forward to sleeping for a change.  3 hours later I woke up, wide awake.  Decided to take half a pill to get me back to sleep.  It worked and I was out again.  2 hours later I was wide awake again.  Took another 1/2 pill to get back asleep.  Woke up again a few hours later.The next day I felt lethargic.  I could barely move.  I was exhausted but couldn't sleep.  That was the first day I couldn't eat either.  Tried to, but things tasted like paste.  That happened for 3 days before I got a dose of Klonopin.  That stuff works great.  In fact, I get the best sleep results if I take a Klonopin right before I go to sleep.  Keeps my mind from racing.So, I'm hesitant to take the Ambien again.  Thinking I'll probably continue to rely on my old standby, Benadryl, when I need help.

Ambien I have had &quot;early-awakening&quot; cycles that totally screw up life in general over the past couple of years.  Wake up after 2-3 hours and can't go back to sleep at all.  Then I am groggy and irritable all day, falling asleep while driving, etc.  Take a &quot;nap&quot; at night and starts again from there.3 times in the last 4 years I have fallen into this cycle and Ambien has been very effective to help me back to normal.  My insomnia is not a constant problem though, it is a habit I fall into once in a while.  The effectiveness definitely drops off the longer you take them.  The 1st night I took  one and was out (I mean fell asleep sitting up!) in a half hour.  I must admit after it rids me of the problem, I find myself using up the rest of the bottle because they are addictive.  (After about 2 weeks, my problem is gone but I keep taking them and can actually stay up 4 more hours.)

Tricks to using this medication.... I have been using this medication for 10+ years and it will only work when you have no food in your system. For example, it won't work at all if you eaten 3-4 hours prior to taking it. However, if you eat AFTER you have taken the pill it will work. I take Ambien at 9pm and eat at 9:45pm. It does lose its effectiveness over time, but having an empty stomach makes it work better. When I started taking it, it did make me &quot;see things&quot; and I forgot everything that happened the night prior. This is a good drug, but don't EAT many hours prior to taking it.

Ambien I liked the fact that Ambien really knocks me out however I'm nervous about becoming dependent. I have portioned out a small prescription (30 pills)over a year to take when I am in desperate need.

Memory Loss of Ambien When I first began taking Ambien I thought that it was the answer to all of my sleep problems. I was finally able to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep for the duration of the night (something I hadn't done in 15 years). The drawback was that I experienced serious memory loss problems, and not just at night. I would lose parts of my day and not realize it until it was pointed out to me. I suggest using caution when taking Ambien on a daily basis.

Ambien Ambien works long term if periodic breaks from it (two or more days) are taken.  However, in my opinion it is very addictive and withdrawal from it is painfully miserable, both physically and psychologically.  For me the ability to even take a nap without ambien occurred after several months of using it.  Like any other addictive substance, it's heaven when it works, but hell when it doesn't and a tolerance to it can be expected.

Ambien This medication was effective for me and worked even if I used less than the prescribed dose. I have used it a few times per month for several years. I was fresh and awake in the AM. It is fairly expensive but seems worthwhile.

Hangover without the fun I really did well with Ambien at night.  Unfortunately, the half-life is rather long, so every time I stopped moving during the day, I fell asleep again.  After some time with this side effect (fortunately I wasn't working at the time), I cut back to 5 mg.  That was somewhat better.  Then I cut back to 2.5 mg.  When I got to that point, I gave it up since at 2.5 mg, it was probably more a psychological benefit than a physical one.  However, the Ambien did &quot;break&quot; the &quot;insomnia cycle&quot; for quite a while. Now, when I have a bout of insomnia, I take Sonata.  It has a much shorter half-life.

Ambien showed me what sleep was... I have never slept much, childhood, college to adulthood, 4-6 hours a night.  I wake up about 10:00pm, no matter how tired I have been all day.  I would get up in the night to go to the restroom and stay up and read or clean the kitchen or do a craft for at least and hour before being able to go back to sleep.  I have asthma, lupus and other various aliments, which means a lot of medications.  I have always resisted taking a sleeping pill because I knew I would be hooked if I tried one.  Well, I was partially right.  I could not believe how rested I felt after a whole night of uninterrupted sleep. Before, I slept through the night maybe 2-3 times a year, and my first thought in the morning would be that I was either dead or had wet the bed. :&gt;  I don't have to take Ambien every night and sometimes I just take 5 mgs, sometimes 10 mgs. After a few nights, my body seems to get the rhythm of rest, and it is blessed.  My overall health is improved because I am rested for the first time in my life.

Ambien I've been using 10 mg Ambien for at least a year but find that some nights I need to take a half a tablet more unless I take it with Benedryl. If I take it @ 10mg alone, it takes me a while to get to sleep (if I do at all) and I usually don't sleep all through the night.  I've been taking 10mg tablet with a benedryl tablet at night and sleeping without fully waking for 9-12 hours.  I need more sleep so don't base your findings on what my sleep needs are.

bluesharp Insomnia for me is caused by arthritic pain both in my lower back and between the shoulders. I don't know how it works, but it does.  I find it works better with a C-PAP machine. Without a C-PAP machine, early awakening happens a lot, with Ambien. With the C-PAP machine, I can sleep more than 8 hours. But no matter how long I sleep, once awakened, my pain is all encompassing. I drizzle out of bed, eat breakfast and go laydown with a trusty thermophore for 2 to three hours before I can walk without &quot;all encompassing&quot; pain.I have tried a half tablet. Not effective.  Two tablets, leaves me with the &quot;dead brain stem syndrome,&quot; where I spend the day with some part of my brain sleepy.Ambien does not work, in any form, 2 tablets, etc. if I am going through an Irritable Bowel Attack.

Wow (At First) When I started Ambien last year, I could not believe it.  Right to sleep and woke up 8 hours later in great shape.  The first couple of nights were the peak, however.   Then the effectiveness slowly eroded until worse than before starting.  Rough nights for a few after getting off.  Threw a whole bottle away.
