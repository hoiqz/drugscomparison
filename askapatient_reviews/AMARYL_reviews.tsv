1	diabetes	became dizzy when driving. thought I would pass out and crash. Made it home though. Other times also, when I got out of hot tub at the YMCA. I will not take this again if I am DYING		M	57	90  days15 mg 1X D	10/31/2012
4	Type 2	No side effects.	However, when taken just before breakfast, after 2 to 3 hours, my sugar level drops below the normal level and therefore I have to take some juice or heavy snacks every day 2 hours after the breakfast to avoid dropping of sugar level.I took HbA1c every 3 months and it was 4.2. So it works!	M	50	1  years1 mg 1X D	7/7/2012Email
4	early type 2 diabetes	No problems or side effects	works well, but works better if taken in the morning	F	50	9  months4 mg 1X D	8/15/2011Email
4	type 2 diabetes	dizziness, sleepiness (would fall asleep mid-sentence, hypo, tremor	I took it along with Byetta, Humalog, and Lantus SoloStar. Think I will try leaving the Humalog. Have to watch what I eat because Byetta takes away my appetite, and sense of taste. But I have to make sure I eat enough to keep my sugar up. Last night it fell like a rock after supper and I was shaking so hard I had to lay down. My husband had to run out and get me a milkshake to get my sugars back up and have protein. I was VERY NAUSEOUS and couldn't think of anything to eat but the shake.	F	41	1  weeks1mg 1X D	4/27/2011Email
1	type 2 diabetes	some nausea to begin with but subsided	Does not work for me. At best it dropped me down about 20 points but I am up at 270-80 fasting plus I take 30mg Actos once a day! Was on glucovance 500mg/ day with Actos, but got too low and hypo (40-50!). Asked Dr. to reduce this but switched me to amaryl. I watch my diet and exercise daily, so I am going back to glucovance if possible. Don't rate amaryl at all.	M	42	5  weeks8 1X D	12/26/2010Email
5	Type 2 diabetes	No side effects	Began at 2 mg after breakfast and after 2 weeks with it pushing blood sugar to mid to upper 30's went to 1mg after breakfast and it will maintain good levels daily. Fasting test each morning shows blood sugar levels to be from mid 70's to mid 90's.	M	59	9  years1 mg 1X D	7/28/2010
4	uncontrolled blood sugar	none	very first day noticed average bsl dropped to 99 in am and91 at night after dinner, havent't been in the 90's for months.hope to continue on this med low dose seems to be just what ittakes to get controlled again.	M	62	3  days4mg 1X D	5/14/2010
5	Try something new	Amaryl threw my blood sugar very low the first few days, maybe because I was in a turmoil  of decluttering my house and doing a lot of physical stuff.  It definitely is a wonderdrug,  I was on Actos 45 mg for quite a few years with swollen face and very swollen legs that hurt.  I have lost 10 pounds and feel wonderful.	I love this drug and hope that it will continue to let me wake up in the morning to 95-100 blood sugar instead of fighting a 150-160 all day long with metformin and actos.	F	54	1  months	7/19/2009Email
4	Diabetes Type II	When I get up later in the morning, Amaryl tends to drop my readings into the 60s and 70s in the afternoon.  I'm learning to anticipate the symptoms of empty stomach, weak legs and a general sensation of weakness, and have some sugar to control it.  But it's quite unnerving.  It seems to work, though...	I've been on 2000 mg of Glucophage plus Actos for years... but did not observe a diet at all and my last A1C was 7.7... my doc got upset and gave me Amaryl.  I have a suspicion I could drop Amaryl and avoid flour, potatoes, sugars, etc. and maybe achieve similar results.	M	72	2  months	3/31/2009
4	high sugar	none i know of		F	61	 	11/9/2008
4	Type 2  Diabetes	Low blood sugars.	I have followed the appropriate eating plan and have been exercising, and the doctor has already cut the Amaryl down to 1 mg a day. I suspect I'll be getting off of it soon. It's doing its job too well. The bad thing is that I have to eat to the blood sugar level when it goes down and that negates any weight loss efforts, which in the long run are a major goal in control of my type 2.	F	53	2  months	8/10/2008
4	lower blood sugars	some nausea, dizziness	BS levels dropped like a brick! was already taking Actos & 2 metformin--doc added amaryl and 2 more metformin. I also gave up refined sugars but still eat fruits. fasting BS in the 80s and 90s (whoa!)--evening BS in the 120s-140s	F	48	4  days	3/24/2008
4	Type 2 Diabetes	Late afternoon hypoglycemia. Not much of a problem for me.	I tried Avandia and Actos with no apparent improvement in blood sugars. Recently added Amaryl to metformin plus Actos (which I've taken for several years) and saw improvement in FBG levels and after dinner values as well within 3 weeks. Very happy so far. Remember Type 2 is a heterogenous condition hence some T2s benefit more than others.	M	63	8  days	2/5/2008
1	Type 2 Diabetic	Took in A.M. Went to bed at 10:00 P.M. with ice cold hands, lower legs and feet. Thundering irregular heartbeat began and ran in intervals for several hours.	I would not recommend to anyone sensitive to drugs.  Apparently I am.	F	64	1  days	1/17/2008Email
4	diabetes	None.	It does not bring my blood sugar down to an acceptable level. I will have to take meds to assist the amaryl. I take 8 mg a day and do not have any side effects that I have noticed.	F	37	30  days	1/9/2008Email
5	Type ll	Took 2mg in the morning and wow, it would lower by blood sugar down into the 70's.  I could feel it when it was low.  So now I take 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 at night.  Morning readings are in the 90's vs 130's + before taking the drug. Also on a strict weight loss program...modified ( Optifast ) and hope to get off meds with sufficient weight loss.	Also have been taking Glucophage for a number of years....no real affect on my blood sugar...also Actos for several years...still not much affect...Amaryl seemed to be the " magic bullet ".	M	57	8  days	7/31/2007
4	Type II	At first, light headedness.	Long term, it is the best thing that has kept my blood sugar under control. At first it can be rough to adjust to, but long term it has bee the best.	M	34	6  years	6/23/2007
5	Type 2 Diabetes	None at all-- however it took a few weeks to start working-- blood sugar is now normal.	I take this with Avandia (called Avandaryl, made by GSK) and 2 500MG tablets of Metformin, and it works great at keeping my blood sugars normal-- I eat pretty much a normal diet too.	M	38	5  months	9/11/2006
5	diabetes II	none	I didn't like takeing it in the evening, it would keep me awake. I am highly sensitive to caffine, so maybe some connection. Lowered my A1c from 7.5 to 5.5 in 4 months time.	M	48	9  months	10/27/2005
5	diabetes 2	none	Amaryl along with some exercise and eating ajustments have been keeping my BS in the normal range.	F	58	3  years	8/12/2005
4	High blood sugar - Diabetes II		I am reviewing this on behalf of my 93-year old mother. Amaryl worked well in keeping her blood sugar levels down.  She took 1/2 of a 2mg pill every morning after breakfast.  If we didn't make sure she had some carbs from lunch onward, her levels would sometimes drop into the 70s.  The pill tended to lose some effectiveness after about 12 hours, and her numbers would be in the 120s pre-breakfasst.  I wanted to give her a 1/2 pill a.m. and 1/2 p.m., but her doctor said it would be too difficult to cut the pill evenly enough to get the dosage consistent.  After a few low p.m. readings, he took her off Amaryl in September.  We're trying to manage by diet alone, which is quite difficult.  We only do 2 readings per day, and I worry about how high her levels go after meals.  I had tested her after Oatmeal for breakfast (when taking Amaryl) and it would get her levels up 80+ points post prandial.	F	93	1  years	10/22/2004
4	High blood sugar	None	Worked well for several years but effects gradually diminished and started insulin (lantus)  Lantus much more effective keeping blood sugar low and stable than amaryl.	M	58	3  years	4/24/2004
