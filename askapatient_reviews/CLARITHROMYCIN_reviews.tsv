1	Chest infection	From the second day of taking Clarithromycin Ranbaxy 1 every 12hrs I started having nauseas, twitchy muscle, my skin very sensitive, extremely exhausted & tired, a ringing sound in my ears 24hrs. I told me doctor how I was feeling and he told me I may have post viral syndrome which can last one month or years & ruin ur life. I was worry and finally did some research myself abt taking this antibiotics. I wont recomend to any one to take it or go through hell as me for 6 long days. AVOID taking Rambaxy		M	40	6  days500mg	11/24/2012

Have taken Klacid in the past and never had any problem with it(klacid is also a clarithromyicin medication). Avoid Ranbaxy if possible	F	34	5  days500 2X D	11/13/2010
