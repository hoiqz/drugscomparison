4	interstitial cytitis	drymouth, and stomach pain.	The drymouth wakes me up at night some. The stomach pain has gone away for the most part. When I had the stomach pain, I took an acid reducer or mylanta. I was going to the bathroom about 16 times a day and now It's around 7.I still have some urgency, but not sure if it's other symptoms of i.c. or not.	F	30	2  weeks5mg 2X D	3/29/2010Email
2	bladder leakage	i had been taking ditropan XL for a year.  i switched for cost reasons and got nasty dry mouth, eyes, and throat, blurred vision, terrible mood swings, acid reflux and stomach cramping that is sometimes quite severe.  (even taking half of one pill daily)	if you have insurance go with the XL. . .	F	49	38  days	11/3/2008
