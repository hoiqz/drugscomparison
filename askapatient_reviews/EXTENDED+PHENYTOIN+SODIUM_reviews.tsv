1	HMO insisted to save money	After 30 years of good seizure control with Dilantin, started taking the generic form due to my HMO's insistance. 4 days later, had a seizure while driving. Don't care what HMO's say, generic is not the same!(blood levels fell from 14 ug/ml to 5.6 ug/ml)		M	51	30  years	5/16/2004Email
1	sleep seizures	-bad heartburn-the seizures did not stop; in fact, 2 weeks after I started taking it, I had 2 seizures in one night and the start of a seizure the next (I fought the third seizure off). On Topamax, I had no seizures for over 9 months.		F	31	1  months	12/24/2001
