3	Asthma	Have not been tking long enough to see any.  The taste left in your mouth after the inhaler is not that great - but all inhalers have this problem and I wouldn't say it's any better or worse than anything else.	If you want to treat Asthma without Long acting Beta drugs, or without Steroids, it's had to find meds.  This is one of them - actually very side-effect free (Cromelyn Sodium is actuall OTC in NasalCrom it's so side-effect free).It does not work as good as Advair (Which I was on) but I'm willing to deal with a little tighter chest to avoid the side effects of Advair.
