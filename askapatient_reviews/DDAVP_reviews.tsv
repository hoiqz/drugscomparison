5	DI	none that we know of	My four year old grandaughter that we have custody of has been on DDAVP all her little life. A life saver for her. It help regulate her urine output nicely. Nasal spray twice daily.		46	4  years	12/6/2009Email
5	Diabetes Insipidus	None	I love it! After brain surgery I didn't know how I was going to survive going to the bathroom every 20 minutes. I take DDAVP nasal spray and it works like a charm.  When taking other meds I have to increase the dosage, but other than that it's a God send.  I use to spend $60 a month at the local CVS, but I started mail order and I pay $10 for a seven month supply!  If you have mail order as an option check out the cost of the medicine.

5	Bed wetting/diabetes insipidus	Mild sinus irritation at first, but it did go away over time.	I love this medication!!!  I see some people commenting about the cost of it.  Walgreen's carries it, get their Walgreen's prescription card for $20 per year, then you pay only $68 and some change.  I would be lost without it.  Even with our insurance, it's still cheaper at Walgreen's.  I hope this helps anyone who is having trouble affording it.	M	34	10  years	7/23/2009
5	DI	Dizziness	We wouldn't want to be without this med.	F	22	8  years	7/10/2009
5	Diabetes Insipidus	None!!!	OMG it's such a life saver. I don't have to drink nearly as much water as I used to. When I started it, it was hard figuring out what dose to take, but we finally figured it out.	F	19	2  years	10/20/2008
1	Diabetes Insipidus	Extreme dizziness, unbearable headache, vomiting, disorientation, overall feeling of malaise.	Only drug to treat DI so basically, i'm out of luck! My dr. has never seen anyone unable to tolerate ddavp i'm an anomalie.	F	32	2  days	10/15/2008
2	Bed wetting	None	My daughter has been on this for over a month now and besides being expensive, she still wets the bed even with strict fluid restriction.   It's very frustrating we're going back to the doctors next week.	F	24	6  weeks	9/8/2008
5	Diabetes Inspidus	Fluid retention if I take more than my body needs and then some shortness of breath.	Virtually free of side effects. I have to adjust the dose based on symptoms and other meds. A wonder drug for DI. DI is horrible but this med. helps.	F	39	2  years	8/26/2008
5	Diabetes insipidus	Leg swelling if taking too much.	My daughter has been on DDAVP  since 1978, 29 years.  She has been maintained well for all those years and it sure is better than the old Pitressin Tannate in Oil.  That med. was injectable every 36 hours, which was very trying.	F	38	29  years	1/16/2008
5	Diabetes insipidus	If I dose it too high, I have fluid retention.	Thank God it exists. I wouldn't wish diabetes inspidus on anyone but if you have it, this medication is fairly side effect free. You just have to adjust the dose to your body. I find that my dose changes based on other medications I take and other factors.	F	39	6  months	11/7/2007
