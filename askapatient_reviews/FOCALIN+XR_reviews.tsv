5	ADHD	Loss of appetite which causes low blood sugar which causes tantrums.  Otherwise, an amazing, life changing drug for our child.	This drug has allowed my dear daughter to go from being thought of as a "problem child" in school to getting all 100%+ days.  Her self esteem is soaring and she can control herself which was impossible before.  The only problem is the lack of appetite which leads to tantrums from low blood sugar.  We will take this over the rages and daily trauma she had to deal with prior.	F	9	6  months25 mg 1X D	1/27/2013
5	ADHD	Slightly jittery and does slightly increase my anxiety level.	Amazing med! I've tried so many stimulants and couldn't tolerate them. This works so well for me, helps me to wake up/stay focused/think clearly, I'm very relieved to finally have this in my arsenal of items for self care. NOTE: My son who is 7 also takes this and is doing very well.	F	43	3  months15mg 1X D	10/4/2012Email
5	ADHD	1) Intermittent stomach pain even when taken with food, 2) difficulty falling asleep managed with melatonin 1 mg 30-40 mins before bed., 3) much quieter, more reserved and serious (less personality), which  may be resulting in fewer friendships, 4) definite decrease in appetite during lunch, which I counteract by giving him more calories at breakfast (including protein) and at dinner - continues to make gains in weight & height at each checkup.	Of all the meds we've tried, Focalin XR has worked the best.  My son has earned straight E's (Excellent) in 1st grades for last 3 grading periods & positive behavior reports (I implemented a simple system with teacher to get daily feedback). Qualified for the gifted program although he was never the best test-taker in the past.  My only complaint is that it only lasts 5 hours. We added short-acting Focalin (not XR) in the afternoon & that has caused terrible rebound irritability (weepiness or anger/defiance) that got worse over time: was once every couple of weeks, then weekly, then daily.  We're switching to 2 doses of Focalin XR. Problems with other meds we've tried: Concerta caused severe rebound irritability with either aggression or weepiness. Intuniv (not a stimulant) caused major sleepiness regardless of when he took it (would fall asleep in the car on the way home & I could sometimes get dinner in him but a bath was out of the question) & daytime enuresis (wetting himself).

4	ADHD	None known	My 7 year old son just switched to the XR 20 mg capsule and takes it once in the morning.  He was taking the 5 mg tablet twice a day but had to change due to summer camp not willing to give him meds there.  There have been no side effects with the new dosage and he does great through out the day!	M	7.5	2  weeks20MG 1X D	7/3/2011Email
4	ADHD	loss of appetite, trouble sleeping	This is the third drug my son has tried for his AD/HD.  So far it seems to be working and he has little side effects.  I will re-evaluate in a month or so.  It took a month to side effects when he was on Daytrana and those side effects were pretty bad.	M	4	4  days10 mg 1X D	5/6/2011Email
5	AD/HD	My son had quite a lot of appetite loss, difficulty gaining weight, some trouble getting to sleep but we were able to counter that with Melatonin quite easily.	We've tried my son on Concerta, Adderall, Vyvanse, Focalin Immediate Release and Strattera. Out of all the meds the Focalin XR seems to have the fewest side effects for him. The others either do nothing at all or make him moody and aggressive.	M	6	1  years10mg 1X D	3/1/2011Email
4	Adult ADD	dry mouth, mid-day crash, decreased appetite	I've been on Focalin XR 10mg for a week now.  My doc added it after trying straterra for 10 weeks with minimal improvement. I'll titrate to 20mg after 14 days.  So far so good, my focus and attention has improved, I'm able to stick with a task until completion.  I hate the mid-day crash, its weird I'll crash then I'll get a second wind.  Its like its releases in spurts instead of gradually throughout the day.	F	30	7  days10 1X D	6/18/2010
