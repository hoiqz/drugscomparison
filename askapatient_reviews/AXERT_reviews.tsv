4	migraine	none	First migraine med I've taken that didn't have horrible side effects and actually helped relieve migraine pain.  The 7 day headache didn't go away, but the medicine significantly reduced the pain enough for me to participate in and acutally enjoy day-to-day activities!	F	47	1  days12.5 mg 1X D	11/9/2011Email
5	Migraine	Only drug I've tried that stops the pain of my monthly migraines. Love it!		F	43	4  years 1X D	10/13/2010
5	Severe migraines	None	Axert is my wonder drug.  After trying most every 'new' migraine medication out there, my doctor finally decided to try some of the older ones.  Axert usually relieves my migraines on the first pill.  If not, you can take a second one after one hour.  I don't go anywhere without them.	F	55	5  years12.5 1X AN	7/27/2010
