4	Social anxiety	The odd sensation of dizziness and lots of euphoria it has the same effect as being drunk, only without the hangover in the morning, you do get a dry mouth, and loss of appetite but i like that in the drug	My favorite benzo by far, it acts fast, induces sleep and kills social and normal anxiety for a breif time, the problem is its the most addictive one in the bunch	F	24	5  weeks2.5 2X D	3/14/2010Email
4	Anxiety	Drowsiness, very mild dizziness	I take 1MG before I go to bed usually to wind down from my day and I notice the difference, it helps to calm me and put my mind to ease so I can get to sleep instead of just thinking and thinking which kept me up at night.	M	24	5  months	6/30/2009
5	Anxiety	Deep relaxation quickly	Probably because it was in liquid form it worked so quickly. It seems to absorb directly into your bloodstream the second it's dropped into your mouth so no worries about swallowing pills or dissolvine them under tongue. Makes you sleep deeply without any disturbances.	M	38	3  days	4/28/2006
