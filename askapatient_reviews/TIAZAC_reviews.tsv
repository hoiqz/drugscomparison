4	High blood pressure	Some ankle swelling	Over the years, I've taken diltiazem HCL in several forms - - generic, as cardizem and as tiazac.  All have been very satisfactory.  Unfortunately, this single drug (at 240 mg a day dosage)could not completely control my high BP. I now also take altace (5 mg/day) and HCTZ (10 mg/day) and my BP is generally 120/75. I was prescribed the HCTZ, a diuretic, because of slight ankle swelling thought to be associated with the tiazac.	M	62	15  years	2/10/2005
