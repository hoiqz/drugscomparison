1	spinal stenosis	insomnia	This drug did nothing for me.  When I heard about the side effects, I threw the pills away.	M	66	2  weeks50MG 6X D	5/4/2013
5	neuralgia	When I have gotten off of it for some periods, I did have some diarrhea for a couple of days that went away.	I take amitriptyline  and tramadol for nerve pain and other fibromyalgia pains. It has been very effective for dulling pains that are otherwise disabling. I really do not notice any side effects other than it makes doing things seem possible, where the pain before medicating absolutely prevented me from thinking about anything else.

1	Headache eye pain	It took my pain away, problem is that it made suicidal.	While on 72 hour hold, I was told that I am in a 1.3% group of people that has that type of reaction to the med. No alert for that reaction.	M	46	7  days50 mg 4X D	5/3/2013Email
4	Fibromyalgia	Insomnia, loss of appetite, weight loss. Increase in energy.	I took this medication in addition to Vicodin (which also causes me insomnia). It doesn't do a lot for pain, but it gives me that boost of energy I need in the morning. I usually take 1 1/2 tablets in the morning (5-6 a.m.). I am able to nap if needed by 2:00 p.m. If I take it any later than 3 in the afternoon, I cannot sleep at night at least not before 12 or 1.	F	43	1  years50 mg 2X D	4/20/2013Email
4	Back pain	Headache, lots of energy, weight loss	This drug works great for pain but I would not take it again ever. The withdrawal systmtoms are a complete nightmare! Whether you're tapering or going cold turkey you will be in a world of hell for a few weeks. Withdrawals include RLS, sever depression, sever insomnia, cold sweats, diarrhea, after days and days of no sleep I started to hear and see things that were not there. All that plus intense joint pain. It is not a good situation at all. Please beware when taking this medication. I have read stories from people who have experienced terrible withdrawal systmtoms after taking this medication for only a few weeks.	F	32	12  months50 4X D	10/12/2012Email
5	Back pain	Itching, if I don't take it I get very sluggish, groggy, and my muscles ache. Great med for back pain. I only take a low dose 50mg and it gives me so much relief from pain that side effects are worth it. I am a NP and would recommend it for my patients.		F	34	2  years50 mg	10/5/2012
4		Extremely nervous if I miss a dose	I usually take 1/2 pill 2 times a day and 1 whole pill at bedtime for osteoarthritis	F	73	5  years50 mg 3X D	7/14/2012Email
1	ankylosing spondylitis	extreme. disgraceful withdrawals....can stop taking it....otherwise thrashing in bed, insomnia, anxiety,loss of energy, agitation,constant yawning yet can't sleep...totally ruined my life...tried to stop ....can't deal with the withdrawals...sensitive to noise......worse drug ever made..	started on 150 mg per day then went up to 200mg a day then back to  150 then 100 now 50 mg....cannot get off the stuff...horrible drug....works good for intense flare ups of my ankylosing spondylitus but i would never have started taking the stuff i knew the cronic side effects...i;ll have to keep taking it for the rest of my life because i can't deal with the withdrawal symptoms at all...i'd rather die......oh yeah constant urinating is another side effect of stopping.	M	35	2  years50mg 2X D	5/19/2012Email
4	Osteoarthritis	Nothing negative all good.	I am pain free now and can walk almost normally.  Such a relief, but the withdrawl side-effects I read about do concern me.	F	65	10  days50 2X D	3/23/2012Email
1	Arthritis	It was not a very effective pain reliever and went through terrible withdrawal when I stopped.  Seven days of agony, insomnia, anxiety attacks, restless legs, unable to eat, dehydration, nausea, chills.  I would NEVER recommend anyone take this drug!  Should be stopped under the supervision of a physician! Still cannot tolerate perfumes or odors after six weeks.		F	69	4  months100 mg 3X D	3/3/2012Email
3	Headaches	Takes a long time to be effective .	Woks for mild pain but did nothing for a headache. Had a slight out of body feel when taken? Also I had a failed job drug test while taking this.	F	37	 30 1X D	2/25/2012Email
3	chronic pain/headaches	no side effects	it works great for pain that is not "severe"; however it is pure HELL to get off of! I have gotten off of other opiates (hydrocodone, codeine) MUCH easier than getting off this drug. It changes all brain chemistry. If you ever want to get off, you'll need to wean off VERY gradually or you will have terrible withdrawals!! Do not start this drug if you can help it. Use hydrocodone instead - it is much easier to withdraw from.	F	54	12  years50 mg 4X D	2/12/2012
4	Fibromyalgia Pain	A little nausea if I don't eat something when I take it. Insomnia,slight itching.	I only take 1/2 pill at a time, usually twice a day (morning and afternoon) because of the sleeplessness it causes. It makes me very sleepy, but when I try to sleep I wake every few minutes. Like all other opiates I have taken, this one makes me groggy and itchy but I can't sleep if I take it close to bedtime. It definitely helps with the pain, so I can function.

1	pain for knee injury	None until the day I didn't take it.. then, bothersome anxiety, shaky, wierd audio hallucinations at night.	Worked great for pain but Dr. never mentioned it can be addictive! Should have done my homework like I usually do. I was shocked to have withdrawal symptoms the first day I skipped the med. Started to wean off it...... when taking only 1/2 to 1 a day instead of 2-3, had twitches/jerking in arms and legs when at rest. Stopped altogether now. Tho excellent for pain would not take again due to addictive quality and unnerving anxiety trying to stop the drug. My Dr. was surprised at my report, says many pts. are fine on it. Wonder if they've tried to stop it????	F	58	5  weeks50 mg 3X D	1/14/2012Email
1	Endometriosis	Horrible time sleeping and trying to stop this medication is beyond horrible!! The withdrawels are so bad that I had to continue taking and taper myself down and even doing this was a struggle!!	Yes this drug does help the pain but the withdrawals are beyond insane! I have taken many diffrent narcotics and though this one is suppose to be non addicting it's the complete opposite!	F	36	2  years50 4X D	12/9/2011Email
4	pain	none what so ever		F	61	 100 4X D	9/4/2011
5	leg muscle pain and weakness	none	I have permanent leg muscle pain and weakness due to cholesterol medication that I was taking for 16 months.  Now I have to take pain medication every day for the rest of my life!  Tramadol works great (fortunately) and really helps me with my muscle pain.  My quality of life would be very bad if it wasn't for this medication.	F	52	12  months100 mg 3X D	8/9/2011Email
5	post AAA surgery leg pain	None		M	64	6  months50 MG 1X D	8/7/2011
5	arthritis	a little dizziness for the first hour after taking	Tramadol has been a lifesaver as the NSAIDS I was taking caused serious gastritis and Tylenol is very sedating.	F	60	6  months100MG 1X AN	7/14/2011
5	Menstrual Cramps	Itching! Hazy, drugged (but NOT dizzy) feeling. Sometimes sleepy, sometimes insomnia. Figure that one out.	I get horrible painful cramps that cause vomiting and other fun symptoms every month. My doctor prescribed Tramadol, and it's pretty awesome for me. Ibuprofin just makes me vomit and other OTCs don't even touch the pain even if I up the dosage. I didn't want to go all the way to vicodin because it makes me SO dizzy it's hard to walk straight which doesn't help the nausea. So I do tramadol, which brings the pain down to a manageable level, which helps (a little) with the nausea. Hazy makes me unwilling to drive while taking it, but nausea makes me unwilling to go anywhere while I need it, so not a big deal. Most of the time I get the sleepies which is actually GREAT, because I can sometimes sleep through the pain. And I don't get an intense itching, just a very mild, persistent allover itch which I will gladly trade for the horrible pain.I was actually totally unaware that tramadol had issues with addiction/withdrawal until reading other people's comments. I only need the tramadol for the first day, so I only take one or two pills every month and have no issues at all with that. The hazy and itching only last as long as the pill does.

4	recovery cervical disc fusion	Yep, been on this drug for over a year as twice post surgery.  It takes the edge off yet doesn't fully relieve the pain but would not be able to work without it. Easier on stomach than Norco	concerned about becoming dependent after seeing other posts here	M	48	356  days50 mg 1X D	5/5/2011
5	Fibromyalgia, ADD, Depression	Trouble sleeping if taken too close to bedtime.	I LOVE TRAMADOL,  its my WONDER DRUG.  I had been on Ritalin and all sorts of anti depressants but when I started taking Tramadol I was able to drop everything and stick with one drug to do it all.  My fibromyalgia takes the best out of me.  I hurt everywhere, I'm constantly cold and I walk around like an old lady with arthritis (im 36)  I usually wake up dragging and in pain but within 30 minutes of taking my Tramadol I feel upbeat happy and ready to conquer the world.  I notice that when I miss a dose I start feeling depressed but unlike the other antidepressants I have tried, I don't have to wait days for my tramadol to build up before it takes effect.   My tramadol was prescribed for my Fibromyalgia pain but had done soooo much more for me.  It has given me a new outlook on life.  I can focus on my daily duties, I have stopped yelling at my son and have stopped crying for no reason at all.  I think the FDA should approve tramadol for depression because IT WORKS, unfortunately not for everyone but for many!	F	36	5  years100MG 3X D	4/4/2011Email
1	Post shoulder operation	Okay as long as I kept up dosage. Worked fine for controlling the pain but.	I only ever took these Tramadol tablets as prescribed for post operative pain so according to the manufacturers web site, Im not addicted. To be classified as addicted you must be abusing the tablets. Things were fine until I stopped after 6 weeks. I had not been warned about the potential withdrawal effects which included sensory sensitivity, itching, hyper anxiety, extreme insomnia, panic etc. I started taking the Tramadol again and this time reduced over 2 weeks, as soon as I stopped completely, all the withdrawal affects described above came back. It is now 2 weeks since my last tablet and Im still suffering from insomnia and anxiety, Im not able to deal with more than one question at a time otherwise I panic. I am a professional person with a responsible job but currently unable to work. I really wish the drug company and the doctors warned patients about the potential problems of coming off of these tablets, it would have been easier to suffer the post op pain, at least you know where you are with that.	M	55	6  weeks100mg 4X D	1/19/2011Email
1	post-op pain relief	Panic attacks; severe anxiety; very emotional - I felt like I needed psychiatric help.	I would never use this drug again and never recommend it - its analgesic properties are not worth the mental stress.Doctors should warn patients of the side effects.
