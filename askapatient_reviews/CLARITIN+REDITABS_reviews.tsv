1	allergies	severe migraine like headaches.. including light and sound sensitivity	If you are taking this medicine to clear up your allergies, keep an eye out on it because it caused severe migraine like headaches for me. I will never take this again!		27	6  days10mg 1X D	2/17/2011
5	allergies	none	very effective. convenient to take without water. no issues whatever.	F	45	  1X D	11/7/2010
2	seasonal allergies	They do nothing for my allergies and make my face and jaw hurt.	I wanted to try them for a week and see what happened, but will be throwing them away. Kind of cool pill formwish more would do that as they are nice to keep in the car.	M	27	7  days5mg 1X D	6/12/2010
1	seasonal allergies	ears stuffed; "out of it" feeling; tired; alternating sweating/chills	Have only taken two days:  yesterday @ 2pm and today @ 11am.  After reading on this site, I am already sorry I took today's dose and hour and a half ago as my ears feel stuffed almost shut and I feel zombie like.  NOT good for anyone having to drive or work a demanding job.  I'm drinking a lot of water hoping to get this out of my system sooner.  Of note, I take NO OTHER meds, and haven't for years, I exercise daily in a gym and usually feel very healthy.  Sorry I started this drug and won't continue.	F	59	2  days	7/1/2009
2	Seasonal Allergies	Cannot sleep despite being exhausted all day. Easily aggrivated, and find it difficult to concentrate.	The first day, it hardly worked at all. After the first day my allergies seemed to be almost completely gone. I'm not sure what I'd rather deal with, my horrible allergies, constant sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes or the side effects of the drug. Either way I cannot get any work done and am miserable.	M	23	4  days	6/3/2009
4	Seasonal Allergies	Very drowsy during the day, anxious at night, insomnia, hot flashes	Actually taking Alavert version, but it's the same active ingredient.  For the last few years, I've had no trouble at all.  This season, though, it just hasn't been helping that much.  With the side-effects keeping me up at night, I'm taking benadryl to sleep!  I think I'll just stick with that and keep on being tired during the day.  I was ready to blame my bc for the anxiety and hot flashes before reading these!	F	25	4  years	3/18/2009
1	allergies	anxiety, itchy eyes, dizziness, apathy, shakiness, depression	Absolutely terrible side effects. It took me so long to realize that claritin was the problem. Shouldn't be allowed.	M	20	4  weeks	6/8/2008
1	allergies	monster head aches,  dried out mucus membranes... yuck		F	48	4  weeks	4/12/2008
2	Allergy symptoms-sniffles,sneezing	Dizziness, symptoms came back after a couple of hours	I was expecting better resutls, I started getting headaches which added to the dizziness, did not make me feel any better	F	29	3  days	11/29/2007
2	sneezing	insomnia	side effects are prohibitive	M	64	3  weeks	11/23/2006
1	allergies	Edgy, obsessive, slightly paranoid. Required little sleep. Very sad sometimes.	Not significantly different than other psuedophredrine type medications. The effects were more subtle and built up over time. I was only taking half a pill a day.	M	40	4  weeks	9/7/2006
1	Allergies/drainage	My son had hyperactivity, extremely aggressive behavior, sleeping problems.	My pediatrician recommended this medicine for my 3 year old son.  The doctor didn't seem to have a problem giving my son the 10mg dose but children his age shouldn't take an adult dose.  My son had a terrible experience with this.  He threw things at us, hit, kicked and slapped us.  He was Dr. Jeckyl, Mr. Hyde with this crap.  Would never give to a child again.  We were at the point we were going to get him "evaluated" when we realized that the Claritin was the problem.  Thank God we did, he's a different child now.	M	3	10  days	7/19/2006
2	allergy symptoms	homicidal tendancies, unable to sleep, bedwetting, lack of interest in the opposite sex, made me want to spend all my time in the kitchen making aioli.	I stopped sneezing	F	23	3  days	7/6/2006
1	no			F		 	5/18/2006
1	allergies, itchy eyes, drainage	The itchy eyes continued as well as the sneezing.   The worst part was the return of intense hot flashes, mood swings, and feeling of exhaustion. I have not taken any tabs for 8 days now and the hot flashes have almost disappeared.  They did however help me sleep.		F	62	10  days	5/8/2006
5	Hives	I haven't experienced any.	These are great. The medication is effective -- and I even take half a dose and it works fine.	M	37	1  years	4/21/2006
3	nasal allergies, sinus congestion	Ended up in the Helps nasl symptoms, but now that I'm tthinking about this, all starting to make sense:  ER 1 month ago due to flushing, rapid heartbeat, cheat tightness feeling of about to pass out.  Had been taking reditabs every other day, sometimes every day.  Also,once in a while, on alternate days taking advil cold & sinus.  Doc had no explanation except "panic attack".  Waking up with an intense anxious feeling even when I'm not stressed.Can't concentrate, depressed more than usual, hot flashes	Hard to pinpoint because symptoms start hours to days after taking this...build up in system?? Took it yesterday, before I cleaned the house (felt fine)  and today rapid pounding heart beat, spacy feeling.  Thought all hormonal, but now curious.  Will stop taking for a while and see what happens.	F	42	7  months	11/25/2005Email
2		thinning hair, fatigue, depression, tendonitis (wrists and ankles), made PMS symptoms worse		F	38	90  days	7/8/2005
5	Hay fever	None	Very effective with no side effect. Worked better than Zyrtec for me as Zyrtec had minor side effects.	F	38	6  years	12/13/2004
5	Persistant allergy problems	none		F	7	4  years	11/14/2001
