3	Psoriasis	It will dry out non psoriatic skin apply carefully and over the years I have built up a tolerance as it is not as effective when first used a decade ago	great first topical of choice for new psoriasis sufferers.	M	40	10  years 1X D	8/12/2011
4	moderate psoriasis	slight tingling the first few times i put it on - only been using for 3 weeks so hope no longer term side effects appear	noticed vast improvement in patches even after 2 weeks - hope that his improvement lasts	F	28	3  weeks	10/27/2009
3	Psoriasis	Mild redness and peeling. Takes a while to really work 6-8 weeks for me. Loses effectiveness over the years on it. Still works wonderful on my forehead and scalp.	Now just in cream form. The ointment worked so much better. My doctor had given me a new form of the dovonex with a power steriod - I don't like the fact that it thins your skin in that form. Not really impressed with Dovonex anymore.	M	39	10  years	7/16/2009
2	scalp psoriasis	None	Didn't work other than provide VERY temporary itching relief.	M	35	8  months	1/14/2009
5	severe psoriasis	No side effects	Cleared psoriasis from legs.  Significantly reduced spots on arms, buttocks and back.	M	583	365  days	7/4/2008
3	Psoriasis		Had used it for many years (ointment) which is now discontinued. It has been less and less effective over time. Really only works on my scalp now as when it is put on my body it has no effect anymore... Once was a very promising drug.	M	35	9  years	1/16/2008
5	Moderate psoriasis	initial reddening and spread of legion area	This stuff works great for me, preferred the ointment but they've discontinued it now, the cream is marginally less effective but it's still very good. 17 years of psoriasis cleared up within weeks, one of the lucky ones.	M	39	3  months	4/18/2007
3	Severe, widespread psoriasis	Immune suppression causing numerous chronic infections, including sinus.  Adrenal suppression (vitamin D *is* a type of steroid, contrary to popular belief), kidney function abnormalities.  Dry mouth, extreme thirst and urination, sleeplessness if used at night.	Taking a one week break from this med, using it once, not twice per day, not at night, can help prevent serious side effects.  It really works best the less of it you apply.  If you can tolerate every other day treatment, endocrine damage may be reduced or preventable.  Ill effects increase with age and length of usage, as well as size of area applied to.

5	psoriasis	some skin dryness in sensitive areas	Dovonex takes a few weeks to really start helping.  It keeps my scalp psoriasis clear, but must be used almost daily. (applied 1x a day)  This seems to be the case with Dovonex in general.  Good for alternating with a steroid to prevent your skin from becoming immune to  to the steroids.	M	41	8  years	2/28/2007
1	Psoriasis	Unsightly peeling skin on my hands, two months after I stopped taking it for my toes.	One toe was cleared of psoriasis, so I perservered with the other big toe. It improved.Alas, the side effects occurred on my hands were minor at first. However, after taking antibiotics for a cold that would not clear up, the side effects of hand peeling (which I had seen before) came back with a vengeance after the course of antibiotics finished. No painful yet, but if it went the way of my feet it would be serious. Worried.	M	54	60  days	3/31/2006Email
3	psoriasis	was told to use the cream in the morning and the ointment at bedtime.  the cream although less greasy seems to work better for me.  the ointment does not work very well.  I also forget to put it on and that is probaby why it is taking some time to clear up.	I really do like this medication much better than the tar based stuff I used in the past.  I have had psoriasis all my life since i was young.	F	33	6  months	4/17/2005Email
4	psoriasis	Initially reddening and peeling	After initial reaction, worked very well to clear me.	F	50	5  years	3/24/2005
5	Nail abnormality	none		M	55	120  days	11/15/2004Email
1	psoriasis	made my psoriasis redder not better!!	doesn't work. Dermovate ointment is great, (clobetasol)!	F	30	2  weeks	7/22/2004
5	psorasis	none	almost completely cleared my severe psorasis in 5 weeks.  Excellent ointment	F	54	2  months	5/18/2004
5	psorasis	none	almost completely cleared my severe psorasis in 5 weeks.  Excellent ointment	F	54	5  weeks	5/18/2004
