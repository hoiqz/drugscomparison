3	TMJ symptoms, headache, shoulder sp	None	It seemed to work okay without any serious side effects. I did notice that I didn't feel "funny" in my head, it didn't effect my head at all, but I think it helped control the spasms. It didn't help when the pain was bad, but I think as a prevenative measure taken regularly it worked OK. I was on Flexeril for 4 weeks & noticed severe hair loss & was sick of being so groggy all the time. I am going to ask my Dr to try something else. I may go back to Baclofen in the future. It would seem to work well if I had something else to take when the pain was severe.	F	24	3  weeks	9/12/2009
4	MS and Fibromyalgia	I had a horrific migraine with the first dose. Since then...not a single problem.	This has been a life saver for me! I am more moblie and not sitting on my rump, waiting for the next spasm. They still come, just not as often. It also really helped with unrinary hesistancy.	F	37	6  months	6/12/2009
5	hiccups	none	My dad was having non-stop hiccups for 2weeks before the doctor prescribed him the drug. It worked for him almost instantly and his life without the hiccups having been soooo much better!!!	M	37	14  days	12/28/2008
4	chronic pain syndrome	maybe a little groggyness at first.	this med helps my muscle to stay loose and keep from cramping. i have noticed the tremors but take cogentin for side effects and that helps. over all i believe this works but i am too chicken to stop taking it to see how much it really helps	F	31	6  months	10/19/2008
3	unknown cause of severe pain.	not many side effects, sleepyness at first, but its a broken sleep that i am now getting used to. the doctor thought it would be easier on the pain factor if he threw in a muscle relaxer, but i found i actually have a harder time carrying my weight because i am about 250 lbs. so i usually take the baclofen when i know i will be close to a bed or couch. it lasts for about 4 hours. but makes me feel odd for a couple of days afterwards...	it does help with the relaxing techniques whether or not that is in my mind is beyond me. i guess i dont really care where the shoes are that we see in person like the nike store and the playtex stores. if i am on a mission for something the pain kinda hides until i give myself a chance to relax. and after this happens it will be hard to get back up and continue the day...

5	To stop cronic hiccups	None	I had hiccups for 6 months, almost every moment of the day. I had GERD (reflux) and hiatal hernia. Hiccups ruined my life during the 6 months. I lost 28 libres due to reflux and hiccups resulting vomiting. Then doctor gave me Baclofen and it stopped the hiccups in an hour. My life changed from then on. I gained weight. I used Baclofen for 3 months and then stopped using. I had no hiccups from then on. A short duration of usage may be sufficient , but I used it for 3 months. I also used NEXIUM for acid reduction.
