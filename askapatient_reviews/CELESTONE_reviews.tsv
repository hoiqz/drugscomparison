1	Upper respiratory	Rapid Heart Rate of 120-160 beats per minute for a week. tingling into my head and spine down arms.  ER visit. Will never take shot again.  Knew a lady who died from one.	Thinking age (41) had an effect with this shot .  Maybe related to hormones in women too. I was on a cycle and maybe potassium was low too.   Had taken it before with little problems.

1	Treated by dr for pneuomia	I was given an injection mix celestone 12 mm & rocephin 5mm the next day I took pill avelox  400mg as directed by dr. I have lost the feeling in my right arm my shoulder and right side of my face, my fingers have feeling, I was taken to the E/R per request from my doctor and had a stroke. I am not sure if the injection that was given to me by the doctors office was the casue of this stroke but I was a healthy 55 man active and no health issues....perhaps this could have cause my illness but I would advise for anyone that might be given celestone to do more research on this medicine.

1	injection in back	hives all over my body everyday for the past 5 weeks.	I had celestone injected in my back and now I break out in hives everyday, it's been 5 weeks. Allergist says you can't be allergic to cortisone but it's an anti-inflammatory and I'm allergic to anti-inflammatorys. How long does it stay in your system. I can't stand the itching and swelling anymore.	F	59	1  days	12/15/2008Email
2	pain in knees	I experienced rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and facial flushing.  The rapid heartbeat has continued now for two weeks, causing a visit to a cardiologist.		F	58	 	6/4/2007
