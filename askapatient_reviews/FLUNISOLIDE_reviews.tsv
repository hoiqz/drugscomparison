1	Nasal allergies; sinus inflammation	Burning in sinuses and nasal passages.	I have used this medication for many years with no problem.  However, after my Part D insurance plan began to purchase it from Rising Pharmaceuticals I began to experience these unpleasantm uncomfortable side effects.  I suspect it is the suspension in which the drug is offered that is the problem.  The drug itself seems to work very well for my needs but the side effects have driven me to make a change.
