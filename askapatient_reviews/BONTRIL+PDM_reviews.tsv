3	weight loss	constipation, mood swings, high blood pressure	I did not loose enough weight because the drug stopped working after about a month. I felt high in the morning and irritable at night.It also made me overly emotional. After I quit ,I was feeling down for days.	F	59	6  weeks	9/28/2004
4	To lose weight quick	None.	It worked for me. I tried it for one month and I lost 15 lbs, also because i was also watching what i ate. EAT VERY LOW CARBS AND STAY AWAY FROM ANYTHING THAT HAS SUGAR! FRUIT IS OK BECAUSE IT'S NATURAL SUGAR. DRINK LOTS OF WATER. THE GOOD THING IS I DIDN'T EVEN EXERCISE.	F	23	1  months	6/23/2004
