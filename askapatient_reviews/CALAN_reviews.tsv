1	Migraines	Fluid Retention whole body beyond unbearable.  Told could not be from this but was only drug on.  Migraines became more frequent.		F	50	3  months60 2X D	11/3/2012
3	PVCs (heart palpitations)	Constipation; gas pains; abdominal pains (usually upper left, under rib cage, sometimes elsewhere, ranging from sharp to dull); heartburn; bloating stomach; hard stools	Worked wonders for getting rid of PVCs, but now the gas pain and digestive issues are really getting to me (about 2 years into taking drug).  I've been to a gastroenterologist and have confirmed GERD.  I suspect it's mainly from the Verapamil, but I can't be sure.  Only had occasional heartburn before going on this drug, with the exception of when I was pregnant.	F	41	2  years120mg 1X D	11/22/2011Email

M	45	8  years240 1X D	7/17/2010
1	Heart Palpitations	Constipation, Upset Stomach, Diarrhea, Sleep Disturbances, Insomnia at times. Awaking at night led to slight panic attacks where heart would race which would bring on heart palpitations.  One night I woke up and swear that my heart was beating so fast that i couldn't even count, but who knows.  Generally a healthy 32 old here without any problems up until now.  I have been off of Verapamil for a week now and the sleep disturbances continue.  Hopefully this will taper off the longer I am off it. UGH!	I wish I had never met this drug.  Not a fan!  I found that I could completely control my heart palpitations by cutting back on my carb and sugar intake.  Try this if you have my condition.  You might be pleasantly surprised.	M	32	30  days	2/3/2010
5	Cluster headaches	Constipation. Poop comes out small and hard. Possibly compounds sleep issues.	It's a lifesaver for me. Cluster headaches feel like a baseball bat to the head. Haven't had one for a year and a half.	F	57	1.5  years	9/1/2009

4	hypertension	The first month I got headaches.  They went away.Severe constipation.  Started on Citrocel.  That cured the constipation.	I take this along with 2 other BP meds.  I have no complaints.	F	55	1  years	12/29/2008
4	migraine prevention	Constipation that was worse the first month or so.  Easily controlled by eating high fiber diet.  Two apples a day did the trick.  Also, verapamil seemed to cause some insomnia.  Made it difficult to tolerate coffee (not much of a problem).	The first month it reduced migraines and daily headache greatly.  Then it seemed to stop working as well.  At three months I was only a little better off than without verapamil.	M	39	3  months	12/29/2008

5	Headaches.	No side effects at all.	Since the age of fifteen I had severe cluster headaches that often lasted for several days and tried many types of medications that didn't help at all.  A doctor suggested I try Calan and it worked right away.  I take one every morning.  Whenever I have an occasional headache it is generally relieved after taking two regular aspirin.

I can not understand why anyone would take a drug or medication that would do more harm than good ?its Insane!! im tired of doctors giving me the same b/s and lieson how good the drug is! hes getting paid a bonus $$ for perscribing it, or got a free trip vacation pre paid somewhere.from the pharm companys!!  I wont stand for anymore Bull !! its Natuaral med time!  as for sure chemicals only cause me harmand sorry but hate liers !	M	50	1  years	4/11/2008

Its hard to adjust to the medication! as Doctor wants me to take larger dose ! im already on a big dose !  and b.p is down!! I dont like ccb's  at all ! they never worked well for me.  also have slight hair loss happeningand Big time Gas bloating problems! with massive cramping in upper back and lower back at times! I think the Mfg companys should go back to the drawing boards -and take out the chemicals or fillers they use, and find out whats causing these stupid side effects to happen -Test it First ! oh yeah Bush screwed up the FDA.. that could be the reason! ??	M	54	30  days	4/1/2008Email
2	Migraines	This medicine stopped my menstrual cycle.		F	24	1  months	1/19/2007
5	cluster headache	none	nothing else prevented cluster headache until i found verapamil.this med is a godsend and i urge anyone with cluster headache to ask to try verapamil.note : dosages are a lot higher than they would be for heart problems. eg im on 720mg a day	M	28	1  years	12/28/2006
5	migraines	none that I noticed	I've suffered from migraines for over 14 years and this is the only thing that has worked to prevent migraines.  I went from a migraine nearly every day to a couple times a week.	F	23	6  months	12/3/2006
4						 	6/2/2006
5	High Blood Pressure	Actually gave me some palpitations.	At first this med was Godsend. Made me feel 25 years younger and lowered my BP quite nicely and even warmed my feet toasty warm!*BUT...then after 1 week I had annoying heart palpitations. Didn't hurt me just annoying. So I give it a *5*   for good measure. I am still experimenting with it some (lowered dosage) and so forth, but alas, I still can get annoying palps from it. Still a good med though.	M	49	6  months	11/14/2005
