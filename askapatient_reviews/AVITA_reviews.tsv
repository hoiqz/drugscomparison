5	Acne	Acne worsened for the first few weeks of treatment; also, before finding a decent moisturizer, skin was dry and flaky.	Had horrible acne as a teenager and as an adult.  Got so sick of it I finally went to my doctor and she prescribed Avita.  My skin is clear now, with only the occasional blemish. Been on it a year now and haven't looked back since.
