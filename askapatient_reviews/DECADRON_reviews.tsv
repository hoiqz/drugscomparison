4	Arthritis in neck	Insomnia, OCD behavior, edgy, constipation and dizziness. It took the pain away within 1 day and prior to that I could not move. Worth the side effects.		F	36	4  days4 mg 4x	3/2/2013
1	Stage 4 Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma	Terror, unbelievable fury, body sensitivity to contact, felt like I was living in the horror of a live nightmare where I might die.	When my dauhter-in-law saw how ill I was she comforted me by saying she wished she was having the treatment for me because she was so much stronger.  I forced myself to not attack her and I've never felt anything like that in my life. When I returned the next day for my second day of chemo the nurse asked me what I was feeling and as soon as I told them I felt like I was dying THEY KNEW it was Decadron and removed it from my treatment.  I gradually felt better within days but I was told I had the opposite reaction to the drug that was supposed to give me euphoria.  I also have the opposite reaction with other steroids.  Once with a frozen shoulder I received a steriod shot for pain and the following pain was truly unbearable for days. At that time that doctor told me I was in the 2% that react the opposite with some drugs		59	1  daysIV /chemo 1X D	12/18/2012Email
1	glioblastoma ( Brain tumor )	Depression, Irritable, cruel, loss of interest in everything, weight gain, Moon face, Over time lost of balance and strength in legs. Blood pressure issues, Very low hearth rate ( under 50 while sitting). Fog minded	This is my DAD. My mom is the main caretaker. The main issue was the jekyll and hyde like switch of the person. When the steroid hit his system he became Mr Hyde. A completely different person. when the dose was reduced to 1MG a day be was then become like a very old 90 year nice man that just sites and watches TV only of others turn it on first. Also the lost of balance stopped and he whent from a whell chair to slow walking with no help. Now with a new treatment they have infected him with more steroid with the other chemo and again Mr Hyde is back and mean as ever. Now that we know what is causing the issue we will be looking into stopping the steroid use. My dad is completely incompatible with the hellish drug. Better to live a shorter life as you really are then live longer has a different person and a stranger to the family	M	65	7  months2MG 2X D	10/27/2012Email

3	Injection due to back spasms	Nausea, headache, mood swing were the side effects, but it took away the spasms in my lower back and burning in my legs that Percocet, baclofen, zanaflex, flexeril, tylenoll 4 could only cure for 3-4 hours.  It's been 12 hours so far with no return of symptoms. I guess I can be a bit crabby and feel like crap if I can breathe without feeling like I'm giving birth.		M	36	1  days	7/12/2012Email

1	Brain tumor	I was starving and HAD to eat every hour on the hour and I ate anything I could get my hands on.  Had terrible night sweats, changing 2-4 times a night.  My faced Deformed so that it looked like it was turned inside out, had 3 chins, gained 40 lbs.	I lost 25 of the 40 lbs, but am stuck and can't lose anymore.  Anyone have any ideas about losing the rest of the weight?  My face is back to normal, though!	F	65	3  months2 mg 1X D	7/6/2012Email

Burning, Loss of sleep, Loss of peripheral vision, Pain and numbness in all body parts , 80 pounds of weight gain, Permanent loss of Gait control, Sevier sweating, loss of sleep and oh the number 1 is a headache which feels like some one is ripping off the top of my head, which has lasted since November of 2010!  	dont let them give it to you!

3	Bee Sting - intense swelling	Agitation/Anger/Rage	My 14 y/o son was given this medication through injection just above he buttocks to help with swelling and pain from a bee sting. He seemed crabby on and off all afternoon, but by about 8:30 that night he was beyond aggitated. He got mad about not being able to watch a movie and flipped out. Screaming and yelling and babbling about things that made no sense. My son NEVER behaves this way. I thought almost immediately that this had to be a reaction the that shot. This fit lasted about an hour, to the point that I was about to get him in the card and take him to the ER. He got himself so worked up that I was certain he was going to pass out because he couldn't breathe. When we finally were able to calm him down and get him to catch his breath, we settled him into his bed and I listened to him cry himself to sleep. This is not normal behavior. I called the Doc's office this morning and was told that it was, indeed, a reaction to the Decordron.	M	14	1  days1 Shot 1X D	5/29/2012Email
1	Cancer	My mother was on this drug for 2 weeks after receiving radiation treatment for a brain tumor. She had stage iv breast cancer that had spread to the lungs and then the brain. Up until she took this drug she was her normal, wonderful self. Decadron robbed my family of the final 2 weeks of my mothers life. She became the EXACT OPPOSITE person. Yelling hateful things at us, acting crazy and refusing any help. She was a strong Christian and on this drug as she was praying she would pray to the 'dark power' and ask for the good to be overcome by evil. It was the most difficult thing I have ever experienced. Months later I researched and found countless other similar stories, including many here. There are better options and this drug should be taken off the market. I hope my writing this saves at least one person from the same torment that my precious mother, and our family, went through.		F	59	2  weeks20 1X D	5/13/2012Email
5	Pulled Back Muscle	First, let me say I am an RN and if I decided to develop a drug habit, this would be my drug of choice.  I was given a dose pack of several pills on the first day with reduction through out the week.  Loved every minute on this drug.  Negative - Taking this medication on a busy day at work when you can't eat.  Your blood sugar will drop suddenly and you will have to stop and eat.  Pros- No pain anywhere on my body.  I organized my house and cleaned it from top to bottom, manicured my yard at 3:00 am with a flashlight in hand.  I had the energy of 10 people and got more done in that one week on decadron than the whole year off of it.   This drug was like an energy pill for me, physically and mentally.   I am not disagreeing that other experienced side effects but for me, it was wonderful.		F	28	1  weeks10mg 1X O	5/10/2012Email

Personally through my experience I didn't like it one bit and I would never take it again!!

1	Croup	December 24, 2011.. My 2 year old was given for croup.  He had extreme rage, tantrums, hallucinations, and psychosis.  It's been almost a months since he had it and he still has episodes.	As a parent, I wish I was given the side effect info and was told how powerful this drug is.  My child still hasn't recovered from this drug!  He will go in spurts, hitting, biting, yelling, tantrums.  This is NOT my child..... He changed completely after this drug.  Went back to his dr and he suggested he might be autistic and this drug activated something that was underlying... going to a behavior specialist.  Come to find out, this drug's effects can last up to 90 days in your system... we were told up to 5 days, which is NOT TRUE!  PLEASE, PLEASE, NEVER give this drug to your children!  This drug should be taken off the market!	F	2	1  days8 mg 1X D	1/11/2012Email

1	strep throat	EXTREME ANGER/RAGE!! Within an hour of getting this injection at local clinic, my pet dog barked near me, and it set me off.  I shoved her roughly and injured her.  I've never acted like that before.  I scared myself and my husband with my behavior.  The only explanation was the decadron injection--which kept me angry and hostile for 24 hours.	This drug may be okay for others.  But I definitely had some type of reaction to it that I will never take it again.  I do have allergies to penicillin and sulfa drugs.

4	uvulaitis	Pain in buttock from injection, very high energy level, non stop talkative, insomnia and it has been 22hrs since the injection and I still feel very energetic and my face and neck are red like I have a sun burn.. It defenitly took the swelling in my throat away.		F	26	1  days1x	12/20/2011Email
1	Brain tumor - inter cranial fluid	This medication is the devils cocktail. I experienced the following symptoms when taking dexamthasone. Hair growth on face, 75lb weight gain, steroid acne on chest and upper back, moon face, hump in upper neck, loss of bladder control, got sick very easily (immune system is depressed when taking this med), loss of period completely, a certain smell to my sweat, swelling in joints, loss of muscle mass in thighs and calfs. When I had the brain tumor removed and started to taper off, on the last day I experienced pain and was unable to look at light. The following day the pressure in my eyes increased and they started to bulge and I almost went blind. I had to take this med to keep me alive long enough to have surgery. If I ever god forbid get another brain tumor I will not take this medication. Oh I almost forgot, this medication caused osteonectosis aka AVN of my hip, knee, and ankle joints. I have had 2 bone surgeries to date.		F	26	2  months12mg a day	12/18/2011Email
5	arthritis/inflammation hip and back	Insomnia but worth it. My back and hip.pain is greatly reduced!		F	45	2  years?	12/3/2011
2	Asthma	pain at injection site (upper arm) which remained sore for about an hour.  I am now 9 hours post injection and my breathing is actually worse, so it didn't help that at all.  It DID give me a raging headache, the joints in my legs and hips are incredibly painful...this pain seems to be working its way up my torso as i type this, and my skin hurts...as if i have a 2nd degree sunburn all over my entire body and like every single inch of my skin is bruised (reaction i've had to oral prednisone, so i was prepared for this discomfort)...it hurts when anything touches my skin, clothing, the sheet, everything...	side effects would be ok IF the medication made it so i could breathe...

3	Brain stem gilomia	I have taken this drug off and on since 1990 I agree it is a evil drug and I let myself get pretty bad before I allow the drs to start me on it.  I just changed to avastin and after second tx had the worst ha of my life couldn't stand and couldn't keep my eyes open.  Each time I have to start them I try to start with the lowest dose and add if I need to.  As low as 2nd a day as much as 16 mg a day.  		F	50	21  days2mg 1X D	10/18/2011Email
1	metastatic brain lesions	Face, stomach swelling. Ache on face. Muscle loss in legs. Loss of taste, ulcer like feeling in mouth, indigestion. Worst of all -- pscyhosis, hallucination confusion-zombie like periods.	My wife is taking this drug for brain swelling due to lesions. It worked in that it took away her headaches and dizziness. She completed whole brain radiation a few days ago but now she had an aggressive-psychotic break last night, recovered and is in a kind of dump stupor at the moment. Rad/onc said to taper faster. She was given haldol to take to counter hallucinations. I'm wondering how long this will last. This is not my wife and it is terrifying. This drug is a beast and it seems like some of the three doctors she has seen would have said something like this was possible.	F	34	4  weeks4 4X D	9/19/2011Email
1	glioblastoma multiforme stage 4	swollen face, neck, ankles and feet.  Weight gain, increased appetite.  Total loss of muscles in arms and legs.  My dad can no longer walk and is bedridden in a  nursing home!  Thinning skin on arms...purple marks all over arms...easily bruised.	This drug is pure evil....I can't believe that my dad has been on this drug since March and every time they try to wean him off of it they end up having to put him back on.  He is so far gone and even the doctors admit it is the decadron.  They say his MRI for his tumor remains unchanged and that he is okay in that respect.  It's not the brain cancer killing him...its this god awful drug!  Hopefully we can get him back with the help of an endocrinologist.  My dad was a strong man with no health issues before this.	M	63	6  months4mg 1X D	8/25/2011
1	Stubborn Rheumatoid Arthritis flare	RAGE!  Irrational behavior, edema of feet/legs/hands, moon face, uncontrollable shakes, blurry vision, racing heart, dizziness, numbness in extremities.	This stuff is horrible.  I've never experienced so many side effects from any medication I've ever taken.  After several weeks of progressively worsening symptoms, I stopped taking the drug and went back on plain old prednisone, after I realized that I could kill someone and it wouldn't have bothered me.  It's starting to work its way out of my system and I hope it hurries!	F	57	6  weeks4 mg 1X D	8/15/2011
3	Migraines	shakes, anxiety, panic attacks, confusion, cold sweats, hot flashes, thrush, swollen gums, face and tongue, GERD, acid reflux, sore throat, tingling sensation in hands and feet, high blood pressure and pulse, heart racing, dizzy, fatigue, asthma, racing thoughts, loss of taste, painful to touch skin mostly in chest, neck, shoulder & head areas, on and off blurry vision.	Had incredibly high blood pressure & pulse on 5th day of taking the medication. Stopped the medication on 7/20/11 & that night ended up with terrible acid reflux.  The next morning started to experience the pain normally associated w/withdrawal of steroids but had terrible sore/lump in throat & starting signs of thrush.  Sore throat, lump & overall steroid pain diminishing by the 23rd but by then lost taste & looked like the center on my tongue was scraped off.  It's now the 26th & I am still experiencing high anxiety but am taking xanax to counteract that, & medication for thrush.  I still feel completely out of it at times.	F	32	5  days4mg 2X D	7/26/2011Email
4	Brain Tumor ICP brain swelling	Hot flashes, severe "moon face"  appetite increase, insomnia, joint pain, shaky all the time, heart palpitations, can't even hold a fork right without tremors, eye dryness or pressure	I never experienecd the euphoria some people reference, but it does help with the swelling significantly.  The pain experienced with it is definitely unpleasant but trying to manage.  The tremors are constant and the moon face is surprising although I monitor my diet and haven't gained as much weight, but cravings are unbelievable....difficult to manage and make sure I don't go overboard on things.  Often hungry during sleep even, have woken up from pain in joints/muscles and struggle to fall/stay asleep.	F	30	30  days12mg 2X D	6/24/2011Email
4	Brain Tumor Radiation/Chemo	Swelling in knees, ankles, face.  Unrelenting appetite which led to weight gain.  Acne on chest, back, upper arms, and face.  Racing heart, jittery hands.  Impossible to get a full night of sleep (3 uninterrupted hours was a GOOD night).	Decadron was a necessary evil.  If I hadn't been taking this nastiness, my brain would have continued to be inflamed, causing me more massive headaches and making my life hell.  I would say the worst side effects were the appetite/weight gain, swelling, and the acne.  No 29 year old wants to look like they're 16 again!	M	29	2  months3MG 2X D	6/20/2011
5	allergies/head cold	insomnia of course- its a steroid. energy.enthusiasm.	great for head colds. I also give one 4 mg tab once a week for my dog with skin allergies.it clears my head up all day and I dont have the cold flu like symptoms until dark. thumbs up. it can be addictive because of its energy qualities. I have to back out at times. it also shuts down immunity so I just take it when I really really need it.	F	36	1  years4mg 1X D	6/3/2011Email
1	Rads Breast Cancer Mets to Skull	OMG, I HATE this drug.  My quality of life is zip on it. Felt great before.  Feel generally weird on it. Loopy I guess.  Blurry vision, feet and leg cramps, severe abdominal bloating and pain, feel like I can't breath, mood swings and bitchiness (roid rage), legs feel like spaghetti, joint pains gone but seem to be loose and weird now, muscle weakness, thought I was having chest pains but then think it's the bloating instead causing it, wake up in middle of night and can't go back to sleep, get dizzy, sweats, headaches, can't taste anything so I feel like I need to keep looking for something to eat because I don't feel satisfied-no taste food causing me to gag, mouth tastes sweet all the time, blood pressure up when never had high blood pressure, wondering about blood sugar levels, probably not drinking enough because of not being able to taste anything.  Doctor says I have no choice because radiation can cause brain to swell, which would not be good.  Has me on low, low dose now.	Decadron is the pill from HELL.  If I wasn't worried about my brain swelling from radiation and causing major problems, I would not take the stuff!  I am miserable and have 2 1/2 more weeks to take the stuff.  No telling what state I'll be in by that time!	F	47	3  weeks2 mg 2X D	5/25/2011Email

When I called they hospital the next am..they said I was sensitive to it and to take 50 mg of Benadryl.  Well I called Pharmacy that has all meds listed...as did the ER also...and was told by Pharmacist it is an ALLERGIC REACTION AND TO ADD IT TO THE LIST OF ALLERGIES..they also added to computer.  ER nurse said I would be ok soon...NOT TRUE...My eyes are wide open STILL.  THIS STUFF NEEDS A RELEASE SHEET TO SIGN BEFORE ADMINISTERING IT   In My Opinion....	F	50	1  days10 1X D	3/29/2011Email

1	brain swelling due to meningiomas	Took this drug in 1996 for radiation therapy and gained 60 pounds, ate like a horse, had severe headaches and thought the room only spun in one direction.....fast forward to January 2011 and ended up in the ER and ICU due to stomach flu I couldn't shake due to the tumors.   Back on Decadron I go and now after 10 days they have pulled me off of it entirely.  Can't focus in the mornings, room is moving, vertigo again, feels like my right side of my face is sliding to the floor and the headaches.....I felt better in the hospital......muscle weakness on the left side.  Radiation Treatment due to start in 2 weeks, 6 weeks again.....guess what they want to put me back on.	This drug is like a poison.   Took me 15 years to get off all the weight, and lose all the side effects of the decadron.	F	49	10  days.75 2X D	2/2/2011
1	Strep Throat	EXTREME mental changes, sweats, shakes, dizziness, fogginess.	NEVER, EVER take this drug. I don't understand why it is not illegal. It is pure hell. The first day I received it through my IV I had no side effects whatsoever. But yesterday i went back to get my 2nd and 3rd dose and it made me absolutely bat shit crazy. It's been 12 hours and the side effects still haven't worn off. I was screaming and cussing like there was no tomorrow, and I never behave that way. It's repulsing. My sore throat is gone but I would gladly welcome it back if my side effects would disappear. I suggest asking if there is ANYTHING else you could possibly have in place of decadron because you WILL be miserable. I feel like i'm in hell and when my mom reported it they said it can stay in my system for up to 10 days. I honestly feel like there's no possible way I'll still be even the tiniest bit sane after all this for 10 days.	F	17	2  days 1X D	1/29/2011Email

Trouble sleeping through the night, always hungry, my legs are starting to get weak- my nurse brought a walker to my home today, I feel out of it- disconnected when it is fully in my system but have trouble functioning without it at times. I hate it! If my life didn't depend on this dumb pill I would stop taking it today.		M	54	4  months4mg 3X D	1/19/2011

4	strep throat	None really. Took a while for swelling in throat to come down, as what they gave me the shot for. Bad diarrhea, not 100 percent sure caused by shot because I am also on an antibiotic. Day two swelling is a bit up but not as bad as originally.		F	25	1  timesshot ??mg 1X O	12/7/2010
3	Edema due to benign meningioma	Insomnia (averaged 2 or 3 hours a night in spurts), insatiable appetite, moonface, skin eruptions, irritability, "crashing" (cease to function and have to lie down immediately), increased thirst, "froth mouth" (all beverages tasted "frothy", major OCD, mood swings, racing thoughts (sometimes irrational), extreme fatigue at times and extreme energy other times, craving for sweets, dry mouth at night, the list goes on . . .	I am sure that the Decadron assisted with swelling post-op and for that I am grateful but I could not wait to get off of this drug. As I tapered off, I would have an hour in the early morning when I felt like myself. I would wake my husband and say "Say hello to your wife before she's gone again".  Once I took the Decadron, it was only a matter of time before I crashed and became agitated. My last pill was 6 days ago, skin eruptions are much better, I am sleeping again (for the most part), moods are much better, energy level increasing, OCD calming down A LOT, "froth mouth" gone, decreased appetite and thirst, still have moonface and have now developed stiff neck and severe headaches over the past 48 hours. Trying to get into see doctor because the headaches aren't being relieved by Tyelnol. I also think I have found a "nodule" at the base of my skull and it's very sore.  :(	F	44	5.5  weeks4 mg 3X D	12/1/2010

Trying to rebuild muscles with stricter excercise regime. Moving onto next stage - steam-cell replacement therapy.		M	44	4  months10 MG 1X W	11/28/2010
1	renal disease-mesoangiocap type 3	I wasnt on Decadron but similar- Over the 18 days on Prednisolone (Panafcortelone) treatment my symptoms varied- started on 100mg every 2nd day for 4 days then because of side effects went to 50mg every day- the worse was the intense cranial pressure (felt like my head was in a vice), Blood pressure out of control, face/lips numb, shakes, unconrollable crying, nerves shot, jittery, unsteady on feet. Then once bp was controlled with cocktail of other drugs came the neck pain (felt like head was too heavy for shoulders). Lying down was only relief. Massive abdominal oedema where I was hungry but could eat as it hurt my stomach. Depression, mood swings. Insomnia was actually a relief as after 3-4 hrs sleep I'd wake feeling not bad. After morning medicine things would go down hill...

3	Pneumonia/ seasonal allergies	1st day great. First time I could breath again in years. Notice arthritis went away to. Felt great UNTIL day 2 them OMG shakes, nervousness, depression crying and anger. Insane feeling,no sleep,shaking, leg cramps, major body aches, out of control feeling, bad itching all over. On day 6 and not getting better	I went in for pneumonia and they mentioned this shot cuz of my allergies as well so I figured why not. No side affects were mentioned. It did clear me up and I have never felt so good from joint pain and can breath great BUT will never take again as side effects are to bad. Lost a week of work, a trip to see family and more. The doctor should make this clear and clearly did not. Everything you read on this drug is that it is very strong. Crazy they would give at a clinic so casually. I hope this helps someone and wish I knew beforehand. I am an advocate now t at least beware of what can happen. It may be needed but should be well thought out first.

1	post brain surgery glioblastoma	severe swelling of face and neck, leg muscles weakened so much he could not walk, extreme restlessness up every minute to five minutes to 30 minutes throughout the night, incontinence, blood sugar became uncontrollable--- went so high it was out of range.This beloved man could not tell us what he was experiencing after major brain surgery but as care giver this is what I observed. I believe the drug just weakened his legs so severely that he could not walk. And that it just wore him out completeley, as well as those who were privileged to care for him.  I would never recommend this drug, I believe it contributed greatly to killing him. The doctors say it is now in my blood also. Be sure to wear gloves if you have to handle the bed clothes and undergarments of a person taking this drug.  I also feel very strongly that oral Temodar for chemotherapy is a cruel, painful, dangerous, ineffective way to treat brain cancer.  They don't even know if it passes through the brain/blood barrier.	The doctors and hospice people tried to convince me this is a good drug, but from my experience with it 24/7 for 4 months I just can't believe it. I think it is very destructive and dangerous. I would not take it. Neither would I take Temodar. Thank you for the opportunity to express my views. It helps the heartache if I can help someone else.	F	67	3  months4mg 3X D	9/23/2010
5	allergies, asthma, bronchitis	None really, I feel better within minutes, maybe tend to urinate more for a day after	This drug has helped me immensely throughout my life.

5	Wheezing due to asthma	The only downside I have experienced with the decadron is joint pain for a few days after the shot. The pain is tolerable though. Without this medication I would probably be dead by now.	I have severe asthma with chronic bronchitis. I use an albuterol inhaler and a 6 times a day albuterol breathing treatment. When the bronchitis starts to worsen the medications start to lose effect. The decadron kicks in within hours and lasts for a month or so. Very effective. I even sometimes put some in my breathing treatment, because breathing it in is better, it goes directly to the source.	F	23	15  years2 mg 1X AN	9/12/2010Email
1	Strep Throat	Within 5 minutes - confusion, sick to my stomach, shortness of breath, complete vision loss, near blackout, numbness traveled down both arms into hands, unable to feel arms for hours which turned into painful tingling in both arms and hands, weakness, insomnia, increased appetite.  Day two - Confusion, dizziness, tingling in arms and hands continued, tingling developed in both legs and feet, insomnia increased, no appetite.  Day three - confusion increased, dizziness increased, tingling in arms and hands continued, tingling in both legs and feet continued, irritability began, shaking began, no appetite.	I was not told I was being given a Decadron shot.  The only thing I have ever been given for strep throat is an antibiotic.  Had I been told this is what I was being given, I would have refused.  I have a history of seizures and would never have agreed to receive this.  This drug is horrible!!  After reading these posts, it seems that this drug is given for very serious medical issues, which makes it even harder for me to understand why the doctor gave it to me for strep throat, which I get almost every year, and recover from just fine within a few days on oral antibiotics.  It also sounds like it takes a long time for this mess to be completely out of your system.  I want it out NOW!!!!	M	43	1  times1 shot 1X D	8/25/2010

I thought I was going crazy, I did not say anything to my family. My mental health among other things got affected.  Thank you very much for this website, It makes me feel better, metally. (it has been a month since the shot) I visited my doctor on Friday, and after questions and questions, she said thay maybe I was suffering side effects due to the shot. It is insane.

It was probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced. This medication is not on my list of DO NOT TAKE drugs.	I was not told any side effects for this drug. My doctor simply gave me a shot because I had a broken foot/ruptured tendons that would not heal.  Turns out- I'm allergic to decadron. For 2 days I was deathly ill and could not get out of bed.

They gave me an 8mg dose of Decadron and 50mg of Benadryl to counteract the allergy. It has been 5 days, and the side effects are still in full force. I don't know how long this will last, but it's affecting my job performance and social life.  I would have rather dealt with the side effects from the original allergic reaction.  This drug is by far, the worst thing that has ever been in my body. I am a very upbeat, positive, social person...and this drug makes me want to crawl into a cave and cry or scream.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS.

His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011

Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!	M	37	21  days10 1X D	2/24/2011Email
5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
