1	Major Depression with anhedonia	Dry mouth, difficulty urinating, somewhat decreased sex drive/anorgasmia, constipation, heptatoxicity.	I took this medicine because of my anhedonic depression (apathy, lack of drive, inability to feel pleasure, feeling "empty," etc.). It felt like a sugar pill other than the side effects, which I guess alerted me that the medicine was at least in my body. It wasn't good on my liver so I had to stop.

5	Depression & anxiety	Serious constipation, dry mouth, trouble sleeping, weight gain		F	40	2  years150	4/19/2012
2	dysthymia, bulimia	trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, binge eating/compulsive over-eating, weight gain	This medication brought back my bulimia, which was in remission for over a year. It caused me to have very strong urges to binge eat daily after being on it for a few weeks that I could not fight despite using all my therapeutic tools I could think of. Additionally, I had previously been able to cope with episodes of overeating without purging since my recovery from my eating disorder, though not while on this medication. It seemed to increase my impulsivity in that way, which is counter to almost evertying else I've read about this medication. Also, it didnt' do much for my depressive symptoms (if anything it made it worse because of how out of control I felt with the return of the bingeing and purging and fear of weight gain).

5	Depression	Dry mouth, constipation, lightheadness when I stand up suddenly, itching, sleep disturbances.	I was put on this medication as one of my last resorts after trying nearly every other anti-depressant on the market and having to discontinue them because I couldn't tolerate the side effects.  This medication has been wonderful.  I feel less depressed than I have in a decade and the most of the side effects either went away completely or were greatly reduced after a couple of weeks on the medicine.  My dosage was very slowly increased from 25mg to 75mg and now I feel great.  Hooray!!	F	42	2  months75mg 1X D	5/24/2010
2	Depression	Gained 30 pounds, difficulty urinating, dry mouth, forgetfulness, stammering, constipation, craving for sweets	This med gave me very little benefit and a LOT of crummy side effects.  I hope everybody else has a better experience with it!	F	45	6  months	1/14/2010
3	depression	weight gain, occasional constipation	It was recommended in a trial of R-EEG to find what meds should work best for me.  It worked ok for a while at a high dose of 250 mg and now I'm at 350 mg and it's quit working.  worked ok for about 6 months but I've been through over 10 anti-depressants and nothing's worked for long.  I've gained 20 pounds since starting to take it.	F	61	10  months	10/27/2009
2	depression	acid reflux in the morning, change in sleep cycle (couldn't stay asleep as long, felt too cold or too hot, some minor nausea	I started on the lowest possible dose of 10mg at night.  On the second day I couldn't stay asleep more than 4 hours.  After that I started taking it in the morning.  My sleep pattern was still altered.  Also, immediately after I woke up I would have the worst acid reflux.  I gave up after 7 days.  I know its not enough time to judge a drug but my tolerance for these kind of side effects is really low.	M	55	7  days	5/10/2009
1	Panic disorder	Extreme worsening of panic attacks: more frequent and more intense.	Do not recommend taking this for panic attacks or anxiety.	F	22	10  days	1/17/2009
4	depression/anxiety	dry mouth, heart palpitations, increased sweating. -no weight gain	Desipramine was the 1st anti-depressant that I took. It worked well for me. I went on it very slowly....probably taking about 6 months to get to my daily dose of 200mg (taking 100mg 2xday). I was so glad to be feeling "happy" that I did not care about the side effects. After going off it, however, when I became pregnant...then going back on, it seemed to lose its effectiveness. I had to switch to a new med and am still trying to find one that I can live with and that works well.	F	39	7  years	8/25/2008
5	depression/ add/ panic disorder	dry mouth, increased appetite	I am very pleased with this medication it replaced- wellbutrin and adderall- I pay cash for my rxs so this saves me about $80 per month.  It also seems to do better than my other medications!	F	33	45  days	5/5/2008
5	antidepression	Tried multiple drugs.  This one combined with zoloft helps without drowsiness.		F		3  months	7/17/2007
5	Morning depression	A short while after taking, experienced brief heart flutter. Occasional constipation. Awakening after a few hours of sleep at night just once every night, but can tolerate this, considering the superlative help it has given me for morning depression.	A God-send! A life-saver! A tricyclic without the sedating effects the others have. Weaned myself down from 75 mg. daily to 25 mg. daily for years; upped dose to 50 mg. daily at bedtime to avoid flare-ups. An oldie but goodie! Superb drug!	M	64	26  years	1/10/2006
4	depression	There are few side efects for me.  One is waking up only after a few hours od sleep.  The other is weight gain. The weight gain has only been in the last 4 months.  I've gained 15 pounds.		F	48	3  days	11/15/2005
4	depression	dry mouth		F	41	2  years	9/12/2004
5	Anxiety/Depression	Only side effects have been constipation and a slightly increased heart rate.	This drug was a God send.  It has completely cured me of my despression/anxiety. I feel normal again.	F	54	12  years	8/9/2004
5	Depression and Drug addiction	Dry mouth, increased heart rate, somewhat higher anxiety (but I am treated for anxiety already).  The one good side effect I had was an very high increase in my libedo! (husband is very happy)!  I do have some weight gain which is my only concern.  But when I figure I haven't attempted suicide since I have started this med, the weight gain is the least of my problems.		F	40	1  years	2/26/2004
5	depression	dry mouth and constipation were the worst but seemed so subside after the first two weeks.  Another strange side effects is my urine is very concentrated even though I drink between three and four liters of water a day.		F	30	22  days	10/18/2002
2	Depression/ADD	No effect other than a rash over my arms and legs		F	17	2  days	5/21/2002
