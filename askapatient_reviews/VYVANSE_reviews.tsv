5	Eating disorder,racing thoughts	-Loss of appetite-insomnia (better the second day)-Always thirsty, never feel like I have had enough water-Frequent urge to pee, even when I do not have to-Rapid heart beat when doing anything other than sitting or lying down	Although I have only been on this med for a few days, I have already felt the effects, and side effects. Right now I am on 20mg, but am going up to 60 gradually (over 10 days). My psych prescribed this med for a few reasons. I have bipolar disorder, rapid cycling, mix-ed state (which means, without meds, I have it consistently). Even with meds, I have racing, obsessive thoughts. This drug has helped immediately. What used to keep me up at night doesn't anymore. I can focus on things without being distracted by several negative things at once. I am also on this because I struggle with bulimia, and have for 15 years. This medication suppresses my appetite, which helps me not think about food, and not be hungry. I do have to force myself to eat so that I do not fall back into anorexia. I'm finding myself more upbeat, and more focused on tasks.	F	32	4  days20 1X D	6/20/2013
5	ADD	Definitely helps me focus, just tapers off in the late after noon...and unfortunately I strongly believe that I am the only person that has not dropped any weight. I'm overweight and figured that would be a plus. Nope, other than that this medicine has helped me with work, home and relationships.		F	34	5  months70 mb	6/10/2013Email
3	ADD	Insomnia, Depression, loss of appetite, agitation, aggression,	I've been medicated for A.D.D since age six. I've tried countless medications for it : Ritalin Adderal, patches, you name it. When I started taking Vyvanse it was great. The only side effect was that I wasn't really hungry and could miss a meal or two and as a teen girl, sadly, I didn't see that as a problem. I started to notice that on the days I forgot to take it, I felt just terrible. I was aggressive, I didn't want to do anything, I couldn't wait to leave school, I couldn't stop eating, everything made me stressed. I've also been depressed and can hardly sleep and I'm not sure what to do anymore. Do your kids a favor. Instead of medication try meditation..meds should be a last resort.

5	ADD	Slightly lower appetite, easier to stay in shape (girlfriends have appreciated this...), mild OCD-esque tendencies (e.g. more attention to hygiene, desk organization, paper formatting, etc.; occasional knuckle-cracking), drowsiness in mid-afternoons that I deal with by taking a nap or drinking some coffee, heightened sociability (sometimes spend too long talking to people and get less work done as a result), sometimes procrastinate on stressful work by doing other less valuable work but I think I've always done this, sense that time is passing more quickly when I'm working on projects (more "flow" states, in the positive psychology sense), better self-esteem, less facial oiliness and acne, more facial oiliness and risk of acne breakouts if too much caffeine is consumed, dry mouth for the first few months but has since stopped, some reduction in sex drive, occasional depression or irritability in evenings but taking a late-afternoon 20mg dose and a morning dose of extended-rel	Enables me to do abstract mathematics, prevents making so many stupid errors when writing software, helps me understand complex material.  It's as if the structures I build in my mind are held frozen in place instead of bouncing around and falling apart like they used to.  Makes the constant songs/soundbytes/static running through my head stop.  Makes me less forgetful/"absent-minded".  I no longer space out in the middle of conversations/presentations/work all the time.  Makes me more articulate and poised; helps prevent speaking (or snapping...) before thinking.  Helps me notice details, subtleties.  Slight anti-anxiety.  Makes me more motivated and better at planning.  Can better harness my natural creativity.  Has improved my career, income, and self-esteem beyond my wildest dreams.  Takes ~40-60 minutes to notice effects; ~90 to fully kick in.  Mild euphoria from ~T+60min to ~T+180min.  Some afternoon drowsiness.  Makes naps feel better for some reason.  Annoyingly only lasts ~5-7 hrs, so I also take a 20mg late afternoon dose: some still appears to be in my system by then, just not enough to do what it's supposed to.  Surprisingly not very addictive.  If I stop taking it, I initially sleep a lot and feel unmotivated, but am mostly fine after 2-3 days.  No headaches or cravings, unlike caffeine.  No desire whatsoever to abuse it; was at higher dose at first and felt robotic, terrible.  Costly (esp. 2x/day), but insurance covers most and effectiveness worth ever	M	22	2  years40+20 1X D	5/9/2013

4	ADD/ADHD	I absolutely LOVE that I stay focused. Some days when I don't eat breakfast before taking it, I can stay focused ALL day. Other than that if I take it at 9am.. It usually wears off around like 4pm.. Which sucks. I use to take 2 different Mgs a day. 30mg in the morning and 20 around lunch. I quit doing that because of cost issues. Vyvanse side effects for me include: dry lips, can't sleep when on it..after it wears off its still hard to fall asleep (somedays), bad attitude/anger sometimes towards small things, headaches, weight loss definitely ( I went from 138lbs in November 2012 to now April 2013 weighing 114lbs) people say I look sick and need to gain like 10 lbs but I try and I can't unless I don't take the medication for a long period of time. It usually speeds me up in the morning and slows me down later in the day causing me to feel tired but cannot fall asleep for at least an hour. I often crack my knuckles on this also. And bite my lips. It's became a habit in the 4 years since I've started vyvanse. Also, I feel the urge to have a bowel movement every morning around 11 am if I take it at 9. Sometimes it's so bad it makes me cramp up. My finger tips are always cold no matter what. I pick at my face also a lot when I am on this (my mom & boyfriend call it "crackhead tendencies") I also take Zoloft for anxiety, which I think is a great combination with vyvanse. It definitely helps the trembling hands and grinding teeth at times. I usually don't have an appetite		F	21	4  years30 MG	4/10/2013Email
3	ADD,Medication-resistant depression	Sweating, skin rashes, yeast infections, itching, dry eyes, reflux, headaches, anger, irrational thoughts, total disinterest in food, weight loss, immediate rebound weight gain when off the drug, picking at skin, fits of anger that are out of proportion, strong chemical smell/taste of all body fluids, obsessive behavior regarding getting/taking the drug (counting how many pills are left, worrying about getting next prescription in time).	Vyvanse does help to make me more focused/alert/talkative/energetic for about 3 hours, I then feel the effects drop off, tempting me to take another dose. When I do take a second dose, it often causes me to feel agitated and have increased physical symptoms. I've tried several times to come off this drug, but usually only last about a month before I ask to be put back on it. I imagine that I am addicted to it, and will be on it long-term.

4	ADHD and possible aspergers	Weakened synesthesia (rare condition that makes my senses cross...i see sound as color etc.), headaches, no appetite, dry mouth, dizziness, cold hands and feet, mild muscle soreness, increased heart rate when it is at full strength (around noon), mild stomach pain, shaking hands.	The first day I took it was horrible and I didn't even go to school. The second day was a lot better but I had no desire to eat what so ever. I had to make myself eat and drink which took away a lot of the symptoms. I recommend eating right before you take it because even though you probably won't be hungry you still needs food to run. Eating also really helps with being dizzy but be careful not to eat too much or you might feel sick-just a snack will do.    I've been much more productive then I usually am but I still have to push myself to start the work I need to do. I told my teachers that I started the medicine for my ADHD and what it was supposed to do. I also told them that there may be side effects and they told me if I needed to step out of the classroom or do whatever it was fine with them. Most of my teachers were happy to know that I started it because they know I'm smart but I struggle when it comes to getting school work done and I'm a horrible test taker. My test grades have actually improved a little since I started vyvanse even thought today is only my 3rd day. I'm also a lot more social which is a huge improvement for me because I'm usually very shy (possible aspergers).	F	17	3  days30 mg 1X D	2/16/2013Email
4	excell in school	rush of happiness, emotional roller coaster, increased motivation, more effort into work, memory loss (short and long term - is not affected when i haven't taken it) uncontrollable shakes in hands and legs, feeling cold EVERYWHERE all the time, sweating even when i'm cold, lack of interest in socialization, very deep thinking, i've been told i come across as rude or unhappy, when i'm really just focused, LACK OF APPETITE: causes fatigue, low blood sugar/irritability, bi-polar symptoms. vyvanse does not cause these symptoms, rather they are responses to the hunger your body doesn't recognize.	i don't feel it as much when i take it several days in a row, i feel it more when i haven't taken it for a few days (such as on a monday when i didn't take it all weekend) must be digested/taken orally. overall i like vyvanse and when taken responsibly it can be helpful, but a high dosage is not needed and you shouldn't take it on an empty stomach... if you feel yourself becoming unhappy or irritable, EAT SOMETHING particularly with natural sugars or protein (apples and peanutbutter, people)	F	17	3  months30 mg 1X D	2/6/2013Email
4	ADHD	dry mouth, hearing occasional noises that are not there, dizzyness, loss of appetite, constipation, increased heart rate, heart palpitations, detachment, inability to sleep, lack of physical energy	Vyvanse has completely eliminated all of my symptoms of ADHD and really helps me to focus in school, having raised my GPA from a 3.2 (before any medication) to a 3.8 (since taking vyvanse). It even alters my state of mind, motivating me to work hard, as well as enabling me to work efficiently. However, grades are the only positive effect I have seen, and I will most definitely stop taking it when I am out of school. When I take vyvanse I become a completely different person: obsessive, pessimistic, lethargic, angry, and almost incapable of laughing or smiling. On the days I forget to take it (or on the weekends when I choose not to), everyone notices an extreme change in my personality--back to the "regular me" who likes to laugh and do stupid things. The obsession is sort of like OCD...but only when I take vyvanse...making me only stress over messiness and imperfection, but never doing anything about it. Because I am typically a hyperactive person, vyvanse has taken away all of my energy, leaving me incapable of exercising or completing simple tasks. It makes me feel separate from reality, constantly spinning, hearing things, and staying away from people. Monday-Friday when I take vyvanse, I can't fall asleep until at least 4am and even then wake up throughout the night, and somehow I am still able to fully focus the next day when waking up at 7am But when I don't take vyvanse, the lack of sleep catches up to me and I require about 14 hours  of sleep.

5	ADHD	NO appetite, extreme weight loss, cold hands and feet, insomnia, dry mouth, jaw clenching, increased sex drive, increased smoke cravings, dizziness when coming off, crazy sweats, sense of euphoria, and very mild depression when coming off sometimes.	Vyvanse has been a God send ! I do what I need to do on a daily basis without getting distracted. Every relationship in my life has improved, I think more rationally and my grades are at an all time high.15 pound weight loss in the first 3 weeks and it is still declining, I hate that I sweat all the time and that my hands and feet are freezing cold and sometimes go numb. Despite these side effects, Its worked wonders for me so far; I see myself going very far in life as being a reality not a dream anymore.	F	18	1  months50 MG 1X D	12/10/2012

3	ADD	calve and back muscles tightening. TIghtening of head muscles at times, mouth and jaw tension. Sometimes head ache or tenderness abouve eyes on forehead.	My suggestion to everyone is go on corepsych.com and anything you want to know about this medication, how to make it work, etc. These meds wont work if your not eating plenty of protien in the morning, and NOT a protien drink. They have LESS side effects if you eat properly. If you are having major side effects than you are on to high of a dose. You will know when you read this site and pay attention to your body.

1	ADHD	Heart palpitations, excessive sweating while working out, severe anxiety/agitation, vision impairment/ whiting out during withdrawal period	As a freshman ivy league student, I thought I needed Vyvanse to  excel in school, I was wrong. Yes, initially Vyvanse helped me focus, but over time the negative effects began to outweigh the positives. Regardless of what physicians, pharmacists, or pharmaceutical companies say, Vyvanse is an addictive drug. Perhaps the exact chemical compound itself is less addictive than alternatives, but the effects it has on your brain and pscyhe are certainly cause for concern. I share my opinions with you out of geniune concern for American adolescents. Vyvanse and similar drugs are not to be taken without warning. There are no longitudinal studies to demonstrate their safety, but in from my own experiences, they are not safe long term. Yeah I graduated and yeah I did well in school, but had I know the pain, self-doubt, panic attacks, tics, generalized anxiety and depression Vyvanse would eventually cause me, I never would have taken it. When I began Vyvanse I did not understand its potency. I didn't understand that it could change my personality. In retrospect I would have traded the concentration and focus Vyvanse provided me for my mental and physical health without hesitation. Vyvanse is a serious drug with real life-altering side effects, please consider this before taking it. Yes Vyvanse can help in the short term, but not without consequences. Before popping that pill and starting down the slippery slope of legitimized drug addiction, consider your happiness, sanity and ability t	F	23	2  years30 1X D	12/3/2012
4	ADD	Dry mouth, chapped lips, less sleep, weight loss (20+ pounds), very small appetite, diarrhea (1st day only), super focused	I will say I do love Vyvanse. BUT on 50MG I am too focused, I feel as if my brain is trying to go super fast with ideas but I can't get them out. I don't take it if I don't have school and I love not taking it because I am me again. My doctor said it wouldn't change my personality but it has. I am not as fun, I think I am boring while on Vyvanse. When I take breaks and then take it again I get diarrhea and it is ONLY on the first day. My mouth is SUPER dry and my lips are always chapped. I lost so much weight and I don't exercise at all. That is the great thing about it. But I eat soo much the first day when I am not on it. I hardly sleep and I hate it because then I am tired when I wake up then when I take it I have all this energy, then when I get home I am super tired and I can't sleep because I still have a ton of energy and then when I go to sleep it is hard for me to sleep. It is a cycle and a crappy one. I recommend 40MG, I wish there was a 45MG because that would be perfect.	F	16	6  months50MG 1X D	11/25/2012Email

5	ADHD, Bipolar I, Bipolar depression	Loss of appetite the first 2 or 3 days.	Vyvanse is very expensive when you have no insurance and on disability.  I told my doc to switch me to Adderall XR.  I really like Vyvanse and it lasts 12-14 hours like many other stims clain to.  These comments won't apply to all because I'm on 5 meds to control bipolar.  I couldn't get the anhedonia to lift when I asked my doctor to put me on stims.  I knew they worked and my life started to change in positive directions with this med.  Not a street drug feel but an even feel with more interest in things like cleaning house etc.  Hopefully the Adderall will help, I haven't taken it since '03 so we'll see.  There is no way that I would stop this med if life hadn't intervened.	M	59	6  months120 1X D	10/2/2012Email
3	To help focus during school.	Major loss of appetite (I'll easily go through a day or two without eating anything.), easily irritated, spouts of insomnia, depression, suicidal thoughts (not often), increased urge to smoke.	Vyvanse really helps my focus and concentration during school, my mind still likes to wonder off, but I continue to understand and comprehend what is being taught/lectured during class. The worst part about taking vyvanse--for me--is that from the moment I get home I am not the same person. I get easily irritated when spoken to (friends or family) and just want to be left alone. The loss of appetite is a bit of a problem because I'm tall and thin as it is. I usually have to force myself to eat, or I will eat before taking the pill. If I try to eat after it has kicked in I hardly eat much of anything, and end up throwing away most of a good meal. Overall, vyvanse work great while I am at school, but once it begins to wear off, I don't like how it makes me feel--with the feelings of being depressed, irritated, and isolating myself from everyone at home.

4	I have bad ADD	At first it was amazing, i did my homework and could pay attention in class. But i slowly started getting anxious and bitching kids out in class who were bein obnoxious. My friends also started complaining that i was different, and then i realized i was. I was quiet and just did my school work with nothing to say to anyone. And then the worst part was the hot flashes. I would get flushed and start swaeting like crazy even in the winter?? Even if i didnt feel warm id start sweat it was terrible. Idk i decided to get taken off of it because the side effects were taking over. My doctor said the problem wasnt the dosage he said its very common in patients and to me it wasn't worth it. Sorry for such a long description i figured it was necessary. But if you get it beware, at first its great but a couple months into it and your depressed, you dont eat, and your quiet and bipolar.

My mind was so scattered and I could only focus on something for a little while. The first day on it was good but after that I got many symptoms.

4	ADHD	Dry mouth, Grinding teeth, excessive peeing, hesitant and shaky speech (stumbling over words too,) fast heart beat, loss of appetite, trouble sleeping, disinterest.	Been taking ADHD meds since I was 9. Was taking Concerta but started feeling major depression on it. So I switched to Vyvance, it's works great for my ADHD and concentration but when I'm not at work or school I feel disinterested in my life since I don't have anything to concentrate on. Might need to lower dossage. Don't take it like I'm supposed to either. I should take it every day but I only take it as needed because I don't like feeling like this every day. Might get better once I take it regularly. But other than that this works fabulous.	F	19	1  months70 MG 1X AN	9/4/2012Email
3	Adult ADHD	Sweating, Cotton Mouth, Mood Swings, Headaches, upset stomach	The first day was great! Felt euphoric and was able to concentrate extremely well.  I didn't have much of a crash on the first day.  I usually take the pill at 8AM and by 3PM I feel very tiered.  I have lost appetite and I lost 5 pounds in the first week, mainly from forgetting to eat.  I'm an electrical engineer and I have managed to follow schematics and understand them immediately without having to go over them more than twice.  I can retain more info.  I can't imagine taking this for the rest of my life.  I think I may cycle the drug to keep some balance and not become dependent on it.  I will have to go back to my doctor to see what kind of balance would be best for me.	M	33	7  days40mg 1X D	8/29/2012Email

I was really social and wanted to do more things than I usually would. I was able to concentrate and do my homework without being distracted. I haven't been hungry all day. I ate a small dinner that I didn't even really want. The only thing I don't like is that it lasts so long. It's now 11:45 pm and I still feel some effects, though it's pretty much over. I also drank two cups of coffee from Starbucks when I first took it so no wonder I felt euphoric ;p It was the "green coffee bean" drinks that look like tea so I didn't realize it until afterwards. I think this is good if you have a test or something like that in school or if you have mild ADD.	F	21	1  days30 MG 1X D	8/1/2012

3	ADHD	diarrhea all the time, less of an appetite, chapped lips, difficulty falling asleep, sometimes a headache, hallucinating (only once), teeth clinching, and I think that's about it.	I started taking Vyvanse on the 19th of June and I don't see a change in my ADHD. The doctor said I would be normal but more focused, I remember things more but not really focused. I believe I need a stronger dosage because I don't see a result. I have no "motivation" what so ever and I just laze around all day not really active but I believe it amplifies my boredom. I don't eat much but my family forces me to. I still lose my train of thought. When it wears off it's like hell, I feel like WTF is going on and I am completely stuck like, what do I do next feeling. I really don't like taking it because it's really pointless at 30MG. I have been taking it on and off. When I take it I am less depressed though and not as angry but like right now I am not doing anything. My lips are always chapped and they never are and they started to bleed a little but it stopped. When I am on it I feel more distant from my family then normal. I heard and read stories about how people were on it but I don't really feel that way. I also get a lot of diarrhea and it sucks because I don't have it all the time but I didn't take the pill on the 7th of July so I took it this morning and I have the side affects I had when I first started taking it. I had a feeling like I couldn't brush my teeth good enough like my mouth wasn't getting clean and I had a bad taste in my mouth, it's not like a food taste though.

I've been addicted since my buddy in high school told me about a wonderful drug that will "make you want to do your homework, dude!".. I made an appointment immediately, I got "diagnosed" with ADHD. Started with Adderall XR, 30 mg and 10 mg blue pills.. i used to crush up and snort the blue pills for fun as a teen, it was like shitty coke if you did enough. But i was in love, I would clean my room, make my bed, even prepare my outfits for the whole week.. After so many years of being on it.. Like most addicting drugs, you start losing the effect, in this case it would be the ability to focus better, and an abundance of energy.. then you start REQUIRING the drug TO FUNCTION NORMALLY, you need it just to get out of bed in the morning.. No vyvanse?  i guess i'm watching Netflix in bed all day. My doctor is a money-hungry corrupt sack of shit, I've seen him prescribe what looked like a 10 year old girl with my pill regimen, 30 mg adderall (60 mg vyvanse equivalence) insane!? stupid parents too! Don't put your kid on this shit! it's SPEED AKA AMPHETAMINES! HAD ME ADDICTED FOR ALL THESE YEARS. DO YOUR WANT YOUR CHILD ON SPEED?.

4	ADHD	I don't get that much sleep at night. Im not as lazy i like to do things besides sleep. and Within 3 months i lost 22 pounds. I don't eat as much as i used to with is making me lose weight. (I have NO problem with that (: ) But when i was in school i did what i was suppose to do which got my grades up really fast. Sometimes i get dizzy..	I like Vyvanse because i was in a car wreck in march witch made my grades go really low cause i didnt go to school for about a week and a month right after i went on a family Cruise to the Bahamas. So when i came back to school my grades were so bad. and i didn't even try to get them up. But then my mom had my doctor put my on the ADHD pill and it helped so much. I only failed ONE class for that semester! and they even work at home because i will help my mom clean and i will clean my room, I never used to. But this pill does help.

5	Adult ADHD	the bad: jaw tension, extreme dry mouth, increased anxiety & anger/temper issues (though the last two decreased dramatically after the first few weeks)the good: where was this drug the rest of my life?? I don't know how I graduated from high school--certainly didn't manage to get through college (it was too boring! there were so many more interesting things to do!). as a grown-up, i somehow landed myself a career in a challenging field and abruptly realised if I didn't magically become a person who could buckle down and work, i was going to lose my career. this drug was a lifesaver. unfortunately, like so many have indicated, it seems that you'd need to continue to increase the dosage over time for maximum effectiveness and that doesn't seem safe, so I've stopped at 40mg. and while I'm not the shining star i was for a while, I (hopefully) won't have a heart attack from this stuff, either.

4	ADHD	It helps a great deal with any focussing/productivity problems. My academic life was substantially improved! However, my social life crashed due to the fact that I no longer had the ability to NOT focus. This drug made me moody, depressed, antisocial, and easily agitated; especially towards to end of the day. Within the first few months of taking vyvanse I had successfully pushed away the people who cared about me, and closed myself off emotionally. Of course this only made me more depressed. This continued until eventually I had a suicide attempt and FINALLY people clued in!!! Now it is a year later and I am MUCH better! I worked with my doctor to find a steady balance in my dosage, plus we incorporated a mood stabilizer called Wellbutrin that has proved most effective. Although things have improved as I have worked through the kinks of the drug, there are still differences in my personality when I am on the drug. On the drug I notice that I am quieter and less outspoken/charismatic. This is not to brag at all! I do not mean to say that off the drug I am like the most outgoing awesome person, but like, I am. The hyperactiveness of my ADHD made me a much funner person compared to when I am on the vyvanse and that hyper-ness is being suppressed. So to summarize my feelings towards this drug, I would say that once you've found your own personal dosage level and achieved a good balance between your moods and what not, then it is a good solution to ADHD.

4	Adult ADD	terrible dry mouth, headaches, craving cigarettes, loss of appeitite	I was unaware I had ADD my whole life but experienced EVERY one of the symptoms. This is the first medication I've tried but it has made a major improvement in my life. First off, my memory is increased tremendously, which was one of my biggest issues. I do not forget a thing. I can focus in class, on reading, at work, and during conversations. I find it easier to listen to overs and find myself blurting out less often in class. It's improved many areas of my life. However, I was recently bumped from 50mgs to 60 and I have been noticing the more negative side effects such as the INCREDIBLE dry mouth. I feel like i'm going to vomit from dehydration sometimes. I have lost around 20 pounds BUT I've been dieting.. that being said my appetite has majorly decreased but I do get hungry in the evenings. Around 3-4pm every day I feel like I have tension headaches, which I experienced initially with this meds but had gone away at a lot dose, I am hoping it will with this dosage as well. There are pro's and con's, you have to weight them for yourself and keep communication up with your doctor.	F	22	2.5  months60MG 1X D	5/10/2012Email
2	ADHD	Before my son started taking Vyvanse he was having trouble at school not following instructions, having crying fits, and complaining about doing work. At home he had a hard time completing more than 3 tasks without becoming distracted and was very hyperactive. On the first day of taking vyvanse I noticed he talked and rambled on about anything and stayed fixed about certain things. the only thing I was satisfied about was how mellow and serious he became. And how well and Independently he worked  on his hw. That night he experienced some insomnia and came into my room in the early.am which he hasn't done that since toddler yrs. Day.2 I noticed a decrease of appetite and how he became fixated on something and just cried for hours inconsolabely. he was extremely emotional and didn't smile and acted very depressed all afternoon. With the acception that  he played ball and stayed focused.for a few hours. But as the.evening progressed he started to show signs of tics and breathing hard and uncontrollably, again thinking about something that made him very sad that he wouldve never normally cried  about. This was certainly not the right drug for him. I did not give him the drug.again and will not consider medicating him for adhd anytime soon if not ever.		M	6.5	2  days20	5/10/2012
5	ADHD	Loss of appetite; the feeling like I might clench/grind my teeth, but it hasn't happened yet; dry mouth, which means I have experienced some annoying polyuria.	This is an amazing, amazing medication.  Granted, I'm new, but I've never felt more calm, motivated, and focused.  Now that I know what normal feels like, I don't want to go back to my non-medicated self.  The crowded, obsessive, intrusive thoughts stopped.  (The best way to explain is that every thought comes in single file.)  I'm not impatient, anxious, or irritable.  I listen and when I speak, it doesn't feel like my thoughts are so disorganized that I don't know what I'm saying.  I've stopped blurting out answers.  I'm more sociable.  Seriously, if I knew that I could be this functional, I never would have gone this long unmedicated.Now, side effects: they're mild, so far, but I'm also on a starting dose.  So far, I've not had problems sleeping anymore so than I usually do.  I took 2.5 mg of melatonin last night and I was knocked out.  This medication is a smooth on and smooth off.  Unfortunately, it didn't last all day for me, but this is something that can be adjusted, so it's not a big deal. (I took it at 6:30 am and it started to not work around 3:30.)  I had zero appetite though.  I forgot to eat the first day and even though I wasn't hungry, my blood sugar crashed mid-afternoon and I felt sick, so my recommendation is to eat something mid-day even if it's little.  You don't want the medication to be winding down slowly and for you to feel miserable because your glucose levels have tanked.If you're sensitive to other stimulants, I would recommend Vyvanse.

5	treatment resistant depression/fati	Dry mouth.  Brief euphoria within 90 min of first dose.  Heart palpitations.  Fatigue after several hours (can be remedied by exercise).	I had been on Adderall previously for two years until it became unavailable last fall in our area.  My Dr. recommended Vyvanse.  I love it for several reasons: one: it is smooth -- no come down or super high like I got from Adderall.  Two: same nice benefits from dopamine -- increased patience, attention, focus, good feelings.  Three: I feel like the me I've known before the depression/anxiety.What I notice now however is that I do better if I take Vyvanse for three days and then take a day or two off.  It makes me quite fatigued, which was a symptom that did not manifest early on.  I noticed it within the last month -- like tired behind the eyes, but my mind was stimulated -- so, I take a day or two off and feel good (I make sure to exercise as this is so helpful for my depression) and then when I take my Vyvanse I feel good.You really have to monitor yourself and be your own advocate -- but this medicine has been excellent for me in treating chronic depression that had become unresponsive to other drug combinations.I have yearly blood work to monitor hormone changes and am also on hormone replacement therapy.  All work together as key components of maintaining good mental health along with diet, exercise, fish oil/supplements.	F	45	8  months50mg 1X D	4/10/2012Email

3	Bipolar 2	I was hypomanic after the death of my father in November. Began taking Depakote in early December for anger/rage/mood problems.  Psych suggested Abilify might help Depakote work better.  While my mood is better and my anger issues are nearly non-existent now, I'm finding I'm still a bit hypomanic and the Abilify creates extreme restlessness in me.  While my house has never looked better and I'm getting lots of project done, I find I can't sit still for longer than 10 minutes and by the end of the day my feet ache for being on them so long running around in the house and doing all my projects.	Together with Depakote.  Doc now prescribing propranolol for agitation/restlessness/irritability - would rather prescribe additional med for side effect than change primary meds...and I agree with his decision.  Doc now bumping me up to 10mg 1xday and propranolol 10mg 1xday.	F	36	7  weeks5mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email

It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.

I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness.

This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email
1	depression/anxiety	severe muscle weakness, tremors that have yet to stop 2 months in, not sleeping, pacing		M	44	5  days5mg 1X D	9/19/2011
1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email
1	depression	i would studder sweat like crazy eye twitching hyperactive cry for no reason heart pounding out my chest really high blood pressure pass out from panic attacks insomia talk really fast umm flame up inside theres more thid pill sucks i thought i was going to die		M	31	 30mg 1X D	8/25/2011Email
5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
