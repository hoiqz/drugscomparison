5	Eating disorder,racing thoughts	-Loss of appetite-insomnia (better the second day)-Always thirsty, never feel like I have had enough water-Frequent urge to pee, even when I do not have to-Rapid heart beat when doing anything other than sitting or lying down	Although I have only been on this med for a few days, I have already felt the effects, and side effects. Right now I am on 20mg, but am going up to 60 gradually (over 10 days). My psych prescribed this med for a few reasons. I have bipolar disorder, rapid cycling, mix-ed state (which means, without meds, I have it consistently). Even with meds, I have racing, obsessive thoughts. This drug has helped immediately. What used to keep me up at night doesn't anymore. I can focus on things without being distracted by several negative things at once. I am also on this because I struggle with bulimia, and have for 15 years. This medication suppresses my appetite, which helps me not think about food, and not be hungry. I do have to force myself to eat so that I do not fall back into anorexia. I'm finding myself more upbeat, and more focused on tasks.	F	32	4  days20 1X D	6/20/2013
5	ADD	Definitely helps me focus, just tapers off in the late after noon...and unfortunately I strongly believe that I am the only person that has not dropped any weight. I'm overweight and figured that would be a plus. Nope, other than that this medicine has helped me with work, home and relationships.		F	34	5  months70 mb	6/10/2013Email
3	ADD	Insomnia, Depression, loss of appetite, agitation, aggression,	I've been medicated for A.D.D since age six. I've tried countless medications for it : Ritalin Adderal, patches, you name it. When I started taking Vyvanse it was great. The only side effect was that I wasn't really hungry and could miss a meal or two and as a teen girl, sadly, I didn't see that as a problem. I started to notice that on the days I forgot to take it, I felt just terrible. I was aggressive, I didn't want to do anything, I couldn't wait to leave school, I couldn't stop eating, everything made me stressed. I've also been depressed and can hardly sleep and I'm not sure what to do anymore. Do your kids a favor. Instead of medication try meditation..meds should be a last resort.

5	ADD	Slightly lower appetite, easier to stay in shape (girlfriends have appreciated this...), mild OCD-esque tendencies (e.g. more attention to hygiene, desk organization, paper formatting, etc.; occasional knuckle-cracking), drowsiness in mid-afternoons that I deal with by taking a nap or drinking some coffee, heightened sociability (sometimes spend too long talking to people and get less work done as a result), sometimes procrastinate on stressful work by doing other less valuable work but I think I've always done this, sense that time is passing more quickly when I'm working on projects (more "flow" states, in the positive psychology sense), better self-esteem, less facial oiliness and acne, more facial oiliness and risk of acne breakouts if too much caffeine is consumed, dry mouth for the first few months but has since stopped, some reduction in sex drive, occasional depression or irritability in evenings but taking a late-afternoon 20mg dose and a morning dose of extended-rel	Enables me to do abstract mathematics, prevents making so many stupid errors when writing software, helps me understand complex material.  It's as if the structures I build in my mind are held frozen in place instead of bouncing around and falling apart like they used to.  Makes the constant songs/soundbytes/static running through my head stop.  Makes me less forgetful/"absent-minded".  I no longer space out in the middle of conversations/presentations/work all the time.  Makes me more articulate and poised; helps prevent speaking (or snapping...) before thinking.  Helps me notice details, subtleties.  Slight anti-anxiety.  Makes me more motivated and better at planning.  Can better harness my natural creativity.  Has improved my career, income, and self-esteem beyond my wildest dreams.  Takes ~40-60 minutes to notice effects; ~90 to fully kick in.  Mild euphoria from ~T+60min to ~T+180min.  Some afternoon drowsiness.  Makes naps feel better for some reason.  Annoyingly only lasts ~5-7 hrs, so I also take a 20mg late afternoon dose: some still appears to be in my system by then, just not enough to do what it's supposed to.  Surprisingly not very addictive.  If I stop taking it, I initially sleep a lot and feel unmotivated, but am mostly fine after 2-3 days.  No headaches or cravings, unlike caffeine.  No desire whatsoever to abuse it; was at higher dose at first and felt robotic, terrible.  Costly (esp. 2x/day), but insurance covers most and effectiveness worth ever	M	22	2  years40+20 1X D	5/9/2013

4	ADD/ADHD	I absolutely LOVE that I stay focused. Some days when I don't eat breakfast before taking it, I can stay focused ALL day. Other than that if I take it at 9am.. It usually wears off around like 4pm.. Which sucks. I use to take 2 different Mgs a day. 30mg in the morning and 20 around lunch. I quit doing that because of cost issues. Vyvanse side effects for me include: dry lips, can't sleep when on it..after it wears off its still hard to fall asleep (somedays), bad attitude/anger sometimes towards small things, headaches, weight loss definitely ( I went from 138lbs in November 2012 to now April 2013 weighing 114lbs) people say I look sick and need to gain like 10 lbs but I try and I can't unless I don't take the medication for a long period of time. It usually speeds me up in the morning and slows me down later in the day causing me to feel tired but cannot fall asleep for at least an hour. I often crack my knuckles on this also. And bite my lips. It's became a habit in the 4 years since I've started vyvanse. Also, I feel the urge to have a bowel movement every morning around 11 am if I take it at 9. Sometimes it's so bad it makes me cramp up. My finger tips are always cold no matter what. I pick at my face also a lot when I am on this (my mom & boyfriend call it "crackhead tendencies") I also take Zoloft for anxiety, which I think is a great combination with vyvanse. It definitely helps the trembling hands and grinding teeth at times. I usually don't have an appetite		F	21	4  years30 MG	4/10/2013Email
3	ADD,Medication-resistant depression	Sweating, skin rashes, yeast infections, itching, dry eyes, reflux, headaches, anger, irrational thoughts, total disinterest in food, weight loss, immediate rebound weight gain when off the drug, picking at skin, fits of anger that are out of proportion, strong chemical smell/taste of all body fluids, obsessive behavior regarding getting/taking the drug (counting how many pills are left, worrying about getting next prescription in time).	Vyvanse does help to make me more focused/alert/talkative/energetic for about 3 hours, I then feel the effects drop off, tempting me to take another dose. When I do take a second dose, it often causes me to feel agitated and have increased physical symptoms. I've tried several times to come off this drug, but usually only last about a month before I ask to be put back on it. I imagine that I am addicted to it, and will be on it long-term.

4	ADHD and possible aspergers	Weakened synesthesia (rare condition that makes my senses cross...i see sound as color etc.), headaches, no appetite, dry mouth, dizziness, cold hands and feet, mild muscle soreness, increased heart rate when it is at full strength (around noon), mild stomach pain, shaking hands.	The first day I took it was horrible and I didn't even go to school. The second day was a lot better but I had no desire to eat what so ever. I had to make myself eat and drink which took away a lot of the symptoms. I recommend eating right before you take it because even though you probably won't be hungry you still needs food to run. Eating also really helps with being dizzy but be careful not to eat too much or you might feel sick-just a snack will do.    I've been much more productive then I usually am but I still have to push myself to start the work I need to do. I told my teachers that I started the medicine for my ADHD and what it was supposed to do. I also told them that there may be side effects and they told me if I needed to step out of the classroom or do whatever it was fine with them. Most of my teachers were happy to know that I started it because they know I'm smart but I struggle when it comes to getting school work done and I'm a horrible test taker. My test grades have actually improved a little since I started vyvanse even thought today is only my 3rd day. I'm also a lot more social which is a huge improvement for me because I'm usually very shy (possible aspergers).	F	17	3  days30 mg 1X D	2/16/2013Email
4	excell in school	rush of happiness, emotional roller coaster, increased motivation, more effort into work, memory loss (short and long term - is not affected when i haven't taken it) uncontrollable shakes in hands and legs, feeling cold EVERYWHERE all the time, sweating even when i'm cold, lack of interest in socialization, very deep thinking, i've been told i come across as rude or unhappy, when i'm really just focused, LACK OF APPETITE: causes fatigue, low blood sugar/irritability, bi-polar symptoms. vyvanse does not cause these symptoms, rather they are responses to the hunger your body doesn't recognize.	i don't feel it as much when i take it several days in a row, i feel it more when i haven't taken it for a few days (such as on a monday when i didn't take it all weekend) must be digested/taken orally. overall i like vyvanse and when taken responsibly it can be helpful, but a high dosage is not needed and you shouldn't take it on an empty stomach... if you feel yourself becoming unhappy or irritable, EAT SOMETHING particularly with natural sugars or protein (apples and peanutbutter, people)	F	17	3  months30 mg 1X D	2/6/2013Email
4	ADHD	dry mouth, hearing occasional noises that are not there, dizzyness, loss of appetite, constipation, increased heart rate, heart palpitations, detachment, inability to sleep, lack of physical energy	Vyvanse has completely eliminated all of my symptoms of ADHD and really helps me to focus in school, having raised my GPA from a 3.2 (before any medication) to a 3.8 (since taking vyvanse). It even alters my state of mind, motivating me to work hard, as well as enabling me to work efficiently. However, grades are the only positive effect I have seen, and I will most definitely stop taking it when I am out of school. When I take vyvanse I become a completely different person: obsessive, pessimistic, lethargic, angry, and almost incapable of laughing or smiling. On the days I forget to take it (or on the weekends when I choose not to), everyone notices an extreme change in my personality--back to the "regular me" who likes to laugh and do stupid things. The obsession is sort of like OCD...but only when I take vyvanse...making me only stress over messiness and imperfection, but never doing anything about it. Because I am typically a hyperactive person, vyvanse has taken away all of my energy, leaving me incapable of exercising or completing simple tasks. It makes me feel separate from reality, constantly spinning, hearing things, and staying away from people. Monday-Friday when I take vyvanse, I can't fall asleep until at least 4am and even then wake up throughout the night, and somehow I am still able to fully focus the next day when waking up at 7am But when I don't take vyvanse, the lack of sleep catches up to me and I require about 14 hours  of sleep.

5	ADHD	NO appetite, extreme weight loss, cold hands and feet, insomnia, dry mouth, jaw clenching, increased sex drive, increased smoke cravings, dizziness when coming off, crazy sweats, sense of euphoria, and very mild depression when coming off sometimes.	Vyvanse has been a God send ! I do what I need to do on a daily basis without getting distracted. Every relationship in my life has improved, I think more rationally and my grades are at an all time high.15 pound weight loss in the first 3 weeks and it is still declining, I hate that I sweat all the time and that my hands and feet are freezing cold and sometimes go numb. Despite these side effects, Its worked wonders for me so far; I see myself going very far in life as being a reality not a dream anymore.	F	18	1  months50 MG 1X D	12/10/2012

3	ADD	calve and back muscles tightening. TIghtening of head muscles at times, mouth and jaw tension. Sometimes head ache or tenderness abouve eyes on forehead.	My suggestion to everyone is go on corepsych.com and anything you want to know about this medication, how to make it work, etc. These meds wont work if your not eating plenty of protien in the morning, and NOT a protien drink. They have LESS side effects if you eat properly. If you are having major side effects than you are on to high of a dose. You will know when you read this site and pay attention to your body.

1	ADHD	Heart palpitations, excessive sweating while working out, severe anxiety/agitation, vision impairment/ whiting out during withdrawal period	As a freshman ivy league student, I thought I needed Vyvanse to  excel in school, I was wrong. Yes, initially Vyvanse helped me focus, but over time the negative effects began to outweigh the positives. Regardless of what physicians, pharmacists, or pharmaceutical companies say, Vyvanse is an addictive drug. Perhaps the exact chemical compound itself is less addictive than alternatives, but the effects it has on your brain and pscyhe are certainly cause for concern. I share my opinions with you out of geniune concern for American adolescents. Vyvanse and similar drugs are not to be taken without warning. There are no longitudinal studies to demonstrate their safety, but in from my own experiences, they are not safe long term. Yeah I graduated and yeah I did well in school, but had I know the pain, self-doubt, panic attacks, tics, generalized anxiety and depression Vyvanse would eventually cause me, I never would have taken it. When I began Vyvanse I did not understand its potency. I didn't understand that it could change my personality. In retrospect I would have traded the concentration and focus Vyvanse provided me for my mental and physical health without hesitation. Vyvanse is a serious drug with real life-altering side effects, please consider this before taking it. Yes Vyvanse can help in the short term, but not without consequences. Before popping that pill and starting down the slippery slope of legitimized drug addiction, consider your happiness, sanity and ability t	F	23	2  years30 1X D	12/3/2012
4	ADD	Dry mouth, chapped lips, less sleep, weight loss (20+ pounds), very small appetite, diarrhea (1st day only), super focused	I will say I do love Vyvanse. BUT on 50MG I am too focused, I feel as if my brain is trying to go super fast with ideas but I can't get them out. I don't take it if I don't have school and I love not taking it because I am me again. My doctor said it wouldn't change my personality but it has. I am not as fun, I think I am boring while on Vyvanse. When I take breaks and then take it again I get diarrhea and it is ONLY on the first day. My mouth is SUPER dry and my lips are always chapped. I lost so much weight and I don't exercise at all. That is the great thing about it. But I eat soo much the first day when I am not on it. I hardly sleep and I hate it because then I am tired when I wake up then when I take it I have all this energy, then when I get home I am super tired and I can't sleep because I still have a ton of energy and then when I go to sleep it is hard for me to sleep. It is a cycle and a crappy one. I recommend 40MG, I wish there was a 45MG because that would be perfect.	F	16	6  months50MG 1X D	11/25/2012Email

5	ADHD, Bipolar I, Bipolar depression	Loss of appetite the first 2 or 3 days.	Vyvanse is very expensive when you have no insurance and on disability.  I told my doc to switch me to Adderall XR.  I really like Vyvanse and it lasts 12-14 hours like many other stims clain to.  These comments won't apply to all because I'm on 5 meds to control bipolar.  I couldn't get the anhedonia to lift when I asked my doctor to put me on stims.  I knew they worked and my life started to change in positive directions with this med.  Not a street drug feel but an even feel with more interest in things like cleaning house etc.  Hopefully the Adderall will help, I haven't taken it since '03 so we'll see.  There is no way that I would stop this med if life hadn't intervened.	M	59	6  months120 1X D	10/2/2012Email
3	To help focus during school.	Major loss of appetite (I'll easily go through a day or two without eating anything.), easily irritated, spouts of insomnia, depression, suicidal thoughts (not often), increased urge to smoke.	Vyvanse really helps my focus and concentration during school, my mind still likes to wonder off, but I continue to understand and comprehend what is being taught/lectured during class. The worst part about taking vyvanse--for me--is that from the moment I get home I am not the same person. I get easily irritated when spoken to (friends or family) and just want to be left alone. The loss of appetite is a bit of a problem because I'm tall and thin as it is. I usually have to force myself to eat, or I will eat before taking the pill. If I try to eat after it has kicked in I hardly eat much of anything, and end up throwing away most of a good meal. Overall, vyvanse work great while I am at school, but once it begins to wear off, I don't like how it makes me feel--with the feelings of being depressed, irritated, and isolating myself from everyone at home.

4	I have bad ADD	At first it was amazing, i did my homework and could pay attention in class. But i slowly started getting anxious and bitching kids out in class who were bein obnoxious. My friends also started complaining that i was different, and then i realized i was. I was quiet and just did my school work with nothing to say to anyone. And then the worst part was the hot flashes. I would get flushed and start swaeting like crazy even in the winter?? Even if i didnt feel warm id start sweat it was terrible. Idk i decided to get taken off of it because the side effects were taking over. My doctor said the problem wasnt the dosage he said its very common in patients and to me it wasn't worth it. Sorry for such a long description i figured it was necessary. But if you get it beware, at first its great but a couple months into it and your depressed, you dont eat, and your quiet and bipolar.

My mind was so scattered and I could only focus on something for a little while. The first day on it was good but after that I got many symptoms.

4	ADHD	Dry mouth, Grinding teeth, excessive peeing, hesitant and shaky speech (stumbling over words too,) fast heart beat, loss of appetite, trouble sleeping, disinterest.	Been taking ADHD meds since I was 9. Was taking Concerta but started feeling major depression on it. So I switched to Vyvance, it's works great for my ADHD and concentration but when I'm not at work or school I feel disinterested in my life since I don't have anything to concentrate on. Might need to lower dossage. Don't take it like I'm supposed to either. I should take it every day but I only take it as needed because I don't like feeling like this every day. Might get better once I take it regularly. But other than that this works fabulous.	F	19	1  months70 MG 1X AN	9/4/2012Email
3	Adult ADHD	Sweating, Cotton Mouth, Mood Swings, Headaches, upset stomach	The first day was great! Felt euphoric and was able to concentrate extremely well.  I didn't have much of a crash on the first day.  I usually take the pill at 8AM and by 3PM I feel very tiered.  I have lost appetite and I lost 5 pounds in the first week, mainly from forgetting to eat.  I'm an electrical engineer and I have managed to follow schematics and understand them immediately without having to go over them more than twice.  I can retain more info.  I can't imagine taking this for the rest of my life.  I think I may cycle the drug to keep some balance and not become dependent on it.  I will have to go back to my doctor to see what kind of balance would be best for me.	M	33	7  days40mg 1X D	8/29/2012Email

I was really social and wanted to do more things than I usually would. I was able to concentrate and do my homework without being distracted. I haven't been hungry all day. I ate a small dinner that I didn't even really want. The only thing I don't like is that it lasts so long. It's now 11:45 pm and I still feel some effects, though it's pretty much over. I also drank two cups of coffee from Starbucks when I first took it so no wonder I felt euphoric ;p It was the "green coffee bean" drinks that look like tea so I didn't realize it until afterwards. I think this is good if you have a test or something like that in school or if you have mild ADD.	F	21	1  days30 MG 1X D	8/1/2012

3	ADHD	diarrhea all the time, less of an appetite, chapped lips, difficulty falling asleep, sometimes a headache, hallucinating (only once), teeth clinching, and I think that's about it.	I started taking Vyvanse on the 19th of June and I don't see a change in my ADHD. The doctor said I would be normal but more focused, I remember things more but not really focused. I believe I need a stronger dosage because I don't see a result. I have no "motivation" what so ever and I just laze around all day not really active but I believe it amplifies my boredom. I don't eat much but my family forces me to. I still lose my train of thought. When it wears off it's like hell, I feel like WTF is going on and I am completely stuck like, what do I do next feeling. I really don't like taking it because it's really pointless at 30MG. I have been taking it on and off. When I take it I am less depressed though and not as angry but like right now I am not doing anything. My lips are always chapped and they never are and they started to bleed a little but it stopped. When I am on it I feel more distant from my family then normal. I heard and read stories about how people were on it but I don't really feel that way. I also get a lot of diarrhea and it sucks because I don't have it all the time but I didn't take the pill on the 7th of July so I took it this morning and I have the side affects I had when I first started taking it. I had a feeling like I couldn't brush my teeth good enough like my mouth wasn't getting clean and I had a bad taste in my mouth, it's not like a food taste though.

I've been addicted since my buddy in high school told me about a wonderful drug that will "make you want to do your homework, dude!".. I made an appointment immediately, I got "diagnosed" with ADHD. Started with Adderall XR, 30 mg and 10 mg blue pills.. i used to crush up and snort the blue pills for fun as a teen, it was like shitty coke if you did enough. But i was in love, I would clean my room, make my bed, even prepare my outfits for the whole week.. After so many years of being on it.. Like most addicting drugs, you start losing the effect, in this case it would be the ability to focus better, and an abundance of energy.. then you start REQUIRING the drug TO FUNCTION NORMALLY, you need it just to get out of bed in the morning.. No vyvanse?  i guess i'm watching Netflix in bed all day. My doctor is a money-hungry corrupt sack of shit, I've seen him prescribe what looked like a 10 year old girl with my pill regimen, 30 mg adderall (60 mg vyvanse equivalence) insane!? stupid parents too! Don't put your kid on this shit! it's SPEED AKA AMPHETAMINES! HAD ME ADDICTED FOR ALL THESE YEARS. DO YOUR WANT YOUR CHILD ON SPEED?.

4	ADHD	I don't get that much sleep at night. Im not as lazy i like to do things besides sleep. and Within 3 months i lost 22 pounds. I don't eat as much as i used to with is making me lose weight. (I have NO problem with that (: ) But when i was in school i did what i was suppose to do which got my grades up really fast. Sometimes i get dizzy..	I like Vyvanse because i was in a car wreck in march witch made my grades go really low cause i didnt go to school for about a week and a month right after i went on a family Cruise to the Bahamas. So when i came back to school my grades were so bad. and i didn't even try to get them up. But then my mom had my doctor put my on the ADHD pill and it helped so much. I only failed ONE class for that semester! and they even work at home because i will help my mom clean and i will clean my room, I never used to. But this pill does help.

5	Adult ADHD	the bad: jaw tension, extreme dry mouth, increased anxiety & anger/temper issues (though the last two decreased dramatically after the first few weeks)the good: where was this drug the rest of my life?? I don't know how I graduated from high school--certainly didn't manage to get through college (it was too boring! there were so many more interesting things to do!). as a grown-up, i somehow landed myself a career in a challenging field and abruptly realised if I didn't magically become a person who could buckle down and work, i was going to lose my career. this drug was a lifesaver. unfortunately, like so many have indicated, it seems that you'd need to continue to increase the dosage over time for maximum effectiveness and that doesn't seem safe, so I've stopped at 40mg. and while I'm not the shining star i was for a while, I (hopefully) won't have a heart attack from this stuff, either.

4	ADHD	It helps a great deal with any focussing/productivity problems. My academic life was substantially improved! However, my social life crashed due to the fact that I no longer had the ability to NOT focus. This drug made me moody, depressed, antisocial, and easily agitated; especially towards to end of the day. Within the first few months of taking vyvanse I had successfully pushed away the people who cared about me, and closed myself off emotionally. Of course this only made me more depressed. This continued until eventually I had a suicide attempt and FINALLY people clued in!!! Now it is a year later and I am MUCH better! I worked with my doctor to find a steady balance in my dosage, plus we incorporated a mood stabilizer called Wellbutrin that has proved most effective. Although things have improved as I have worked through the kinks of the drug, there are still differences in my personality when I am on the drug. On the drug I notice that I am quieter and less outspoken/charismatic. This is not to brag at all! I do not mean to say that off the drug I am like the most outgoing awesome person, but like, I am. The hyperactiveness of my ADHD made me a much funner person compared to when I am on the vyvanse and that hyper-ness is being suppressed. So to summarize my feelings towards this drug, I would say that once you've found your own personal dosage level and achieved a good balance between your moods and what not, then it is a good solution to ADHD.

4	Adult ADD	terrible dry mouth, headaches, craving cigarettes, loss of appeitite	I was unaware I had ADD my whole life but experienced EVERY one of the symptoms. This is the first medication I've tried but it has made a major improvement in my life. First off, my memory is increased tremendously, which was one of my biggest issues. I do not forget a thing. I can focus in class, on reading, at work, and during conversations. I find it easier to listen to overs and find myself blurting out less often in class. It's improved many areas of my life. However, I was recently bumped from 50mgs to 60 and I have been noticing the more negative side effects such as the INCREDIBLE dry mouth. I feel like i'm going to vomit from dehydration sometimes. I have lost around 20 pounds BUT I've been dieting.. that being said my appetite has majorly decreased but I do get hungry in the evenings. Around 3-4pm every day I feel like I have tension headaches, which I experienced initially with this meds but had gone away at a lot dose, I am hoping it will with this dosage as well. There are pro's and con's, you have to weight them for yourself and keep communication up with your doctor.	F	22	2.5  months60MG 1X D	5/10/2012Email
2	ADHD	Before my son started taking Vyvanse he was having trouble at school not following instructions, having crying fits, and complaining about doing work. At home he had a hard time completing more than 3 tasks without becoming distracted and was very hyperactive. On the first day of taking vyvanse I noticed he talked and rambled on about anything and stayed fixed about certain things. the only thing I was satisfied about was how mellow and serious he became. And how well and Independently he worked  on his hw. That night he experienced some insomnia and came into my room in the early.am which he hasn't done that since toddler yrs. Day.2 I noticed a decrease of appetite and how he became fixated on something and just cried for hours inconsolabely. he was extremely emotional and didn't smile and acted very depressed all afternoon. With the acception that  he played ball and stayed focused.for a few hours. But as the.evening progressed he started to show signs of tics and breathing hard and uncontrollably, again thinking about something that made him very sad that he wouldve never normally cried  about. This was certainly not the right drug for him. I did not give him the drug.again and will not consider medicating him for adhd anytime soon if not ever.		M	6.5	2  days20	5/10/2012
5	ADHD	Loss of appetite; the feeling like I might clench/grind my teeth, but it hasn't happened yet; dry mouth, which means I have experienced some annoying polyuria.	This is an amazing, amazing medication.  Granted, I'm new, but I've never felt more calm, motivated, and focused.  Now that I know what normal feels like, I don't want to go back to my non-medicated self.  The crowded, obsessive, intrusive thoughts stopped.  (The best way to explain is that every thought comes in single file.)  I'm not impatient, anxious, or irritable.  I listen and when I speak, it doesn't feel like my thoughts are so disorganized that I don't know what I'm saying.  I've stopped blurting out answers.  I'm more sociable.  Seriously, if I knew that I could be this functional, I never would have gone this long unmedicated.Now, side effects: they're mild, so far, but I'm also on a starting dose.  So far, I've not had problems sleeping anymore so than I usually do.  I took 2.5 mg of melatonin last night and I was knocked out.  This medication is a smooth on and smooth off.  Unfortunately, it didn't last all day for me, but this is something that can be adjusted, so it's not a big deal. (I took it at 6:30 am and it started to not work around 3:30.)  I had zero appetite though.  I forgot to eat the first day and even though I wasn't hungry, my blood sugar crashed mid-afternoon and I felt sick, so my recommendation is to eat something mid-day even if it's little.  You don't want the medication to be winding down slowly and for you to feel miserable because your glucose levels have tanked.If you're sensitive to other stimulants, I would recommend Vyvanse.

5	treatment resistant depression/fati	Dry mouth.  Brief euphoria within 90 min of first dose.  Heart palpitations.  Fatigue after several hours (can be remedied by exercise).	I had been on Adderall previously for two years until it became unavailable last fall in our area.  My Dr. recommended Vyvanse.  I love it for several reasons: one: it is smooth -- no come down or super high like I got from Adderall.  Two: same nice benefits from dopamine -- increased patience, attention, focus, good feelings.  Three: I feel like the me I've known before the depression/anxiety.What I notice now however is that I do better if I take Vyvanse for three days and then take a day or two off.  It makes me quite fatigued, which was a symptom that did not manifest early on.  I noticed it within the last month -- like tired behind the eyes, but my mind was stimulated -- so, I take a day or two off and feel good (I make sure to exercise as this is so helpful for my depression) and then when I take my Vyvanse I feel good.You really have to monitor yourself and be your own advocate -- but this medicine has been excellent for me in treating chronic depression that had become unresponsive to other drug combinations.I have yearly blood work to monitor hormone changes and am also on hormone replacement therapy.  All work together as key components of maintaining good mental health along with diet, exercise, fish oil/supplements.	F	45	8  months50mg 1X D	4/10/2012Email

3	Bipolar 2	I was hypomanic after the death of my father in November. Began taking Depakote in early December for anger/rage/mood problems.  Psych suggested Abilify might help Depakote work better.  While my mood is better and my anger issues are nearly non-existent now, I'm finding I'm still a bit hypomanic and the Abilify creates extreme restlessness in me.  While my house has never looked better and I'm getting lots of project done, I find I can't sit still for longer than 10 minutes and by the end of the day my feet ache for being on them so long running around in the house and doing all my projects.	Together with Depakote.  Doc now prescribing propranolol for agitation/restlessness/irritability - would rather prescribe additional med for side effect than change primary meds...and I agree with his decision.  Doc now bumping me up to 10mg 1xday and propranolol 10mg 1xday.	F	36	7  weeks5mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email

It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.

I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness.

This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out!

5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie).

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011

It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed.

3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed.

Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight.

3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

5	bipolar	askithia	This medicine has been great but I have started to feel a side effect of my mouth twitching back and forth. I am worried this will be permanent. Will talk to doc about this.	F	35	5  years20 mg 1X D	11/20/2010Email
3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email
5	depression	none - maybe weight gain as is with everything it seems	Just a small increase recently really pulled me out of a slump	F	54	 20 mg 1X D	10/23/2010Email
5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

3	Bipolar I	Increase in appetite (gained 2 lbs in 2 weeks), GI upset initially, migraines so bad had to discontinue it	I'm bipolar with mixed states. After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated. Who knows if it "helped my depression" because it made me an absolute basket case!	F	21	14  days2.5 mg 1X D	9/27/2010
2	GAD	RAVENOUS, INSATIABLE HUNGER!!!!	When I see my Doc I have to tell him I MUST come off this med or I will be the size of a house in a month!	M	33	2  weeks 1X D	9/25/2010
2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).	F	42	16  months30 mg 1X D	9/7/2010
3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.	F	35	4  weeks15 MG 1X D	8/29/2010Email
5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

4	Depression	Interrupted sleep, weight gain at higher doses (which isn't coming off by lowering the dose), more energy, decreased sexual desire and ability	This drug has been great for me. I'm only on 5 mg to augment Effexor 225mg, but it gives me more energy and really helps elevate my mood. It's been a lifesaver. I had some weight gain and irritability at 7 and 10 mg, but none at 5. I just wish the weight would come off just by going down in dosage, but it's not. My only big complaint is the cost. Even with my (not so great) insurance its very very expensive, but I'm working with my Dr. to make it more affordable	F	22	4  months	8/22/2008

1	Bipolar	I took ONE 2mg tablet- Pdoc assured me that I would have no side effects on such a miniscule dosage.NOT- I was so nauseous I had to seek anti-nausea meds from my primary doctor. My head pounded for 12 hours and tylenol nor advil would stop the pain.	Mood wise- I could feel a difference. I was very Calm. However the nausea and headache were enough to not ever take this again.

Hmmm...	Also on Topamax, Wellbutrin, Lamictal(450mg), Ativan as PRN, and just tapered off Effexor 37.5 when I started the Abilify. Don't know what s/effect is from what anymore!! Hungry, tired, sore, anxious, poor judgement. Used to be on 10mg Abilify and couldn't sit still or concentrate on anything. Drank and smoked way too much! Once off of it, all negative behaviors stopped. 2 years later we decided to try a smaller dose (2mg) and things are different, but not good.	F	37	10  days	8/10/2008Email
5	Depression	Day 1 - Very sleepy, felt drugged. No serious side effects since the first day. A little bit of night-time waking, but not really insomnia. Sometimes I struggle a little bit in conversation. It seems that I occasionally take a little longer to find the right word when speaking.	My doctor suggested that we augment my Wellbutrin with a low dose of Abilify (2mg). After the first day I felt less sleepy & each day began to feel like a had more energy and desire to get up and do things. I'm taking the abilify in the morning now and not feeling drugged at all. Day 6 - 14, I've continued to feel less depressed and my energy seems to be returning.I've been on Wellbutrin 300mg for over 12 months with some stabilization of my mood, but my depression never really went away with just the Wellbutrin. The Abilify seems to be doing the trick.	F	47	14  days	8/8/2008

It's hard to tell if it stabilized my mood or not.  I was told I have rapid cycling mixed episodes.  I won't take it anymore though because the akathisia (look it up on wikipedia) was like TORTURE.

I am just so tired, I have always had vivid dreams and have had no trouble falling asleep, anywhere.  I'm not sure i like the way i feel. Maybe i'm just used to being on high alert all the time, but i feel so "just here".  My husband keeps telling me this will pass.  I had been on 40mg of prozac for 11yrs and was taken of cold turkey 2 weeks ago, that went very bad.  So now i am on 20 prozac and the abilify.  Just don't know if i can hang in there!!!

1	Dad (82)was taking it for dementia	This drug killed him! He threw up all night and next day,was unable to swallow,his dementia got much worse, and over a month long period he lost 40 pounds! The stupid doctor said he was psychotic but we found out later dementia can have a paranoid component. Dad was never bipolar! He went downhill and quit eating, etc., and finally died--night and day difference for the worse after the pill. We found out later this drug should not be used for people with dementia.

2	Depression	Restlessness, leg aches, foot pain, inability to "get comfortable," unable to concentrate on one task long enough to finish it, always hungry, skin breakouts, confusion (driving has become scary), light bothers my eyes, and my vision is blurry -- like there's a layer of gel on my eyes that I can't get off.  I keep moving things closer and closer to me so that I can see them.	I took 2 mg for two weeks and 5 mg for 1 week. I'm also taking Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, and Topamax -- all because I'm so depressed that I see no point in any aspect of living. Add in the Abilify side effects, especially the muscle pain, confusion, and vision problems, and I'd rather not live than continue taking that drug. Think I'll inquire w/ my doctor about Cytomel or Ritalin to augment the antidepressants.	F	37	3  weeks	7/15/2008
5	Bipolar II	Sleepiness, which impoved with time.	This medication is very effective in controlling mania.  My outbursts have stopped, which has saved my job.	M	47	8  months	7/8/2008
1	BIPOLAR DISORDER	NAUSEA VOMITING BLURRED VISION WHOLE BODY PAIN SWEATING SOCKS SND ZAPS IN MY ARMS AND LEGS FELT LIKE I WAS IN AFOG	STOPPED TAKING AFTER 3 MONTHS TOOK ANOTHER 3 MONTHS BEFORE I FELT LIKE MY SELF AGAIN I WOULD NEVER TAKE IT AGAIN I HAD ABNORMAL THOUGHTS AND DREAMS COULDN'T SLEEP ABNORMAL PERIODS I LOST TRACK OF TIME DURING THE TIME I WAS TAKING IT.  I COULDN'T FUNCTION AT ALL	F	36	3  months	7/8/2008
5	Bipolar II	Acne, occasional fatigue and leg cramps in the first couple of weeks, has since gone away - still have occasional pimples.	Love this medicine. It's the only Bipolar med that has helped me along with Topamax. I have tried almost every med out there and everything had so many side effects or just made me loopy or made me pass out all day. This combo has kept me stable with little to no side effects. I'm so thankful for Abilify.	F	29	1  years	7/6/2008Email
1	Yes	Tardive dyskinesis, weight gain, terrible mental health ( mental fog, slow thinking, poor coordination, excessive sleep)  not able to function to my full potential...just a walking zombie....like being in a vegetative state.	Presribed by doctor and forced to take by the doctor for her diagnosis for schizophrenia....the new doctor i saw after her expressed concerns about the previous docs diagnosis....for i never exhibited any of the symptoms except for depression...	F	26	3  years	6/28/2008
2	major depression and gen. anxiety	the first night i had a bit of nausea and kept waking up in the middle of the night, and then second night i also had nausea and i ended up passing out in the hallway.  it felt like there wasn't enough blood in my head, and then i collapsed and hit my head, and a few minutes later i threw up.	i can't say anything about its psychological benefits because i only took 2 small doses (2.5mg), and i stopped taking it due to the bad side effects.  mostly i'm terrified of taking new meds now, as i already had an intense fear of getting sick and was weary of side effects from anything.	F	17	2  days	6/21/2008
5	schizoaffective or biploar	none	This drug made many improvements in my day to day life.  I was constantly suicidal, hearing voices, and overall extremly depressed, etc... prior to starting this medication.  Now if I can find someone willing to hire a schizo, I'd be all set.	M	36	2  years	6/16/2008Email
4	depression	significant weight gain; impotence	abilify was especially helpful with motivation.  overall, depression was greatly reduced.  gradual weight gain and sexual dysfunction made me stop taking it, however.	M	47	1  years	6/13/2008
5	bipolar mania and psychosis	Emotionally disconnected taking 25 mgs. a day.		M	31	2  years	6/12/2008Email
2	Bipolar - rapid cycling	jittery and sleepy all of the time.  Extremely irritable	I began taking this drug to help with my rapid cyclng.  Abilify only made my life more difficult due to the unability to sit still for more than 15 seconds.	F	35	3  years	6/6/2008
3	bipolar	Initially I was VERY restless and had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Eventually that wore off. Weight gain.	I'm on the fence as to I feel about it. The weight gain bothers me the most. It served its purpose at the time it was needed but now we are going to discontinue it.	F	37	1  years	5/27/2008Email
2	Depression	My Dr. added this Rx to my Effexor (150mg) and Wellbutrin (300mg) because I was still having problems with my depression.  I'm gaining weight (which I definitely don't need since I already have a weight problem), my knees are killing me, I feel very fatigued, I'm not sleeping all that great, and I can't seem to feel "good" anymore--not even for a day. I'm going to ask to be taken off of this drug.  I have never done this before and I've dealt with depression off and on for the past 10 years.  The side effects are just not worth it to me.		F	48	3  weeks	5/27/2008
2	PTSD - Anger Management Issues	Extreme Restlessness, Unable to concentrate/focus (this is a big problem for me as a go to school), Night Sweats, Weight Gain, Blurred Vision.	Abilify is supposedly the better substitute to Geodon according to my Doctor. However, I never felt anything different other than than my nausea went away. I always have this feeling of restlessness and the need to move every minute. It has also become difficult for me to study for school because I cannot focus my attention to my readings! My dreams have also become vivid and I wake up all sweaty. Since I started taking Abilify, I couldn't stop eating! I already gained 10lbs in the last 3 days. Definitely not worth it!	M	30	4  days	5/10/2008
1	bipolar/ ocd	ticks, shaking, extreme anger, sleepy, extreme moods,	when your up your really up and hyper which lasts an hour then extreme exhaustion...extreme anger,,i was on for 2 weeks and made my doc put me on something else	F	25	14  days	4/29/2008
3	depression-CFS	constipation, I've gained 20 pounds.. but I took a vacation and I have been able to gain wieght easily in the past.	It seems to really numb me out. I take 15mg abilify-120mg cymbalta-90mg adderall + slepping pills. I think the abilify take the highs and lows out of the adderall. Bummer on the highs but good on the lows. I would rate it higher if I had more exerience with this drug	M	37	30  days	4/19/2008
5	PTSD; depression; rapid cycling	Some blurred vision; muscle stiffness and fatigue	I am extremely medication resistant and after trying virtually ever psych drug on the market with no success, Abilify has been a life saver.  It works for me on a low dose (4mg) and has improved and stabilized my moods and quality of sleep. A great drug if it works for you.  Try lowering dosage or starting on a really low dose if side effects are too much.	M	45	4  weeks	4/16/2008
3	OCD	extreme restlessness	this medciation is REALLY helping my ocd, but the restlessness is almost unbearable, especially since i have a desk job. i'm going to talk to my psych about maybe taking something to combat the side effect.	M	24	1  months	4/12/2008
4	Bipolar: depression, phycosis	night sweats, weight gain, bloating, restlessness, insomnia, hypo manic and a little grouchy	i have been on 10mg for about three weeks. at five mg the first week i felt great. i had been having psychotic thoughts and depression. now i am hypo manic which is much better than being depressed. i can't sleep well or sit still but i get my housework done. I have started having night sweats and insomnia on week 3. the psychotic thoughts have not totally been taken care of but i do not want to increase my dosage yet. it's hard to be around other people when i have these thoughts.	F	39	3  weeks	4/8/2008
1	bipolar/depression	extreme restlessness, unable to concentrate, nausea, headache.	I was on 10mg and the only thing it helped was that I stopped getting mad... but the sideeffects were definetly not worth it!	F	22	10  days	4/4/2008Email
4	Bipolar, antisocial disorder	Not able to eat much, bowel movements inconsistant, weird taste in mouth	Mu Daughter has been taking this med. in the morning, along with Pamilor at night(I assume to counter effect some of the nasties that can go along with Abilify) So far, her mood and behavor are MUCH better, relationships with friends and family are more stable. She is on 5mg right now with an expected increase next week to 7.5mg. I think that will do it. She seems to be aware of other human beings now and the distruction of the house (mostly unintentional) has improved soooo much.	F	13	1  weeks	4/3/2008Email
2	Anxiety, Depression, Bulimia	Extreme hunger!!!! Restlessness, tremors, insomnia.	Obviously I hated being hungry all the time. Not the right medicine for me.	F	18	4  days	4/3/2008
3	Childhood Onset Bipolar Disorder	Parkinsonian symptoms including elbow flexion, mask face, dysfunctional posture, some stiffness in arms, initially somnolence, but this eventually passed	My 7 year old son was started on Abilify as soon as he was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder.  He improved remarkably after the first dose, and within 6-7 days his symptoms were improved by 80-90%.  However, he also immediately developed what is called in medical lingo akinesia, which is abnormal movement and posture, delayed spontanuity in gesture, and abnormal posture.  Most of these side effects made him look like a Parkinson's patient.  The pych was against giving a drug to counter these side-effects becuase he felt it was not a "clean solution."  Later however, we did put him on Congentin which immediately took care of these side effects.  In a nut shell, we tried various other drugs and none worked as well as Abilify so we are now going back to it hoping the side-effects don't re-emerge.  He has been on numerous anti-pychotics since, and the side-effects are slowly diminishing with each new one.	M	7	6  weeks	3/25/2008
3	bipolar II - Depression - anorxia	killer headache - pain in my jaw - nausea - dizziness	Can't really say yet if I like this medicine.  I've only been on it for four days - 5mg.  Seems as though a lot of people have gained weight. Hopefully that won't happen to me - right now I am nauseous so I don't want to eat; which is good sort of - I've had an eating disorder for many, many years.  Now I am worried about gaining weight.  If I do - I am off this drug. Thanks for the heads up - because my Doc prescribed this med as opposed to seroquel.  I am hoping that these side effects go away.	F	50	4  days	3/25/2008
1	SUPPOSED BI POLAR AND DEPRESSION	I cant fall asleep or stay asleep when the abilify was added to the effexor a week ago. Anxious and Xanax wont take the edge off	AS I sit here crying at 5 am becasue I once again am sleep deprived, have gained weight from it and keep getting told its okay I want to scream its not!!  I am goging to have my dr remove me from this drug.  Its as some have said not worht the side effects.  I lived through the nausa but the no sleep other than 3 hours a night is wearingme out.

5	Complex PTSD	thinking becomes dull, thick.  Dizziness, a little tardive dyskinesia.	Used this drug for a year or so, then was able to ween off of it. Now it works well when  I cannot slow my brain down in any other way.  Sometimes I only need it for 3 days, sometimes for a month. I can always ween off of it again and have months that I am ok.  Many times, it has kept me from having to go back to the hospital.  I am grateful to have it.	M	51	3  years	3/16/2008
5	BIPOLAR II - PTSD	mania, jaw clenching, consitpation, increased appetite for sweets, jittery, sleepy after taking, anxiety,	it has IMPROVED my mood 100%. Very LOW dose 2.5mg. Started at 10mg, then 5mg every other day, then 2.5 mgs. That works best. Perhaps these folks on higher doses need to lessen dose until it is manageable. I am on EFFEXOR+Abilify 2.5-was suicidal b4 for 2 years.  Now in less than a week I was up, productive, working, getting things done I hadn't in months. Will monitor for weight gain--I already gained weight on Effexor! No need for more weight.	F	46	14  days	3/11/2008
5	Schizophernia and Bipolar	Stiffness in muscles and joints and skipped heart beats, my doctor prescribed me 40 mg and the max is 30mg.	Learned that this medicine effects different people differently	F	34	2.5  years	3/7/2008
4	Bipolar w/psychotic features	always hungry; some weight gain (would be more if I ate when I was hungry); not sure how to describe this, but the blahs; physical restlessness	My doctor is thinking about switching me to geodon because of my constant hunger, but is concerned about the extrapyramidal effects with that medication; I'm not sure how well this works for depression either.	F	47	2  months	2/29/2008
1	Disasociative Identity Disorder	fatigue, headache, numbness, nausea, irritability, sleep disturbance, loss of vision, rash	I may be diagnosed with lupus or some other complication at this point. I had to stop taking the drug because of the side effects.	F	23	4  months	2/25/2008
1	Bipolar	Fatigue, depression	I was taking 15mgs and could never stay awake. I would sleep for almost 12 hours and still fall asleep at work and in class. I had to drink 4-5 energy drinks a day just to make it and I STILL had difficulty staying awake.	F	22	1  months	2/23/2008
5	bi polar disorder	some problem with bladder control (minor)		F	52	1.5  years	2/14/2008
1	Bipolar II	So far, the side effects of this medication are some of the worst I've ever felt. I have had non-stop nausea, vomiting and a horrific headache since the medicine got into my system. I've only taken one dose and am reluctant to take another before first speaking to my doctor about my exteme side-effects.	Skin "crawling" and cannot get comfortable.	F	30	1  days	2/12/2008
5	bi polar	sleepy	you doctor may not tell you this but if you are over weight or insulin resistant this medicine may cause you to become diabetic I am insulin resistant and for that reason I had to wean myself off of this the benefits were not worth having a future of diabetes	F	28	9  months	2/11/2008
4	PTSD	Weight Gain	Helped with nightmares. Went to sleep within 1 hour of taking. Other than 20 lb. weight gain, this medicine was very effective.	F	25	3  months	2/3/2008
4	Bipolar	none	Abilify has been a great help for me. I've been on it for two years now and I haven't had another bad episode since. I am beginning to become depressed again but we are going to take my dosage up.I definently recommend this medication.	M	18	2  years	1/31/2008

1	Was switched from Rispiradol.	Our 16 year old son had gained a tremendous amount of weight taking Rispiradol and the Dr. switched him to Abilify.  "Will do the same as Rispirasol for your son without the weight gain", the Doctor told us. Well, he STILL continued to gain weight (always hungry) (has gained 70 pounds in 9 months, and he was always small framed until beginning the Rispiradol). He became extremely restless and he would pace and not be able to sit still for more than 8 minutes at a time. His lying and disrespect intensified.  It was as if we no longer knew our son.Now, two weeks after stopping the Abilify, our old son is re-emerging.  It is a welcomed sight.	We will never allow him to be put on abilify again.	M	16	2  months	1/22/2008
2	Anxiety & Depression	Strange restlessness; especially in arms and legs. No chair felt right. First few weeks: couldn't sit still !! Increase in anxiety & depression. Slight increase in weight which subsided after 5 weeks.	Quicker orgasms!	F	40	6  weeks	1/17/2008Email
3	depression	20lb. weight gain,sleep disrupted, fatique.	New info about weight gain caused by increased appetite will be published soon. My therapist knows someone who works for the co. and he said my psychopharmacologist didn't have the info because it hasn't been published yet. I was waking up several hours earlier than normal and went back to my regular schedule as soon as I stopped.	F	50	4  months	1/11/2008
1	supposed bipolar	my son was 17 yrs old.He was on abilify for9 months with some progress with social issues.he gained 50 lbs.he went to bed at 10.30 and passed away in his sleep.this was the only med he was on.autopsy report could not determin a definate cause.we believe it had to be from the med.		M	17	9  months	1/9/2008Email
4	Bi-Polar, ADHD	My seven year old son has been on this med for two weeks. He complains about a little pain, I am thinking muscle pain, he has had a sore inside his cheek that we treated with clove oil and hydrogen peroxide (went away), he has been a little sad on this med, a little whiny, but considering all he has been through, it seems like he is finally able to feel emotions whereas before he seemed very out of touch with reality and non-emotional (his dad abandoned him and we are in the middle of divorce, and my son has hardly registered emotionally, which might have been a blessing in disguise all this time, and I think part of his whininess is just his ability to finally feel the things he had not been able to feel before).	Now the good stuff, we tried this med first (physician sample), then Risperdal (actual prescription). The Risperdal had no effect on him, he was still racing around like a lunatic, and after seeing him on this drug, we decided this drug was far better. He can focus at school, listens to the teacher, was able to be included in his school Christmas pageant, the violence against others (classmates, his dad, myself) has stopped, and he is able to sit still for long periods, complete class work and homework, no longer destroys the house like he did before, the school is considering allowing him to rejoin his classmates in social activities (recess and PE, which he was held out of for most of the school year because of fighting and violence), and this saved him from being suspended for the second time. My son likes the drug, wants to take it, and gets a lot of satisfaction from being able to complete tasks and follow directions. He was in so much trouble before, and meds were a last resort f	M	7	2  weeks	1/7/2008Email
3	depression,  adhd, anxiety	2mg every 2-4 days, per shrink.  I have noticed that I have been happier the first day after taking it, each time, but then I get more moody or anxious as the pill wears off so I take another one which is about 2-3 days later.  I sleep fine but not as hard anymore as I used to and I find myself more bored.  I am more friendly to people though - most of the time.	I am still on the fence on this drug.  I am not sure if it is because I am "thinking" it is working in a good way - or if it really is.  This is one drug I am still waiting to see miracles happen but, honestly, I doubt it'll ever happen.  I will continue to take the samples I received from the shrink and go from there.....	F	38	30  days	1/3/2008
2	BI POLAR I	Tired, less energy, lathargic, mouth is dry, jittery, cold sweats, etc.	If i take it in the day I feel tired all day, I take it at night around 8 eiother was around lunch I am so tired and sleep 3 hours and around 8-10 at night, when I take it at night I am almost on the verge of passing out and it gives me quite a rush and keeps me up. I was very energetic before, now I feel like not even moving. LOL if you can tell I had just tookin my meds or I would not even be typing this. Also I am ever so restless legs, getting comfortable etc.	M	34	4  weeks	12/26/2007Email
3		Massive increase in hunger and weight gain.  No other side effects	Abilify worked great to stop mood swings and sense of "What's the point?" and fearful thoughts.  The doctor said the medication would make me lose weight but it didn't so I decided to stop it	F		2  months	12/25/2007
1	Bilpolar	RESTLESS!! Doctor said technical term is "akastasia" pardon spelling. Wasnt even comfortable to drive. I have driven cross country etc. before this experience. Couldnt sit still, stand or ANYTHING for 5 mins. Thought I would crawl out of my skin. Was making me feel almost suicidal! TOOK TWO full weeks or more off my 15mg dose to feel "normal" again.	I was on this med for occasional manic episodes and rapid speech.....it made me feel completely whacked out. Have never felt so uncontrollably "odd" like that before. Was honestly a terrifying experience!	F	30	4  weeks	12/19/2007
3	Bipolar	Extreme nausea like I've never had, unusually tired, constipation, and restlessness	Helps keep my mind clear though...good for that, but the nausea makes me too sick to move much	F	30	24  days	12/15/2007
