5	IVF	Red splotches around the injection site, bloating, area was tender to touch and painful when I used my ab muscles.	I was expecting a lot worse, and most of my side effects had more to do with getting shots in my stomach than the drug itself. Some had warned me that Repronex stung but I never had that problem.

5	IVF	Stings as the shot goes in, but other than that no side effects.		F	34	12  days	2/22/2006
3	Infertility/IVF	bee-sting like reaction at injection site when taken sub-q, that lasted days.  No side effects when taken i/m.	Although sub q shots are easier, i think many people have reaction to this drug sub q.  Intramuscular shots of this drug were much less worrisome to me.	F	30	10  days	8/25/2004
