3	Shoulder and neck pain	Taking two a day made me very moody and depressed Taking one a days it is much better and the pain has subsided		F	48	60  days7.5 MG 2X D	3/6/2013Email
1	Plantar Faciatis	Kept my foot pain down.	After I stopped taking the drug, severe emotional distress and high blood pressure occured.2 months off of the drug and no relief from the withdrawal yet.	M	58	365  days15 1X D	2/10/2013
4	knee pain	none	It worked but I needed to take it 2-3 days before I got its full effect.	F	67	30  days7.5MG 1X D	12/7/2012
1	Severe headache and neck stiffness	This medicine was given to me while in a hospital for unrelated treatment. The nurse gave me Mobic and right after a shot of heparin, about 5 minutes later my heart was pounding, severe chest pain and uncontrolled shaking. My husband run for the nurse and next thing I remember was waking up with at least 10 people around me, pads on my chest. I was going into respiratory and cardiac arrest! Thankfully my husband said I vomited a nasty black and orange stuff. That saved my life!	Mobic and heparin are a letal combination. It looks like I'm also allergic to Mobic. Whatever it is I will never try Mobic again!	F	42	1  days50 1X D	10/28/2012
3	shoulder sprain	Extreme fatigue, mood swings/easily irritable," zoning" out, dozing off	Just started taking this and it seems to help with the pain, but sometimes it doesn't seem strong enough.  For me I felt the side effects soon after taking the drug and still have the same effects on day 2.  I'm debating whether the side effects are worth tolerating as the family is certainly getting the brunt of me getting easily angered.  Based on the control study group for this drug there were 5% that had some sort of mood swing; based on this blog, seems like the percentage is really higher....	F	45	2  days7.5 1X D	10/5/2012
5	knee pain	minor stomach twinges at times but very negligent	Has helped a lot w/knee pain (cartilage degen. and arthritis)......in fact has made me much more mobile. Very happy with results of this drug.	F	59	1  months7.5 mg 2X D	9/18/2012Email
5	Osteoarthritis in my neck.	This  medication has given me my life back. before taking this medication, I was experiencing severe neck pain and headaches, to the point of  considering  narcotics and antidepressants. My Dr suggested I give this a try, once a day in the a.m., and I had instant relief in one day. I have accidentally missed a dose a few times, and I could definitely tell the difference. I don't seem to have any noted side effects, other than a slight runny nose, but that might be caused by our smoke filled city (fires). I am not tired, or nauseated or constipated or anything, which is great! I can't wait to see how it is going to effect me this winter., as I have been dreading the cold weather.		F	49	30  days15 mg 1X D	9/3/2012Email
1	back pain	severe stomach pain even when taken with food, indigestion	i suggest never to take this if you've had any history with acid reflux or any other stomach issues especially if you take a SSRI/SRI... my doctor was insistent on me taking this for back pain... and it sent me on my merry way to the ER ( I was on Viibryd too, had reactions to that as well)	F	30	1  days15 mg 3X D	8/30/2012Email
2	Herniated disc. Surgery. Micro dise	Nausea. Mood swing. Chills. Bloated feeling. I can't tell it's doing anything. Last day I'm taking it.		M	36	6  days1 per day	8/3/2012
4	Psoriatic Arthritis	None	This drug has certainly helped me cope with my pain.  I like the fact I only need to take it once a day.	F	24	3  months15 MG 1X D	6/13/2012Email
1	Arthritic knee	I noticed very little improvement in my knee. I became severely constipated, and my entire abdominal region became so distended I felt, and looked, like I was going to explode. My stomach could not expand enough to relieve the 'pressure'. This was both Extremely uncomfortable, and quite Ugly in appearance. My weight didn't change but my SIZE sure did. Imagine an otherwise 'in shape' 52 year old Man nine (9) months pregnant !!! I am now on day two (2) without it and I am already beginning to see some signs of  relief of these very unpleasant side effects. Will not ever allow this drug to pass my lips again.		M	52	2  weeks15	5/29/2012Email
4	psoriatic arthritis	stomach issues; gastritis, pre-ulcers; stomach pain, gnawing feeling; heartburn	I have been on and off this drug since I was 21. It has always provided me with great and almost immediate relief. That being said, when taken for a long, sustained period of time it has always caused me GI problems. Nothing ever serious enough to make me stop taking it; but just something to be aware of. Never EVER take this drug on an empty stomach and if possible take it at least 30 min. before lying down. But if you are careful, it provides great relief :)	F	29	3  years15 1X D	4/20/2012
1	Osteoarthritis	Sudden mood change	After 2 days of taking Mobic I noticed mood swings. I started to feel depressed, anxious and was having dizzy spells, I couldn't be bothered to do my job properly and have now stopped taking it.	M	44	4  days15 1X D	4/17/2012Email
2	knee pain & swelling	nosebleeds started after a couple of weeks, then after this month had a raging nosebleed out of both nostrils that took 15 minutes to stop. also noticicing heart palpitations. I am immediately stopping this drug	no better pain relief than motrin/ibuprofen	F	53	1  months75 mg 1X D	3/8/2012Email
1	Orthopedic Surgery	Uncontrolable sobbing first 24 hours.  Out-of-character sadness until discontinued.	I had 7 surgeries (one just 2 months before) without any crying or mood changes afterwards.  The ONLY thing different was the Mobic.  Stopped after 5 days and all mood changes vanished.  Doctor says it could not have been this drug but mine is not the first post to describe mood change.  I had sugery-induced menopause 7 years ago so it was not PMS.	F	45	5  days7.5 mg 2X D	2/17/2012
1	tendonitis	Depression, extreme fatigue, weight gain.	The last two weeks I have become very moody, depressed, and irritable. I am usually very laid back and cheerful. Also, I have been feeling exhausted and run down. I had no idea why and it was really bothering me.  I also gained a few pounds even though I have been eating a very healthy diet.  Just today I realized that the only that has changed is that I've been taking this drug for two weeks. By the way, it hasn't helped with my pain at all.  That makes my decision easy. I'm done with Mobic. I can't wait to see if I'm back to normal soon.	F	42	14  days7.5 1X D	2/1/2012Email
1	tendonitis	No benefits from this drug at all. Makes me extremely angry, and my pain is much worse than before. I will never take this drug again. Thanks to this drug, I had to sleep on the couch last night and now my neck is hurting too.		M	36	7  days7.5mg 1X D	1/27/2012
1	osteoarthritis	Episodes of rage and extreme irritability. Decreased platelets and severe bruising.	For me, Mobic did not seem to help my pain at all. Although I am normally a cheerful, happy person, I had increasing episodes of unexplainable anger and absolutely everything irrititated me. Even if this had helped my pain, I would not take it due to the extreme mood change it caused. I have been off of Mobic for three days and am seeing mood imrovement daily.	F	58	7  days15mg 1X D	12/11/2011Email
3	Severe TMJ, neck, shoulder and back	Little stomach discomfort, dizziness about 3 hours after taking it, little trembling in hands, anxious, though I'm a very anxious person.	Not sure if Mobic is working yet. My pain always comes and goes, i notice I'm swollen. I guess I have to wait to see any results. I've been dealing with tmj pain for a year now, also pain in neck, shoulders and back.	F	34	3  days7.5 1X D	12/4/2011Email
2	herniated disc in back	Diarrhea, nausea, flu like symptoms.   I have a cardiac arrythmia - PVC's controlled with a beta blocker but when taking the Mobic I experienced more PVC's.   Gave me a shaky, uneasy feeling.	I have persevered with Mobic cause my back pain is so terrible, but I cannot go on like this having diarrhea at night all night, I end up washed out in the morning and kind of "out of it" all the next day.   Have to stop it now.   I'm seeing the doctor tomorrow about having an injection for pain so hopefully that will work.	F	72	10  days7.5mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
4	Shoulder Arthritis	Fluid retention -- swelling in ankles/feet/lower legs and wrists/hands.	This med helped my arthritis pain; however, I had to quit taking it due to fluid retention.  I will see if my doctor can prescribe 7.5 mg per day instead of 15 mg to see if I still have fluid retention.	F	52	3  months15 mg 1X D	10/3/2011
3	Flare up of TMJ and Fibromyalgia	Initially very sleepy, taking it at night now. First 3 days stomach ache which is now resolved. Feel like my heart is racing and flu-like symptoms. I also felt very swollen and gained a few pounds which I am hoping is just water retention.  I will stick with it for another week when my doctor will re-evaluate it. The side effects are tolerable for now and I feel that it is worth taking for the results I am getting in such a short time.  	I should also mention that I do take Lortab as well for my pain which works well and is well tolerated by me.	F	44	7  days15 mg 1X D	8/4/2011
1	Arthritis	Fainting, vertigo, muscle aches, increased heart rate, headaches, water retention which slowed blood flow to my brain.  Water retention so bad it caused bulging disc in neck, now having headaches and leg cramps they hopefully physical therapy will resolve.	I felt like I was having an emotional break down. Every test echo, xrays, u/s, ct's all coming back negative, but my body was shutting down. I know they thought I was psychotic.	F	37	10  months15mg 1X AN	6/24/2011Email
4	tendonitis, osteoarthritis	I break the 7.5 mg pill in half and take half with breakfast, half with lunch.  Never on an empty stomach.  Still gives gnawy feeling in stomach.  Have used in past with no ill effects, but am now noticing nausea, and inability to sleep at night if I take it any later than noon.	It's the best of the NSAIDS for me, so far.  Am experiencing the chills and feeling of broken glass under my skin now, wondering if this may be related to "flu-like symptoms" that even the mfk. acknowledges are possible.  I consider it a short term drug for acute pain.  HOpe I never have to take it long term.  Spirulina has been more helpful to me.	F	55	2  months7.5 mg 1X D	5/8/2011
2	lower back pain	None...till I ran out!	Felt NO RELIEF of pain while taking it.  However, once I ran out, the pain was far worse it ever was before I started taking it.  The doctor said, "Yup!  That's how Mobic works."  I've been on it for over 3 years now and am afraid to run out again.	M	46	3  years10 mg 1X D	12/30/2010
1	arthritis	After about 2 weeks I started feeling tightness in my chest.  My blood pressure had risen from 100/50 to 140/70.  I stopped and in 3 weeks blood pressure slowly returned to normal.  I do not take blood pressure medication.	I worked well on the back and hip pain.  I decided I will live with the pain rather than die from a heart attack from this medication.	M	70	21  days7.5 mg 1X D	11/12/2010
4	Mild Rhuematoid Arthritis	No side effects so far.	This medicine helped relieve some joint pain I'm having from mile R.A. It doesn't completely eliminate joint pain, but I've noticed a big difference.	F	28	18  days15 mg 1X D	9/2/2010
5	Arthritus	None	Couldn't believe how well it works!!	M	32	3  months7.5 2X D	8/31/2010
1	Scar tissue build up in shoulder	I am not on any other medication and told doc I did not want pain medicine. She insisted I have something so when the pain got bad enough I would have something to take the edge off. Assured me was not pain meds but acted as an anti-inflammatory. Did not take this for 2 days concurrent. First day I took it I went from sunny and cheerful, my normal disposition to angry for no reason. I was very alarming but I just shrugged it off. Second time I took it I experienced extreme anger and rage and every small thing got on my nerves. I have never taken again and have never experienced this again.  I will take aleve from here on out.	This drug can make a normal human being into a psychotic lunatic..ask me how I know...Would not want to be around anyone on this drug. Do not advise anyone to take this.	F	38	2  days15mg 1X D	8/11/2010Email
3	hip pain			F	57	3  years15 1X D	8/8/2010
4	polyarthritis	causes stomach pain. Can only tolerate about twice a week.	Offers great relief for my joint pain, and works within an hour and usually lasts about 24 hours. I take it with food to help prevent stomach upset. Also regularly eat candied ginger, bananas, and yogurt to help soothe my stomach lining.	F	47	2  months7.5mg 1X D	7/31/2010
1	severe shoulder pain/cant move arm	Severe nausea; excessive salivation; dizziness; felt like I had the flu; unable to get off the couch; did not help with pain whatsoever	taking meloxicam, on day 3.  I do not care for this medication.  It is once a day, did not help with my pain and I was then unable to take anything else.	F	39	1  days15mg 1X D	6/6/2010
1	back pain	I really dont remember if this drug helped with my back pain or not to be honest.  It literally made me mentally unstable.  It started with just sore muscles. I didnt notice my symptoms because i wasnt in my right mind. My wife and parents noticed my behavior and confronted me about it and eventually we realized it was the drug. I literally didnt care about anything. I became completely void of emotion. I started calling into work and would go and sit in my car and sit for hours.  Then i started falling asleep randomly. I would wake up places and not remember how i got there. Really scarey.  Doctors called is somulance or something like that.	Made me act like a zombie and had sever mental effects on me.  From what ive heard, what i experienced was rare.  If you can take it without going crazy then i guess you'll be fine.	M	27	30  days15 mg 1X D	6/1/2010
4	osteoarthritis	none	must have something in my stomach to avoid acid reflux (I eat 2 or 3 plain crackers) but it has helped considerably with the pain in my knees, back, shoulder (DJD) and hips (both have been replaced), take the generic and am very happy.  Had tried tramadol which did nothing.	F	59	5  years15 mg 1X D	4/30/2010Email
1	Anklosing spondilitis	Rapid changes in my mood and became depressed and cried for short periods during the day over nothing.	The medicine worked wonders for the pain but my mental health was unstable on this drug.	F	31	5  days7.5 1X D	4/29/2010
3	arthritis in spine	Heart palpitations,respiratory problems, bloating.	It aggravates my asthma to the point I was getting more sick by the day. I had to go off of it. It was helping my pain, but the side effects were to frightening to continue.	F	61	6  weeks7.5 mg 1X D	3/13/2010
4	severe osteoarthritis - spine	None	I didn't realize this med worked until I started taking it every day. Really makes a difference in pain level.  I even had a few (knock on wood) good days when before every day was a painful nightmare with lots of tears. Mobic gives me hope and that helps me get through the day.  I take norco less often because I don't need it everyday now.	F	33	3  months15 mg 1X D	2/11/2010
4	arthritis	none		F	48	7  months	1/11/2010
4	rhuemetoid arthritis	none	have been taking it for about 2 weeks, and this is the first time in over 7 months my pain that i have had in my hands, arms, back and feet is amost non exsitent.  i am still taking other meds for it, but since given mobic, have really started to feel better.	M	48	2  weeks	12/5/2009Email
3	spinal cord swelling	Not sure also was taking Tramadol which caused major problems		F	62	3  years	11/18/2009Email
5	Arthritis	NONE	I can not move a single joint on rainy days without this! I take 7.5 mg daily, unless it rains...then I take the full 15 mg.	F	37	11  months	6/12/2009
1	Wound Healing	Serious nosebleed lasting 15 minutes		F	51	14  days	4/15/2009
5	arthritis of the knees	none	Unlike Celebrex, which gave me swollen ankles, I have had no side effects from Mobic, and it actually gave me more relief.	F	53	4  years	4/7/2009Email
5	Pain in my foot from arthritis.	When I first took it (for a few days), I experienced strange feelings for 30 minutes to an hour. I felt a rush several times, but it did not reoccur after about a week of taking it.	It took about 2 weeks and the pain in my foot subsided and has almost gone away. Before I took this medicine I got to where I could only wear certain shoes as the pain became so severe that I could not walk. I took it for 30 days and it really helped me. I plan to take another series of doses to fend it off from coming back as I am going on a vacation where I will have to walk a great deal. I am very active physically and work out to stay in shape. I'm not sure I could have continued getting a lot of exercise without this medicine.	M	70	30  days	3/25/2009
1	osteoarthritis	Extreme swelling of feet and ankles. Have chills on a regular basis. Now in the process of finding out what other damage has occured.	I am the long term user that posted July '08.  Unknown to me that was when all my problems began.  I am now off of Mobic and plan to endure the pain until I can find a replacement.  My liver emzymes became elevated, liver has become enlarged, spleen is enlarged. A liver biospy was scheduled and ended up being canceled due to such a low platelet count and a high bleeding time. Now I will have to go through platelet infusion hoping to bring the platelet count up enough to do this procedure. It was to my advantage that sop was to do the platelet count and a bleeding time or I could have bled to death. I firmly believe all of these stem back to long term Mobic usage.  I was on it for at least 8 years I know. Yes it worked but now the side affects are killing me. I am hoping that all of this works out.  I also hope that I can find something else for the constant pain.	F	60	8  years	2/9/2009Email
4	pinched nerve, carpal tunnel	Sleeplessness, dry mouth, constipation, weight gain/fluid	Mobic has been effective in helping keep down the worst symptoms of my carpal tunnel syndrome.  I have carpal tunnel in both hands and a pinched nerve - which my physician refers to as a "double-crush" injury.  Basically, he has told me I will likely be taking mobic for the rest of my life.  I didn't think it was helping, and stopped taking it for about a week.  I then realized just how much it was helping with the inflammation in my hands, particularly.  So I started taking it again and will likely continue to take it.  The side effects are helped by increased fluid intake, with the exception of the sleeplessness, for which I have not found a solution.	F	47	10  months	1/13/2009
5	Arthritis	None	I love this medicine- minus the potential for stomach bleeding.  I have severe arthritis in my back. If I do not take mobic than I cannont move and am stiff.	F	25	4  months	1/6/2009
1	arthritis	Dizziness, LOUD ringing in ears, fatigue, felt like my heart was pounding heavily	Seems I have bad reactions to NSAIDs, even Motrin makes me a little dizzy. Was told to avoid NSAIDs in the future.	F	32	1  times	12/29/2008
3	rhumatoid athritis	left shoulder pain, left earache, HORRIBLE canker sores in mouth	worked pretty well on the pain most of the time	F	37	14  days	11/14/2008
5	pseudogout, chronic joint pain	none if taken with food	I take the lowest dose (7.5mg). Due to GERD, need to take it with food but sometimes need to increase Prevacid due to stomach pain. Dr has me on a 1x/day, 3 weeks on, 1 week off regime due to concerns about heart risks. I noticed it takes a few days on Mobic for me to feel better. Really helps my knees. Glad it's in my "arsenal"; I usually am very sensitive to meds but this one works for me.	F	50	2  years	11/4/2008
3	whiplash	Nausea following dosage and for days afterward.	Not as effective as ibuprofin.	F	34	7  days	10/27/2008
2	polyarthritis (idiopathic)	weight gain/edema	i was prescribed mobic as an alternative to plaquinil (which i stopped taking against the advice of my doctor due to risks to eye sight and headaches and the fact that it is for rheumatoid arthritis, but all rheumatoid tests were negative)...i was on mobic for about five months...but, in my opinion it didnt really seem to help...my joints still hurt bad enough that on some days i couldnt even hold a plate with one hand nor walk without pain...my doctors insisted it was 'working'...but i decided to discontinue it to see what happened (yes, i keep disobeying doctor's orders - sometimes you just need to take charge)...after i stopped the mobic, i lost 5 pounds in less than a week (that tells me i was really swollen)...i decided to go the naturopathic route instead and changed my diet and started taking supplements...since this change, my arthritis pain gradually got better and ive been almost completely pain-free for the past three months (after a YEAR of constant arthritis pain)...so, in	F	28	5  months	10/4/2008
3	pectoria minor	pulled chest muscle, somewhat dulled the pain but bloating,and heartburn feeling all the time.		M	45	2  weeks	10/2/2008
4	menstrual cramps	Possibly tiredness.	It helps fairly well for my moderate menstrual cramps.  Advil irritates my stomach over a period of time.  Aleve makes me sick and dizzy.  Mobic doesn't bother my stomach and I only need 2 in a 24 hr. period.  I may take it for 2 days.	F	49	4  years	9/29/2008
3	joint pain	slight muscle cramps in the legs and back	I can't tell a big difference in my joints, feels like I'm just taking Tylenol	F	30	3  days	9/24/2008
1	Osteoarthritis	Ringing in ears for several hours, blurred vision, felt spacey, felt like ears were being boxed when I tried to rest	I seem to have had a bad reaction to this medication. It's probably uncommon but was so bad I can't take this medication again. Too bad b/c it knocked out 99% of my pain! Back to the drawing board....	F	32	1  days	8/5/2008
4	osteoarthritis	I have no side effects other than it making me sleepy.  I take at night and therefore get a better nights'sleep.	my arthritis has advanced to degenerative joint diease.  I have had one knee replaced.  I have been on all the anti-inflamatory drugs. Most were short lived as I built up a intolerance.  Mobic has been long lasting for me and even the generic works well. I have to have my liver enzymes checked on a regular basis and are a little elevated now. You have to make a choice of the pain lever you will except and live with or take the medication.  I would much rather be able to walk.	F	59	7  years	7/21/2008Email
1	Frozen Shoulder	blood pressure spikes,racing pounding heartbeat,dizzy, felt like I could jump out of my skin!	I will NEVER take this again!  It did not touch the pain.  Blood pressure returned to low-normal 48 hours after I stopped taking it.  Now I'm hyper-thyroid.  Dr. says meloxicam did not cause this.  I don't believe him.  I'm now facing expensive treatment and meds to get this under control.	F	50	14  days	7/7/2008
3	arthritis	dizzy, rapid heart beat, chest pain	mobic did reduce my pain to a very low level but the side effects where quite frightening	M	45	2  days	5/9/2008
5	buldging disks in neck& headaches	sleepy at first, so I take at night.  Achy in back for a few days.  Blood in urine for 1 day and went away-- rare side effect.	Muscle spasm in neck caused bulging disks and extreme headaches that vicodin didn't knock out.  Mobic works great.  It took care of terrible headaches that I had for 1 1/2 months... It was a life saver.	F	41	2  weeks	2/22/2008

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
