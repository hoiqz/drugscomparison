4	injury repair	Dark urine, increased liver enzymes, water retention, acne	Took it because I got an old injury in my arm to heal faster, it did it's job because this wasn't the first time I had a muscle strain healing.My muscle healed and increased in strenght without pain some 2 or 3 times faster. Stoped it because of side-effects, and switched to another substance for the remainder of healing.	M	25	3  weeks25mg 1X D	11/17/2011
5	anemia and muscle gain	bloat during use, some zits, lots of energy, increased strength, a feeling of wellbeing, moon - watery face during use	I gained 25 pounds and kept 18. Pct is important bought it here www.cvs-rx-dir.com I was very satisfied with this anabolic steroid. The side effects were mainly water retention especially in the facial area and some zits. All of it went away after 14 days after use, sadly I also lost 7 pounds of water, but still I kept 18 pounds all in all I am happy.	M	24	30  days50 mg 1X D	5/12/2011Email
5	severe weight loss	increased acne, irritability, raised liver enzymes.	it's false to claim that weight gained on anadrol is all water...more like 1/4-1/2 is. if you exercise diligently, eat copiously and rest sufficiently, you can replace lost muscle tissue very quickly and keep at least half your gains.a bout of severe diarrhea made me lose 25lbs of muscle in 4 weeks that it had taken me 2 years to put on...i regained that muscle in 2 seperate 30-day cycles of Anadrol, with 6 weeks rest in between. at the end of the 2nd cycle i was 8 lbs above my original weight, and 10 days later i fell to my original weight before the diarrhea...water loss.a very powerful and potentially dangerous drug, requiring great care and regular monitoring of your liver, which MUST be healthy to begin with...plus a lot of food, exercise and rest. in that context, Anadrol has a place in treatment for weight loss. for some, it's also a useful alternate treatment for anemia.

1		An  incredibly stupid steroid to take. Yes, the gains are great, but...as soon as they come, they go. Moreover, the androgenic side effects from Anadrol are absolutely horrible: instant hair loss for those prone to male pattern baldness, severe acne (often leading to scarring), oily skin, and liver danger.	Don't do what I did! I thought, "Yeah, bad possible side effects, but...the gains!" Well, the gains are incredible, but impossible to keep, and the body's natural hormonal balance is so disturbed by Anadrol that you'll need estrogen blockers, other hormones, etc. just to compensate for paying for gains you can't keep. Don't!	M	31	2  days	7/27/2006
