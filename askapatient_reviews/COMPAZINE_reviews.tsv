4	migraine headache	Note! If you are too nauseated to keep the pill form down...ask your Dr. for rectal suppository .... works quickly....Europeans take many mere via this. method as it absorbs quickly through the intestinal wall. My Dr.was surprised when I asked if it was available...as she had never heard about it. It is cheap....very cheap in comparison to the fancy migraine meed. Only problem is it must be kept in fridge...melts easily. When people tell.me of their headaches being awful and object to this suggestion....I know they are not in REAL.PAIN......Another tactic that works is to take whatever mere...wait 20 minutes.Get in shower. Point water to your head. Turn as hot as you can stand then switch to cold as you can stand then hot then cold back and forth till you cant take it any more.....this will expand and contract blood vessels and pump mere through your system. Idealnif you can go to bed and take a nap after the shower. People who object to this method because it willL mess up their hair are not in REAL PAIN.!!! These are cheap and simple tactics that can provide. relief to desparate migraine sufferers! Oh yeah....and compazine can leave me somewhat tired.....and give me a dry mouth....not bad for cheap relief.

1	migraine	Worst experience from a drug ever. Two minutes after it was put in my iv I had overwhelming feeling to just run out of the hospital. I literally ripped my iv out of my arm and struggled with the nurse to get out of room. They explained to me %it was a reaction to the medicine. 12 hours of misery felt like i just want to jump out of my own skin. Awful feeling will never take it again.

1	Nausia	Went to ER with extreme nausea from migraine. Was given Compazine via IV. Within five minutes of having the drug administered my legs began to shake uncontrollably while my breathing began to be labored and my throat began to close. The nurse literally ran to get the doctor in charge. As I am laying there thinking I'm going to die the doctor injected Benadryl and the reaction began to immediately subside.  The doctor said in all his years practicing medicine had had never seen a reaction to Compazine. He assigned a nurse to stay with me at all times during my ER stay to ensure that I was not going to have any further reactions.  Like others have noted here,  I continued to experience a reaction after the initial event.  I had very restless legs for a solid month after the event.    I understand that this drug does not cause  issues in the majority of the population but for me and the others here on this ratings site it was obviously hell. Be very very careful.		F	45	  1X D	12/25/2012Email

1	Nausea	I was given Compazine through an IV in the ER. I drove myself there so after the doc gave it to me I was alone in the room. The doctor told me I may feel restless as a result. Understatement of the year! I have never been so depressed in my entire life. I wanted to rip the IV out of my arm, destroy the room and kill everyone in the hospital and then myself. I had no idea that it was a result of the Compazine because I am depressed in general. My mom showed up at the hospital because I called her to tell her I was going in earlier that evening. The moment she walked in the room I looked at her and she walked out to get the doctor. She told the nurse "something is wrong with my daughter", apparently I had crazy eyes. They gave me benadryl but I was still incredibly depressed, I didn't even want to leave the hospital I was so scared about what happened. I still suffer from extreme anxiety maybe or maybe not as a result of that. It terrified me that I could ever have thoughts lik	I was surprised to see that so many other people had similar reactions. I try to joke about it now saying I "hulked out", but in reality it terrifies me. Make sure you are not alone when you take this med!	F	21	1  days 1X O	10/25/2012

3	Severe Migraine	I have been given Compazine through an IV about 4 times in the past year. I've had a concussion for about 10 months now and I had migraines beforehand. Now, the migraines come much more often and are extremely painful, much more so than prior to my concussion. One night, I experienced severe pain that I had never felt before. My head felt like it was about to explode because of the pain. After taking Fiorescet and Maxalt with no relief, I went to the hospital and they decided to give me Compazine. After about 30-45 minutes on the IV, I started feeling lightheaded and shortness of breath. I started hyperventilating and I felt like I just wanted to run around screaming. I demanded that the doctors take the IV out because I desperately wanted to get out of there. Once I was home, I couldn't get to sleep because I was still breathing funny. I think I had this reaction because Fiorescet was a caffeine tab and Compazine is a depressant so they were counterattacking one another. Fortunately, the medicine helped my headache so my neurologist gave me a prescription for Compazine. I find the pill doesn't result in the crazy side effects, but my legs do get restless and my toes twitch uncontrollably if I'm not hydrated. The only problems with the pill (10 mg) is that the hangover from the migraine is so intense that the headaches last for two or three days afterwards and it also causes severe drowsiness. I was surprised reading most other posts and researching after I took the		F	15	1  daysIV 20-40MG	9/6/2012Email

1	Migraine	Extreme Panic Attack, Sudden Agoraphobia, Restlessness, Shortness of Breath, Extreme Dysphoria.	I was given a "Migraine Cocktail" in the ER. The IV drugs where: Benadryl, Toradol (both of which I have taken before w/o any issues) and Compazine. 3 mins after everything had been administrated, I felt this sudden onset of fear and restlessness like I have never felt before. I couldn't get comfortable, was also having shortness of breath I did everything possible to try calm my self down, and not run out of the place. I tried to describe what i was feeling to the ER Dr. but he really didn't seem to care. 10 mins later I was gratefully asleep. This drug has been probably been used interrogations; as I said everything possible to get out of there as soon as possible so I could get home and just sleep off this new nightmare of situation.

1	Extreme nausea	My fianc went in to the Er a year ago for extreme pain and while he was there he was suffering from nausea the doctor wanted to give him compazine. We asked if there were any symptoms and he said no. Not five minutes after he was given the drug his legs started shaking he looked like he was going to have a seizure. He jumped out of the bed and started yelling at the doctor he nearly tried to rip the IV out. We were so afraid to give him anything else but finally they gave him Ativan to counter the compazine. He later told me he felt like he was going to jump out of his skin, he was in a panic and felt like he was going to die. The doctor later said he knew of the effects but it was so rare he had never seen it before. I am glad to hear we are not crazy. One year later he still has what we have come to call attacks on his body he has seeked therapy because we didn't know what else to do.

1	Morning sickness	Took this medication in rectal suppository form for nausea related to pregnancy.  Dosage info on package said take 1-2 doses for nausea as needed.  Took one at 4 p.m-after about hour and a half I was still throwing up so took additional dose.  Was very sleepy and jittery about three hours later.  Slept through night and when woke up next morning was very jittery, restless, could not sit still.  Over next couple hours the feelings intensified.  Heart was racing, could not stop pacing, dizzy and had blurred vision.  Strange feeling of dread and I thought if there was a cliff near I could throw myself or one of my kids off it.  Was terrified of hurting myself or my children.  Thank god our babysitter came that day-when she left I called my husband to come from work.  The effects started to subside at 2 in the afternoon but didn't go away fully for another day and a half.  I had taken this medication before for nausea and had not had any problems like this.

I was already in a lot of pain, it got rid of the migraine but soon after I got it in an IV I started moving my uncontrollably. It was the most terrifying time I've ever had. I tried to tell the nurse that I was freaking out and she just walked out and left me alone. I became so paranoid that I ripped out my IV, put my clothes back on and fled the hospital through a back door. I ran all the way to my car where my husband was waiting and he was confused. He thought I was discharged as normal and I was too scared to say anything. I got no sleep that night and still could not control my body movements. The next day I went to another ER because I honestly thought I was going out of my mind.	It's been years and I'm still terrified of ERs and taking new medications because of my experience. My life was changed with this drug and I have to take zoloft for anxiety and panic attacks now.	F	26	1  days 1X D	3/14/2012Email

1	awful effects	all the ones listed here by others	I have never had compazine IV.  Years ago I had pill form and do not remember any adverse effects. I just wanted to comment on what people I know have told me.  Their effects are exactly the same as all of yours.  I can not believe that hositals still use this medicine for nausea in this day and age.  Zofran is an anti nausea that dissolves on your tongue and works wonders. I know medicines affect us all different and do not want to preach, but I have never have heard of any other drug that universally seems to be as toxic as this one.  For those of you who go to ER and need something for nausea.  Please discuss other options  instead of compazine. As someone who suffers from anxiety, it makes me upset to hear the terror some of you suffered.  Please ask if Zofran is an option. NO side effects and nausea disappears lickety split!

1	Extreme Nausea	Anxiety, paranoia, jerking, suicidal, homicidal.  I am 19 weeks pregnant with severe sickness and kidney stones which also caused extreme nausea.  I have been given this via IV not once but three times even after I explained that I had a reaction.  Benadryl did nothing... actually made the anxiety a million times worse.  I ripped out my IV the last time and stabbed myself with it.  Had to be knocked out with Ativan.  I can't believe they give this to people.  No offense but especially pregnant women.  Very very dangerous.		F	26	1  days10mg	1/4/2012Email
1	Cluster headache	While I have taken compazine orally before with no problem, the I.V. compazine for me, as well, caused such a severe panic attack I DID rip my IV out the first time because no one was at the hospital with me and they just left me in the room after administration. They got me set back up and gave me some ativan, but it was one of the worst feelings in my life. I have a pre-existing anxiety condition to begin with, so I think I am also more susceptible to this compazine-induced anxiety, but clearly others have had a terrible reaction as well. It seems to me it was a very specific panic, too... it was not only that I wanted to get out of the hospital room, I suddenly feared I would never leave. Claustrophobia also set it and the having the IV in, being "tethered" to something, made it that much worse. I might have been a little better off if I had asked to go to the bathroom and just get out of the room. Skin crawling, racing thoughts, racing heart. Really just miserable.	Always taken with toridol and benadryl, and always the same awful anxiety. After this combo had been tried about 5 times (on separate visits), it never helped my headaches and I had the terrible reaction to the compazine, so now when they ask me about drug allergies I tell them while I'm not allergic to anything, I know I have that reaction to compazine, reglan, and zofran and just request in advance it not be given, or if it must, something other than benadryl be administered to curb the anxiety.

1	Sever migraine/ nausea	Horrible panic attack within 10 minutes. Couldn't concentrate, couldn't sit still, hard to drive home, constant restlessness. I finally fell asleep after taking some Ativan and Tylenol pm, woke up and STILL feel restless and crazy like totally not myself. I told them not to give me reglan which is in the same group of medications but had never heard of this before so if you had a bad reaction to compazine DO NOT take reglan either!!

I was tired and lightheaded at the same time.  3 days later and Im experiencing constipation.	I was sick from a virus, vomiting all night and unable to keep fluids down.  I went to the doctor in the morning and soon after the injection I was lightheaded, excessively tired, anxious.  I wanted to leave the doctors office but they ended up keeping me there for an hour and half to get test results back.  It was awful.  I was in bed 24 hours straight I was so tired and I kept waking up every hour feeling restless.

This was adminsitered with benadryl and toradol. I have never had any drug allergies before.	As a chronic migraine sufferer, I highly recommend just asking for a shot of Demerol.

1	pregnancy nausea	Severe anxiety with suicidal thoughts & desire to kill my unborn baby, combined with inability to sleep, shaking, racing heart, unclear thoughts... like a bad trip off recreational drugs	Do NOT take this medication. I have never had a worse psychological reaction from any other drug in my life. I love being a mom and am looking forward to our new baby. This drug made me want to kill myself- if my roommate wasn't here I may have. VERY dangerous and no one warned me about this at all. At the hospital I wanted to rip the IV out and run home... I did not know where to attribute my feelings and assumed I was just sick of being in an ER for 5 hours. Luckily I drove home OK, and then things got much worse. What a nightmare.

1	nausea	Dystonic reaction.  Neck, jaw, and back all moving uncontrollably/having spasms and painful and stiff.  Took one 10mg pill and started having progressing symptoms within hours.  ER gave up to 100mg of IV benadryl which only slightly decreased the symptoms.  Eventually IV valium stopped it fully.

1	Chronic Nausea and Vomiting	Besides the restlessness and anxiety, I experienced very unusual symptoms including a locked jaw and involuntary movements of my tongue. The first symptoms after taking this drug were subtle. I felt restless and tired at the same time. My mind was out of control, though I sensed my body was exhausted, my brain remained restless and would not allow me to sleep or rest. At this point, I didn't make the connection between these symptoms and the drug. A day or two go by and I was still taking the medication, until I realized my tongue was slightly arched toward my throat beyond my control. Still, I thought nothing of it and hoped it was just my imagination. Eventually it got to the point where it made my breathing difficult and my jaw started to act up as well. My jaw would open, again involuntarily, to the	fullest extent, painfully stressing my jaw bones and muscles. Then my jaw would close shut, pressing my teeth together with a crushing force. It cycled back and forth several times and I could almost feel the drug rushing through my face as I experienced these symptoms. I finally went to the hospital and they gave me an IV of Benadryl and the symptoms faded away. By far the worst drug I have ever taken. This should be off the market, and banned universally. I was told that only a few people were allergic to this drug, and I was one of the few, but I think that's just an excuse for drug makers to extend their profit margin regardless of it's dangers.

Can't believe I am not the only one that had the jumping out of my skin reaction after put in IV. After that horrible feeling and reading these comments, I think they should not give in IV unless they know if patient has had oral dose and was ok with it.

Maybe after 3 minutes I began to feel anxious. I wanted to leave the hospital ASAP! After the compazine they inserted fluids through iv. I swear i felt like i wanted to rip out the iv and run out. I honestly thought the anxiety was coming from being in the hospital but when i was discharged i went home and i got an anxiety attack. I remember me shaking and having trouble breathing. This has been by far the worst feeling ever!!!!! I could not sit still and i felt as everything would annoy me. I finally took a sleep aid and slept for about 4hrs when i woke up i was feeling better BUT i did not feel like myself. The anxiety was had warn off but i could still feel the side effect.

The hrrid symptoms lasted for almost three days and I only had one IV dose of it for severe vomiting and nausea due to an allergy to caramel coloring.  Just like everyone else I felt crazy.  Like I wanted to get up and run around, but then when I would get up and walk it felt like that wasn't right either.  Antsy is an understatement, I just felt crazy, like my thoughts weren't my own.

Felt same symptoms the next day and went to my family doctor. He told me it affected my central nervous system that's why I felt that way and the only way to stop that shaky feeling from lasting is to take Valium (a muscle relaxer that relaxes your CNS) for 3 days, three times a day.

I went home and felt better. The next day and for the past week and half now I have had chest pain every day. I have also been anxious with hot flashes and thoughts of harming myself. I went to the ER on Thursday (8 days after being given Compazine) for chest pain and anxiety. They did an ECG and cardiac work up. Nothing was found. They gave me morphine and ativan to calm me down and sent me home. I went back to the ER yesterday (Friday) because I wanted to kill myself. They offered for me to go to a Psychiatric Hospital for a week. I told them that I really think it has to be related to the compazine reaction because this was not my normal self.

1	I had horrible nausea	I was 18 at the time.The 1st day I was really 'antsy' I couldn't get comfortable just sitting still. I was constantly shifting my body around. That lasted for 2 days & got worse as the days progressed. By the 3rd day I lost control of my neck muscles. My head felt so heavy & could not hold my head up. Or keep it from falling backwards. It then turned to a strong attack where my neck would relax & then force to back farther than it should go, it did this also turning my neck farthest to the right side twisting it very painfully beyond where it should go. My back would arch at the same time, & my tongue was completely numb, my eyes were wondering. My mother said I looked possessed. It was so painful & scary not having control. I went to the er & they gave me a shot of bennadryll, & sent me out the door before I 'calmed' down it was all a horrible experience. Will never even look at compazine, I'm highly allergic to anything in the compazine family as wel	Horrible!	F	27	3  days? 2X D	8/4/2011Email
1	headache	uncontrollable shaking, restlessness, severe anxiety, impending doom	I was pregnant and complained of a headache, dizzyness, extreme fatigue, and irritability. I was given a combo of compazine and benydryl via IV drip with fluids. Immediately, I felt all of the symptoms I decribed. Never have I felt so scared in my life. I wanted to scream out for help, but the drugging effect rendered me unable to articulate how I truly felt: hopelessness. I felt like I was being tortured. The worst experience of my life.		35	1  daysunknown 1X D	7/26/2011
1	Headache, nausea	I was given this drug in the ER (combined with benadryl) because of a headache / what they thought might be a migraine.  Within minutes of getting the drug I felt so anxious I couldn't stand it.  I felt like I wanted to scream! I felt like I had to move my legs.   I got up from my bed and kept pacing around the room.  This was right before getting a spinal tap and holding still for that spinal tap was next to impossible and then I wasn't able to lay down afterwards.	I was up until 4 AM (drug given around 9 PM) pacing and wanting desperately to just collapse into unconsciousness.  I managed to sleep a little after taking benadryl but I still feel very jittery and uncomfortable this morning.  This drug is incredibly dangerous and considering the high possibility for this side effect I think it should come with a warning or possibly be banned entirely.	M	27	1  days? 1X D	7/21/2011

Within 10 mins i started feeling panicky and "wierd" i called the nurse in and told her they checked my pulse and it was 150. They said i was having an anxiety attack. I felt like ripping the iv out of my arm and after serveral minutes of asking them to take it out i did just that! I felt terrible. After about an hour i started feeling a little better but still not like myself. I went home and tried to sleep it off but could not sleep. My heart was racing and i couldnt be still. I went back to the hospital and was given ativan finally i was able to sleep. Its been 3 weeks later and im still feeling the affects of this medication. Some nights i cannot sleep without taking the ativan. I feel restless and extreme anxiety and sometimes depression. I have talked to a therapist and in a week going to get a mood stabilizer.

I Immediately felt an extreme hot flash down my body from head to toe and then my legs started moving and I started shaking. My teeth were chattering, I was cold and hot and then felt an this intense anxiety wash over me in a wave that is almost inexpainable and horribly scarey. I was convinced I was  going to die. I can describe it like a contraction you would have during labor, it started out slow and then got stronger and stronger and when it was at its peak, it was almost unbareable, my friend and my husband did their best to talk me through it and tell me I was not going to die. The nurse did not have a BP cuff on me and had left the room. My friend that was with me and is an EMT took my pulse and it was about 170 during the anxiety attack. She went to get the nurse who came in and said it was just the benadryl and would go away. After she left I had	I could bearly sit still on the way home. I still was having anxiety attacks and insisted my EMT friend keep telling me I wasn't going to die. I got home and took 1.0 more mg of Xanex that I had previously been given to use for my fear of flying.I am 4 days out and still talking .5 mg every 12 hrs or so. I am a nervous wreck and feel like I have PTSD.  It was awful. I will never have an IV hooked up again if I can help it. I don't think the ER is a option for me. I would rather die at home than go through that experience again. I thought the moto was "Do no Harm" Guess it is not the moto Doctor's use anymore.

I usually get dilaudid and phenergan but a new er quack refuses to give it to me and insists that compazine will work.

All I wanted to do was squirm around and scream and act like a crazy person. Luckily, the nurses knew what was happening and gave me Benadryl and the effects eventually wore off.

I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness.

This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds.

Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".

The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me.

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present.

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie).

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

3	Bipolar I	Increase in appetite (gained 2 lbs in 2 weeks), GI upset initially, migraines so bad had to discontinue it	I'm bipolar with mixed states. After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated. Who knows if it "helped my depression" because it made me an absolute basket case!	F	21	14  days2.5 mg 1X D	9/27/2010

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email

4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010

3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped. Abilify worked immediately and I haven't been depressed since.	F	24	3  weeks5mg 1X D	5/9/2010Email

Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal.

1	Bipolar spectrum disorder	Restlessness, anxiety, drowsiness, face rash	I went on Abilify at the start of an up period, so I don't know how effective it would have been in treating depressive spells. However, it did counteract some of the effectiveness of my lithium, and I was falling asleep during the day more frequently than usual. Had to go off it because of a rash on my chin/cheeks/ears.

I got depressed due to weight gain, but after several months I feel medication ceased to be effective. This time  was very reluctant (2 yrs later & different Dr. & different anti-depressant medication-Prozack-2 yrs ago) but I am trying it w/ a different antidepressant than previously-Taking now w/ Wellbutrin.

4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue. Negative - I find myself much more emotional - memories, key phrases, smells, songs, pictures, etc.can bring me to tears.	M	50	9  months50 MG 1X D	4/11/2010
2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now.

2	depression	Nausea the first few days, some constipation, cloudy thinking, increased appetite	Combined with Wellbutrin XL which suddenly stopped working for me after 3 years. After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

Insomnia (but the Seroquel has completely cured that.)	Abilify has helped me like no other drug.  I am on it along with cymbalta, deplin, seroquel and ativan.  Within just a few days I was feeling better and am now able to exercise, clean my house and just moved across the country-something I could never have done during my depression.

Then still have little to no energy for the rest of the day.  I was previously, taking 60 mg. of Cymbalta for almost 2 years, but my dr. switched me to this when I started to feel like dying again.

3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!

2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010
1	depression, of all excuses	This is to the PARENTS out there who believe that if their child looks passive on the drug it is a godsend:  Beating someone over the head with a baseball bat can also make them sit still.  Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.

I am taking cymalta but after about a year, it didn't work. My MD RX'd 5mg of abilify along with my cymbalta every day. In my opinion, it saved my life.

That night she experienced indigestion/heartburn. She vomited. Sleepy but couldn't sleep. Feeling scared for no reason. Next day she passed out after being awake for 15 min. I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug. I got home and looked up the side effects and all of these were listed.  I can only say that we are glad we found out so quickly about this drug.	F	12	2  days	12/19/2009

3	bipolar	stopped after 14 months due to heart pulpitations, memory loss, trouble sleeping, slur speach due to excess syliva, after 12 months these things started. At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying. I am very uncomfortable giving a child this age any drug that is diagnosised by trial and error.	M	8	14  months	12/17/2009
2	unipolar depression	nasal stuffiness, dyslexia, word finding problems, increased appetitite, change (worsening) of vision, weight gain and wanting to graze constantly, watering eyes, feel like gravity is heavier (I have to sit down to brush my teeth), very restless around people, visual hallucinations (things disappear then reappear right where I saw them last), trouble focusisng while driving  --- weird.	I am taking 50 mg of lamictal concurrently with 7.5 mg abilify.  Affect is flatter, less mood swings, but more non-reactive than anything.  I'm not sure this is where I want to be. I have been able to get projects done that I had difficulty starting.  Some days I have energy, some days I don't.  I a fasting blood draw yesterday and haven't heard the results yet.  Continuing to take abilify is a quandary -- do I feel worse or better if I factor in all the weird side effects?  I will probably cut down on the dose since I really will be suicidal if I gain any more weight.	F	51	30  days	12/17/2009

1	Post-opiate addiction depression	Cannot sit still, terrible anxiety after about 2 weeks, weight gain	This drug should be taken off the market.  After about the 3rd day you will not be able to sit still, ever.  It feels like there is something inside of you trying to get out.  After about 2 weeks I started having severe anxiety attacks almost constantly and came very close to having to be committed/hospitalized.  Smack your doctor if he recommends this.	M	26	 	12/13/2009

But already being overweight, my Doc said the rapid weight gain was unacceptable and switched me to lamictal. Geodon had been working well for me, but the side effect of clenching my left side...mainly leg and toes, leaving my toes red and swollen, led me to stop taking it. Depakote made me a zombie.

4	autism spectrum disorder/ bipolar	Weight gain - up to 30lb	My daughter has had tremendous improvement in energy, concentration, and mood. Before taking Abilify she was on Geodon and had terrible akathisia. It also interfered with her ability to learn, and she had to withdraw from college courses to avoid failing. (She wound up finishing college with a B average, so you can see she's normally able to learn. ) Once she got off the Geodon, the irritability and stupidness went away but she became suicidal and self-injured. Since starting the Abilify she hasn't tried suicide even once. (Before that it was 14 times in six years.) I am grateful to the Abilify, but I wish she wasn't so hungry all the time.

I take Cymbalta 60.mg and now 2 mg  abilify.I would stick with it since it works within 2 weeks.I sleep better, and  am more focused.

Then my legs started shaking couldn't keep still. I had to go off it cold turkey because of my dangerously high sugar. It might work for some people but be careful of the side affects.

4	major depression and anxiety	the first night i felt like i was coming down from meth. i adjusted the times i took my meds, because i take asprin, reglan, nexium, and effexor 75's.  i took the asprin, nexium, and reglan with dinner, and the effexor and abilify, plus a half of a klonopin at bedtime, and i sleep through the stomach upset.	the second day i felt much better.  i was able to clean a room, take care of bills, and just never thought of negative things more than twice.  this is my third day, and i was able to joke around with my husband at the store, and though i still haven't showered, i may do that tonight, after i clean the bathroom.  i have great hopes for this med, and hopefully, i won't have to take it very long.

5	Bipolar depression	Some weight gain and insomnia.	This drug saved me from the darkest, deepest depression I have ever had to endure.  For over two years, I lost my will to see people, clean house, get dressed, etc.  After just three days on Abilify, I was able to get up, shower, go visit friends in New England (I live in South Florida), clean up my messy house and talk on the phone again.  I have gained a great deal of weight over the years from all different types of medication.  I accept the fact that medication makes me heavy and I am grateful to be heavier and sane than thin and crazy.	F	54	30  days	11/2/2009
5	Depression/Anxiety	Occasional headache.  Woke up in the middle of the night a few times but that got better.  Still sleeping well.	Doctor added 2 mg Abilify to my 10 mg Lexapro because I was still having suicidal thoughts despite the Lexapro.  Its worked great so far and has been a real boost in energy and mood.	M	17	5  weeks	11/2/2009
4	anxiety, paranoia and major depress	restlessness at 20 mg, eye tic at l5 mg, now down to 2 mg daily.  No weight gain at all on any of the doses.	Because of side effects including diabetes risk tried to go cold turkey at l0 mg.  Okay for about 2 weeks then experienced major nervousness, disorientation, jaw clenching, etc.  Now taking 2 mg. daily and feeling much better.  Still worried about side effects.  Not taking any other drug along with it.  Still experiencing anxiety but it is manageable.  You must wean yourself off this drug and not try to quit at once.	F	62	3  months	11/2/2009
3	ADHD	uncontrollable muscle movements, especially when in the car.	My son has been on Abilify (1 mg) for over a year.  We started on .5 mg because of his weight.  I did not want to medicate my child but I had no choice.  He was diagnosed at 2 with ADHD, but I didn't believe the psychologists because it's hard to diagnose something like that at age 2.  He is also ODD.  Last summer he was almost kicked out of daycare because of impulsivity, aggression, and inablility to sit still.  The Abilify worked for him then and continues to work.  I would love, however, if he didn't need it but now he's in kindergarten and has to take it to get through the day.  I was also able to get him a 504 plan with the school since I got another diagnosis at age 4 which was ADHD.	M	5	1.5  years	11/2/2009Email
2	add on for depression	none except rapid and major weight gain	I was very hopeful at first. I felt improvement after the 3rd day when this was added to my Wellbutrin. But in 5 months time, I gained 40 lbs on a petite, 100 lb frame!! I'm really struggling to lose it, and am currently discontinuing because of it. People that I bump into at stores and such ask when I'm due!!Really too bad, I had no other side effects. but now I'm left with this big mess with my weight to clean up.	F	34	5  months	10/29/2009
1	GAD/Depression	weight gain, extreme fatigue, depression worse	I was taking 2 mg of Abilify last Spring after Paxil didn't seem to be working as much any more. I felt ok then I felt bad again. Dr put me on 5 mg of Abilify. I feel terrible!  Extremely tired- so much so that I can barely move. I am going to ween my self off immediately.	F	47	6  months	10/28/2009
3	Mood stabilizer along with Zoloft	I took 1 mg daily and it helped but caused too many side effects. I'm very med-sensitive. I've stopped Zoloft at this point.	I was on Zoloft and Abilify but stopped both due to weight gain. After a lot of research I'm adding Abilify back at 1 mg every three days. I'm very med-sensitive and tend to respond at lower doses than other people do. Will be back to post how this goes. Something has to help. I'm a wack-job right now. Can't control my thoughts and I dwell on bad stuff too much. Can't get sad events out of my mind etc. I have to give Abilify another chance at a reduced dose.	F	62	 	10/27/2009
4	Oneiric states	jittery at low doses, sleepy at high	It has helped me stop feeling like I'm in a dream all the time                                   but my mood is only a little better so far	F	59	3  weeks	10/25/2009
2	Depression	Insomnia, chest pain, blurry vision	Only on 0.5 mg. for three days.  Horrible insomnia no matter what time of day I take med.  Makes me drowsy during the day, hard to tell if my mood is improving due to the side effects.	F	35	3  days	10/24/2009
5	major depressive episode	Energy and hope restored.  Insomnia, head ache, speedy, shaky,visual disturbance,constipation.	Hopefully the side effects subside as my body gets used to the med.  I'm not willing to stop taking the med as I feel so much better with just 2mg of Abilify as an adjunct to Lexapro.  I have hope again.  I got my butt out of bed by day 3 (went shopping) then cleaned the house on day 5.  What a change from the depths of deep epression to my old self in less than a week...WOW!	F	46	10  days	10/23/2009
3	bipolar II	agitation, shakiness, acne, loss of libido, weight gain, inability to urinate	This med helped stabilize my mood a bit, but I could not get the full benefit because I could not increase the dose.  Every time I would go up on the dose, I would be hit by an avalanche of side-effects.  Had to get off eventually.	F	26	5  months	10/23/2009
3	To help my mood	Strange itching in my nose. I made myself bleed by trying to scratch it but couldn't help myself. It tasted good so I'm okay with it.	I've had depression of one kind or another most of my life.  I wanted to feel normal.  But, I ran out of samples after a week.  It wasn't long enough to find out if it would help.	M	56	7  days	10/22/2009
3	Mood Disorder	My son is 9 years old. He started in June on a mood stabilizer.  Abilify 5 mg, worked on mood, however he has gained 25 pounds. He can not stop eating.  He even sneaks food!! I don't know what the doctor is thinking.  We are taking him off.		M	9	4  months	10/19/2009
5	Bipolar Disorder	Very hungry, but able to manage it. Some difficulty sleeping, usually for an hour in the middle of the night. Spending money a little more than usual. Initially had a few days of headaches, not major.	This drug immediately snapped me out of low-grade depression that was steadily worsening. I started taking 2 mg of Abilify each morning and all of my depression symptoms lifted. I only realized how bad my concentration had been because it was so improved on this drug. Like others have said, I lost my hyper-sensitivity to people and situations and replaced that with a high tolerance for life's challenges -- big & small. The side-effects are very minimal at this point, but I'll be paying attention to see if this continues. Lastly, the fact that it works so quickly is a powerful asset if it works for you.	F	39	2  weeks	10/17/2009
1	depression/schizoaffective	can't stop pacing, feel like someone is inside me trying to get out of my skin, insomniac, no sex drive, having to put car into park at stoplights to keep from ramming into someone in front of me; insane.	i stopped taking this today and hope to G-d it doesn't last long in my bloodstream.	F	29	2  weeks	10/16/2009
2	possible bipolar	feel like a crack addict, hard to even sit here and type, hitting wrong keys, clenching jaw, restless beyond belief	on 10 mg...gained about 5-7 pounds, doc swears I need it, am bipolar but w out mania, just very low lows.......need to get off this but afraid of geodon...feel like a speed freak.  sleep is my only relief.............	F	38	6  weeks	10/7/2009
1	Mood stabalizer	makes me gain weight, tired, not sure if it is what causes memory loss, fatigue, moodiness, irratability.		F	35	2  years	10/7/2009
5	Anxiety, depression, mild mania.	Jitters, sleepiness, stomach distress.	This drug is very strong and very good.  I am taking 2 mg in conjunction with 7.5 mg of Lexapro.  It has reduced my severe PMS and helped me with my previous need to sleep 11 hours a day.  Note that I am on one tenth of the recomended starting dosage for someone who is bi-polar; I can only imagine the side effects, however for my purpose it has been a god send.	F	29	1  months	10/3/2009
1	Bi-polar	pacing, high blood sugar, foamy urine, severe thirst, fatigue, pancreatitis, kidney damage	Please stop taking the Abilify immediately.  My husband was prescribed Abilify and it almost killed him. He was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis for 10 days and then on home care hooked up to ivs for another 2 weeks. He is now diabetic and needs to take insulin shots 4 times a day. He is on a very strict low-fat no-sugar diet and may never have even a sip of alcohol ever again. His pancreas is permanently damaged. We are very lucky he is alive. Abilify is evil. Please do not take it. It will kill you.	M	30	 	9/30/2009Email
5	depression, OCD	more alert, motivated, racing thoughts greatly diminished, some nausea, no weight gain!	I was leery about taking this, others make it sound like a nightmare drug. I have no doubt that it affects some people badly, but for me, it made a huge difference. I do wonder if this will wear off after a few months, but so far 5 mg have allowed me to think clearly, get off the couch and accomplish things. No weight gain but dr has me on Metformin to regulate blood sugar and cravings, so that might be the trick there. Important for everyone to monitor their own reactions carefully, or ask family members to help, because every drug works differently for every person. YOU know best what helps YOU.	F	45	2  months	9/19/2009
3	depression/ bipolar	flattening/apathy, word-finding problems, short-term memory loss, trouble concentrating, not able to articulate thoughts and feelings, muscle weakness. To be fair, it made me manic for the first month I took it, which was wonderful, and I say I'm not depressed now, but is apathy really that different from depression?	When trying to stop taking 5mg, severe akathasia that literally kept me from sleeping at all. I'm tapering, now on 2.5mg, but still fearful that I will have the same symptoms when I discontinue again. Feeling a little trapped.	M	35	7  months	9/17/2009
3	Childhood Bipolar, ODD	WEIGHT GAIN, MUSCLE PAIN/STIFFNESS	My son has shown improvement in mood, decreased mood swings, more even temperament, however, he constantly complains about pain in his feet and legs. He describes as burning, stinging pain, mostly in his feet. We have observed more nasal stuffiness. He appears short of breath, at times, however, we are linking this to his weight gain (approx 12 lbs) and history of asthma. We are still observing and waiting to gauge any affect in cognitive abilities (school grades). Time will tell if the side effects are actually worth taking the medication.	M	11	3  months	9/16/2009
1	Bipolar 2-PTSD	Eating abnormal amounts - lethargy - no libido - no personality - sweating	This shit, and yes I say this profanely because that's what it is. It made me more depressed than ever. Yes the headaches and voices went away. But it made me socially anxious , paranoid , ripped me of my self esteem and made me gain weight because all I did and wanted to do was eat. I am an athlete, model, and full time mom. I kissed my life goodbye when taking this shit. Desparate, I stopped taking it. Which made life even more worse. I wanted to kill myself so badly because I wanted the pain to go away. It's all in my head. Mind over matter. I'll be the moodswingin crazy gal I am than risk my life. Also causes muscle weakness. Lucky to be able to carry anything up a damn flight of stairs. All in all, just stay away!!! Spent the whole summer in bed sleeeeping getting fat and suicidal. Whack!!!	F	25	2  months	9/14/2009
1	GAD/BPII/PTSD/OCD	Severe depression/out of touch	I was on Abilify for three weeks.  I started with the 10 mg for two weeks and up to 25 the third week.  On the 10 mg I started feeling "funny" and experiencing some side effects.  By the third week I was self mutlilating (something I have not done in 15 yrs.  I was so depressed I could not function at any level, very irritable and people just were too much to deal with.  All I wanted to do was sleep and just disappear.  My Therapist said it was like I did a 180 in two weeks and was so concerned she called my Psych.  After seeing my Psych, she immediately took me off it and put me on Geodon...not sure if that is a possitive change or not.	F	37	3  weeks	9/14/2009
3	Bi Polar 2	Akathesia, insomnia, anxiety, weight gain, head aches	The Akathesia was awful.  I would lie in bed thinking I was weak or flu-ish, but once in bed I could not get comfortable.  My workouts decreased as I felt weak, dizzy, short of breath, lost balance while stretching. My face would sweat way more than normal.  I could tell I was starting to gain weight and would pack on the pounds rapidly if I did not stop taking this. Since exercise is therpeutic for me, the abilify took that away from me.  BUT it did help control my mood swings (by making me feel like an emotionless zombie) and the need to act out my irritability. However, inside I felt increasing anxiety and irritability.  The side effects just aren't worth it.	F	30	2  months	9/8/2009
3	Depression/Anxiety	I have gained 20 pounds and am not eating any more than normal.  The medicine definitely lifted my depression, but the weight gain now has me looking like a pig.  And, it seemed to increase my libido.	Started off with 5 mg; now am down to 2.5... but, because of the weight gain, I am asking to get off of this medication.	F	40	4  months	9/5/2009
1	anxiety	Akithesia	Do not take this med. I had severe akithesia whereby I had a constant feeling of having to 'move' It was exhausting and I thought it would never leave which made me feel even more panicked. It was the most scared I'd ever felt on a medicine. Before this I truly never paid attention to side effects on labels, now I do.	F	38	 	8/29/2009
4	Bi-Polar	Akathisia, increased libido, insomnia	Loved it the first week until the Akathisia kicked in.  Then I wanted to jump out the car while it was moving... Halfed my dosage, no help.  Halfed the dosage again, no help.  Now I am on 1/8 of the pill.  Akathisia is gone, but increased libido went away.  Still have insomnia taken care of by Ambien.	F	46	1  years	8/28/2009Email
5	for incentive, to mk decisions	none except lots of hope, energy, lack of fear,loss of procrastination, able to make decisions, ability to focus just an all around zest for life with unlimited happiness	If your anti depressant or anti anxiety meds work but you still have no energy, ask your Dr to add Abilify. I had never heard of it but now instead of thinking of everything I need and want to do I am optimistic and bubbling with enthusiasm and energy. Now instead of reading all day long I am cleaning and doing hobbies, kyaking, running, dancing and marching with my grandchildren Whats next a sea plane ride and travel. Was just weeks ago I was close to Agoraphobia. If your meds only get you to the bottom of the mountain looking up and wishing you would, try Abilify, you will climb that mountain, maybe even run up it and then dance on the top!!!	F	62	3  weeks	8/23/2009
2	bi polar 2	weight gain, sugar cravings, excessive sleepiness, inability to exercise (no stamina, gasping for breath)	It helped with irritability (because nothing seemed to matter) but left me unable to live normally and my friends all asked if something was wrong because I was so quiet and getting more quiet with each passing day.  Because the side effects were so crippling, I have stopped taking Abilify and switched to Geodon.	F	60	4  months	8/18/2009
1	Bipolar I	Akathisia, loss of interest in life, Always sleepy, high anxiety, catatonia	Got really bad Akathisia after only 3 days on 10mg. Was taken during a bad manic/pschotic state so was forced to stay on it. Initially was bumped to 20mg which made me catatonic. Back to 10mg kept hallucinating. Added Cogentin, made Akathisia go away but severe anxiety came in it's palce along with lack of motivation and no interest in anything. Severe confusion followed. This sucked my will to live. The Akathisia was so severe I was suicidal.	M	32	7  months	8/17/2009
3	depression; withdrawal aid	VERY rapid weight gain (10 lbs in a month!), constipation, swollen legs and feet, back pain	GOOD NEWS: This drug helped me in the horrible phase of discontinuing Cymbalta.  I was no longer moody and nasty-tempered.  BAD NEWS: the fact that my face is so puffy I now look like a fatter, older version of myself and I now have GOBS of fat in places I never gained weight before (back of arms, waist) proves this stuff is POISON.  It may inhibit thyroid function, because I am not eating more than I usually do (in fact my appetite is less than normal--wierd!) yet I am piling on weight. The constipation, nausea and fatigue aren't fun either.  And I look like CRAP: bloated, haggard, pale, and unhealthy. Phasing off this med asap!	F	31	2  months	8/14/2009Email
5	depression	I have experience swelling of the calves. This may not be related to the Abilify, as I have had a kidney transplant.	My family has a history of serious depression to the point of being institutionalize. For many years now my brother and I have tried one drug after another. Nothing helped us 'open the curtains'. Two mg of Abilify each morning, after just a couple of days, has given us our lives back. This is a miracle drug for both my brother and my self. I must include, we have only been on this medicine for two or three weeks.	M	60	18  days	8/8/2009Email
5	wellbutrin	somewhat more tired, some difficulty urinating..	A Great help.. relieved pain in my shoulders and elbows.. and has rid me of most of my suicidal or weird thoughts and voices.	M	57	25  days	8/5/2009
4	bi-polar 1 disorder	nausea, vomiting, insomnia	I am 5mg, for just about a week, first 2 days I was very hostile, last 4 days restless with insomnia and cant eat much.However I have energy, I get things done, I am back to being social which I was not for over a year and half. No fears of public and can focus to read, play games etc.  My patience level is much better.  Just would like to know when the insomnia and nausea will pass.	M	41	1  weeks	8/5/2009Email
2	Possbile Bipolar 2	Extreme sweating, extreme nausea, weird chest movement, insomnia	Been on Celexa for 10 years now, up and down in dose as lifes stresses went up and down... 40mg now for past 2 years. Doctor added abilify for possible Bipolar 2. I took at 7pm and within 2 hours I was sweating profusely and kept doing so for the next 24 hours, then it started to go away. I wasn't hot, I even cranked up the air conditioner, didn't help at all. I soaked my clothes and sheets. This caused some dehydration which didn't help the nausea. That was also extreme. I never actually vomited but still laid on the bathroom floor just in case. The first few bouts of it I could barely move. I was flushed and weak and trembling it was so bad.I also couldn't sleep, which I'd already been fighting insomnia the past few months. But this made it worse as I couldn't sleep more then 10-30 mins at a time. The constant sweating didn't help when trying to sleep.I'm not saying don't take this med. I dealt with bad nausea for weeks when I first started it, and also when I went without for over a week. Just wanted to share what happened to me	F	32	1  days	8/2/2009
5	major depression/Bipolar	None really..Some initial insomnia but got better with time. Sexual sides are minimal and never a problem	A great medicine.It worked the 1st day I took it (5 mg)..I felt so much better..NOTHING has worked for me except Abilify and Parnate. People love to rant and rave when something is not working for them. Fine. But please don't tell other people to stay away from the drug because it doesn't work for you. If your having a hard time finding something that works, try this med. It works quickly so you'll know if it's for you without having to wait 2-4 weeks.	M	49	60  days	7/31/2009
1	Bipolar Disorder	Weight Gain	I was taking this medicine for about half a year and was recommended to not go off of it. In this six month period I gained 67 pounds. It also made it very hard to lose the weight afterward. Here I am almost two years later, and I am five pounds away from getting rid of the 67 I initially gained. Although the weight is gone, the stretch marks remain and still will. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE.	F	22	6  months	7/27/2009
5	schizo personality disorder	I LOVE ABILIFY!!  It is my favorite antipsychotic.  Side effects range from mild tiredness and hunger spells to insomnia at bed time.  But that helps with Ambien CR which my doc loves to prescribe like candy to me!  Abilify helps tremendously with voices and does not give me the akathisia movement disorder like the "dones" risperidone and ziprasidone antipsychotic do 100% of the time.	This medicine is a mild antipsychotic when it comes to side effects when compared to other antipsychotics.  I would recommend ABILIFY (aripiprazole) over the other atypical antipsychotics any day.	M	29	6  years	7/23/2009
1	Schizophrenia	Couldn't stop moving, couldn't sleep.  Paranoid, anxious.	This is hell.	M	18	4  weeks	7/22/2009
1	major life long depression	I had a STROKE after 9 days on this awful medicine. I've been on wellbutrin for years and started to feel a deeper depression than normal. My psychiatrist put me on Abilify as a boost. Within 3 days I became very confused and very tired. It was the weekend, on Monday I called the doctor. He said it was the side effects and would clear up, that I had only been on it 6 days. On Thursday, I called and told him that I was stopping it. In addition to the confusion, I was having a hard time talking. He said the side effects would probably be gone by my appointment. They got worse! I couldn't remember how to use my utensils, my toothbrush etc. I couldn't spell or write, was mixing up the phone number even if I was looking at it. Monday, he still felt that it was side effects but at my insistence he sent me right to a neurologist, who ran me through a number of tests. He agreed that it was side effects. If I wasn't better in 3 weeks, he'd do a CAT scan. After 1 week insisted on the scan and lo	I was 62 years old and do not have dementia. My doctor did not consider me elderly. At what age does the drug company consider elderly? My doctor said that this shouldn't have happened. I am better but not back to the way I was before Abilify and the stroke. After 13 months I don't feel that I am getting any better and I honestly feel the problems I am still having are permanent. But it could have been worse, I wasn't paralyzed! Even with the computer, this write up has taken me 2 1/2 hours to compose.	F	63	9  days	7/15/2009Email
2	Some psychotic disorder	Akathisia. Insomnia.	Tried Abilify for a while and was hoping the initial akathisia and insomnia would go away, but after a month there was no change, so I gave it up.	M	34	1  months	7/14/2009
1	depression	I had bad nausea and vomiting. Very bad acne. Super drowsy.	It didn't even help with my condition. I have been trying it out for about 4-5 weeks and the side effects are horrible. I was still the same person I was before takin Abilify if not worse.	F	21	5  weeks	7/10/2009
2	Depression	Nausea, vomiting, anxiety, restlessness	Only took 2.5mg and had horrible first day so I decided not to continue taking it.	F	33	1  days	7/9/2009
1	Bipolar	Explosive headaches, sexual dysfunction, blurry vision, muscle stiffness, indigestion, nausea, loss of concentration and memory impairment	I am a heart patient and have also experienced sky high BP. I have no idea why this drug would even have been prescribed to me. I agree it is a poison.	M	51	1  months	7/5/2009
4	Pediatric BP rapid cycling	tired, sleepy,	9 yr old boy, started on 10 mg then increased to 15 mg. Takes 900mg lithium and 15 mg Abilify. Takes all at night due to sleepiness. Is a bit far away during the day on the 15 mg. Hardly any mania or outbursts. No complaints of inner restlessness. No weight gain. Appetite is normal.	M	9	1  months	7/3/2009Email
1	Bipolar	Miserable, horrible drug: extreme fatigue, bloated face, mental sluggishness and confusion.	NO theraputic effects whatsoever for me. Useless. I took it for about 6 months in 2003 and was taken off it by my psych. at my sister's urging. She came to see me at Christmas and was shocked at what she found. I was not even aware of how bad it was until I was taken off it.	F	41	6  months	7/3/2009
1	BiPolar II	Severe headache, tooth pain, muscle aches, depression, lethargy, trouble sleeping, jaw pain.	Called doctor and she said I had an allergic reaction to Abilify and to discontinue use immediately.  If you have any of the symptoms listed above, contact your doctor ASAP.	F	35	1  days	7/1/2009
5	Schizoaffective Disorder	I initially experienced Akathesia, Nystagmus and sleepiness. Then my dosage was recently upped from 20 mgs to 25 mgs due to break through depression, after that I did feel some nausea. Other than those few side effects I've felt fine on Abilify. I would recommend Abilify to others who are being carefully monitored by their Psychiatrist. I just happen to have an excellent Dr., which does make a difference.	I take Abilify along with Divalproex Sodium ER 1250 mgs for migraines, Clonazepam, Cogentin 1 mg for Akathesia, 2 grs of Armour Thyroid for Hypothyroidism.	F	47	5  years	6/28/2009
