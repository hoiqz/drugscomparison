1	High BP	Severe urinary track infection, enlarged boggy prostate an urethritis. Went through every test know to man for UTI including very painful scopes of the bladder an biopsy of the prostate. Was put on several different antibiotics for UTI even though no bacteria was ever found in clutters or urine. Read someone else experienced the same type problems with a 300 mg does of Tekturna but when dosage was decreased symptoms decreased same here. Took me almost a year of the worst urinary pain imaginable to figure this out !!! It was Horrible!!		M	49	2  years300 mg	3/27/2013

1	was told it was a safe drug. lied	It is very bad drug.  It has caused me a lot of problems.  Even heart problems		F	71	3  years300/12.5	12/21/2012Email
2	Hypertension	Bloating, aching joints, leg cramps, fatigue, acid reflux, coughing, insomnia.	I really didn't know I was having side effects until I started reading the comments on this page and realized I was experiencing so may of the same issues.  I stopped taking it yesterday and I have immediately felt better.  I don't feel bloated at all, I slept amazingly well last night, my nightime coughing has stopped, no acid reflux last night and I have so much energy I can't even believe it.  I've been taking my BP and while it is elevated, it's only slightly higher than when I was taking the Tekturna.  Now that I feel so fantastic, I definitely don't want to go back on it.  I don't know what my doctor will say about this, but it's so nice not to feel like crap any more!	F	41	1  years150 mg 1X D	12/8/2012Email

2	High blood pressure	Hair loss, severe cough	I took Tekturna  for approx four years before I had to stop due to severe coughing (so bad that I broke a blood vessel in an eye). Prior to that, I experienced substantial hair loss, which started about 6 months into the treatment. But Tekturna worked fairly well. I was sorry I had to stop using it, but the constant and severe cough was unbearable.	F	64	4  years300 mg 1X D	6/6/2012Email
3	HP	I don't know about anyone else but the Tekturna helped a little with my blood pressure.  It has caused me some swelling in the feet however my biggest complaint is GERD.  It causes me severe GERD.  I have been put on Zantac but it is not helping.		F	60	20  days300 1X D	4/23/2012
1	Blood Pressure	Chills, fever, orange urine with slight red tint from blood, high liver enzymes,high protein level in urine, slight jaundice under eyes, slight bilirubin levels, stomach and back pain. No hep A, B, or C. Organ scans normal, no gallstones. I stopped the drug and within 48 hours my urine was back to normal color. Chills and fever were gone. Rechecked liver enzymes and they were back to normal. I would not take this drug again.		M	45	 150 1X D	3/15/2012Email
5	Hypertension	None	In 2007 my BP was 240/120, and was also diagnosed with a bundle block.  I had a pacemaker implanted and cardiologist put me on Micardis/Hct and later added Norvasc.  My BP would never get lower than 140/100.  He then put me on 150 mg of Tekturna and within a month I was down to around 110/70.  I have maintained that for almost 3 yrs but yesterday my PCP called and told me to quit taking it because of some recent warnings.  I asked what the warning was about and was told there were instances of sudden cardiac arrest.  Great!  This medication worked for me and now I'm told to quit taking it.  To add to the frustration I have had to change my Plan D carrier twice because the ones I had dropped it from their formulary.  Now I've been put on Bystolic and I'm worried because of the complaints I've been reading about it.	M	68	3  years150 mg 1X D	1/10/2012Email
1	High blood pressure	Weight gain, joint pain, insomnia. The pain in my back, legs and ankles is bad. I hope this is reversible.		F		3  months	12/25/2011Email
4	FMD of the renal artery-high BP	Insomnia; other than that none so far.	I am on several medications to control my BP but this one seems to help the most- Toprol, Lisinopril, Norvasc, Hydralazine,Clonodine patches plus orally did not control the BPafter 4 renal angioplasties and a stent in the right renal artery. I found that it takes over the 2 weeks noted in the literature to really help. It is worth the money to take it as it won't go generic for ? 5 more years.	F	73	6  months300 mgm 1X D	12/6/2011Email
1	I had slightly elevated B/P	I had the worst back pain you could imagine. I ended up first in urgent care and then in the emergency room. I could only get to sleep with help from percocet and could only get through my day with a muscle relaxer. I had all over joint and muscle pain. I thought I had fibromyalgia.	Once I realized it was the Tekturna I called the doctor and discontinued the medication. Within one week the back pain was gone. The muscle and joint pain was gone. However, I now have residual neurogenic pain in the last area of my upper back that was affected by Tekturna.	F	52	3  months 1X D	7/29/2011Email
1	blood pressure	This has got to be one of the worst medicines that I have ever encountered! It made my joints ache, I felt like I had been posioned-my stomache felt like a was going to throw up all of the time, it put so much pressure on top of my head that I thought it would expode, no sleep at all, thank god my doctor changed my prescription. It did keep my blood pressure in check, but created so many other problems, never take that again!		F	66	35  days150mg 1X D	7/6/2011Email
1	HBP	At first, I did not suspect this med. I thought I'd gotten an upper resp infection. My cough started slowly, like when you have bronchitis and quickly worsened. I was so busy at work, I was trying to push through it. Went to doc to see about what I thought was bronchitis, and found that my blood pressure, which had been somewhat high (150/80) was now 290/212. I was admitted to the hospital, for what was expected to be an overnight stay, turned into 11 days. Tekturna caused immediate CHF and a myriad of other issues. My blood pressure has not been controlled since, but not as severe as when on this med. Because of this incident, I am now uninsurable, lost my health insurance and have more problems than ever - not to mention huge medical bills I'm still paying off. I would NEVER take this med, or any other in this class again.	Agreed - the clinical studies on this were extremely skewed. I am so sorry I ever tried this med. For 25 years Zestoretic did a very reasonable job with many fewer side effects.	F	58	15  days150 mg 1X D	6/26/2011Email
4	high blood pressure	bp rose very high initially at night, but I felt energetic in the day. Doc changed to HCT formula. It still didn't work to lower bp, but I loved how I felt. Diovan added..mostly works now. I take 150 in morning and again in early afternoon (not at night, cant sleep). I must diet (Atkins) or I would gain weight rapidly. All worth it to me to feel good and not so tired.		F	69	5  months150 mg 2X D	4/29/2011Email
1	High Blood Pressure	Moderate difficulty breathing; dizziness & light headed; rise in BP & pulse rate over 10 days from 122/70  to 167/82; dry cough;	I took for 10 days and my BP went up a little each day and developed the side effects mentioned to the left. Called Doctor and he told me to stop taking tekturna, and go back on Verapamil ( which caused MAJOR palpitations - so I'll be med free until he figures out what to give me next).It seems Tekturna doesn't lower BP for a lot of people from what I read in this site. The Novartis (maker) website barely touches on this side effect in their clinical trials, saying only that ...2.2% of patients were removed from tekturna for "uncontrolled hypertension. 2.2% of 6,450 patients in the trial = 142 people.What good is a BP med if it RAISES your BP?Want to see the shocking truth about how patients are chosen for "clinical trials?"  GOOGLE  Clinical Trial, and read the WikiPedia article. Women, children, the elderly, and those with common medical conditions are frequently excluded from trials. That is to prevent those people from having adverse effects to skew the results of the drugs during trials so the FDA will approve them. Yet the drug will be prescribed to those same women, children, the elderly, etc at some point, and they will experience bad reactions to the drugs, reactions that would have been discovered in trials. All so the Pharmaceutical Industry cam earn Billions of $$ a year in obscene profits.	M	55	10  days150 mg 1X D	12/3/2010
1	HBP	By the 5th day began having severe and constant arrythmias, to the point that ER trip was needed.  Had been taking Cozaar (Losartan) also, so perhaps the two combined contributed. (?) No heart problems were discovered, so it appeared that the only variable was the initiation of Tekturna.  Wonder if anyone has had this problem, because journal evidence does not list arrythmias as a possible side-effect.

1	High BP	gingival pain , headache and stomach cramps.	Didn't lower BP at all.	M	41	2  weeks150mg 1X D	8/24/2010
4	high blood pressure	Headache, neck pain, muscle pain, diarhea, throat problems	After taking other BP drugs for years with terrible side effects, Tekturna helped get BP down to average 135/70 and holding. It was reduced to one 150 mg tablet per day with success. I hope to get it reduced to 75 mg soon.	M	79	22  months150 mg 2X D	7/25/2010
2	Hypertnesion	Weight gain, depression and doesn't lower bp enough.  Stays around 145/89.		F	51	3  months300 mg 1X D	7/20/2010
1	hypertension	bad stomach cramps, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing, rash on face	would not recommend this drug to anyone	M	59	60  days150 1X D	4/27/2010
2	hypertension	little diarrhea, and head throbbing	blood pressure actually went up from 150/90 to 180/100	M	47	30  days300 mg 1X D	2/13/2010
1	High Blood Pressure	After one week, experienced no change in bp rate.  Difficulty breathing, rash on neck, hard to swallow, tired and 5 pound weight gain.  Since day one, experienced severe headaches - all day.		F	49	6  days	2/3/2010
5	High Blood Pressure	Have had high BP for about a year. Almost every BP med I tried has had bad side effects EXCEPT Tekturna. I am taking 150 mg. Tekturna twice a day plus 100 mg Metoprolol twice a day. Began a year ago with BP at 212(!). Now in the 130's. New drug... your insurance may not cover any/all of the cost. Great stuff...give it a whirl if you've had problems with other BP meds.		M	62	2  months	1/16/2010
4	High bp	Tried Diovan, Benicar (cough with those) but Tekturna has least side effects. Worst side effect for me is weight gain. 10lbs in 5 months @ 300mg. On about 500 calories a day and cannot drop weight. Tinitus. Achy muscles(neck and lower back)every so often. It has affected my personality, not as much enthusiasm and drive which is very dissappointing.	It has controlled my bp so far.	F	64	5  months	12/26/2009
4	HBP	I have tried  every BP medicine and could not tolerate any of them. Tekturna (150mg) works for me, but I do have some side effects that are very bothersome. I have serious insomnia, and my heart beats rapidly, as high as 95-109 beats per minute. My Dr put me on Inderal to lower my pulse, but the insomnia persists.	Also started getting short of breath and cut my pill in half. It remedied this. My Dr explained that this medicine builds up in your system, and if you quit taking Tekturna, it would still lower blood pressure for 2 weeks.	F	56	8  months	10/1/2009
5	hypertension	I tried eleven (11) other medications before trying Tekturna and was either allergic or had horrible adverse reactions, and my blood pressure would not get lower. I've been taking 300 mg of Tekturna for 8 months now, and my blood pressure is normal. Also, I don't have any side effects! Thank goodness for Tekturna. It saved my life.		F	55	8  months	8/17/2009
2	High BP	none	Doesn't help whatsoever. asking for something else.	M	68	4  weeks	5/26/2009
1	For High Blood Pressure	Increased my High Blood Pressure even furtherDizzy, Pain in the legs and abdomen, in general unwell feeling	Would not recommend it.	F	67	4  weeks	4/26/2009
3	High BP	Only on Tekturna for 2 weeks and so far it's worked great, with no side effects.  Literature says diarrhea is the most common but I've had none.	Also read that it works much better with Diovan combined. So far it's working well by itself 135/70 but since I was on Diolvan alone before(which did 'not' keep my BP stable it was erratic but no side effects) I'll keep that in mind and if the BP does shoot back up I'll add the Diovan back with the Tekturna. I liked the way it worked directly on the Renin, differently than the ARBs or ACE inhibitors or esp. the Beta blockers.  Fingers crossed.	F	55	2  weeks	4/10/2009
3	High Blood Pressure	No side effects noticed, except for maybe making my bp go higher.  Worked great (150mg) .. for about 2 months.  Doctor said if bp starts to creep up, then to double the dose.  I moved to 300mg for a few days, which made me feel even worse, and my bp went up even higher.  I read that the renin rebound is higher with these types of drugs when compared with the ACEs and ARBs.  Was then given 5mg lisinopril (dad's been on this one @20mg with success for 10+ years) to add to the 150mg tekturna, which worked, but too good.  I started consistently getting 100/60 readings with heart rate high 70's in the evening, and my body just didn't feel right during those times.  After a month and a half of that, I went to tekturna 150mg and lisinopril 2.5mg.  In less than a week, bp was up and I felt like crap.  Switched back to 150mg/5mg for a little over a week, which brought things down again, but like before.  I then switched to tekturna 75mg and lisinopril 5mg, which brought me energetically and bp	I do yoga once a week and practice a martial art twice a week.  If I open up and share that I battle high blood pressure, people are shocked.  I will say, during the times when taking this drug and when the bp has been under control, my sexual responsiveness was improved.  With that said, to all that are looking for the right bp drug for them, I say this one's worth a shot.	M	33	6  months	2/11/2009
5	High BP	None.	I have been taking Tekturna for well over a year.  It has lowered my blood pressure and I have experienced no side effects.	M	50	1.5  years	1/25/2009
1	HI Blood Pressure	After 2 weeks did not control BP. and made my puls race switched back to DIOVAN.  About that time I found some info ON LOWERING BP. W/ HI POTASSIUM DIET. BEEN EATING MASHED POTATOES (7 OZ.) = 1000 MG. POTASSIUM.  ALSO MORE VEGGIES & FRUIT. PLANTAINS ALSO ARE HI IN POTASSIUM.  USE A SALT SUBSTITUTE WHICH IS POTASSIUM 600MG/ 1/4TSP. IF I EAT SODIUM I TRY TO EQUAL W/POTASSIUM.  LAST 2 WEEKS DOING THIS I TAKE 1/2 (80MG) DIOVAN /DAY AND BP. STAYS AROUND 125/75.  TOOK ABOUT 8-9DAYS FOR DIET TO START WORKING.  I BELIEVE IN TIME I WILL BE DOWN TO 1/4 DIOVAN OR LESS/DAY.  TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS TAKING 1 1/4 DIOVAN /DAY (200MG) AND STILL BARELY CONTROLLING IT.	LOOK UP POTASSIUM RICH FOODS AND TRY IT.	M	44	15  days	1/2/2009
4	to lower blood pressure	This is my 6th medication in the last 2 years in an attempt to control my blood pressure.  I have been taking this medication for the past 4 months and my blood pressure is the lowest it has ever been and have experienced no side effect.	If anyone out there has experience with horrible side effects from blood pressure medication as I did, I would certainly recommend giving this medication a try.	F	65	4  months	12/28/2008
2	hypertension	I've been on 300 mg aliskiren since mid-July 2008.  It is now 10 Nov 2008 and I have been experiencing depression and weight gain along with insomnia.  I also take HCTZ 25mg and 10mg amlodipine. The aliskerin was substituted for good old lisinopril 20 mg. and I think the lisinopril worked better.  I still 'bang trips' (over 100 on diastolic) occasionally.  I'm goin for an echocardiogram to see if something physical is wrong with my heart.		M	57	120  days	11/10/2008
4	hypertension	None so far	This is my 8th BP medication in 20 years and so far the best.  Only complaint, it's relatively new so my medicare D insurance carrier doesn't cover it at all.	F	72	60  days	10/16/2008
4	High Blood Pressure	So far none.  On 150mg for 3 weeks.		F	38	20  days	10/15/2008
3	High BP	None yet	I've been on this med for seven days at 150mg....BP is still high, 178/112....Started today at 300mg...I will update this info soon.	M	48	7  days	10/9/2008
