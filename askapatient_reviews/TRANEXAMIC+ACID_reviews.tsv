3	long periods of heavy menstrual flo	I had nausea, headaches and extreme fatigue. This could be because of he heavy bleeding but I felt it made my symptoms worse. It never stopped my period like my doctor claimed it would.		M	22	4  days500	3/24/2013
1	heavy period	A burning sensation inside my bottom & nausea.		F	45	2  days500	3/17/2013
2	control heavy periods.	15oo mg a day and it only slightly helped control amount of bleeding. Had to stop taking it after 2 days as it caused severe nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Felt like a bad case of the flu and I could not get up. When I stopped taking it, symptoms cleared right up within hours. Glad it helped others but personally would not recommend it.

2	heavey bleeding and clots	No side effects, I take 3tablets 4 x daily. Stopped bleeding on provera, but due to a bad reaction was prescribed these and my bleeding and clots have now worsened and now I have unbearable cramping, I cannot live a normal life as my iron is very low and I also suffer from alpha thalasaemia.

5	heavy hemmoraging period was given.	None. i was in hospital for heavy bleeding this drug was injected in my drip.		F	49	1  daysby drip	8/31/2012
5	heavy extremely long periods	I have yet to feel any negative side effects after 3 months of use.	I have huge fibroids (my uterus is the size of a 5-month pregnancy because of them), so my periods were lasting up to 3 weeks and were so heavy I was completely anemic and lethargic (not to mention unable to work or lead a normal life). I was slated for a full hysterectomy, but my doctor decided to try cyklokapron first and these first 3 months have been HEAVEN. My period is SHORT AND LIGHT! I have my life back! I hope it keeps working this well!	F	38	4  days1000 MG 4X D	5/2/2012Email
2	heavy period	none, but the reduction in bleeding only lasted 9 months and it's now heavier than before		F	38	 30 3X D	5/30/2011
3	heavy period	worked for the first 5 months like a charm then my period came back with vengence.  After taking the drug (as prescribed by the doctor) my period was heavier (if that is possible) and 3 times longer.	No medical proffesional I have seen can understand how debilitating this problem is.  I usually walk out with the same advice:  eat more red meat and get a hysterectomy	F	46	3  days30mg 4X D	3/18/2011Email
4	heavy period due to uterine fibroid	No side effects	does anyone experience spotting or heavy bleeding when you stop taking the drug? I have been told to take it only during my period and to stop when the bleeding stops (hopefully it will!).	F	46	3  days1000mg 3X D	3/3/2011
5	Heavy Periods & clotting	Have had no side effects at all	I can now go to work & not worry about have to change every 1 1/2 hours or so	F	51	5  months30mg 3X D	5/4/2010
5	for really heavy periods	I am still unable to feel any side effects related cyklokapron	It has made a huge difference to amount of blood loss during menstruation. These tablets have made my periods lighter.  I have become anaemic all my life due to really heavy bleeding. I wish i could of been taking these years ago.  Now I can restore my Iron count back to normal with the help of Iron pills.	F	42	4  months	1/13/2010Email
5	Very heavy periods/cramping	Cannot directly relate anything to tablets.	Taking 2 tablets, three times a day for 3-4 days of period.  Has given a much needed respite from flooding and very painful cramps.	F	45	3  months	8/4/2008
5	Very Heavy Menstrual bleeding	I have been taking this medication for over 2 1/2 years now due to severly heavy menstural bleeding and cramping.  Before being prescribed this medication , which I take  2 pills twice a day for every day of the bleeding, I was bleeding so heavily that I wound up in the ER/A&E.  Not a pretty sight.	This medication is a god send.  It has cut the amount of bleeding down by about 25-30% and the cramps by about 25%.  I used to not be able to get out of bed before when I was on my period, now I can just about make it through the day.  And for some reason, either this medication or my moon cup(www.mooncup.co.uk) the length of my period has gone down by at least a day as well!!	F	23	2  years	11/10/2006
4	heavy periods	None but was never quite sure when to stop taking it as sometimes period would recur		F	43	 	7/7/2006Email

1	menorrhagia	Headache more like sinus headaches	I have been bleeding for three weeks after taking Lysteda for the first five days of my cycle; Lysteda has not worked for me at all.	F	42	5  days650 mg 6X D	6/1/2013Email

5	Heavy period, painful periods		Noticed a difference by the time I took my second dose! Periods are much more manageable and not debilitating any more. I would recommend this to anyone suffering from unmanageable periods. I have also noticed since I have been taking it the past several months that even if I do not take it every period that my period is still lighter! For me this was a godsend!	F	26	 650mg 1X AN	2/23/2013Email
4	Dysmenorrhea and heavy periods	None that outweighed my dysmenorrhea.	For 5 years since the birth of my youngest, I have experienced the most excruciating pain with my cycle. I have never experienced painful periods before her birth. I also have what my OB suspects as "retrograde blood flow" -- which means the periods were so heavy the blood would flow back up thru the fallopians and into my abdomen.  Also, since  I got pregnant with my youngest daughter while on BC, I have had reactions to all BC since.  I refused an IUD and opted to "suffer" monthly.  My OB gave me a sample of Lysteda and it has helped.  I still have bad cramping, but the flow is much less, more tolerable and I don't feel like Carrie on prom night.	F	36	5  months2 tabs 3X D	1/24/2013Email
4	Uterine fibroids and heavy periods	No side effects 	For me, Lysteda is better than taking birth control to lessen/stop the bleeding.  The first time I had to take it the bleeding lessened within hours (I had been changing sanitary products every other hour a day and doubling protection at night), and within 3 days it stopped.  On the last occurrence although I had lighter bleeding, it took the entire 5 day dose before the flow lessened considerably.	F	52	5  days1300 3X D	11/2/2012
3	Heavy Cycle	Prolonged cycles. While on pills will dramatically decrease flow and produced a lot of clotting, (not for sure is the drug is suppose to produce clotting). Once I stop taking because I only took on my heavy days my cycle will start again with periodic spotting days later. I will discontinue use at this time to see if its the pills or something else	I have recommended this product to others and they as well have discontinued use for various reasons.	F	36	4  months650mg 3X D	10/31/2012
4	Heavy period/sharp pains in vagina	Back pain and extreme leg pain to the point where I stopped taking it. I go in on Monday, 10/8 to my Dr.	I only used it for 2 months and I saw a MAJOR change in my cycles. The leg pain will not go away and I recalled that its one of the side effects, so I stopped taking the meds. I love having light, managebale periods, but my leg and back pain outweighs it and I just want the pain to stop.	F	39	4  days 6X D	10/3/2012Email
1	to control heavy cycles	The first month I didn't recognize any side effects.  I thought this was a miracle drug. I did notice that I started suffering from chronic fatigue.  I thought it was because I had been out of the country and picked up a bug.  The next month I suffered blurred vision and an ocular migraine, still I didn't make the connection to the medication.  I did realize that the dose I took the first month was too much so the second month I cut it in 1/2.  It still worked great for my period so I didn't even think about the fact that my back hurt a little and I had a stuffy nose, and I had blurry vision.  I thought dry eyes, left over illness from being out of the country.  Then the third month came around and I took the medicine and had the strongest reaction.  (In the mean time I had been to the dr and they diagnosed me with anemia, another side effect I was unaware of) The third time on the medicine I had a very bad headache, shortness of breath, chestpain, blurred vision, extreme fatigue, sinu		F	41	3  months65 3X D	9/20/2012Email
5	Heavy menstrual bleeding	No side effects. This slowed my horrible bleeding to barely spotting. I cannot take hormones or bc pills so this med has been a wonderful solution. I like that you oonly need to take it for five days or less instead of daily.		F	35	2  months3x a day	7/4/2012
1	Bleeding due to uterine fibroids	Side effects from my first and only dose were extreme: hypertension, headache, nausea, vertigo, sleep disturbances, abdomen felt like supernovas were exploding in it. And my fibroid bleeding increased!	Caveat emptor with Lysteda. My gynecologist wanted me to take this drug three times a day for at least three days. After enduring those frightening side effects from just one dose, I told her NO WAY. Obviously this was not the drug for me. My body reacted as if it were a poison. Fortunately, by 24 hours after that single dose, my blood pressure had dropped back to normal, and all the side effects had disappeared.	F	54	1  days650 mg 1X D	5/20/2012
5	Very Heavy Periods & Bad Cramps	Headache & Stuffy Nose but it is worth it.	This is fantastic. I used to have horrible extremely heavy and painful periods that lasted for about 7 days. Now my periods are very light (like spotting almost) and completely pain free and only last for 3 days. I would highly recommend this.	F	19	7  months 3X D	5/19/2012
5	extremely heavy periods due to fibr	none	I normally have crazy periods and lose so much blood it makes me anemic.  my Dr. prescribed Lysteda.   Started my period yesterday and after 1 dose my period changed to spotting.  After 2 doses it stopped completely.	F	57	1  days2 pills 3X D	3/27/2012
2	Heavy Period	Room-spinning dizziness and headache.  Some anxiety but that might be just a reaction to the dizziness.	The first go round, my period stopped after the 1st dose.  Unfortunately, the last three rounds I have taken it, have not lessened the bleeding one iota.  	F	47	4  months1300 mg 3X D	10/18/2011Email
5	Heavy Heavy periods	I absolutley cannot describe the relief that I received within hours of taking this drug.  I thought that taking it 3 times a day was going to be hard but I will tell you that after the first dose and within hours I noticed a difference I didnt want the flow to start back up.  I stopped my period within 3 days and swear by this drug.  I used to plan my family outings by my periods...now I take my Lysteda.  LOVE THIS DRUG		F	31	5  days650 3X D	9/29/2011Email
5	Debilitating periods	slight achiness, barely noticeable	Before this drug, I was bleeding so heavily I slept with super plus tampon AND maxi pad, and still had to wake during the night to change every 3 hours. I was in so much pain I was crawling on the floor for one day each month and missing all activities for days. Lysteda has really helped! At 47, I had an ovary removed due to cyst, but periods continued worsening. My Dr. kept telling my to "just get a hysterectomy" but I refused. Lysteda was a last ditch effort and so far, so good. Since I'm sensitive, I started out with 2x/day, but feel that 3x a day will be manageable next month.	F	48	1  months2 pills 2X D	8/19/2011Email
5	Lessen monthly bleeding	Changed my life completely. I went from bleeding through double protection and my clothes for days on end to a normal, light period. I was amazed at how well it works.		F	37	1  months 3X D	5/16/2011Email
5	Heavy Mentrual Bleeding	There were no side effects at all	This drug is amazing.  It helped my heavy bleeding considerably with no side effects. And while the recommended dose is 1300mg 3x a day for 5 days, i find that 650mg 3x a day for 5 days works just as well, so if you start this drug, ask your doctor if you can start at a lower dose.
