3	Cyst	Extreme nausea throughout entire day, loose stools, tired. Wake up in mild of night, occasionally, with unbearable nausea and stomach pain	works for my skin but isnt worth feeling like death every day	F	21	60  days 1X D	3/31/2010
1	staph infection/impetigo	stomach pain; vomiting bile; heart murmur, near heart attack	At first, the pills just gave me a terrible stomach ache, which turned slowly into a full-blown ulcer and diverticulitis.  Then, when given it again, it nearly killed me.  I vomited up bile, my joints swelled up: my ankles and knees were the same size.	F	39	3  weeks	12/5/2007
1	Sore throat/ strep throat	I have abdominal cramping. Lots of air in my stomach making it hurt. It only stops when I eat. Very sharp and sever pain, although it is helping the infection...	I think that if you have an alternative medicine method you should take it. I have to take two of these pills twice a day, and I hate it..	F	17	10  days	9/17/2007
