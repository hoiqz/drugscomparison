5	ibs	Little tired but when I had less spasm and lightned sharpness a lot. Took a little bit to get used to it but works better than hoaycyamine for same thing no more pain is the result my job revolves around concentration at all times so this pill works for me may want to consider how much pain in abdominal cramps you can take this does work for me...dh		M	42	2  months10mg	1/2/2013
5	IBS/vertigo/chronic diarrhea	None! This changed my quality of life! I was violently ill several times over the course of 3years & docs didn't know why. I got so sick shortly after eating food that I had vomiting, severe cramping, diarrhea, spinning vertigo, nausea. Couldn't even walk during these attacks and ended up in ER a few times. I was finally given this med after being prescribed many drugs as trials. This worked & ice not been sick once since I started this 4 months ago! A real lifesaver!		F	44	4  months10mg	10/9/2012
1	BLADDER INFECTION AND GASTRITIS	Bloated, heartburn, vomiting		F	22	4  days20 mg	10/8/2012Email
4	IBS, Gluten intolerance	Dry mouth, a little drowsy	I've been taking this medicine a long time, before I took it I was having dirah about 10 times per day. I was in constant pain, couldn't work, had severe stomach cramps. And the moment I took it, I didn't have any more direah, no more stomach cramps either. It is my miracle pill!!!!	F	27	3  years 3X D	8/29/2012Email
5	diarrhea 3-5 times a day 8 months	i never experienced any side effects	i am still taking bentyl  and in the past month, i had diarrhea onceand i fear that without it i will go back to the same problem sountil my doctor says i should quit the medication, i will continueto use it.	F	72	3  months10mg 2X D	8/20/2012
5	IBS	No side effects	I was diagnosed with IBS in 1991 and have been on Bentyl ever since.  I take it only when I need it.  Some times, I will take 4 pills daily...then months will pass when I do not need any at all.  This has been a God-send for me.	F	70	22  years10 mg 1X D	8/4/2012
5	Colon Spasms/IBS	Dry mouth	Bentyl is my miracle pill! I have suffered on and off for over 10 years with stomach problems and back pain. After my last emergency room visit, I was forced to see a GI doctor. She prescribed Bentyl as part of my "cocktail" of meds, and it gave me my life back! I realize it's not for everyone, but it is definitely worth trying!	F	41	3  months10 3X D	7/25/2012Email
2	Crohns/intestinal spasms	Lightheadedness, dizziness, hives/rash, headache, extremely dry mouth, nausea, blurry vision.	Diagnosed with Crohn's 14 yrs ago, and was put on Bentyl then (10 mg though). It didn't help much then but that's been a long time and now the dosage was more, I thought maybe would work this time. I got huge red patches of skin, I'm talking 7 inches long, up to 3 inches wide, and on top of that, it only helped the pain for 1 to 2 hours. It wasn't worth it the first time I took it and it's not worth it now. Like any drug, it works for some not for others.	F	47	2  weeks20 2X D	6/27/2012Email
2	Stomach cramps	This drug made me have severe diarrhea, gas. My stomach became descended and I have egg burps. This is not a good medication for me!!!		F	33	2  days30mg	6/16/2012
5	For Rectal Pain/Spasms	Only a little tired at times.  But nothing really bad.  It does calm me and I feel comforted about that.	I would recommend Bentyl to anyone!  For 3 long year I have had rectal pain all day long.  It was to the point where I had to get on pain medication.  I had to go to the ER one night it got so bad I was crying and in alot of pain.  They gave me 40 MG's of Bentyl and I was shocked!  The pain subsided.  My GI doctor finally gave it to me and I'm trying to adjust the medication so I can live pain free and comfortable.  This has been a God send to me!  If I have alittle breakthrough discomfort I just take OTC pain meds and I'm fine.  I take the Bentyl 1/2 hr before I eat.  And the side effects aren't as bad then.  Don't suffer anymore....They are worth their weight in gold.	F	54	1  months20 MG 4X D	6/14/2012Email
5	ibs/colitis	Dry mouth, out of body feeling, dizzy. I only feel like this If I take it on an empty stomach. Otherwise, only dry mouth.		F	33	1  monthsAN	6/13/2012Email
4	Irritable bowel syndrome	Dry mouth at times, slight dizziness, "loopy" or "numb" feeling, slight decrease in appetite an hour or two after taking it.		F	22	3  months20mg 4X D	5/14/2012Email
1	Diarrhea, cramping, suspected IBS	Severe constipation, bloating, gas cramping, severe nausea, heart racing, spacey "drugged" feeling, dizziness.This drug was a nightmare for me. I took it only once a day for three days. The first dose was fine, as I took it right before bed. The second dose had me up most of the night with my heart racing and fluttering. I also felt flushed and my skin felt like it was burning up, although my fianc said I was icy cold. After the third dose, I woke up bloated, severely constipated, gassy and overwhelmingly nauseated. The cramping was so bad I couldn't stand up. That was a Sunday- its now Thursday night and I still feel awful. I'm still gassy, stomach distended several inches, heart flutters and I havent been able to eat much all week. Be very careful with this drug!		F	28	3  days	3/29/2012
4	IBS symptoms	Drowsier in the afternoons after the second dose of the day. Blocks sweat glands. I don't seem to sweat when I work out, even when its real hot outside.	SO far Bentyl has been great for me. I was getting sick as much as twice a week and now I get sick about once every 3 months and that is typically after eating a lot of junk and lactose. Miracle drug. Definitely worth a shot.	F	30	8  months10 2X D	3/17/2012Email
5	UlcerativeColitis	Sleepy but worrh it! AMEN relief of horrid painful bowel spasms!:)		F	50	6  days20mg	3/12/2012
5	IBS	Slight dizziness, tiredness...not to the extreme. I only take as needed. This medication is a god send. I was in so much pain I was unable to eat or stand straight. Controls the unbearable pain and have been able to gain back some of the 30 pounds I lost from bowel attacks.		F	22	3  years10-20mg	2/28/2012
3	Stomach cramps, nausea	It dried out my mouth and lungs (which exacerbated asthma).  It also caused some drowsiness.	It did help out with the stomach cramps and, to a lesser degree, nausea.  However, the fact that it dried out my lungs and made the asthma worse made me not take it again.	M	49	30  days25 MG. 2X D	2/27/2012
4	IBS/Gas Cramps		Takes 45 minutes to an hour to work.	M	21	8  months20 1X AN	1/4/2012Email
4	IBS	Dry mouth, occasional dizziness, constipation if I don't keep on top of drinking extra water, especially when taking it 3 times a day instead of just 2.	This med has helped me a lot.  Unfortunately, I'm still having pain and gas even on it; the dr. said I might need surgery but I'm skeptical that that's the right thing for this problem.	F	49	50  days10 mg 3X D	12/29/2011Email
5	Severe IBS	Sometimes feel aloof ~ Dry mouth ~ Tired	A Godsend!  As a teacher, I can't just run to the bathroom, and this miracle medicine has changed my life.  I don't have the fear or panic once associated with severe IBS.  The side effects are so worth the comfort Bentyl has given me.	F	47	5  weeks10mg 3X D	12/11/2011Email
4	IBS	Dry mouth, stoned feeling, a feeling of not really being with it, nausea and bladder irritation.		F	36	3  years	11/28/2011Email
1	IBS, Overactive colon	Vertigo	This is the only time in my life that I have had vertigo. It was not consistent, but it was absolutely horrible. I would rather wear a diaper than go thru that again.... My doc prescribed hyoscyamine (levsin generic) which said could cause dizziness- but have had no ill effects other that slight dry mouth.	M	40	3  months10mg 3X D	10/25/2011
5	IBS	Blurred vision/photophobia, auditory hallucinations/invasive thoughts when taken in conjunction with Trazodone for sleep, slight tremors, occasional muscle twitches.	I know all of that sounds bad but it's honestly nothing compared to what IBS was putting me through. It also has a noticeable anxiolytic effect.	M	20	4  days20 MG 4X D	9/29/2011
4	IBS due to Anxiety	Light headedness, Mellow, dry mouth.	I took Bentyl specifically for the IBS but the mellow "high" feeling is a good feeling for me, relief from the anxiety which causes my IBS. Thing is I tend to get adjusted to it. Making it  hard to take the right dosage because I constantly adjust it. I'll skip a day to let the Bentyl filter out before taking it again the next day. Specifically on my days off. Hate going through my dosage so fast.	F	20	3  months20mg 6X D	9/23/2011
4	IBS	Change in vison, auditory hallucinations, hives, rash, feeling of lightheadedness, drowsiness, fatigue.	Although I do LOVE how Bentyl has helped by horrible stomach cramps, I did develop hives and this had reassured me that I cannot tolerate it. I had tolerated it up until that point because it worked so well. I first began with auditory hallucinations when taking the maximum of 3 a day. I stopped this and began only taking it once a day. I still developed hives and was disappointed I could not use it anymore.	F	22	3  months10 mg 3X D	9/13/2011Email
5	IBS	Dry mouth, but sipping liquids throughout the day helps enormously.	Every month I would have an attack that caused excruciating cramps and pain. Sometimes the pain was  so bad that I would have to go the ER. After an attack, my entire abdomen would feel so bruised that I could not stand up straight for two or three days. Levsin SL did nothing to help. My doctor recently switched me to Bentyl. So far it has been a miracle drug. While I still have cramping when gas passes through my intestines, it is very minimal.	F	50	1  months10mg 4X D	9/4/2011Email
1	Unknown stomach/back/gas pain	Within 10 mins I felt my chest get very tight and had shortness of breath, anxiety do to the prior side effects and racing heart beat.after a nap 6 hours later i went to work and had to leave after 2 hours. Intense tightness in chest, very heard to breath(weezing) and increased heart rate and feeling very faintish.	This drug was a nightmare for me, the only time i ever felt like that was when I had zoloft one time. I really don't think i have IBS but i was willing to try it cause the only other suggestion the doc had for me was antidepressants and counseling	M	30	1  days20 mg 1X D	9/1/2011Email
1	ER visit	SEVERE blurred vision, dizziness, very dry mouth, drowsiness, chills.	I was sent to the ER due to bad stomach pains. The doctor gave me Bentyl because he thought it was due to IBS. 5 minutes after taking it I could not even read the text on my cell phone my vision was so blurred. The blurriness lasted around 15 minutes. It was very uncomfortable. The dizziness was horrible too. I remember having a hard time walking to the bathroom. My mouth became so dry that they had to put me on a IV to pump more fluids in me. Just be careful if you have to take this stuff.	M	21	1  days20mg 1X D	8/13/2011Email
4	IBS,IBD,and Stomach cramps	When first used Bentyl I had diarrhea, and some drowsiness, eventually went away.	I'm still taking Bentyl if needed.	F	16	4  months10 MG 4X D	7/1/2011
5	IBS w/ constipation	Intermittent dizziness (feels like back of head is spinning) and blurry vision (have to wear reading glasses all the time, not just in low-light situations as prior to bentyl)	This drug has been like a miracle, and I'd nominate my doctor for a nobel prize for prescribing this if I could!  After only 24 hours on it, it totally ended the 20+ years of agonizing pain, spasms and cramps I have endured with IBS-C.  The side effects are very minor compared to the debilitating pain of IBS.  Now my digestive system is normal, I don't have to worry about attending meetings, etc. at work. Prior to bentyl, the pain was so severe I could not maintain an upright position, and it would last for weeks and weeks until I basically stopped eating.  I take one (1) 10-mg capsule in the morning (two if I anticipate it being a stressful day) and maybe one (1) more at or after lunch.  I have had NO PAIN and NO constipation since starting bentyl, and it is not expensive either.	F	45	2  weeks10 mg 1X AN	5/22/2011Email
3	Severe upper stomach pains	Extreme lightheaded-ness, dizzy..feel very "high"..did help my stomach pain somewhat but not worth the feeling it gave me!		F	22	2  days10 MG 2X D	5/19/2011
5	IBS/Diverticulitis	none...a little drowsiness but it is well worth it since my IBS is horrible.	I only take it as needed since my IBS only acts up during periods of high stress.  I was totally surprised to see some of the comments on side effects, since I have had none.  It is the first medication to curb the IBS and I am so grateful for it.  I have a long commute and am always scared about having an IBS attack.  With Bentyl, I no longer have to worry since it works very quickly.	F	48	3  months10mg 3X D	3/22/2011
4	IBS	A little lightheaded...diarrhea when I first started the drug which actually made me feel so much better in the end!!!	The problem is that people only feel compelled to write up a review when they are not happy with something.  I would suggest trying Bentyl for yourself and see how it works.  I figured out that I don't want to take it 3 times a day and only use it when I start feeling bad or if I know I'm about to eat something that's going to cause my IBS to flair up.	F	30	10  days20 2X D	3/22/2011
3	Crohn's / Ulcerative Colitis	None	I've had Crohn's for 29 years, and was diagnosed with UC four years ago. When I was in Asia on travel years ago, I was having cramps, and got OTC from a pharmacy a tiny pill called BUSCOPAN. Hallelujah! One little 10mg pill gave me instant relief from spasms and cramp pain for 24 hours! Upon return to the US, I found this was not available for some reason, though it's been on the market for 50 years and is OTC in dozens of countries, including Germany,slight difference in my cramps and doens't last very long - though it's better than nothing.However, you need a prescription for Bentyl, while you can buy Buscopan online without a prescription, and it works much better. WHen I was hospitalized in Germany, the hospital gave me a super-strength version only available by Rx, and it was immediate relief. It's sold overseas for menstrual cramps as well, and taken with Ibuprofin, I don't even know I have my period!If you're finding Bentyl doesn't work for you, or doesn't work well, go online and order a bottle of 10mg tabs OTC. No side effects, no addiction. Made in Germany and the UK, easy to swallow (size of lomotil).	F	38	3  days 2X D	2/13/2011
3	IBS	I have been taking Bentyl for some time now and i have mixed feelings about it. On one hand it does work great for the cramping and pain of IBS. The side effects (WOW) I have experienced the worst of them. Dizziness, Anxiety, Nervousness, dry mouth, Insomnia and Suicidal thoughts. I had to stop taking it because it has sent me into a mental tizzy. I now just take it on a "as needed" basis.	Like i said it works for the pain but the side effects (WOW) they can be a duzzy.	M	44	30  days10mg 4X D	2/8/2011
5	IBS /Colitis/Precancerous Polyps	No real negative side-effects at all. Did not cause any dizziness  or tiredness.  As a matter of fact the issue I did have was a bit of insomnia.	Works wonders. My stomach pain and cramping is completely gone. It is literally a wonder drug in that respect. And one thing I can say about this medication is it makes me feel much better all over - so maybe that is the "relaxation affect". This has been a miracle drug. I'm so happy with it!!	F	39	7  days10 3X D	1/29/2011Email
5	ibs or nerves	none, ever	never had a single issue or side effect. Always helps when my stomach is hurting from nerves or irratation. I was shocked to see anyone had any of the side affects I read on here. strange, it is a pretty mild drug.	F	53	10  years10 3X W	1/8/2011
1	IBS, suspected Colitus	Worst drug I have ever taken. Side effects so bad had to call in sick this morning. Debating if I should go to the ER. Careful taking this drug.		M	48	2  days10 mg 4X D	12/17/2010
5	IBS, Diverticulosis	Neurological side effects began within two doses:  disconnected, numbness in my hands, an overall sense of being 'mellowed out'.  By the 5th day, confusion set in, followed by a very frightening experience whereby I could not swallow.  Had to go do the ER for treatment to this adverse reaction.  Needless to say, I am no longer taking Bentyl.	Bentyl significantly reduced by severe IBS symptoms - within 1 dose.  I initially dealt with the side effects, despite the fact that they were very pronounced, because I was so thrilled to find a medication that worked.	F	42	5  days20 mg 4X D	12/10/2010
5	IBS	Just constipation, as expected.	My stomach has been hurting terribly for months and months.  What relief I've gotten finally from this medicine!  I'm thrilled!	F	47	45  days20 mg 2X D	12/7/2010Email
5	Stomach cramps from allergies	None	Absolute godsend. I'm usually very sensitive to side effects, and have lots of stomach issues on top of that. So to find something like bentyl that can stop stomach cramps so effectively without any downside? Wonderful! Not sure what I'd do without it.	F	26	2  years10 mg 1X AN	11/19/2010
4	IBS	Initiially extrememly satisfied w/ Bentyl and it helped my IBS a great deal. The initial side effects were slight drowsiness, dry mouth, and it also seemed to ease some anxiety issues which were derived from IBS since never being sure if you'll be able to make it to the restroom before dooking in your pants can be an anxiety inducing issue.However, last night had a most frightening experience w/ Bentyl from which I'm still recovering from as this is being written.Took my prescribed dosage at around 9 pm. By 10 pm my face was itchy and red and the whites of my eyes were completely bloodshot. I should have immediately called 911 but like a fool I didn't. From the there the problem progressed until it got to the point that it felt as if sand mixed w/ pepper sauce had been thrown into my eyes- they were impossible to keep open. Obviously it was impossible to sleep. By around 7 in the morning the itching and burning had subsided somewhat and managed to go to bed. Upon waking up arou	Do not be a fool like me. If you are having serious side effects call 911 immediately and get some treatment.	M	36	3  weeks10mg 4X D	10/5/2010
3	IBS	Confusion, difficulty talking (stuttering, not being able to form words properly), light-headedness, lethargy, increased heart rate, inability to focus or concentrate, dry mouth.		F	25	3  days20 MG 4X D	9/5/2010
5	IBS	I haven't noticed any, but I don't read the side effects of my meds until I have trouble with it. The people who read the side affects first seem to suffer more of them.	I am very greatful for this med. Before I had this I spent up to 4 hours rolling around the bathroom floor because of the sweating, cramps, and you know whats.	F	48	 20 mg 2X W	8/27/2010
2	ibs and urinary spasms	very spaced, inability to concentrate, difficulty urinating at times, diarrhea (which was one of the reasons I was taking it), difficulty talking, and a generally anxious mood.	I'm so spaced from this drug that I can't even understand the other comments or write my own very well, but I do agree with all the negative statements.  Started at 10 mg and moved to 20.  I am so frightened by this drug that I feel that I need to taper off rather than to stop abruptly, and maybe 10 mg will work for me without destroying my well-being.  It was OK at the beginning.  Would be interested in knowing if anyone else developed a tremendous appetite (coupled with fatigue which made it impossible to exercise).  Also, I would highly recommend that everyone take seriously the warning about staying out of the heat.	F	62	3  weeks10 mg 2X D	8/11/2010
4	IBS	Initial drowsiness passed on the second day of treatment.  After over a year and several dosage increases, I still have diarrhea upwards of 12 times a day.	Despite the side effects, I still take Bentyl as it greatly relieves the agonizing pain in my colon.  It has not limited my daily bowel movements, but it has not increased them either.  Before treatment with Bentyl, I would literally cry on the toilet.  It's not perfect, but I can't get by without it.	M	21	1.5  years40 mg 4X D	7/23/2010
5	suspected IBS	Sometimes I experience drowsiness but most of the time relief and a sense of being relaxed. I have panic attacks and have noticed since taking Bentyl these have lessened.	Bentyl is an Awesome medicine that I am so glad my Dr. prescribed, I now can eat most any food without fear of getting gas, cramps, bloating, pain or diarrhea..and if I do experience these symptoms they are much milder than going without Bentyl. I get out more, I don't worry about always being close to a bathroom!	F	34	2  years20 MG 4X D	7/1/2010
3	Crohn's/IBD	Eyes dilating, difficulty swallowing, feeling overheated, constipation, feeling "out of body"--like I had no substance and would just float away, confusion, forgetfulness, slurred speech, dizziness, pounding heart, killer headaches... pretty much every bad side effect	Generally I feel really stupid when I'm taking Bentyl and I hate hate hate taking it. The only thing is when I don't take it I have such terrible stomach pain and diarrhea that I can't go out in public. Darned if I do darned if I don't. I wish there was something else out there that did the trick without making me feel like I'm in some crazy fun-house bad dream. Also I get so tired when I take it that I'll fall asleep on the couch and my husband will make dinner, feed the kids, feed the dogs, do the dishes, and blast his music and I have no clue... I'm just gone. I just don't want to take it anymore but I'm waiting on another surgery and have to continue taking it in the meantime :(	F	26	9  months20 MG 4X D	6/26/2010Email
5	IBS	I have had NO major side effects to this stuff. NONE! It eases the cramps and discomfort from IBS. I have been miserable for 2 months and this stuff has done the trick. There might be the SLIGHTEST bit of drowziness but no more that what I normally feel as a 45 year old woman. You people are cry babies!	Dont let these comments scare you. Its worth a try if you are having severe stomach problems. I started with only taking one a day instead of three so I could test out side effects, then upped to 2 and 3 only as needed. Its common sense. I feel great!	F	45	5  days20mg 2X D	6/7/2010
1	IBS, IBD	Dizzyness, Drowsyness, A strange "microwaved" feeling (cold on the inside, hot on the outside) extrememly "high" feeling. Heart palpatations, Pounding in chest (felt my heart beating at my fingertips and in my head)	My docter prescribed it for the suspision of me having IBS. I dont think i have IBS, but i took the drug anyway. It made me feel terrible. I wasnt able to function. And the heart palpatations had me in the E.R. thinking i was having a heart attack. It seems to work for some people, but MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BEEN PROPERLY DIAGNOSED Before taking it because the side effects are terrible.	M	19	1  days20 mg 2X D	5/31/2010Email

4	Gerd	Mild side effects - Heart palpatations.	I take the medication as needed. I usually take it when I eat greasy or spicy foods. My wife has taken it for over 20 years and had never complained of and adverse side effects.	M	66	2  years	12/9/2009
4	IBS-A	Mild, if any (slight drowsiness and lightheadedness at times)	This drug has been such a comfort while living with IBS.  When an IBS attack strikes, the cramping and resultant nausea are quickly stopped.	F	32	1  years	10/9/2009
4	Gall bladder attacks		I take it when my gall bladder acts up. Works wonderful! Never had any side effects at all!	F	25	1  years	9/13/2009
5	Occasional IBS  - travel or stress	Possibly causing some numbness/tingling in arms and lightheadness.	Developed sudden terrible low cramps on a trip 4 years ago and intestinal system shut down for a week with continue pain.  Started happening again on every trip.  Doctor finally prescribed bentyl and it has been GREAT.  But I only take it when I am becoming very bloated, constipated or I am on a trip.  Usually I take 1 or 1/2 when I wake up in the middle of the night because it works better if you are relaxed.  LOVE IT, but I use on a very limited basis.	F	69	2  years	7/15/2009
5	Sweating	Dry mouth	I have been taking this medication for hyperhidrosis, and I immediately saw an improvement in how much I perspirate. I am no longer anxious or embarrassed that I will sweat through my clothing or look like I stepped out of the shower in public.	F	28	1  weeks	6/25/2009
1	IBS	Dizziness, nausea, panic attack, increased heart beat, mental changes, headaches, blurred vision.	The Bentyl definitely helped with the cramping problem after I ate, but on the third day of taking the 4 pills a day (1 every 6 hours as recommended by my doctor) I experienced some very scary side effects. I had what I would describe as a panic attack I guess. I haven't had one before, but I felt like I was going insane. I immediately stopped taking the pills and haven't had any of those side effects yet. I was at the severe end of the side effects sheet, but it was enough for me to quit taking it after the one episode. Personally I would rather deal with the IBS syptoms than the side effects I experienced from Bentyl. It seems that this drug works for a lot of people, but I would just caution you to be very careful taking it.	M	23	3  days	4/24/2009
4	Cramping/Spasming due to IBS	None so far.	This has been a lifesaver. IBS runs in my family and I just recently started to experience it. I can take this pill and not have to worry about picking what I eat based on how bad it will upset my stomach. I have had no side effects whatsoever and the relief it has provided has not only come quickly but actually lasts as well.	F	21	3  months	3/25/2009

I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email

Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify.

I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
