5	Schizophrenia/Psychosis	Some drooling	Finally, after testing various other medications such as, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Abilify, and and Risperdal. All of these medications didn't help me stop hallucinating(audial). Clozaril, after about a week I was fine and living a normal life again. It's a hassle having to do all the bloodworks, but for me this has been a miracle drug. So it made the bloodworks worth it. After 1 year it is only required once a month(the blood tests). I am free of hallucinations and more focused then any of the other meds I was taking. I give this medication a 5.	M	29	1  years225 MG 2X D	3/19/2013Email
1	Paranoia	Clozaril was taken off the market in the 1960's as a result of deaths from Agranulocytosis. Now patients are tested for this. Plus have to have an ECG at least every 6 months.		M	19	10  months300	12/20/2012
1	Schizophrenia	Drooling, droolingThis is more sedating than seroquel. Clozaril is the most sedating antipsychotic.Clozaril has the more weight gain than zyprexa.	Like the comments before: UR bed when u wake up in the morning will be full of saliva. Yuck! The only way to stop salivating is to tell ur doc to take u off it.I can't get off this stuff keep relapsing and guess what? Doctors put me straight back on it again. My life is a misery and zyprexa actually worked better for me.	M		2  years600 1X D	11/8/2012
2	Schizophrenia	Drooling, knocked out straight after taking it	This is meant to be the 'Gold standard' the 'Best' antipsychotic. Did NOT do much for me. PLZ remember everyone responds differently to medication. The thing doctors rarely mention is that Clozaril is one of the hardest drugs to discontinue if you don't like the side effects. It can cause 'rebound psychoses' at its worst. Basically your psychoses can sky rocket off the universe by trying to get off this medication even if your doctor takes you off it slowly. Once on Clozapine you might be on it for the rest of your life coz of what is mentioned above. This can be a miracle drug for some people but for me my paranoia and hallucinations were NOT stopped and were actually worse. I hated the drooling which as far as I know can NOT be stopped by anything. Missing more than 2 doses in a row can make you have a relapse which happened to me. On the up side. This is the only antipsychotic that does NOT cause TD(tardive dyskinesia). If your doing fine on something else don't bother changing hoping for a cure coz at the moment there is NONE.

5	Schizophrenia	Extreme sedation, lethargy in the morning, excessive salivating, desire to eat sweets that is impossible to resist, heart races, panic attacks	Yes, there are a lot of terrible side effects. Yes, the blood draws are an inconvenience.But clozapine has controlled my schizophrenia better than any med I've been on before (been on lots of antipsychotics)	F	19	1.5  years200 mg 1X D	4/11/2012
1	Light schizophrenia	My son took it for 6 years and his worse of now-totally a vegatable.dont take this drug,its DANGEROUS!		M	19	1  days400mg	4/3/2012Email
1	sluggish schizophrenia		THIS IS DEADLY KILLER DRUG. THIS IS SIMPLY USED TO KILL IN MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTIONS. IT JUST KILLS YOU. PERIOD. Outside (prison) hospitals this drug is almost never used because it is simply a KILLER drug. It is 100% unethical to use this drug. YOU DIE.	M	30	1  days 1X D	10/10/2011
5	Schizoaffective/Schizophrenia	Drooling at night and Drowsiness and increased appetite	Clozaril has made me normal. I have no more symptoms of schizophrenia. I am very happy that I was put on this medication and I plan to stay on it. It is worth the trouble of the weekly blood draws.	F	23	6  weeks200 mg 1X D	3/23/2011Email
1	depression/bipolar II	Extremely sedating--I slept 12-14 hours out of every 24. Increased appetite. I lost my personality and became like a zombie.	I did not realize what clozaril was doing to me until I stopped taking it and the sedation wore off. Then I could see that the two years I spent on clozaril were two years that I spent as a zombie laying on the couch. I wish I had not taken this drug.	F	41	2  years200mg 1X D	6/10/2010
1	self-injury, bpd	drooling, EXTREME weight gain (in institution and not eating much too), drowsiness, not remembering events, bed-wetting, 100% zoned out, taken off because my white blood cell count dropped	this is the most EVIL med I have ever taken.  My doc wanted to put me back on it saying that, "my white blood cell count didn't drop too far" last time I was on it.  Doctors are currently in love with this med, it works for some, but event they have quite bad side effects from what I know.	F	25	4  months	1/11/2010
5	Schizophrenia	Drooling, Sedation, Seizures	I have to take a seizure medication with Clozaril because my seizure threshold is low.  Actually, if I take any antipsychotic I have to take an anticonvulsant, so it's not just Clozaril, it's just that I have to take a higher dose on Clozaril.  Ah, for the drooling, you can take (sublingually) the eye drops that they give you at the eye doctor to dilate your pupils.  It stops the drooling.  I take a couple drops under each side of my tongue before bed and I don't drool at night...nice.  My doctor taught me that one.  When I went to fill my prescription for the eye drops, I had to explain it to the pharmacist...lol.  I don't get too much sedation, I mostly sleep it off, as I take the med at night.  I've tried all the meds and this is the best one.  It even helps the negative symptoms, which are mostly what remained for me with the other meds.  I had a lot of problem with "connecting" to people, which affected my ability to form relationships with people and my interactions with people.  Clozaril helps a lot with that so I can relate to other people and "connect."  It is hard to explain, but it definitely helps me feel human.  For me this has been a great medication.

1	bipolar	gross medicine	doctors say this medicine is the best, thats a big lie and rumor.  This antipsychotic did nothing for me.  Most patients grow out of there bipolar or schizophrenia by the time they turn 30 years old anyway.	M	29	2  years	10/9/2009
1	SCHIZOPHRENIA	This drug is the worst just terrible.	Impossible to take side effects are deadly.	M	29	3  months	7/30/2009

5	schizophrenia	The First year or so, alot of drooling, very tired. Major weigt gain. Id rather be ovedrweight than psychotic.	great efffects though from the voices. Been on it since 1992. Been on them all. This is the best. No more voices.	M	44	16  years	12/17/2008Email
5	bipolar depression	super-intense weight gain via surge in appetite 45 mins-1hr later,bed wetting,extremely sedating,and drooling	The ONLY reason I gave this med a 5 is because it is the only med in the universe that will put me to sleep.NOTHING else works.I  do hate this drug for the side effects,especially the bedwetting and drooling.But what can I do?I need it for survival. The mandatory bloodwork is a major inconveinence and pain in the rump.The 2 good things about it are:no sexual side effects,and good for anxiety.	M		12  years	12/13/2008
5	Schizoaffective disorder	weight gain, night sweating	LOVE this drug. It made me normal, for the first time. I can do housework, I can work, I have a happy relationship with my family.	F	30	9  months	7/23/2007

Currently on 75mg p/d.	M	32	2  years	4/3/2007
