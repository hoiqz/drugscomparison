2	Depression	I was never disappointed in the drug until I stopped taking it.  It has some severe withdrawal symptoms.  I stopped taking it because my GP more or less told me to; some recent blood tests indicated my liver was under strain and he thinks remeron is the likely culprit.  I do not drink or take other drugs, so I think he is likely right.  Anyhow, since I stopped taking it, I only sleep one REM cycle and then wake up wired at 3-4 in the morning.  It's making for some pretty weird days.  I also have a constant headache.  The withdrawal symptons only strengthen my resolve to stop taking it.  I don't think I am actually depressed or in danger of reverting to some unstable state.  I was teenager that was getting into trouble when I started taking it.  I was an unstable teenage, but 15 years later I'm a pretty stable person, I don't think I need this medication and am sorry I took it for so long, but quitting it is going to be much harder than I thought.  People need their sleep.		M	34	15  years7.5 1X D	3/9/2012Email
1	Depression/anxiety	Not 100% sure how long i was taking it, meds have ruined my memory a bit.  Vivid/erradic/relistic dreams, stopped taking it a year or so ago (i think) and still have the problem. Makes waking up incredibly hard, as if it's hard to adjust to this reality after spending so much time in another, wake up with unclear mind, no concentration etc	I can't make a judgment if you should take it, but i will say i deeply regret ever having touched this medicine, ruined my life ever since taking it	M	23	2  months15mg(1tab) 1X D	12/22/2011Email

5	anxiety with depression	restless legs, hunger, sleepy	Remeron is the closest thing to a wonder drug that we have. I have tried just about everything out there. I have fired 2 pdocs. A kind GP finally prescribed Remeron. I will never quit taking Remeron ever.	M	29	1  years30 mg 1X D	9/27/2010

5	anxious depression	sleepiness at first, which lessened then some weight gain later	I gained more weight on Paxil than Remeron.	M	40	3  years30 mg 1X D	9/2/2010
5	Depression, anxiety, insomnia	not just restless legs -I called it "restless body" Cannot take the medicine at bedtime as directed. Although I do feel very sleepy after taking it, I cannot rest because of the irresitble muscle urges in my abdomninal muscles and legs. Makes me quite sleepy for about 1 hour after taking. Increased appetite- have gained about 10 pounds in 3 months.	I was prescribed this drug after a period of suicidal ideation (probably from high dose of Neurontin, which I started taking for pain.) It took a while for remeron to kick in with me but I feel almost back to my normal self. i still do experience pain, but it is not as intense and I don't "care about it" or obsess on it the way I did before. So remeron has helped me cut back on my pain medication significantly. I also do not need any sleeping aide or tranquilizer any more. I am very satisfied with Remeron. I take one in the morning (which my doc thinks is weird) and one while I'm fixing dinner. cannot take at bedtime due to the AWFUL restless "everything" it gives me.
