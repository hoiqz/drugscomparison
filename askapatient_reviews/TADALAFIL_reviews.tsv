4	Maintaining a firmer long erection	I can't imagine going through some of the horrible side effect others are experiencing. As for myself, I get the nasal stuffiness once in awhile and the occasional headache. Just recently though,(the last time I took a 20mg 5days ago) I got an annoying headache above my right eye that lasted for 5 days. Today is the first day without it. Other than that, it works great! My girlfriend is 16yrs younger than me and she's very happy with the results. We have sex 5-7 times in a 4-5 day period from one dose.		M	44	10  months20mg	7/7/2013
1	Create more blood flow.	Intense back pain, hamstrings and cramping glutes.  I have only tried This med 2 other times works great I am very large so it's difficult to get completely hard. Never again will I take this garbage.			43	2  days20mg x 3	6/27/2013
2	E.D	I am or was taking the 5mg daily dose and on the last evening i took it i developed a Major MIGRAINE about 4 hrs after taking it and am  Just now coming out of it after 2+ days. Also severe back ache and leg/foot cramps and an all around crappy sickly feeling. Nausea and vomiting as well. I've taken the Daily 5mg pill for approximately 2 months now and this is the first time I've had this issue. IT I THE WORST I'VE EVER FELT ALMOST LIKE THE FLU. ALMOST.		M	42	2  months5 mg Daily	6/18/2013Email
4	Confidence. New relationship.	Excrutiating pain that started in the chest and over a period of two days worked its way down to lower back, buttocks, hamstring, calfs then out of body completely. Have not taken cialis since.  Note: Since then have  taken something else when needed but only take one fifth of a tablet. Still get a mild pain in right leg though.		M	58	1  daysminimum	6/17/2013Email
5	ED	After 24 hrs debilitating, extreme lower back pain. Lasts about a week. Have been using Cialis for several years. Foolishly, forget the paralyzing back pain and keep taking it again.	Although it works great, have come to realize after this last back breaking episode (I cannot even stand up straight--3 days and counting) it is NOT worth it.	M	65	3  days5-10mg 1X W	6/14/2013Email
1	ED	Taking Cialis was a HUGE mistake.  Really bad headaches and sleeping problems the first 36  hours.   For 2 days following, had terrible  headaches, stomach aches,  severe fever and  back pain.    I've been miserable since I  took it,  never again -  threw  remaining pills in the garbage.  This product should be taken off the market!		M	46	1  times20mg	5/21/2013
5	Other meds made me need it	Seeing a haze after sex		M	38	1  days5mg	5/3/2013Email
4	ED due to diabetes	When I first started this medication, I had quite a bit of nasal congestion but that seemed to subside over time. I had no other ill effects until after about a year, when I had blurry vision on occasion. I reduced the dosage to 10 mg and had no problems. Within the past year the effects don't last a full 36 hours and my erection is not as strong.	If you are considering Cialis, please carefully follow the dosage instructions given by your doctor. Do NOT double your dosage without speaking to the doctor. This is not like an aspirin or Tylenol. More isn't better unless the doctor says it is safe and may help. Also, be VERY careful about ordering Cialis from online pharmacies. Many are scams.	M	58	3  years20 1X AN	5/3/2013
4	ED	I went thru facial flushing, nasal congestion and the right leg pain, I don't know why but the 5mg daily pill gave me headaches and the leg pains.What i did was to break in 3 pieces the 20mg pill which elimintaed the leg pains, still get some facial flushness but the erections are as hard as when i took the 5mg daily or the 20mg. i recommend smaller doses of the 20mg. And for the leg pains advil or tylenol will help.		M	45	4  years20mg 1X AN	4/30/2013Email
2	ED	Massive headache and thigh pain.	Worked great for what it was designed to do.  But I got a huge headache about 18 hours taking the drug and incredible thigh pain after 48 hours.  Side effects are too intense to bear.	M	38	1  days20mg 1X D	4/30/2013Email
1	To shrink prostate and for ED	Severe aches in lower back and hamstrings that prevented me from sleeping.	The manufacturer says the aches go away in a couple of days. What they don't tell you is that they are referring to people who take single doses for ED. Those who take it daily for both ED and BPH will be in constant pain. The manufacturer also claims that only 3% experience such pain. But if you peruse the internet forums on the subject, it seems that at least 70% experience it.	M	61	7  days5mg 1X D	4/23/2013
1	Erectile dysfunction	Bad leg pain, bad lower back pain, wife said eyes are red , works for ed not worth the pain it causes to the body.		M	40	3  days25	4/22/2013
5	blood pressure medication	Extreme leg cramps, calfs, knees, sometime thighs and even feet.  They don't happen at same time or not each time.  The wierd thing is that it affect my right side 90% of time. The cramps alway happen in bed after sex, but has also happend during.  Rarely, I've had to stop in the act and walk it off--a big mood killer  Yes I get the dizzyness, eyes red, flushing within 2 hours and even later after 6+ hrs I seem to freeze/chill easy at times, cold enough to shiver. The cramps are the worst side effect for me, I have found heat helps releave the cramps.	Much better than Viagra, I couldn't take the side effects.  20MG Last three days.  After reading the other posts on this website, I will now cut them in half and may decide to take at bedtime to avoid most of these side effects.  I Hate the side effects but love the results.	M	61	2  years 1X AN	4/14/2013
1	Ed/lack of arousal from lexapro	Initially started feeling pain right thigh after 1 dose, 5mg.  Now 2nd day, awake 4:30am, excruciating lower back pain, also in thighs, calves, buttocks, feels like cramping.  Awful, cannot sleep.  Thanks for this forum, thought I was going crazy.  Just took 200mg ibuprofen, hoping it helps.	Sounds like the "magic pill"...?  Maybe for some, but not worth the minor benefits for me. And, orgasm was entirely less fulfilling. No thanks. Gonna try the progressive labs herbal stuff, worked in the past.	M	51	2  times5g 1X D	4/9/2013
5	ED related to low Testosterone	Minimal side effects.  Some aches, and minor headache the next day -- but worth it.	Started taking it 2 days ago, 5MG per day.  Had morning wood for the first time in months after the 1st night.  Satisfying erection on the 2nd night, and easily aroused by the wife.  Need to experiment with dosing, because I don't believe I will need to take it everyday based on what some have some here.  Plan to use maybe 10MG on a Friday before a weekend, and believe it should last a few days.  Wish there was a generic, because this stuff is not cheap!	M	37	2  days5 MG 1X D	4/1/2013
1	pulmonary hypertension	headache,face flushed, neck swollen,cough, bad indigestion, leg pain soreness 2nd day. alot worse 3rd with thigh & back pain. woke up midnite wasn't sure if needed to call paramedics so much indigestion. didn't take it 4th day & back in bed leg, back & thigh pain. Wish i'd seen these comments before trying. Dr said some patients having bettr breathing on it.	Was approved for pulmonary hypertension. some +of these side effects can be permanent so wouldn't advise any1 to take it!! Take hemp oil if u hav a ED problem!	M	62	3  days5mg 1X D	3/30/2013Email
2	ED	Heartburn, tightness in chest, headaches, low back pain. The pain started about 24hrs after taking my first dose. The side effects have been horrible.  The headaches, heartburn, tightness in chest but worst of all the pain in the lower back.  keeping me up at night and making me very sore all over, similar to bad flu.	I had little explanation on what to expect.  I took 1/2 of 20 mg and didnt feel anything. I took the other 1/2 2hrs later and for the next 24hrs had great erections with no side effects.  I then took another 20 mg (whole pill) 24hrs later and the side effects have been horrible.  The headaches, heartburn, tightness in chest but worst of all the pain in the lower back.  Keeping me up at night and very sore all over. The erections were great but not worth the side effects.	M	54	4  days20 1X W	3/24/2013
4	ED	Lower back pain started very bad after taking Cialis every other day for over 4 years.  The first day it happened I could barely stand up in getting out of bed.  No side effects that I was aware of before then.  I've had the back pain now for over 4 months and continue to take Cialis.  The back pain in worst when I first get up and I can hardly bend over to tie my shoes.  The pain is only there when I try and straighten up at first.  It goes away in about 10 minutes, but is there very day.	It worked very well at first every time for the full 36 hrs and sometimes longer.  I took Viagra before that, but it doesn't last long enough and you can't always count on having sex during the 4 hour time it lasts.  With 36 hours there is more opportunity.  After taking Cialis for almost 5 years every other day it doesn't last as long as before.  It would easily work any time during the 36 hours and longer.  I only take it every days ( 48 hours ) at the same time.  It usually has full effect within two hours after taking.  In order to eliminate the back pain I may go back on Viagra or experiment with reduced dosage to see what happens.	M	64	2  days20 MG 1X O	3/18/2013Email
4	erectile disfuntion	severe hip pain debilitating in fact going to have xray in case a fracture .	it helped with erection but pain isn't worth it anymore i mean i love sex but if the pain im having if from the cealis its a tough call.	M	45	 half of 5m 1X AN	3/14/2013Email
3	ED	Worked great at first, but then excruciating back and thigh pains started. Second day of pains now, no sign of improvement. Can't find any comfort sitting, standing, lying down, anywhere.	I don't know what to say. As long as there were no side effects it was great, I really felt confident that I could have intercourse without "failing". Now I'm afraid to take it again as I'm on my second night without sleep and my second day without work. Such a pity. If I knew that it would last a couple of days then disappear even continuing to take it, I'd last out the pain, but who's to say?	M	48	3  days5 1X D	3/5/2013Email
2	mild ED	Two days after taking I developed intense lower back pain and tightness in my legs. Still experiencing this on day 4. Also blocked nose and headache lasting for days.	This drug did work for me in terms of ED, even on day 3 after a single 20mg dose. But side effects are too intense to justify continued use.	M	40	1  days20 1X D	1/18/2013
1	ED	Extreme lower back and leg pain.	I started taking 5mg on Sat.morning and was in the ER on a Morphine drip on Wed. due to the horrible lower back and even worse leg pain.I have been off the pill since Tues.morning and the symptoms are slowly going away.Its to bad too because the product worked instantly for me.Great erections.Going to see my Doc today to see what else we can do.Cialis is NOT worth the side effects.	M	43	4  days5 1X D	1/3/2013Email
5	better/faster erections	some facial flushing and nasal congestion.  Allegra fixed the congestion. Occasional minor headache easily treated with ibuprofen.	This stuff works great! I am a healthy 56 year old male that usually has sex 3-4 times per week.  I tried this as at my age it takes longer to achieve an erection and the recovery period is longer as well. Usually within a couple of hours of taking dose I get vein bulging, super hard erections. Wake up with really hard morning wood for at least the next few days often in the night as well.  Tend to take it on Friday around 4:00 p.m. and have had sex with my wife as many as 5 times over the weekend but usually around 3 times as she gets tired and sore. Works again like in my 20's as all I have to do is think about sex and it's up.	M	56	2  years10mg 1X W	12/28/2012Email
3	Maintaing erection	About 1 hr after dose, minor face flushing, sensation of nasal sinus congestion, but not detracting.  Minor tingling in lips.  Later on 2nd day, significant back ache, started in lower back, by late afternoon 2nd day (about 18 hrs after single dose), entire back in pain, like I had thrown my back out after WAY over exerting myself (I'm in very good shape).  Tylenol took care of pain.  Back pain was better 3rd day, but then returned during afternoon 3rd day, pretty debilitating if you had planned on doing ANYTHING for several days after that only dose.  Back pain kept me on the couch for 2 days (and counting) after that single dose.  Hard to think about taking it again, maybe a much lesser dose?	Great erections a few hours after the initial dose, nice plump feeling all the next day with instant erections when wanted, maintaining erections as long as I wanted it.  Nice wood greeting the morning of 2nd day after dose.	M	59	1  days20mg 1X AN	12/3/2012
1	ED	Flu-like symptoms, headache, facial flushing, indigestion, overall miserable feeling. Erections were not as stong as with other ED medicines, not as rapid to get either. Overall weak effect with numerous negative side-effects.	Levitra & Viagra work FAR better than this, with shortened side-effect duration.	M	43	1  days15 MG 1X D	11/28/2012

3	ED	Headache, Anxiety, Pain in upper legs and feet	Gave me an excellent erection. Effects never lasted anywhere near 36 hours, but nasty sides lasted the next day and part of day after.	M	31	1  weeks20 mg 1X AN	10/17/2012
1	Sexual enhancement	I took cialis once with zero side effects and very pleased for the next 3 days. Took cialis again the following week and all possible side effects were present and the severity of which took me by surprise. Bloodshot eyes, stuffy nose and flush feeling were the first present. On second day flu like symptoms kept me awake for the night (odd feeling like I felt as though I were dying) third day had severe back pain and powerful headache, ibuprofen didn't work well. Fourth day, headache weakened but still very present. Fifth day is looking a lot like say four. Had to miss work from the pain and completely thrown off schedule. The intense side effects countered sexual benefit.		M	42	2  days20mg	10/10/2012
5	MaintAining erection	Indigestion	Works really well	M	75	3  months5 1X D	9/23/2012Email
3	ed	This drug works but for me the negatives outweigh the positives. I almost always experience severe back pain and indigestion a day or two after taking. My thoughts are try some natural alternatives and make some lifestyle changes - you might be surprised. If that doesn't work then give calls try in small doses.		M	43	1  years10mg	8/26/2012
1	ED	24 hours later terrific (sleep preventing) pain in  lower back, thighs and calves, cramping, blurred vision and headache with almost flu-like symptoms and tinnitus as well! Sickest I have felt in years and 5 days later still much the same. Will never ever do that again (and it did little for the ED either!)	Arghhh.. If you ever wish to experience 4 days with little opr no sleep and a pain as if your bones are disintegrating try Cialis!	M	62	1  days20mg 1X D	8/26/2012Email
1	stronger erections	terrible leg aching--feel like my legs are very heavy...bad muscle fatigue all over body..feel like I been in bad car wreck...get headaches sometimes as well.

5	ed and bhp	none	This is fantastic makes you feel like you are 30 years old, and works better for enlarged prostrate than terasosin.	M	63	120  days10 1X D	8/9/2012
4	mild ed due to oversex	almost none. not sure heart rate of 50 is related since I swim and Zuba regularly	Had submitted a review in 2007. Cialis still works most the time but have to increase dose to 1/2 of 20mg. Same girl friend, have sex 3 times/week, reduced from 7 to 10/week when last review. Not bad for 62 yrs man.	M	62	4  years1/2 of 20 2X W	7/24/2012
5	ED	Mild transient headache and moderate heartburn	Cialis worked great!  Took the first dose and an hour later got a firm and lasting erection.  Made love to my wife like never before.  Did cause delayed ejaculation, but my wife did not complain.  Headache and heartburn improved after about 5 days of use.  Definitely recommend.	M	50	7  days5mg 1X D	7/13/2012
3	ED	My blood pressure is 120\80, my percentage of body fat is 20.9% I am in great shape and workout 5 days a week, I took one pill of 20mg and gave me severe pain in my thighs and buttocks that lasted 9 weeks, I strongly recommend not to workout legs if you take cialis instead do legs stretch twice a day, otherwise you might have an injury call pyriform syndrome.		M	53	1  days20mg	6/20/2012Email
5	Regular	If I take it for 7 or 8 days, I get pain in my lower back and upper legs.  I have to get off of it for a couple days.	The thing about Cialis is dosage, dosage, dosage.  It can be a terrible and painful drug if you take too much.  20 mg would give me severe pain for days!  I have experimented and found that 1/8 of a 20 mg pill taken daily works just fine.  I have to use my very fine precision saw (x-acto) to cut the pill into approx 1/8 sizes.  Tedious, but it also saves me money.  Cialis blows away Viagra since it is more focused/directed in its desired effects and the side effects are much more tolerable (at least in my case).	M	57	1  months2.5 mg 1X D	6/14/2012Email
3	For Harder Erections	Severe pain in my lower back, butt, and upper rear thighs.	The pain is so bad, I have trouble sleeping. Taking Tylenol alleviates the pain after about 30 minutes, and lasts about 6 hours. It is much easier to obtain and maintain an erection, and my erection is much harder, which is my reason for taking it in the first place. I will probably only take it as necessary as opposed to the daily dose, and will take with pain killer if at all.	M	47	7  days5mg 1X D	5/22/2012Email
3	BPH	knees and hips ache.  I thought at first because I was painting interior rooms of house and climbing up and down ladder.  Also been experiencing heartburn even though I take a heartburn medicine daily	Hopefully these side effects will diminish.  The positive side is pretty nice.	M	63	5  days5MG 1X D	5/21/2012
1	erectile dysfunction	Severe back and hip pain unable to sleep because of pain. Subsided and then reoccurred.	Don't take this stuff!	M	64	1  days15 1X D	5/19/2012
5	To maintain sustained erections.	Some 12 hours after taking Cialis, I first felt pain as I was trying to fall asleep. It was a sharp stabbing pain in my right thigh. I put a heating pad on it which caused the stabbing sensation to go away. The next morning that thigh felt sore when I pressed on it, but it didn't really bother me. A week later when I used 20 mg again there were NO side effects.	Without Cialis I can only maintain an erection for 10 minutes. With it, I can have intercourse as long as I want, 30 minutes easy. It makes me feel in control. I took the Cialis three hours before sex. Two hours after taking it I was walking around with my girlfriend and noticed that my penis was secreting precoital lubricating fluid, something it had not done in quite a few years. Also, up to 48 hours afterwards I experienced spontaneous arousals.	M	70	2  weeks20 mg 1X AN	5/14/2012EmailHistory
3	ED	I have had no side affects of any kind,took one 10mg. 4 hours prior to having sex with my girlfriend,couldn't get an errection,it was like I had taken nothing!	Would I be ok to try and take 2 10mg.of Cialis to see if that makes a difference?	M	69	2  days10 mg. 1X D	5/12/2012Email
5	ED	None at all.	Unbelievable med. It was my first time taking a drug like this. It sure corrected my ED problem. Take it every morning and my center member comes to attention whenever I want it to. The wife isn't really used to the new sexy me. LOL. I would recommend this med on a daily basis to every guy with this problem. Also it gave me back my self confidence.	M	63	14  days5MG 1X D	5/5/2012
4	E.D.	I tried a larger dose at first (half of a 20 mg), which gave me acid stomach pain, leg cramps and backache.  On the smaller dose, I have no real side effects..yet.	The lower dose is perhaps not as effective, but it works well enough for me. If you are having bad side effects, try a lower daily dose....it also helps keep the blood pressure down somewhat too.	M	57	2  weeks2.5 1X D	5/3/2012Email
4	ED	Throbbing in the muscle of my lower right leg.  I have isolated it to Cialis, but I don't understand why just one muscle.  The hips are legs are stiff after sitting a little while.  51 years old.  I don't wanna give this up.  I take it for masturbation.		M	52	21  days5 MG 1X D	4/17/2012
1	ED	next day after - headaches, mostly mitigated by Advil.  At 48 hour mark - thigh pain, very painful, lasted 3 days.  pain spread to calves as well.  No back pain fortunately.	It worked but, for me it was not worth the side effects.  I work out regularly and was able to quickly isolate this pain as being due to Cialis.  Advil helps but not completely.  I will be looking for natural solutions rather than messing up my body with this stuff.	M	38	1  times20mg 1X AN	4/15/2012
1	ED	Delighted this site exists, Terrible muscle pains now 48 hours later. Brain seems fried. unable to sleep with the pain.	Certainly works but not worth the side effects.  Would advise starting with 5mg if at all. I certainly won't rust to use this again..		61	 20MG 1X D	4/9/2012
5	Sudden emergence of ED	Nothing, nada, niente, zero.	Take 10 mg every 2-3 days. Service my 46 yr wife to her full satisfaction every 3-4 days, and keep my 34 yr mia noi pleasantly impressed whenever we meet (about once a week). Works more reliably than the "original recipe" used to 20 years back, although still miss a beat here and there when too much work stress. Am in an excellent physical shape, which helps the performance and keeps any side effects out of my happiness. Swim 1 km at least 2 times a week, then do 2 series of 40 push-ups and sit-ups without skipping a beat. Take a lot of anti-aging supplements though, and steer clear of alcohol or anything stupid.	M	65	3  months10 10X M	3/31/2012
4	erection insurance	Lower back and hip pain. Slightly blurred vision.	5-10mg helps me get and maintain very hard erections. Also slightly reduced penile sensitivity which helps me build to a better orgasm and heavy ejaculation. I've figured out though, that the back pain that comes a day or so after taking isn't just from thrusting and so forth during sex. I've taken Cialis enough times in anticipation of intercourse and then not had sex to suspect the back pain is from the drug, since there's no way I strained by back. Comments and questions welcome.	M	59	3  years10 1X AN	3/31/2012Email
1	my boyfriend takes it	I experience horrible side-effects after having sex with my boyfriend. The same as men taking it experience. Debilitating headaches and muscle aches. The awful side effects are almost total body resembling the the flu. I wonder if other women experienced this. It sounds crazy but I know it is the cialis. It must be pretty toxic to affect the partner too.		F	52	6  years10MG	3/31/2012Email
1	After radical prostatectomy	Severe back pain in lumbar region and some cramping in buttocks and thighs. Also some "acid reflux" and difficulty swallowing on 6 th day.	Symptoms appeared after second dose, and got worse after third dose. I tried splitting a 20 mg pill and taking a half dose and the back pain returned within an hour.  The pain is terrible when laying down. Taking two 200 mg Advil provided relief within an hour.  My doctor is moving me to Viagra.	M	64	1  weeks20 mg 3X W	3/29/2012
5	short-lived erections	Mild, recurring acid reflux, occasional mild headache and chest tightness each time after taking a dose, and occasional reduced penile sensitivity when erect. Side effects reduced with use and reduced dosage.	Since most of the reports here are quite frightening I need to remind anyone considering Cialis that millions of men around the world take it and most have zero or only mild side-effects. My doctor prescribed 20mg and told me to go home and masturbate to see how many orgasms I could have repeatedly, advice which I found odd but fun. The 20mg turned out to be too strong as I experienced unpleasant side effects, especially rapid heartbeat, reflux, and chest tightness. I reduced the dose to 10mg twice a week and the side effects lessened considerably, and now I take only 10mg per week. Super erections and orgasms the first few days but by day 6 the erections don't last as long as I'd like.  I don't want to discount the leg and back agony some men have reported, but I do wonder how much of that pain had to do with Cialis and how much of the pain was a result of suddenly going from little sex to active sex. Intercourse is major exercise, especially if you are overweight, and can seriously strain a back and legs that are not strong and accustomed to it. My advice is to start having sex with your partner on top for a few weeks and go easy with the missionary and doggy positions until you build up your strength, and join a yoga class until you are in shape. Plus, if you have existing eye issues, migraines or back issues proceed with extreme caution and work with your doctor.	M	60	2  years10 2X W	3/25/2012
5	Firmer erections, younger partner	Have always had a little congestion, facial flushing, eyes a bit bloodshot, and minor headache within about 30 minutes and lasting a few hours, maybe overnight; all worth it for the benefits.  Quick eye drops, nasal spray, and ibuprofen are an easy fix. Over the last year I do notice that I tend to have more noticeable lower back/back of thigh aches, and I think at times some neck aching, that come on about a day or two after taking it, and last two to three days,  Still accepting the trade-off, a little exercise, stretching, and ibu or tylenol help well enough.  Acid reflux...maybe, hard to tell, eating the right things and not a ton of alcohol helps anyway with that, perhaps the cialis makes me more prone to it but not an automatic problem in any way.	Pretty difficult to criticize the side effects that I get personally in light of the super hard, vein bulging erections...one 20 mg on a Friday at 4 pm, and I am good for three rounds through a Sunday "wake-up call" every weekend.  My partner is 12 years younger, and always up for the game, so being there with the real goods matters; she knows from conversations with all of her friends that she's getting more wood at home than any of them, honestly, and tells me so.	M	55	5  years20 mg 1X W	3/1/2012
1	Want to maintain erection longer	The drug definitely worked for me. That said, the side effects are brutal. I had dizziness, chapped lips, flushing, blurry vision and an overall feeling of malaise. Does anone have any suggestions as to what might reduce these horrible side effects?		M	52	1  days20	2/20/2012
5	More consistent erections	Have taken every day for up to 2 weeks. After several days I sometimes get a slight headache and muscle aches in legs - when those appear I stop taking it.	Effects last for days after stopping taking - works extremely well, natural -	M	57	3  years20 mg 1X D	2/18/2012
5	ED	None	I read through some of the awful side effects experienced by some Cialis users on this site and it made we worried about starting off with this medication.  Eventually I started off with 5 mg.  The next morning there were no effects, positive or negative.  To be on the safe side I did not take any more that day.  Then I took 5 mg the following day (day 3) and the morning after this I had a great erection.  I followed the same pattern with holding off for a day and then taking 5 mg the next day.  The results have been great erection-wise (the morning after taking it) with no side effects so far.  Once I've tried taking 5 mg two days in a row and with no side effects.I've read quite a bit about people popping larger doses the first time they tried this.  To my mind this is a mistake.  Take it very slow to begin with and if you tolerate it over a period of time then increase the dosage slightly.My doctor gave me little guidance except for not going about 20 mg.  My feeling is that the users of this drug are not getting enough guidance.	M	49	20  days5 1X D	2/17/2012
5	injury leading to weak erections	No negative side effects, other than an enhancement of existing pain during erection.	It hasn't made me 18, but it has made me 30. Very hard erections, but no size difference. Very quick to get an erection, also. I need almost no stimulation. When it's out of my system, it's gone. I may have some increased hardness a few day later, but that's about it.	M	45	3  weeks10 1X W	2/17/2012
5	occasional ED	Occasional stuffy nose, occasional acid reflux, wake up frequently with extreme hard on.	Works great for me I've taken for over 3 years. I found I really need to take only 1/3 of 20 mg. Usually take on Friday and good to go whenever necessary but usually only 2-3 times per weekend. I also will wake up with wood almost every day now. It wears my wife out so I have to pace my self. Oddly enough she doesn't know I take Cialis. She thinks I'm Dr. Studley on my own. What she doesn't know sure won't hurt her.

1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.	F	52	8  years20 MG 1X D	1/13/2012Email
2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011

3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.	F	36	7  days2 MG 1X D	7/15/2010Email
2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.

5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010

3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped. Abilify worked immediately and I haven't been depressed since.	F	24	3  weeks5mg 1X D	5/9/2010Email

Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal. I belive my GAD is finally diminishing - regular therpay is helping me too.  I have had my condition for 6 yrs and 6 months now.	M	45	2.5  weeks2 mg 1X D	4/19/2010

1	Bipolar spectrum disorder	Restlessness, anxiety, drowsiness, face rash	I went on Abilify at the start of an up period, so I don't know how effective it would have been in treating depressive spells. However, it did counteract some of the effectiveness of my lithium, and I was falling asleep during the day more frequently than usual. Had to go off it because of a rash on my chin/cheeks/ears.

This time  was very reluctant (2 yrs later & different Dr. & different anti-depressant medication-Prozack-2 yrs ago) but I am trying it w/ a different antidepressant than previously-Taking now w/ Wellbutrin.

4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue. Negative - I find myself much more emotional - memories, key phrases, smells, songs, pictures, etc.can bring me to tears.	M	50	9  months50 MG 1X D	4/11/2010
2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now.

2	depression	Nausea the first few days, some constipation, cloudy thinking, increased appetite	Combined with Wellbutrin XL which suddenly stopped working for me after 3 years. After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

Yesterday Got upped to 5mg, felt like a ton of bricks at first... seems to be subsiding now, feeling better... will keep you posted	M	52	14  days5 mg 1X D	2/5/2010Email
3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!

2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010
4	ocd, agitation, schizotypal	drowsiness at high dosage, jittery at low. however, sometimes i feel my legs very heavy, other times i've a little akathisia. try to manage the right dosage for you, it's the only way.	it get slow my mind, my obsessions get down almost to not have. i take it in combo with Wellbutrin and Gabapentin, and i feel calmer and relaxed than before. it was horrible only thinking about past.

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010
1	depression, of all excuses	This is to the PARENTS out there who believe that if their child looks passive on the drug it is a godsend:  Beating someone over the head with a baseball bat can also make them sit still.  Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.  No more for me. Abilify- Forgetaboutit!!!!!!!	F	57	3  days	1/30/2010Email

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.

5	anxiety and depression	increased hunger and increased energy	This is a wonder drug for me. I thought I was going do die due to severe depression and anxiety. I am taking cymalta but after about a year, it didn't work. My MD RX'd 5mg of abilify along with my cymbalta every day. In my opinion, it saved my life. I feel like I have a reason to live and starting to enjoy the things I used to, just after one week of starting the med.	F	42	7  days	1/13/2010
4	Bipolar and anxiety	restlessness increased appetite inability to concentrate. Not sure if there are periods of anxiety or nervousness. No Mania	Works for mania. My pdoc says there is activation at low doses. My son started on 10 mg and takes 15 mgs. He also takes 900 mg of lithium and 10 mgs of Lexapro.	M	10	6  months	12/29/2009Email
3	Depression	Weight gain and constant appetite, anxiety, inability to concentrate	Worked well for the depression, but the constant appetite and associated weight gain, along with anxiety at higher doses, was not worth it overall	F	39	2.5  months	12/22/2009
