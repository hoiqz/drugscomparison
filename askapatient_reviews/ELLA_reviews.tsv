4		Extreme exhaustion, dizziness, nausea. Cramps	While I took it 107 hours late (the earlier the better, not sure if I had ovulated or not this month) I felt cramps a few hours later, which I think is a good sign. Made me extremely extremely exhausted though. DO NOT take if you have work/plans this day. Also, none of my local pharmacies carried it so I needed to purchase it from ella-kwikmed.com	F	21	 1 pill 1X D	2/6/2013
5	Prevent Pregnancy	Ella worked with mild side effects.  After being sexually active during my peak fertile time, I took ella.  I did not use any other method of birth control.  I took anti-nausea pills (Meclizine, 50mg) along with ella.  Side effects were mild.  A bit of nausea the night I took it, followed by some upset stomach and dizziness the following day.  My period came and was normal, maybe a bit early.	I would recommend ella for anyone uncertain about their birth control method.  Upon taking it, I would recommend staying in for the night and having healthy, light meals.  It's way better than the abortion pill taken later!	F	26	1  days30 MG 1X D	3/27/2012
