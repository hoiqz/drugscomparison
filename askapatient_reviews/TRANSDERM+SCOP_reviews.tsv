1	Motion sickness	I went on vacation with my family when I was 13, they gave me the patch twice in two days. The second night I woke up in the motel we were staying in, with visual hallucinations that were more profound than LSD. I since have never been the same! I am now 39 and can still remember verbatim the two day trip!!!		M	13	2  days10 mg	7/14/2013Email
1	Anti nausea for surgery	This was the worst drug experience I have ever had in my life. I did not know what was wrong with me for the first 2 days after I had returned home from a surgery.They gave me the patch to help with Nausea. I first started feeling dizzy and disoriented and then the anxiety started. I could not walk and my heart was pounding. I have done my share of drugs and I will tell you right now this was the worst and most scary experience I have ever had. I thought I had permanently lost my mind. I spent all night awake and hyperventilating.I thought I was having a heart attack. I tried other things to calm me down but nothing helped. I am lucky my boyfriend took care of me. It lasted about 4 days and the worst 2 days where in the middle. I will never take this drug again. The doctors did not believe me when I called and told them what was happening and that made me even more scared until my boyfriend found this site and read the review.  at least then I knew I wasn't going mental.

1	light headedness / dizziness	blurred vision, couldn't read - extreme dizziness - restlessness - anxiety - extreme fatigue - muscle weakness - impaired motor funcion	I put this patch on at 5pm on a Friday, woke up at 5am Saturday and sat up in bed, room was whirling, broke out in a cold sweat, felt horrible, immediately removed the patch and tried to sleep.  Felt bad all day on Saturday, but oh my Sunday morning all hell broke loose, 24 hours after removing the patch my symptoms were heightened.  My husband took me to the urgent care center, all they did was tell me to drink lots of water to try and flush the drug out of my system.   Its day 5 now and I'm still having issues with dizziness, weakness and fatigue.  Hoping to be back to at least the original state I was in before takign this drug soon.

5	Vertigo	No side effects	Only thing that stopped my vertigo, nausea, and vomiting that lasted for four weeks before I got it.  Within 30 minutes of having one on, my vertigo stopped.  Hasn't been back since.  Highly recommend this for anyone with vertigo.  Be careful and wash your hands after handling.  This is a strong sympathetic system medicine.

1	I had minor surgery.	When removing the patch within an hour or so I was disoriented. Felt like I was in a dream. I then became confused and kept repeating myself. I had to have my husband come to my work and take me home. I slept all night but woke up with the same side effects literally no memory, very scared and confused. Husband took me to the ER. They did cat scan and blood work and told me to drink lots of fluids. Doctors didn't seem to know about drug effects. I became worse within a few days. Finally got to the point where I was studdering and couldn't remember anything. I became catatonic and couldn't speak at all when I was finally rushed again to the ER. I was placed in ICU for 24 hours and had testing for a stroke. I also had vomiting, high blood pressure and fast heart rate. MRI, and every other test said no stroke. reaction to the patch. I then spend another two days in a regular room getting my speech back and my anxiety level down.	THIS DRUG SHOULD NOT BE ON THE MARKET! Even if some tolerate it well its not worth it to have it out there where it can cause so much havoc for those that do not tolerate it well. I was not given any side effect information besides, dry mouth and blurred vision. Surgery center just placed it on me. THIS DRUG COME FROM A PLANT IN COLUMBIA THAT IS USED FOR TRUTH SERUM AS WELL AS CRIMINALS TO DIBILIATE THE VICTIM WHERE THEY DO NOT HAVE A MEMORY OF THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED. THIS DRUG IS CALLED DEVILS BREATH IN COLUMBIA. I have went through two weeks of hell after having this patch. I thought that I was not going to live through it all.  It has now cost my husband and I thousands in medical bills because of my SERIOUS reaction. Please call the FDA and the pharmaceutical reps in your area as well as the makers of this drug. If enough people do maybe it will be taken off the market. 10 DAYS OUT AND STILL WORKING ON GETTING MYSELF 100% BETTER! STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG.	F	44	2  daysunsure 1X D	4/29/2013Email
1	7 day cruise	This drug is poison. I have used the patches on 3 previous cruises and thought this medication was wonderful. This time, I was terribly wrong. During the cruise the only problem I experienced was blurry vision, which I expected because it was listed as a side effect. 12 hours after I removed the patch, all hell broke loose. I was naseauted, dizzy, felt like my movement was delayed by 3 seconds, anxious, depressed, tired, was twitching and confused. I couldn't focus and was crying all the time. It has been 4.5 days since I have had that evil patch on, and I still do not feel back to normal. This drug is HORRIBLE and STAY FAR AWAY from it.		F	24	7  days	4/4/2013Email

1	To avoid Nausea after surger	15 minutes into wearing the patch my heart start thumping wildly and then racing, thumping and racing...beating hard, then I noticed my throat scratchy and dry.  I could not think clearly.  My face was on fire and when looked into the mirror my cheeks were flushed. Diarrhea the next day.	15 minutes into wearing the patch my heart start thumping wildly and then racing, thumping and racing...beating hard, then I noticed my throat scratchy and dry.  I could not think clearly.  My face was on fire and when looked into the mirror my cheeks were flushed. I thought hmmm I better look at side effects and so when I did I ripped that patch off immediately.  I had placed it on at bedtime as I was to have surgery the next morning...as a result surgery was cancelled due to my condition from the patch...I had felt GREAT all day long before I placed that patch on...unbelievable...for me it was a HORRIBLE experience. I had diarrhea that next day into the next night...I didn't get any sleep that entire night after I ripped the patch off.  If you have ever had an allergic reaction to any other substance DO NOT USE THIS PATCH.	F	56	1  days 1X D	1/24/2013Email
1	motion sickness/cruise	My daughter was prescribed this patch by her PCP.  She had worn the patch previously in October on a cruise with no side effects, however she put the patch on Dec 16 and wore it three days and replaced with another patch on the other ear.  Now she has lost her hearing in one ear and has had everything you can imagine nausea, vomiting, dizziness, muscle spasms, can't drive or even work without help, cannot work-cannot function-THIS DRUG IS DANGEROUS AND THE DRS, PHARMACIST, AND DRUG MAUFACTURERS NEED TO KNOW THEY ARE HURTING PEOPLE WITH THIS MEDICATION!!!!IT NEEDS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE MARKET!!!!!!

5	Deep sea fishing	Dry mouth	These patches are amazing! I get violently sick on the high seas. To the point of dry heaving the entire day non stop. I love fishing so much that my doctor starting prescribing me these patches about 8 years ago. I put one on the night before my fishing trip and fish for 10-15 hours the following day. I take it off the second we step off the boat. No problems! Awesome stuff! By the way, the over the counter motion sickness meds don't  work on me.	M	58	1  days1.5 mg 1X D	12/27/2012Email
1	Cruise vacation	Blurred vision, slight confusion and extremely dry mouth during use.  After removing the patch, migraine and extreme nausea. Ended up in urgent care due to vomiting and migraine symptoms.		F	35	10  days30mg	12/14/2012
1	Severe Motion Sickness	I experienced all of the side effects. I wore the patch for the first three days, at this point my vision became blurred. I replaced the patch with a new one. I realized the next morning that the medicine was causing dizziness, blurry vision and dry mouth. So, I removed the patch. Within the hour, I began to feel nauseous, my head began to spin, and I began to feel anexious. I am assumming there were withdrawl symptoms. I called my PCP and said symptoms can last up to a week. If you have any sensitivity to drugs....DO NOT TAKE THIS! I was and continue to be miserable 3 days later.		F	24	3  days	12/11/2012Email
3	Motion Sickness on a cruise	Vertigo, light headed, dry mouth and red eyes	Went on a 7 day cruise.  Used Transderm scop 1.5 MG Followed instructions to change it every three days.  It helped me from nausea and vomiting, but I had vertigo, dizziness, light headed dry mouth and red eyes.  I guess you can say that the cure is worse than the disease.  Not sure if I would use it again.  Its now going on 5 days and I am still dizzy and light headed.	M	72	7  days1.5 MG 3X W	12/7/2012Email
1	counter the effects of anesthesia	Vomiting and an extreme headache behind my left eye, nauseated with bouts of dizziness, trouble urinating, and sensitivity to light.	I used the Transderm-scop 1.5 MG/72HR patch, to counter the effects of anesthesia. I had the prescription filled as I wanted to do everything I could for a fast recovery! Approximately 15 days later, after using all 4 patches in the prescription and having come home wearing 1, I took the last patch off and 24 hours later it was on!The first signs of more withdrawals yet to come were projectile vomiting and an extreme headache behind my left eye; after which forced me, while still nauseated with bouts of dizziness, trouble urinating, and sensitivity to light, to research what this patches active ingredient is and to my surprise it is scopolamine thus scop, which I surmise was used to deceive the consumer/patient. After an hour of searching for a protocol to counter the withdrawal effects of Devils Breath as they call scopolamine in Columbia, I found the following: over the counter Dramamine or Bonnie; the active ingredient is Meclizine. Take 50MG every 6 hours for 3 days, and then try spreading them to every 12 hours if you can, for 3 days and taper down for the next 3 days to 25MG.  Here is the website where I found my protocol:  http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Ear--Nose--Throat/scopolamine-withdrawal/show/391762Everyone needs to be their own advocate and research all medications before use! This scopolamine is in other drugs including Parkinson tremors medication, psychiatric, over the counter, and etc.There have only been perhaps 3 clinical studie	F	54	15  days1.5MG 1X O	11/3/2012Email
4	14 day cruise	Extreme nausea within 4 hours of removing the patch at the end of our cruise.  I couldn't eat or drink anything for 2 days.  By the third day I was able to keep down flat ginger ale.  At day 4, I can eat low sodium chicken noodle soup, toast, crackers, etc.  Initially, I had mild blurred vision which has cleared up completely.	I've used this patch for much shorter timeframes in the past with no adverse effects.  My motion sickness isn't limited to ships - I get very sick in cars, etc.  Since our cruise also included excursions in mountainous areas, I kept the patch on the entire 14 days.  I had no ill effects until I removed it.  I noticed a small of amount of visual blurring when we got home, but that cleared up within a day.  Within 4 hours of removing the patch, I had hot flashes, was dizzy and thought I was going to throw up (in a restaurant).  Once home, I had to go straight to bed. The next morning, I felt kind of OK, so I drank a small smoothie.  That was the beginning of the end.  From that point, I threw up whenever I tried to drink anything for the next 2 days.  I thought I'd have to go to the hospital to be treated for dehydration if I couldn't begin keeping liquids down soon.  After finally settling my stomach with flat ginger ale, I've been able to keep very plain, bland foods down - I feel like someone who's on a chemo diet.  Anything with much of a fat content (like a pat of butter) goes right through me, however, I feel so much better than I did a few days ago, it's like a new me.  I'm lucky because I'm retired, so I didn't have to worry about getting to work like some of the others.  There's no way I could have handled riding in a car, much less public transportation.

1	7 day cruise	Never again!  I decided to try the patch b/c dramamine and bonine knock me out cold.  That's not my idea of a vacation.  I put the patch on the night before as directed.  The next morning while reading the paper I realized I was falling into a deep sleep sitting up and I also felt like my throat was not swallowing things properly.  I was constantly choking on everything, fluids and food.  I slept for four hours straight not unable to be woke.  Someone took the patch off.  The cruise ended 5 days ago.  I STILL am not able to concentrate on small print, computer screens, or books.  The lightheadedness and severe dizziness is constant.  I have memory lapses, blurred vision at times, and tension headaches of the century.  Never again.  I hope this goes away soon.  It's already been 5 days.		F	28	7  days30 1X W	10/26/2012Email
1	to prevent motion sickness	While using the patch for 5 days I did not get motion sickness. However, I have been vomiting for 3 days since removing it. DO NOT WEAR THIS PATCH! I followed the directions. Wore it for exactly 3 days. Removed it and put on a new one. Removed that one after 1 1/2 days  when I returned from my trip, so I had been medicated with the patch for a total of 4 1/2 days. I woke up the next morning so dizzy I couldn't drive my son to school without vomiting while driving. I have been in bed since then. This is the fourth day and I am finally able to sit up in a chair without feeling queasy. I had severe migraine headaches while sick. I would begin to feel better but after walking around the house, doing the dishes, etc. I would begin to feel dizzy again and would once again begin vomiting.  Driving was impossible.  I tried and had to immediately turn around and come home.  The first thing I did today was to call the company to tell them my complaint. I will deal with my motion sickness as I al		F	50	5  days1.5 mg. 1X O	10/25/2012

1	cruise	irregular heart rate, low blood pressure, heavy limbed, fatigue, sore throat, etc...etc....the list just keeps going....  this drug should absolutly not be on the market!!!!	there is help..for anyone out there who is still having trouble....i have done a lot of research and found the patch blocks neuro transmitters to the brain that tell you that your sea sick, problem is it can also block other neuro transmitters and make your life a living ----!  i have two things that i know can help this... use hot compress around neck for 10 munites then cold for 10 munites.  do this as much as you can starting and ending with heat.  that helps the transmitters start working, and then most important, find a neuromuscular therapist that knows what they're doing.  quiz them, ask them what they know about neurotransmitters!  they can work the area of the neck where these transmitters get blocked and help to get them working again. neuro transmitters control alot and when out of balance and not working properly they can really make life --------!  i am writing this for my mother, she got extremely sick after using the patch and after ekg, and many, many other tests the dr's did nothing.  so after alot of research this is what we did and she is well on her way to being herself again after 2 visits to therapist.  they say she should only need about 2 more sessions.

1	Vertigo	I was given this drug for some mild to moderate vertigo I had been experiencing.  I put a patch on Saturday and replaced it on a Tuesday as per the directions.  I started feeling really out of it, had impaired cognitive function and pupils dialated, so I removed it Tuesday.  Approximately 12 hours later I felt VERY sick to my stomach and my dizziness was worse than before I put on the patch.  I was very shaky and couldn't eat.  I felt this way for three days (had to take off work).  The third day I was feeling a little better and tried to drive to the grocery store and was overwhelmed with motion sickness and dizziness and had to turn around and come home.  The next day I tried to drive to work and the symptoms came back tenfold - I got so dizzy (a constant dizziness) and I vomited and my body started to ache and I got headaches.  I had none of these symptoms prior to removing this patch.	Bottom line - I am now facing possible short- to long-term leave from my job (not sure how I will do this as I support myself) because I cannot drive the 50 miles to work.  I'm really hoping my Dr. can offer something to help me.  This drug is a nightmare and should be removed from the market.	F	45	4  days1.5MG 2X W	8/10/2012Email
1	boating	Terrible side effects. I only took half a patch because of my size. That was over a week ago. Woke up this morning with spinning head - I can't even begin to tell you how bad it is. Threw up on and off all morning. Hard to focus - feels like if you move the wrong way will start the spinning all over again. Chills, weakness, headache - JUST AWFUL. I know it is from the patch because this happened to me before when I took a whole one. Thought I'd be ok with half...obviously not.	Please be careful. To me it is not worth these side effects. You don't know when they are going to hit you...and trust me...they are bad. The spinning feels like someone is rattling your head - and the vomiting reaction is immediate. I am only hoping these symptoms go away for good! Very scary...	F	42	2  dayshalf patch 1X D	8/9/2012
1	motion sickness	Every time I tried to quit the patch I would become very sick vomiting,dizzy, shaking.

1	Post surgery	Nausea, dizziness, and blurred vision 24 hours after taken off the patch. This drug is poison!		M	33	7  days	7/8/2012
1	Vertigo	extreme dry mouth and throat, dry eyes, mild dizziness while on the patch	I removed the patch after 24 hours due to the dry eyes and throat, eating was getting hard, having to chase food with water to get it to go down.  I've been off for over 24 hours and I think my withdrawls are mild compared to what i've read..but here goes.  My vision was slightly blurred, made it hard to focus on things close up, I have an anxiety disorder and this has made it much worse than usual.  Last night as I was going to bed I would relax and then my muscles started twitching, just on the verge of sleep, I would jump like I felt the falling sensation, I had a very hard time sleeping, it was hard to keep my eyes closed I felt like I had had too much coffee...which I had none.  Today I woke up feeling a little better to start, then an hour or so ago, just started feeling out of it and couldn't stop crying...more anxiety.  Got home and tried to take a nap and the muscles were jumping and waking me up.  Anyone else had muscle twitches?  I looked it up and I guess it only happens to a small group of people.  Anyway, I believe that I should have just waited out my vertigo spell, I honestly think the patch made me feel worse and way more anxious.  I will NEVER use this drug again.

4	Vertigo/Meniere's Disease		I've tried almost everything under the sun to help with my daily bouts of vertigo due to Meniere's Disease. The Scop patch is the only medication that has reliably helped; it cut down my episodes of vertigo from every day (sometimes a couple times a day) to 2-4 times a week. In preparation for surgery, my ENT wanted me to wean off the scop.  I took off the patch before a 3-day weekend after reading about terrible withdrawal.  12 hours after removal, withdrawal kicked in.  One study online had recommended a meclizine taper to counter the withdrawal, so as soon as I started feeling the extreme vertigo and nausea, I took 2 tablets of OTC meclizine (less-drowsy version of dramamine) and 8 mg of Zofran.  Every 4-6 hours I took another tablet of each for the first day.  Day 2, I cut down to every 8 hours, then day 3, every 12 hours.  I was able to go to work on day 4.  I'm now on a 3 days on, 2 days off schedule for the patch until my surgery.  It gives me some relief from vertigo, and the only withdrawal with that short of a duration is a headache for a few hours 12-24 hours after taking it off.  For me, the benefit of reduced vertigo in my daily life outweighs the mildly annoying side effects and the withdrawal.  I wouldn't strongly recommend this medication for just a cruise or air travel, but for people with daily vertigo that doesn't abate with more common treatments, this medication may vastly improve quality of life.

2	Cruise	Blurred vision, extreme dry mouth while using. Nausea, dizziness, continued blurred vision 48 hours after removal.	Worked great to help with my motion sickness on the ship, however the side effects and withdrawal symptoms I'm now experiencing are not worth it. I feel horrible and am worried about when my vision will (if ever) clear up to what it was previously. The side effects seem minor until you have to deal with them for days after ending treatment. I won't use these again. Not worth it.	F	42	7  days 1X AN	4/9/2012Email
1	cruise	Put the patch on the night before my flight for air travel and was planning to leave it on for the duration of a 5-day cruise.  Within an hour of taking the patch I could feel my heart racing and had palpitations.  When I woke up in the morning I had a terrible headache also.  I looked it up and found so many comments about the problems after having the patch on so I took it off after 7 hours.  No withdrawl symptoms.  I am glad I did not leave it on any longer.	Take it off before it's too late	F	48	1  days 1X D	4/7/2012Email
1	For dealing with my chronic nausea	While on the patch I didn't feel any better, and i had a hard time focuses in close objects. Having to do school i took it off in less then a day. About 24 hours later I experienced extreme nausea, dizziness,drowsiness, and my eyes were dilated all day. I found online that a drug that helps with sea sickness actually subsided a victims withdrawal. I took bonine and the nausea decreased greatly. its the second day and i took one more bonine and I feel almost back to my regular state (without withdrawals) of nausea. I hope that helps.	DON'T TAKE IT!!! WITHDRAWALS ARE HORRIBLE! if experiencing withdrawals try bonine for nausea.	F	15	1  days30mg 1X D	3/30/2012
3	cruise	vertigo, nausea, headache	I have used the patch many times for cruises and it usually makes me feel OKAY on the boat, I never feel great. I ALWAYS feel bad after I take it off. Luckily I dont feel as bad as many of the people who have written on here before, I usually have vertigo and nausea for awhile after I take the patch off. The ONLY thing that sometimes makes me feel better is to take a warm bath, Im not sure why it helps so much, maybe because I can actually match my vertigo up the the way the water moves or something but it definitely makes me feel better. Also, dont bother calling them about questions, they had me on hold for 20 minutes, asked me a million questions and then told me they couldnt help me because they werent doctors... gee thanks. The only good information that I got from them was that it takes 4.5 days for the medicine to leave your system and if you feel bad after taking off the patch then youre probably having withdrawls! Good luck everybody who doesnt feel well, I feel your pain.	F	22	7  days1.5 mg 3X W	3/19/2012Email
1	motion sickness/cruise	dizziness, nausea and vomitting, light headedness, blurry vision, difficulty focusing on near objects 24hours after removing patch	I will never use this patch again. I ended up seeing my doctor and missing work due to the side effects of the medication. Very nasty side effects. Make sure you consult your family physician before using this product. It shouldn't be available over the counter. It's been 4 days now and I am still feeling the side effects post removal of the patch.	M	28	6  days1.5mg 2X W	3/7/2012
1	To combat sickness after surgery	Nausea, blurred vision, itchy skin, dizziness, uncontrolled vomiting, headaches, and right eye is dilated.	I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN POISONED!  This patch was put on me just before my surgery, nurse said it would help the nausea I get when under general anestesia.  I was only warned about touching the patch, then touching my eye.  Didn't sound bad at all.  I wore it for just over three days then removed it.  I woke up yesterday feeling very nauseous, dizzy, and exhausted. I had some of the symptoms during the 3 days wearing the patch, but assumed it was from surgery.  My vision was so blurry, I could not read.  I have the hives, severe headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and feel very depressed.  I am grateful that I ONLY wore it for 3 days.  My heart goes out to anyone who used it longer than I did.  I tried to explain to my husband what it feels like.  Try to imagine your worst hangover you've ever had, now multiply that X's 10!!!  And don't forget to add all the other symptoms to that feeling. I would not recommend this poison to ANYONE!!! I hope to feel normal someday.	F	40	4  days 1X W	3/6/2012Email
1	7 day cruise-1st time cruising	Cruising with my husband, sister, and her husband.  We all were told by friends to get the patch since it was our first cruise. We followed directions and changed patches every 3rd day.  It worked great during the cruise. High winds during cruise. They had to close top two decks one of the days.  Only side effects we had were dry mouth. It was after the cruise when the nightmare began!	Just like everyone else has said it all started about 24 hrs. after taking the patch off.  It was awful!! All 4 of us said that if this was the price for cruising we didn't want to do it again!! We were vomiting, dizzy, chills,no energy, sleeping, etc.  Since this was our first cruise we thought we were just experiencing "getting our land legs back"! I didn't think the cruising business would exist if everyone felt this bad afterwards, so I did some research.  Wish I had researched the Transderm Scop as much as I did the cruise!  I wouldn't have taken it!  Not worth it!!!  No one talked about the side effects after you take the patch off!	F	60	7  days1.5 1X D	3/5/2012
4	Antarctic Cruise - Drake Passage	I was a little drowsy and some slight double vision, but nothing to write home about. I would DEFINITELY take the patch again if I ever needed it. The side effects didb't bother me. I only noticed the double-vision when I was reading a book up close - no other time. And I just drank some tea to combat the drowsiness. But I also sleep really easy on boats so that could be making me sleepy too.	I have been off the patch for 3 days and have had no ill effects. I would much rather take the patch again rather than go through the Drake Passage without it.	F	30	8  days1 patch 1X O	2/7/2012Email
1	14 day cruise	No side effects while on patch. But 24 hrs after removing patch my husband began with severe nausea, fatigue, sleeplessness yet needing to sleep a lot, strange dreams, spinning thoughts and just feeling totally lousy. It's been five days now and he still has these symptoms to varying degrees. He starts to feel better for hours and then it hits him really hard again. Don't know how long this will last, but it's encouraging to read so many posts from people with similar reactions.  No more cruises - it's not worth it!	My husband used the patch for a five day cruise five years ago and had no side effects. But we'd never again use the patch after our most recent experience!	M	75	14  days 1X D	1/23/2012
1	Motion sickness (ocean cruise)	NEVER AGAIN.  Applied one patch the night before our cruise departed.  Woke up with literally zero saliva in my mouth (couldn't even swallow) and unable to walk in a straight line.  Also felt extremely heavy-limbed, dizzy, and weak.  The patch may work for motion sickness aboard sea vessels (my mom uses it on every cruise) but for me, it is TOTALLY not worth the side effects.  I ended up taking the less drowsy Dramamine and that did just fine.	Really, really not worth it for me.  Take Dramamine instead.  It's cheaper and has way fewer side effects.

1	Cruise	I used the patch for 2 other cruises with no problem.  This cruise, I had no sea sickness at all.  Only side effect was blurred vision.  When I took the patch off I got really sick.  I was nauseated for several days.  I actually started feeling sea sick when I took it off so I put it back on after I got off the boat.  I have had it off for a couple days now and my vision is extremely blurry.  I'm praying I get my vision back.  I wish people posted updates on here so I could see how long this might last.  Really scary.  I'll use bonine next time.	NOT worth it.	F	40	11  days4 patches 4X W	12/30/2011Email

1	Cruise	Wearing the patch caused the symptoms it was treating. I was dizzy and nauseous. Couldn't see straight or walk. My words didn't make sense and my speech was slurred. Became disoriented and had hallucinations. The cruise doctor said these were all from the patch and I took it off. I spent the next two days detoxing. Terrible cruise.

1	To prevent motion sickness on a 10	I used this drug for three cruises in the early 90's and loved it.  I used it 4 weeks ago and had exactly the same symptoms upon removal. Neither my dr. or pharmacists heard of this.  I have suffered for 13 days.  This site suggested bonnine and it worked.  At least I will make it thoiugh the holidays.  I will try ginger root in the future to wean myself off the bonnine. Any other advice would be appreciated.  Note:  Over the course of 13 days there was NO improvement, I would have just waited it out.  Someone who was ill this long-----help!		F	62	10  days1-5 1X D	12/2/2011Email
1	unable to control vomiting	I have no side effects while wearing the patch; however, if I attempt to stop wearing the patch, within 10 hours I am completely dizzy, cannot stand light, noise or smells. and I begin vomiting and am totally unable to move.  At this point an ambulance is called.	I need to know how to stop my vomiting (no doctor an diagnosis why I would start vomting in may and they still cannot find out why.

1	Vertigo/Dizziness	Nausea, Dizziness, Extreme Headache, Anxiety, Sweating.  Then I took the patch off and 2 days later I literally thought I was dying.  I missed Thanksgiving dinner and couldn't eat anything for 48 hours.  3 days later I am better, but still have waves of the after-effects.  The withdrawal hit me like a tidal wave and I was completely unprepared- I literally was so scared I had a total panic attack.  The room was spinning and I felt like I was floating.  For the first time ever, I think I even hallucinated.  Oh, and I cried and felt depressed.  If anyone wants to email and let me know how long their withdrawal symptoms lasted, that would be great.	I would NEVER, EVER take this medication.  I have never heard of a medication that you can take for 36 hours and have extreme, and I mean, extreme withdrawal symptoms from.  Be warned.

1	Honeymoon cruise	The medication works great for duration of cruise.  Dry mouth and blurred vision are trade offs for nausea and vomiting.  Problem occurs when medication is discontinued.  Had extreme  nausea, vomiting, and dizziness for 48 hours.   My vision is still blurry and dry mouth persists.  Unusual symptoms this time around.		F	54	10  days30mg	11/27/2011
1	Motion sickness	I felt fine while using the drug, and only experienced the slight blurred vision they note on the packaging. However, upon removing the patch I felt extreme dizziness, fatigue/lethargy, and intense nausea. As soon as I put the patch back on I felt fine again within 4 hours. I had to wear the patch for over 20 days and then stopped when my doctor told me to. I have been unable to drive, work, or function. I am constantly dizzy, tired, and on the verge of vomiting or actually vomiting. I have trouble finding the right words to say/ concentrating. I have no appetite and have lost 15 lbs. I am pale and my heart races sometimes when I try to walk a distance. I fainted and ended up in the ER. Most recently, my left pupil is larger than my right. I have had a normal MRI, vertigo and balance testing, and vision screenings. My doctors cannot explain my sudden experiences after removing the patches, only to say that  am most likely suffering rebound effects. Good news- antivert (meclazine),	I wouldn't take this if I were you.

1	Cruise	Wore the patch for 8 days changing it every 3 days as prescribed.  Side effects while on the patch were dry mouth & a drugged feeling.  The last day started blurry vision that lasted for 8 WEEKS!	I started having blurred vision the last day of the cruise and just didn't feel well.  Removed the patch and then had withdrawal symptoms for about 7 days - dizziness, blurred & double vision, headache and nausea.  I could only see about two feet in front of me.  I went to the ENT that prescribed the patch and he said that it could not cause these symptoms.  He thought I had a stroke so I had an MRI & MRA.  Both showed no signs of stroke or anything else abnormal.  He sent me to an optometrist & an opthamologist.  Both doctors also said the patch could not cause this yet they couldn't explain my symptoms.  I could not see to drive for 6 weeks and my husband had to drive me to work every day and help me at the grocery store because I would get dizzy walking down the aisles.  I could finally see well enough to drive after 6 weeks and the blurry vision went away totally at 8 weeks.  I have spoken to other people that have had these symptoms including a doctor in Australia who knew about these horrible side effects and the vision problems that can last for 2 or 3 months.  I will never use the patch again and I tell everyone I know not to use it.  Very dangerouse drug.	F	51	8  days1.5 mg 1X O	10/10/2011
1	surgery	Nurse put patch on b4 surgery, all she said was it reduces nausea and vomiting, by,the end of the day, I had a blinding headache, eyes were so dry they hurt, and  waa more disoriented now than I was waking up after surgery.AlmoST two days later, I cannot drink enough watet to and yet barely able to Pee, considering I had a kidney stone removed, peeing would be good I would think, noticed this was a side effect of the patch, MU head still hurts, unable to eat. DO NOT EVER TAKE !!!!!!!I also had bouts of anger and saddnesd	It should be taken off market	F	44	1  days 1X D	10/9/2011Email
3	7 day cruise	dry mouth, blurred vision	While taking the patch, things were good.  It actually worked and I did not experience motion sickness while cruising.  This was my first cruise but I normally get nauseous on ferry boats or boats like that.  The trouble is going on now (day 3 post patch removal)  I can barely stay awake in the afternoons.  I get really dizzy when sitting for too long.  My vision is still blurry and I am forced to wear glasses I use sometimes for distance in order to read my computer screen, phone screen, books, ect.  I'm just thankful that I came across this message board.  I'm experiencing so many of the same things as others have posted.  I suppose it's just a waiting game now to see when these symptoms stop.  Good luck everyone.	F	31	7  days1.5 1X D	9/28/2011
1	Vertigo/dizziness	I was prescribed this during a particularly nasty bout of vertigo because my usual meclazine wasn't doing the trick.  I put a patch on, ran an errand, then laid down for an hour or so at home to wait for it to kick in as I had plans that evening.  About 4-5 hours later on as I was attending an event, I suddenly experienced a severe chest pain - it felt like a massive cramp - extending from mid breastbone to diaphragm, so bad I couldn't draw a breath for a few moments.  After the first bad pain, I could breathe, but it was difficult.  My boyfriend took me outside in the fresh air, and got the patch off of me while I tried to breathe.  About 5 minutes after the patch came off, the pain disappeared.  I called my doctor the next day to tell them what had happened and was told not to put the patch back on (DUH!!) even though the doctor "still felt it was the best treatment" for my dizziness.  I didn't have any other side effects once the patch was off, but I have a feeling that ma	My father was prescribed this for nausea during the last stages of cancer and it worked well for him right up until his last few days when he literally needed to be sedated to avoid dry-heaving.  I know this drug has its good uses, but I think doctors might be a bit more picky on what they prescribe it for considering how severe the side effects can be.	F	31	1  days 1X D	9/6/2011
5	Motion sickness	A bit of dry mouth while taking and absolutely NO side effects after.	I suffer from extreme motion sickness.  Transderm Scop has enabled me to enjoy cruising.  I would definitely recommend this patch to others.  I would bet that there are more people that it helps than those it doesn't.	F	68	21  days 1X AN	9/2/2011Email
5	To avoid sea sickness	Very minimal side effects, slight dry mouth, no dizziness and no side effects after removing the patch.  Applied the patch every 3 days for more than a month working on a fishing boat.  For the most part I couldn't even tell I had it on, other than I was not hurling.

1	motion sickness- cruise	lack of energy, dehydration, blurry vision, anxiety.  Worse of all, I had an episode on cruise ship where I fell down stairs (may or may not have been contributed to by above side effects) fainted, and had to seek emergency medical attention. The ship doctor removed the patch immediately and said never to take it again. He could not believe I had taken as instructed for 7 days- said the patch is very bad for people.  It had caused my blood pressure to drop extremely low. (I am a norm healthy, active 29 y.o. with normal blood pressure). Had to give IV fluids and other medicine for dehydration. Was a scary 40 minutes in hospital bed waiting for blood pressure to return to normal and heart rate to get back to normal. I thought i was clumsy and panicked- however now realize after reading all these other posts that the patch contributed to this. I was so startled by this event, I dont think I remember how bad the withdrawl effects were. I thought the dizziness, exhaustion and other effects	I didnt believe the doctor- but now see these other posts and wish I knew this before hand. I would not recommend nor take this drug again.

1	Vertigo	Dizziness, nausea, vomiting, extreme dry mouth, headaches, confusion, hallucinations, hard time remembering things, blurred vision/large pupils, abdominal cramps 24 hours after removal of patch as well as sweating, drowsiness	I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PATCH TO ANYONE!!! It made me feel way worse than I ever did to begin with.  I thought taking the patch off would make me feel better but the withdrawal side effects are horrible!  24 hours after I removed it I became very nauseous and had a bad cramp in my stomach.  I became very sweaty and felt like I couldn't move.  I took the patch off three days ago and I'm still not feeling normal!  I'm very easily confused and I cannot remember things that have just happened.  The night after I took it off I had hallucinations and thought there was a giant spider chasing me out of my room at 2 in the morning.  I am a small girl (100 lbs) and I think the dosage was way too much for my body!  Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT use this patch.  You will regret it.  I wish my doctor had warned me of all these awful side effects!	F	20	1  days 2X W	8/27/2011Email
