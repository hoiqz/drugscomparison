3	Ventricular Tachycardia	I feel very depressed and down. This is very much a big change for me. I am usually very happy-go-lucky. I feel like a could cry at any given point. I also have this horrible headache and I normally never get headaches. I am not sure I want to be on this medication anymore.	The medication is working for the problem that I had, but I do not like the side effects that I am experiencing.	F	39	3  weeks	4/12/2007Email
