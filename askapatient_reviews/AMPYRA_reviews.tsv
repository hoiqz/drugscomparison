5	MS for 29 yrs. Falls from foot drop	Indigestion, lost some sense of balance, lower back pain, minor throat irritation, insomnia	Would I start it again? In a heart beat! I have scraped up my knees way too many times and broken 3 bones and my upper 2 center teeth from falls caused by foot drop. The side effects I have felt are a very small price to pay for the (almost) total elimination of that foot drop. Thus, my high rating.	M	62	30  days10mg 2X D	11/26/2011EmailHistory
2	To improve my walking.	On the first day, after the second pill, my legs were tingling uncomfortably. The tingling subsided in a couple of days and I stuck with the regimen for three months. However, my walking didn't improve. And then I ended up getting a nasty UTI, which took two rounds of antibiotics to get rid of. And I'm not prone to UTI's. After a one-month layoff, I tried it again and with the first dose I got a nasty headache and body aches. I'm through with the stuff.		M	51	3  months10mg 2X D	9/26/2011
2	MS Gait	The first few days tingling sensations increased but that subsided after a few days.  Increased bladder infections with spasms.	It seemed to improve the overall nerve function for me for the first month then seemed to lose its effect. I could walk a bit better for a while but not faster; I'm ceasing the use of this one.

5	Muscle endurance due to MS	Increased Urinary Tract Infections	I was on the clinical trial for this med.  It works for me.  I have no complaints.  My walking speed increased, my energy levels were higher and it had some off-label benefits such as improved bladder continence.	F	40	5  years10MG 2X D	11/16/2010

1	Gait difficulty because of MS	Worsening of my MS symptoms - numbness, spasticity, and heaviness of feet and legs. The numbness became unbearable within 36 h. I could not sleep, sit, anything.	I was among the first to take this recently FDA-approved drug.	M	58	4  days10 mg 1X D	5/12/2010
