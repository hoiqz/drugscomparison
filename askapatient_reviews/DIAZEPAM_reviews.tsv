5	Panic attacks	At first sleepiness.	Still works wonderfully after 5 years.  I've tried every benzo on the market, and its still surprising how this ancient drug works better for me than anything else.  Also taking It with Effexor XR and trazodone.  Knocked out my panic attacks completely!	M	26	5  years10 mg 2X D	1/25/2013
3	GAD, Panic attacks	tolerance;  very poorly absorbed before/during/after food/meals	Long half-life is great. But I've noticed a severe malabsorption of this med with food. This is a major problem. The pharmaceutical market is (i feel) wide open to an enteric-coated form that is pre/post prandial neutral. One lives in hope...!	M	54	24  months5MG 3X D	12/17/2012
5	Anxiety and Panic Attacks	None	One of the best meds I've used for Anxiety. This drug has been around a long time and works great if you don't abuse it. Taken as needed, it has helped me a lot with Severe Anxiety and Panic Attacks. I've noticed that with ALL drugs, you will find people who say "Don't take this or that drug" as if you'll die if you do, these people have serious issues.	F	55	10  years5MG 3X D	11/27/2012Email
3	anxiety	none.	Was given this as a substitute for ativan (lorazepam) because of its longer half-life, and thus greater efficacy at helping me sleep. I found it much less potent than ativan, and could take it like candy. It's a "smoother" benzo experience, but for that reason, felt "watered-down." I'd rather take ativan for anxiety/panic, and then lunesta or something for sleep. In my opinion, diazepam has been surpassed by other benzos like klonopin, ativan and xanax, and should be used only to ween off of these (again, due to its longer half-life and mildness).

5	Anxiety/Panic attacks/insomnia	Initially, diazepam sedated me, especially once it built up in my system after about a week or two, but the sedation wore off, and now I find that it works great to keep my anxiety low and prevents panic attacks...also, diazepam is much easier to withdrawal from than Xanax or Ativan b/c of the long half-life..

1	...		Having side effects, withdrawal problems (between doses, trying to cut back, etc) and not getting real info from the medical profession? You aren't alone or crazy. Want to know the truth about Benzo's? Check out: www.benzo.org.uk/manual/	F		  1X D	4/26/2012Email
5	Anxiety/Stress	None	It has been a great drug to relieve my anxiety for stress in life. I suffer from social anxiety and it helps in social settings.	F	42	2  years5 mg 2X D	2/14/2012
5	Panic/Anxiety	I've been taking Diazepam 3-4 times a week for a couple years now for acute panic. I have a hereditary disease that sometimes causes me to freak out a lot. Diazepam has helped tremendously to keep me on an even keel.	Don't take more than you really need it, don't stop taking it abruptly, and DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL while taking it.	M	51	2  years10 MG 1X AN	8/24/2011Email
5	migraine	none	Diazepam (valium) is the ONLY medication that has really helped with my migraines. I take 1 or 2 as I feel the symptoms come on and at about 20 minutes I am fine. No headache, no aura.	M	41	5  years10 mg 3X D	7/24/2011
4	RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME	None - it is very successeful for aleviateing the symptoms of restless leg syndrome.	Not safe to take for anxiety or sleep disorder as it is ALWAYS addictive. Diazepam takes over the brain's natural functions and brain dependency follows. This is known as addiction. It happens within 4 weeks. It may take 12-18 months to withdraw from diazepam very slowly. Stopping diazepam too quickly can cause cold turkey symptoms and even seizures and death. It is far more difficult to stop than heroin or cocaine. If you need it for a week or two - fine. If not, then never take this drug ever, unless it is for RLS like myself.	F	68	 5mg 1X D	12/19/2010
5	Anxiety	drowsiness	Made my flying experience much more comfortable.	M	20	1  days10mg 1X D	10/9/2010
4	Trapped nerve pain & depression	None.  Took it for 10 days (2mg) x 2 times a day.  Felt improvement within 48 hours.	Took effect within 24 hours.  Pain lessoned and I stopped crying and feeling low and miserable.  After 4 days I started to laugh again after weeks feeling hopeless.  Only took 2 x 2mg tablets a day for 10 days.  Come off them and already feeling lower and the pain level is going up.	F	37	10  days	2/24/2009
5	anxiety/ post traumatic stress	After trying multiple drugs with mostly no results and major side effects, I have finally found a med that helps. But like others have said, sometimes it works better than others but always atleast takes the edge off.		M	32	2  weeks	11/1/2008Email
2	sleep problems	none	gp never gave sufficient dose to make it work. I was on 5mg, i needed at least 6 tablets to feel drowsy. It wore off very quickly too.	M	34	4  years	10/15/2007
1	stress	muscle fatigue and pain.  water retention or some sort of swelling, feeling of being weak and sick.  All this after 1/2 of a 5 mg pill	would not take this again	F	65	1  days	9/14/2007
5	Anxiety	This worked like a charm.  It allowed me the sleep I needed as well and I woke up in the am with no fatigue.  I took it with Effexor.	I do not have any insurance and if there is anyone that would be willing to sell me any, it would be greatly apprciated.  I am in the process of finding a job with bennifits that would cover this medication.	M	44	3  months	7/20/2007Email
4	terror attacks/suicidal thots	none	so far a lifesaver	M	37	7  days	5/27/2007
5	Anxiety - Panic attacks	None bad - Slightly groggy in the morning after 5 or 10mg but if you can get 8 hours or so no problems. A nice morning coffee fixes it anyway.	This really helps me. Works better on occasions than at other times. I take it travelling and without out it I get bad anxiety. I try to use it only when needed which varies but go I go through probably 10-15 5mg per month on average. The best medicinal help I've found. Tried Zoloft but way too many side effects.	M	35	5  years	2/10/2007
1	control antidepressane seide effect	feeling of being "sick"; tired; muscle soreness; immune system weaked; addiction with bad abdominal pain as withdrwal symptom	I was given diazapam to counteract anxiety due to antidepressants. I always took a lower dose than what was prescibed but eneded up badly addicted. After trying to go off a number of times I found that it takes a year or more (not the month my doctors told me). I found useful info at www.benzo.org. I am still in a lot of pain.	M	50	3  years	10/27/2005Email
1	Generalized Anxiety Disorder	Mild tiredness. The doctor gave me a very high dosage and the drug still did nothing. It was, in my experience, absolutely worthless	Do not use this drug	M	24	3  months	12/20/2004
5	anxiety	None at all. In my opinion Diazepam is the best drug to treat my anxiety.	I'm being prescibed 20mg.s of diazepam, same as valium, to take three times a day and all I'v got to say is it's working great for me ! I finally can walk down the street without the unreal fears I had about people and now because of the help of this medication and my own self determination I now have a job.	M	23	 	11/3/2004Email
5	Anxiety	None	No side effects. This drug did exactly what I wanted...to calm me down! I have such horrible anxiety attaks that I have gone to the hospital emergency room several times for fear that I was actually dying of a heart attack. I've had several EKG's done on me, and every time my heart appears normal. So was diagnosed with Severe Anxiety and prescribed Diazepam to treat it. It works wonders for me.
