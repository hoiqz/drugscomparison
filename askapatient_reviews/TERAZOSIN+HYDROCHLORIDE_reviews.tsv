				F M	 	 	    
5	BPH & Hypertension	Only noticed side effect was dizziness upon standing.  No sexual side effects at this dosage ever.	After taking this drug for 15 years my BPH took an unexpected bad turn and I was switched to Rapaflo.  I do not like the Rapaflo side effects, especially on the sexual side.  I am going back to urologist to see if a switch back could be possible	M	53	15  years5mg 1X D	8/26/2012
5	urinary urgency, increase flow	Slight headache, some dizzyness when beginning the drug, orthostatic hypotension.	Switched from Flomax to Hytrin and thank God I did. Works great, I can piss like a racehorse again, have no vertigo at all, can ejaculate normally again, and don't have to worry about "floppy iris syndrome" as much. Moved from 1 mg. a day to 2mg. after the 1st. week. Side effects flare up briefly when you up the dosage, then subside in 1 or 2 days. Added benefit of spontaneous "night boners" again. Haven't had those in the last 20yrs....!!! Great alpha blocker ...and cheap...!!!	M	57	60  days2 mg 1X D	7/22/2012Email
2	BPH, urinary retention, repeat UTI	Rapid heart beat (110 BPM) lasting over 30 min. Chills under a heavy layer of blankets. Eyes (during sleep) wet as if infected. Insomnia. Anxiety/nervousness. Slight increase Blood Pressure, to no increase. No dizzyness.	Took Terazosin generic for Hytrin. Seemed helpful: increased flow, able to urinate longer. Insomnia on first and second night, 4 hrs sleep each night. Chills lasting 20-30 minutes when very warm. Though entirely different drugs, experienced similar side effects with Flomax. If you experience chills, elevated heart rate, or significant eye problems STOP USING and call the Dr. May be a good drug if your body can handle it, mine can't.	M	60	2  days1 mg 1X D	1/22/2011
1	Minor Urinary Incontinence.	Severe diziness, and spinning sensation all night with first dose.  Second night almost fell down when getting up to urinate and hand to crawl to the bathroom and back to the bed, 3rd night lightheadache and dizzy, decided to try accupuncture instead	Not for me!	M	48	3  days 1X D	8/30/2010
3	Hypertension	Growing impotence, reduced sexual response, as dosage rose from 2mg through 4mg to 6mg.  Very little and light syncope.	Can't tolerate the side effects I now have.  Original application was for BPH in preparatin for TURP procedure performed last June.  Hypertension increased after the procedure (surprisingly), so nephrologist switched uses to this purpose.

3	enlarged prostate gland			M	68	3  years	11/11/2009
2	Frequent urination	Stuffy nose.  Tiredness.	While it improved my urination issues (frequent visits, reduced stream, straining) it made sleep very difficult.  Instead of getting up at night to go to the bathroom, I was awakened several times from not being able to breath through my nose.  I stopped taking it 1 1/2 ago.  I've just been prescribed Flomax following a Cystoscopy.  I'm concerned I'll have the same symptoms.	M	50	365  days	8/24/2009
3	bph	fatigue	it works well to help with the urination problem,but I have fatigue that may be related to the drug.	M	87	17  years	7/20/2009Email
2	bph, hypertension	First took it for BPH when I had no hypertension. Side effects of reverse ejaculation and extreme tiredness never went away & I discontinued drug. Later, when I developed hypertension, I started on it again and this time was  side effect free for 2 months, on 5 mg. taken at bedtime. Lowered blood pressure & relieved BPH nicely. Then began experiencing breathing difficulties & pounding heart in late morning, which would go away after several hours. Lowered dosage to 2.5 mg. Side effects did not gone away, and BPH relief is unsatisfactory at this dosage.		M	63	3  months	3/15/2009
5	bph & hypertension	Terrible side effects when taken for BPH alone, w/o hypertension. Reverse ejaculation; constant fatigue, even on 1 mg. dose, even after several weeks. Terrible drug at the time, had to discontinue it. But later, when I experienced high blood pressure, drug lowered it very well and relieved my BPH symptoms, and I had none of the previous side effects, even on 5 mg. dose. It became an excellent drug for me.		M	63	6  months	1/31/2009
4	high blood presure	I think this drug may have caused my hair thining out also when the presure falls suddensly you may feel very weak or in your legs.		F	62	20  months	10/12/2008
5	BPH	None noticed	Started at 1 mg still at 1 mg symptoms of urine stream stoppage went away within days of begining dosage. No relapse of symptoms.	M	42	6  months	7/20/2008Email
5	BPH	No side effects.  Started at 2mg, increased to 5mg.  Stream flow increased substantially.  Still get up a couple of times a night, but this is related to my personal sleep pattern and probaly unrelated to the prostate problem.	Very satisfied with this drug.  Does not CURE the underlying problem (unfortunately), but sure makes it more tolerable and avoids the need for surgery (at least thus far)	M	68	2  years	6/11/2008
5	BPH	LIGHT HEADED FOR A VERY BRIEF PERIOD.KEEPS MY BP IN THE NORMAL RANGE!	IT HAS WORKED EXCELLENTLY FOR ME.  FROM 3-4 'TRIPS' PER NIGHT TO JUST ONE AND SOMETIMES NONE. LOST SOME EFFECTIVENESS OVER TIME AND NOW USE AVODART AS WELL.  GOOD RESULTS!	M	68	12  years	9/1/2007
4	bph	Too high of a dosage - Weakness, lethargy, shoulder pain when bike riding, very tired after exercising	As I stepped up thro 1mg, 2mg, 5mg, 10mg, urination kept improving.  My regular prescription was thus 10 mg.  After three months I realized all of the side effects were caused by too low bp (I had normal bp before meds).  I am now at 3 mg.  Urination is still pretty good (but not as good as 10)as I am only getting up once a night vs. 3 or 4 times.  However, I feel like my old self -- energetic and pain free.  I may move up to 4 mg.  You need to carefully take the time to balance dosage vs low blood pressure.  For me, I need about two weeks at a particular dosage to fully understand a side effect vs. just a bad day.	M	68	7  months	8/8/2007
4	post brachytherapy - flow/urgency	Initially, none other than very positive effects of increasing urine stream, improving volume, decreasing urgency. On physician's recommendation, I increased dose and experienced considerable dizziness.  Reduced dose, added 4x/day Aleve (c.) to help limit inflammation AND things seem fine!	Following brachytherapy (radioactive seed implants within cancerous prostate) the prostate gland (predictably) enlarges, pressing up against the bladder and constricts the urethra. You get all sorts of urinary symptoms.  I couldn't tolerate the drug of choice for this - Flomax (racing heart, extreme dizziness) and Hytrin suggested as replacement. So far - results seem good!	M	53	10  days	6/22/2007
4	Enlarged Prostate	None	It definately helps urine flow. If I miss a dose, I can tell the difference.	M	64	2  years	6/14/2007
1	enlarged prostate	after a few months i had sever lower adominal pain. i could quit taking it and pain would go away. prostrate also would enlarge.		M	66	6  months	5/9/2007
4	Decreased urine flow; hypertension	Initial dizziness, but none now	Has been a very effective med for me	M	53	4  months	2/4/2007
4	prostate	Only thing I've found that helps urination. Can't tell of any side effects yet. Been on Hytrin about 6 months. Dosage 4 mg per day.		M	66	6  months	5/10/2005
3	hypertension	some light headedness at first but that went away after about 2 weeks.	its working.	M	43	7  years	10/19/2004
3	to improve urine void rate	posturial dizziness	Benefit after a few weeks seemed to atrophy gradually back to slow (and incomplete) voiding again. With each increase of dosage, the pattern seemed to repeat itself although not as quickly as before. Conclusion? Not-so-good with, but worse without!	M	68	10  years	2/23/2004
4	Enlarged Prostate--BPH	At 5 mg, blood pressure was lowered to the extent that I fainted.  My Physician reduced dosage--after trial and error --to 4 mg per day. I have reached an equilibrium where blood pressure is low but not to low and BPH symptoms are acceptable.		M	66	 	12/29/2000
