1	Allergies	After having taken Astepro for many months, stopping b/c of the seasons, and then restarting, I began having horrible acid reflux.  After months of taking different medicines, seeing specialists, and getting pH tested, I found out it was the Astepro causing irritation in my esophagus.		M	32	6  months 2X D	3/4/2013
3	rhinitis	Kidney issues. When I went in for routine blood work, my creatinine (blood protein) was 1.8 (34% kidney function), and that is too high. It indicates that the kidneys are not functioning properly. I quit Astepro, and a week later my creatinine was .6 (107% kidney function). I also had urinary burning, but there was no indication of infection in my blood. But there was some blood in my urine while I was taking Astepro. That cleared up when I quit taking it.	Although Astepro did help clear my stuffy nose, I absolutely recommend AGAINST taking it. I was taking it in conjunction with Nasacort, as recommend by my ENT doc. My dosage of Astepro was 2 puffs in each nostril 2x per day, for a total of 8 puffs. I don't know if it increased my body pains; I have osteoarthritis and have chronic pain anyway. It does taste bad.

3	sinusitis	sleepy, mentally impaired.	While taking the prescribed dose, I lost my purse and a few days later forgot to go to work. It changed my behavior so I reduced the dose. I won't stay on it because I need to be more alert.	F	59	7  days.15 2X D	5/27/2012Email
5	allergies/constant post-nasal drip	mild headaches and some fatigue	Have tried more than a dozen allergy meds and allergy shots, this is the first medication to help.	M	54	20  days 2X D	3/22/2012Email
3	allergic rhinitis	Terrible burning itchiness inside my nose. Did not sneeze, but sure felt like sneezing would have been a relief. The acute itchiness lasted ten or fifteen minutes, and then significantly reduced but did not go away. Also, the taste isn't good, but that didn't bother me all that much.	This is only my second day on this med, but so far I am unhappy with it. I called the doctor's office, and told them that I felt itchy inside my nose, like I had never felt before, and the nurse told me it was just allergic rhinitis. Nothing I could say to her could get her to understand that this was different, but I didn't realize that it was definitely a side effect from the med until the third time I took it. Now, I'm certain.	F	48	2  days.15 x2 2X D	2/17/2012Email
4	Allergies	This medicine really stopped my sneezing and helped out with nasal allergies and the fatigue caused by them.  However, it contains sucralose, which can be a trigger for migraines and GI problems and possible Thymus Gland issues.  See www.livestrong.com/article/85719-dangers-sucralose/.	I don't feel comfortable taking this drug consistently because of the sucralose it contains.  (See side effects)	M	49	1  years2 sp 2 X D 1X D	10/25/2011
1	Nasal Allergies	Very dry sinuses that caused lots of blood in my mucus.	It did nothing to help my allergies. It only made my nose bleed. I don't recommend this at all.	F	31	1  weeks2 sprays 2X D	10/13/2011
4	allergies/sinus problems; migraines	Sleepiness. It gives me a good night's sleep for the first time in a long time, but I'm considering reducing or skipping the morning dose.	Allegra D gave me some relief from allergy symptoms but didn't stop the sinus pressure that was contributing to chronic daily migraine headaches.  Astepro has given me relief from that sinus pressure and I've gone three days without a migraine!  That's a record for me in recent years, so I'm beyond happy with Astepro so far (except for falling asleep in the day time!)	F	60	3  days1-2 sprays 2X D	10/7/2011
3	Vasomotrr/Mixed Rhinitis	One major thing that happens is I get REALLY bad sneazing fits when I reintroduce this medicine into my body, and especially for the first couple days taking it for the first time. To me, that meant that maybe something was working. The sneazing fits are down right scary since they get the heart rate going and last for a couple minutes. I can't tell if the dry throat that I am experiencing due to the medication or if I wasn't on it that things would be much worse. I am a singer, and dry throat is bad, but at least I could sing at 60%, as before using this product I could barely speak.	I can't tell with absolute certainty that this has completely helped me since it's too soon, but one thing is for sure is that it deffinately helped me in general. It dosent seem people know too much about Vasomotor Rhinitis, but most Dr's love to misdiagnose it. They will just think you have alergies, when in reality, your nose is so sensitive, you get bad sinus headaches at any chance in temperature or humidity. I'm happy to know at least what I have so that I could begin treatment and from all the worthless nasanex, nasacort, flonaise, alegra, etc...this medication actually did yeild some results. If you are like me and have bad sinus issues and don't just have alergies I reccomend taking Sinus Buster for the sinus headaches. I tried treating my self on Sinus Buster alone, but then my sinuses totally kicked my but and I needed to step up to Asterpro, which deffinately helped. Again, I'm not totally cured just yet, but maybe I need more time. At least I know something is working for my condition, if only a little bit. Singing is my life, and I'm desparate at this point, and this does help a little.	M	31	1.5  weeks1.5 1X D	5/21/2011Email
4	chronic sinusitis	I'm not sure if this is a side effect.  That is why I'm asking.  I normally do not have even pink cheeks but my cheeks are brilliant red after using this only once.  Has anyone else experienced this?		F	57	1  days205.5 mcg 2X D	5/6/2011
5	sinus headaches, postnasal drip	Some stomach ache, kind of like heartburn, but nearer my belly button. Slept well, but had wild dreams, like being chased by a horse-sized hamster, all night. I was a little dizzy yesterday, but just quit taking Claritin D 2 days ago, which always keeps me up all night long with racing thoughts and pounding heart, so it might have just been lack of sleep catching up with me. It CAN leave a gross taste in your mouth if you take it incorrectly, so it is VERY important that you take it right, because the taste is nasty and doesn't go away for hours. MAKE SURE your head is tilted forward while you're standing up, with your chin to your chest, looking down at your toes. Sniff GENTLY as you QUICKLY push the plunger down (aim it at the back side of your nose). This will create a mist that mostly goes into your nasal cavity. If you push slowly, you'll get a stream of liquid that runs down your throat into your mouth, and if you don't look down (so medicine can settle into your sinuses instead	I will post later when I've had more time on this medicine, but after 3 days, I think it is a miracle. For the first time in MONTHS, I have no hint of sinus headache, and it has almost cleared up my year-round case of post nasal drip. No more disgusting hacking and snorting just to clear my throat to breathe!!! I only take half the recommended dose, because this medicine is similar to astelin, and since Claritin makes my heart race and most of the negative comments regarding astelin talk about heart racing, I didn't want to deal with that. Taking one squirt of the 1.5 mg spray up each nostril once a day hasn't caused any of that, and did relieve the pressure in my head and ears. I feel like an entirely new person, and am just hoping that some of the side effects I have read about Astelin are not going to happen. However, I feel so much better that even if I did have side effects, I would consider taking it, even if not every day.	F	36	3  days1.5 1X D	9/16/2010
5	Post nasal drip	Only bad taste!	Worked very well to stop post nasal drip.  I use it along with nasonex and zyrtec and while taking allergy shots.  It works within 30 minutes and is great!	F	36	3  months.15 1X D	8/20/2010
5	allergies	Bad taste, stange smells	Well worth any side effects. I had been on XZAL and NASACORT for two weeks and allergies were no better. Could tell an amazing difference after 3 doses of Astepro.	F	44	7  days.15 2X D	5/11/2010Email
5	nasal allergies	I think it's making me a little dizzy, but otherwise the results are great!		F	55	30  daysspray 2X D	4/26/2010
