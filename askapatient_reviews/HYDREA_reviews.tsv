5	Essential Thrombothycemia	Light headed at times, occasional mouth sores	I have taken this drug since age 23, it saved my life.  I presented with clots in Hepatic veins in liver and platelet count of 1.3 million.  Now at 600,000 have had doses of 500 daily, 500 alternating with 1000 and now trying 1000 daily with 1500 Sat. and Sun.  Side effects definitely tolerable considering alternative.  Also taking warfarin since diagnosis.	F	42	20  years1000 1X D	2/2/2013Email
4	Essential Thrombocythemia	In the beginning I had exhaustion, dizziness, weakness, nausea, lack of appetite, for a few months ..Long term, skin atrophy, hair thinning, occasional mouth sores, gums receding, lack of the strength I used to have. Weaker immune system.	My doctor said people can do well for 10 years, 6 years ago when I began...  I notice my overall health and energy is less than it used to be. I take 500mg one day and 1000mg the next. I told the Doc I feel like I am taking poison..he said, "yes it is poison for your platelets." (Unfortunately hydrea doesn't travel only to your platelets, it is in your bloodstream)....It was keeping my platelets at a reasonable number, but they have been climbing up over the past 6 months, which means I will need to take a larger dose in the near future.. It is apparent to me, that I am becoming more immune to the current dosage...the alternatives are worse than hydrea...One person in 100,000 get this disease, so there is not much much research being done. In the last year I was put on Pravastatin, and Plavix. (I am allergic to aspirin.) I am thin and don't eat meat, and my diet is fairly healthy. I walk 5 times a week, but have trouble with weight bearing exercise. So we take it a day at a time. It is better than having a stroke or a heart attack from ET. 	F	66	6.5  years500 mg 1X D	12/18/2012Email
4	Essential Thrombocythemia	None noticed	Platelet counts have gone from 2100 to 1100 in 2 months with no noticeable side effects.	F	46	2  months1000 1X D	12/12/2012Email
3	Essential Thrombocythemia	I take my hydroxyurea with 4 crackers and a glass of milk at night. I tried taking it in the morning, but the side effects were much worse, including falling down to my knees.Side effects: cold sores, pits at sides of mouth if high dose.Dizziness  with nausia intermittently throughout the day, fatigue about 1 time per week, down most of the day. I have not experienced hair loss, my heart, lungs, spleen and liver are fine, so far. I do experience reddening of my face, which comes and goes. I experience discomfort and pain in my lower back and around my ribcage, at times. I have cold sores sometimes, and use neosporin to get them to leave, if they are outside my mouth, benzodent if inside.Sometimes I suddenly have itching on my skin, then I use benedryl cream for that.I experience dry mouth a lot, and use mouth moisteners, like cough drops without menthal. I also use butterscotch candies.	I am taking one Prilosec each morning and night with my meals, also taking L-Lysine to prevent or lessen cold sores. I also take echinacea to help my immune system. I am on a good natural multi-vitamin, as well as Vitamin B, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, Vitamin D3 with Calcium. I also eat yogurt two to three times each day. I also drink 1 12oz bottle of Gatorade G2 each day, to help with electrolytes. I have platelet counts that do not stay in the normal zone, but roller coaster all the time. My platelet count could be 350,000 sometimes, or it could be higher, close to 1 million platelets at times. I have to take a dose that will hopefully keep me alive and allow me to have an immune system.	F	67	4  years1000 1X D	11/30/2012Email
4	Myeloproliferative disorder	None. Numbers stay under control now. Platelets were over a million without drug. I also worry about long-term effects of the drug		F	56	10  years500 mg	11/28/2012Email
3	Polycythemia Vera	Initially: night sweats, joint pain, stomach pain, diarrhea, stiffness, extreme fatigue.Now: Fatigue. Am completely exhausted by early afternoon. Used to cycle 30 miles/day and 50 on weekend trip; now I bonk at about 10 miles. Physical and mental exhaustion.	The drug is effective at controlling HCT and platelet count.

5	Essential Thrombocythaemia	Nothing I have really noticed	I also have M.S as well as Essential Thrombocythemia, wouldn't know I was on it, the alternative is much worse, love life make the most of every day.	F	53	3  years 2X D	10/28/2012Email
4	Policythemia Vera	Maybe slight fatigue, itchy legs.	Now 7 years into this illness, I take a total of 5grams a week which keeps my levels within parameters, except Hematies which, at 6.380.000/ul, is slightly above max. Just had a phlebotomy, usually have one every 6 months. This year no itchy legs, Doc says it's because I've been sunbathing every day, something I never used to do. Never had the side effects other users have, maybe I'm just fortunate.	M	66	7  years500mg 1X D	10/20/2012Email
4	Sickle cell anemia (HbSS)	fatigue, deterioration of hip joints, extreme cycles of constipation and diarrhea, extreme weight gain (roughly 30kg or 66lbs), skin darkening, mouth ulcers, joint pain, increased risk of infection	this drug is supposed to substantially improve my longevity and overall quality of life. however, after having been on this medication for 11 years, i'm not sure how well I will be able to manage this for the rest of my life. I'm only 22.	M	22	11  years2000 MG 1X D	6/10/2012Email
5	essential thrombocytosis	Lots! But for the first time in 3 yrs I don't have a pounding headache 24/7.. severe heartburn. Upper GI pain & incredible fatigue.,...but I don't have a headache & to me that's all that matters!		F	50	2  weeks500 mg day	5/1/2012Email
3	JAK-2,  Essential Thrombocythemia	At least once a month I experience such fatigue, dizzyness and nausea that my manager sends me home. I've been alternating the drug 1000mg and 1500mg but this doesn't seems to be helping although my platelet count is stabilised I really don't want to feel like this for the rest of my life :-(		F	43	6  months1500mg	4/16/2012Email
2	polythemia vera	after taking the drug, 5 hrs later intense itchy skin,urination alot, nasaua, taking it on and off  hate the drug. hair thinninghavent worked since taking the drug. had to cut down on smoking.doc says people live a normal life, my life hasnt been normal since taking this drug.		F	56	2  years500mg 1X D	2/20/2012Email
4	Essential Thrombocythemia	Mild pain near the rib cage, fatigue, weight loss.  Currently skin discoloration on hands and feet.  Skin atrophy.	Helped with the platelets.  Was up and down, but in a "good" range. Wish there was another drug I can try.  I am told this is the only drug left.	F	31	4  years500 2X D	1/11/2012Email
3	Essential Thhrombocytheamia	Stomach discomfort and fatigue for first month which subsided later. Just had dose increased from 500/day to 500 one day and 1000 the next as platelet count started to go up again 3 months ago and has continued upwards. Never been below 600 yet.	I Do worry about condition turning into Leukeamia especially as I've started at a younger age than appears typical (42).I also take cholestorol lowering meds, blood thinners and somrthing that makes the platelets slide over one another more easy (Lipitor).  Heamo says the other drugs significantly lower my chances of another stroke.	M	42	10  months500/1000 1X D	12/14/2011Email
2	Essential Thrombocythemia	Very tired, feeling drugged, pain in ribcage, numbness of arms and legs, neurological symptoms (probably got worse because I was on alfa interferon before), very weak, anemia, dificult breathing, in the begining large black bruisings on legs but I was taking 6-8 pills a day! Weight loss (6 kg) and hairloss with bold spots. Back pain, strange spleen sensation and enlarged spleen. In the begining trombophlebitis, putting legs higher then rest of body helped. Muscle pain and very nervous, got better after a few months.	I was also on Anagrelide and Interferon, Interferon was terrible, I had alucinations and thought cars were chasing me...Pain in the bones and very depressed.	F	21	1  years500 3X D	12/8/2011Email
4	Essential Thrombocythemia	Fatigue, aching bones.....especially hips and femurs. Occasionally ankles. Has actually reduced my headaches, kept platelets under control. Diarrhoea .....at least 3 times daily. Weight gain....put on 30kgs quite quickly but have been able to maintain at that weight for last 8yrs.....Specialist said we'll worry when I "can't" put weight on! Gee I love that man!	It's saved my life!!! I tried Peg Interferon.... as part of a drug trial, and was having suicidal thoughts after 13 weeks! I was soooooo sick when diagnosed I tried anything! Hydrea might have it's risks but it has given me life for the last 9yrs and enabled me to watch my children grow up and make me a grandmother!	F	50	9  years1000mg 1X D	10/13/2011Email
1	essential thrombocytosis	The hydrea did lower my platelet counts but at about 2.5 years I developed very rare hydroxyurea dermothapy, causing skin problems and also developed periodic severe itching. Had to  discontinue usage, take cortisone and topically apply clobetasol for skin problems, and after 5 years still have a few skin problems, spleenomegaly and itching is increasing.	This drug very rarely can have pretty severe side effects for your skin. See hydrea dermopathy. For some patients who develop dermopathy, the problem is cured by discontinuing use of hydrea. In my case, after 5 years I still have some symptoms, including skin abnormalities and my big toes are tender on the tips.	M	60	3  years? 1X D	7/12/2011
4	JAK-2, primary essential thrombocyt	Fatigue and loss of energy for the initial three weeks.  That has improved.  Weight gain.	I am very active, ran a half marathon several months ago, cycle approximately 150 miles a week.  I find myself very tired some days with loss of energy.  In spite of being so active, I have gained weight which I can only attribute to the Hydrea.  It has helped finally bring my platelet count down to a normal level therefore I have no choice but to take it but I am concerned about long term effects.	F	49	3  months500 3X D	5/26/2011
3	Essential Thrombocythemia	Experiencing extreme fatigue, not sure if it is the ET or the Hydrea. Mouth ulcers that are very painful.	Having a big problem getting and keeping platelets within the normal range. My hem is constantly adjusting my dosage, I find this extremely frustrating. I've been going for blood tests once a month and to the doctor every 3 months for 2 1/2 years now.  I can't imagine living the rest of my life like this.	F	49	2.5  years500 3X D	4/17/2011Email
4	Essential thrombocythemia	Intermittent but severe fatigue. Dry, itchy skin, rosacea. Constipation.  Occasional nausea or lower leg pain.	Wish I didn't have to take it, but one of the only treatments for ET. Could be worse. Do worry about long term effects, though an oncologist said this drug has been around for a long time with no proven long term danger.	F	31	6  months500 4X D	4/7/2011
2	polycythemia	no side effects to begin with but extreme fatigue at day 12 and extreme claudication at day 12.	Fatigue seems to be common to a lot of modern medications.	M	81	15  days500 1X D	2/14/2011Email
3	essential thrombocytosis	At first, I went through a period of fatigue and loss of appetite. That lasted about 3 months but I don't have a problem with it anymore.  I do, however, have very painful tongue ulcers about every 3 months.  It goes away after I stop taking the medication for a few days but during that time I gargle with baking soda and eat a bunch of yogurt.	For some time, it helped lower my platlets to within reach of normal but I never got there.	M	56	2  years2500 1X D	2/28/2010Email
4	Essential Thrombocythemia	Chronic headaches, full of energy for a period, extreme fatigue the next, very fuzzy head, concentration difficulties, visual disturbances	I worry about the risk of acute leukemia	F	49	16  years90 3X D	2/26/2010Email
4	essential thrombocythemia	redness of the skin, nausea	I think it is a dangerous medicine that can cause leukemia.  I don't like taking any medicine for my condition and wonder why a cause cannot be found for it.  Hydrea only numbs the effects of what is wrong.	F	49	3  years	12/20/2009Email
4	Polycythemia Rubra Vera	Initially, constipation, diarrhea, nausea	Starting to feel better but fatigue is worse. Our support group is http://mpdsupport.org/.  Helped my alot with my MPD	M	58	1  months	12/30/2008
4	ET-PV	nausea when first started - fatigue- chills	Have been taking it for 7 yrs. - dosage has increased over time due to symptons.  Have many concerns.	F	44	7  years	11/18/2008Email
4	PV	LACK OF ENERGY. FULLNESS IN MY HEAD BUT DON'T KNOW IF IT'S CAUSED BY THE PV OR THE HYDREA. A BIT OF A ROLLER COASTER EFFECT AS FAR AS EXERCISE. WORKOUT ONE DAY AND WIPED OUT THE NEXT. SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM AMONG HYDREA USERS.	DIAGNOSED WITH POLYCYTHEMIA VERA IN OCT. OF LAST YEAR. BEEN ON HYDREA FOR TEN MONTHS. STARTED WITH 1500mg DAILY AND AM NOW DOWN TO 500mg DAILY. WILL FIND OUT IF THAT IS ENOUGH IN A FEW WEEKS.	M	57	10  months	7/28/2008Email
4	Polycythemia	I am very active cyclist, over 7,000 miles per year. I have noticed I have less energy, less endurance, dry skin and my knees have starting hurting for the first time in my life.	Taking the Hydrea on a daly basis is better than purging blood every thirty days.	M	54	2  years	3/10/2008Email
4	Essential thrombocythemia	Very little now, except very dry hair and skin, skin has aged very quickly but better that than platlet count through the roof.	Do have concerns about long term effects on appearance, vain though that seems, but more about how much I have to take, currently platlet levels not responding as well as before so dosage increased.	F	49	4  years	2/10/2007Email
5	Blood Disease - Myleoperliferative	I am on so much medication due to other conditions such as Atrial Fibration and Diabetes, I am not sure if I have any side effects.  I had four infarcations to my spline prior to being diagnosed with this blood disease in September 2000.  Since taking this medicine, my red blood cell counts have been normal and no more infarctions.No one will admit if my Atrial Fib is due to my disease but everything seem to happen in September of 2000.  Looking back on my medical records show that I had an elevated red blood cell count since 1997.  At first I lost weight but once my heart medication was changed in May of 2003, I started to gain weight.  I am more that satisfied with Hydrea as comparied to the alternatives that would certainly have been dying from the infarctions.My Oncologist feels that I am a success story and I see him every 6 months.	This drug is very inexpensive and readily available from Pharmacies.	F	67	7  years	2/5/2007Email
5	Polycythemia Vera	No side effects experienced	Slightly worried about having to take this medication for life	M	60	2  years	1/31/2007Email
4	essential thrombocythemia	initially, experienced fatigue for approx. 2 weeks once I started taking it but this has passed. Diarrhoea and occasional nausea. I am concerned about long term usage, however it seems to be the only drug to keep those pesky platelets under control.		F	49	4  years	10/10/2006Email
4	essential thrombocythemia	initially, experienced fatigue for approx. 2 weeks once I started taking it but this has passed. Diarrhoea and occasional nausea and a few mouth ulcers If I "over-do" one day, I find myself quite tired the next day	I am concerned about long term usage, however it seems to be the only drug to keep those pesky platelets under control	F	49	4  years	10/10/2006Email
4	EssentialThrombocythemia,Myleofibro	I'm sometimes easily tired. Other times I have lots of energy. Over all, I feel fine.	Hydrea has brought my platlets down to normal levels. My doctor has tweaked the dosage several times in order to establish and then maintain my blood counts within a proper range. This seems typical, and the tweaking hasn't had any effect on how I feel.	F	72	5  months	10/10/2006Email
4	polycythemia vera	In the beginning, I had some nausea, but at this time, the only side effect is limited energy.	Hydrea keeps my counts under control very well.  I am currently taking 1000 mg per day.  My biggest concern about longterm use is the possibility of flipping from polycythemia to leukemia.  I'm really not THAT concerned, though.  Its not likely that will happen.  I'm just happy to be alive!	F	53	2  years	10/10/2006Email
4	essential thrombocytosis	none yet	It has worked very well to lower my platelts to a normal range, without any side effecs.I am worried about long tern use though as I am only 38.	F	38	4  months	10/9/2006
4	Polycythemia Vera	Nausea is the big one, diareah at times, itchy skin at times, sores on my scalp at times, sometimes mouth sores.	I find that if I take my hydrea through out the day, and drink lots of water, the sideeffects are less. For nausea, I have found that "seabands" for the wrist work great.	F	33	6  days	5/5/2006Email
4	Polycythemia Vera	I notice that I get tired more easily.  One day of increased activity such as shopping, leaves me very tired the next day.	The medication really helped my numbers.  The doctor adjusts the dosage as needed.  I worry about the long term effect also.	F	44	5  years	2/21/2006
4	Myelofibrosis	Fatigue, more or less constant diarrhoea, aching legs, breathlessness.	It has helped ease the pain considerably.	F	52	2.5  months	12/12/2005
4	Polycythemia	Don't know if it is the drug or not, but sometimes achy legs and tiredness.	I have been on the drug for 6 years now and am concerned about long-term effects.	M	53	6  years	11/26/2005Email
4	essential thrombocytosis	tired... headaches... not sure if from hydrea or nexium... been on it almost month.. 1500 mg daily..	would like to know if I can take lower dosage or not at all for sometimes	F	45	1  months	9/24/2005Email
4	essential thrombocytosis	tired.....		F	45	2  weeks	9/4/2005
4	I have a Polycythemia Vera	Not much, but I am concern that I am taking this medicine for a 10 years. Should I change it? Is it posiible to receive a secondary cancer if you take hydrea for a long time?Thank you.Ilia Gulkarov		M	65	10  days	2/12/2005Email
4	for polycythemia vera	legs are achy since taking medicine and more tired	definately helped control all the blood counts.....doctor tweaks the meds when needed but doc is very pleased with the results from drug	M	55	1  days	2/8/2005
4	Polycythemia Vera	none that I know of, maybe some heartburn if I don't take it with something to eat, but I can't say that for sure.		F	40	4  years	2/7/2005
