5	Pregnancy/Antiphosolipid syndrome	mild pain with injections, bruising at site, recently oozing from site	First pregnancy ended at 29 weeks with myself almost dying due to HELLP and PRE-E, son was born extremely small and spent 3 mths in hospital. I am currently 36 weeks pregnant and don't believe that would have happened without Lovenox	F	32	9  months40mg 1X D	3/23/2013
4	PE	Massive hematomas, damage to liver and grossly enlarged pancreas, price is outrageous!!  I have hereditary elevated factor VIII, Coumadin resistant.  Had to go off lovenox due to abn numbers from kidney functions.  I feel like a walking time bomb!!		F	34	4  months120 2X D	11/6/2012Email
1	Blood clot	BLOODY urine for 5 days and almost had kidney failure, ending up in surgery with 2 stents from my kidneys to my bladder!!!!! HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!		F	70	  1X D	8/16/2012
1	My mom was taking it aft knee repla	My mother had Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia AND Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis after 10 doses of Lovenox!  She almost died.  Only 10 reported cases of this in American Medical Journals-only one to a replacement patient-hip-69 years old and she died!  My mother is the only living knee replacement patient to have survived it!  She has been on Arixtra for 4 months.	Even though it is rare-people are allergic to Lovenox/Heparin and if they are it most often is fatal!  Watch for headaches, nausea, vomiting after you start taking it!!!			10  days 1X D	7/12/2012Email
4	Blood clots	Stinging sensation,light bruising. mild headaches. Injecting slowlyeases the pain. Night sweats.		M	51	3  months30mg 2X D	3/19/2012Email
5	FVL, Lupus Anticoag, DVT, Double PE	Slight bruising at some injection site, patient error from clutching skin too tight. Slight taste In mouth while injecting. No other side effects. Warfarin user for 10 years, switched to Lovenox because pt/inr would not stay normal. Was getting blood drawn every week. Since off warfarin not tired all the time and feel better in general.		F	38	2  months180 mg day	2/27/2012
3	pregnant, misscarriages	Intense burning sensation and pain during shot and for several minutes after, don't know how I can do this for 6 months, so far only light headedness followed by shot		F	20	6  months1shot dail	1/25/2012
3	Recurring blood clots and pregnant	Nausea,vomiting,headache,lightheaded,blackout spells, bruising, weakness, bruising at injection site with hematomas, eye sight loss from headaches, hemorrhaging  from female area,nose and throat, chills and couldn't keep warm and blood was way too thin!		F	26	9  months40mg 2X D	1/9/2012Email
2	Dvt,Ovt and pregnancy	Extreme hematomas, pain, and tenderness at the injection site. Have had to receive stitches for severe bleeding at injection site.  Mild nausea and vomiting. I was on arixtra for almost 2 years with no problems, due to not becoming therapeutic on warfarin 6 months prior. Arixtra was perfect for me and the reason I had to switch to lovenox was due to my pregnancy. I have had 3dvts in my legs, and 1 massive dvt on my ovary, all of which while taking warfarin. I would recommend arixtra to anyone currently on lovenox because of less side effects. As I became further along in my pregnancy, pinching skin was harder than ever, and I was allowed other injection sites besides my stomach, but with the same results, horrible hematomas that required stitches. Very disapointed with this drug, mainly because I've seen how blood thinners don't have to interfere with your daily life. For everyone who reads this and is dissatisfied with lovenox, but doesnt know of anything better, ask your doctor about arixtra!		F	28	9  months120mg	1/1/2012Email
4	PE in right lung	Stinging at time of injection and up to 5 minutes afterwards.brusing, some small bleeding at injection site afterwards.	I could not take Warfarin because of the bad headaches, dizzy/foggyness as well as chest pains, muscle aches. Switched to Lovenox 14 days ago and while it's not fun to inject shots 2 times a day, I don't have the same symptoms I had on the Warfarin. I still get the slight headaches once in awhile and a little foggyness at times from the shots.  I also feel bloated from the shots.  Drink a lot of water and the headaches and bloated feeling goes away.  I hope to only be on these shots 3 more months.	F	47	14  days80mg 2X D	11/28/2011Email

4	DVT, factor five warfarin resistant	stinging during and after administering shot.  Some bruising, one bad hematoma.  Very helpful advice on this site on how to administer shot and avoid some of the pain.  Thanks!	I am warfarin resistant so this is my only option.  No bad side effects.  Don't love the shots but can easily deal with them.  I'll be on lovenox for 3 months then not sure.	F	63	30  days80 2X D	10/29/2011
4	Pulmonary Embolism	Stinging sensation during injection and a full minute afterwards.  Bruising.	I'm not a fan of injecting myself twice a day but it has made a world of difference in my life.  I was on Coumadin for 2 1/2 months and could not function I was so fatigued and foggy.  I FINALLY feel like myself again, first time in almost 3 months.	F	37	14  days80 mg 2X D	10/24/2011Email
5	DVT + Coumadin failure and new PE	The nausea I struggled with in the beginning is now just an occasional nuisance. Other than a bruise now and then, I no longer experience any regular side-effects with Lovenox.		F	47	3  months150 1X D	10/11/2011EmailHistory
4	DVT and bilateral PE	Slight bruising at injection site	I had an allergic reaction to coumadin and taking Lovenox is my only option for right now until other drugs are approved for use in DVT cases.  It does not give me any side effects, I just wish it were covered a little more by my insurance.	F	19	9  months40 mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	pregnancy	My wife was put on lovenox during her pregnancy, because she had a blood clot in her leg 20 years earlier.  When she was 7.5 months pregnant, she died of a brain aneurysm.  The doctors are pretty coy about what role the blood thinner played, but I cannot help but think that she would not have internally bled to death without the blood thinners.	Even with the lovenox, my wife had a miscarriage a year before the pregnancy where lovenox participated in her bleeding to death.	F	38	7.5  months35 mg 2X D	9/26/2011
4	DVT, Bitaleral PE, clotting factor	Slight injection site tenderness.  Switched from Coumadin when my hair was becoming brittle and significantly  falling out.  After 3 weeks off Coumadin my hair has stopped falling out and texture is almost back to normal.  I will put up with injections forever in order to keep my hair!

5	postive factor five	Just bruising taking the shot is like breathing now very easy	I feel the lovenox has saved my life..4 blood clots in my right leg PE in right lung..clot in my vena cava now have greenfield filter..Lovenox makes me.feel safe	F	42	10  years100 1X D	8/17/2011Email
5	blood clotting disorder - pregnancy	pain during injection, bruising, occasional knots under injection site	i have not had any additional side effects whatsoever and don't think i was even aware that there were any likely "extra" side effects besides the injection issues.  i took this my entire first pregnancy without complication as well, and was so very grateful for it since it allowed me a successful pregnancy unlike earlier miscarriages.	F	36	9  months40 mg 1X D	8/8/2011
4	Leiden Factor V/Pregnancy	Burning during & after injection.  Some bruising depending on where administered.  Sensitive skin for about an hour after injection.  Some tummy issues, not sure if it is the Lovenox or pregnancy.	So far this isn't the worst thing I have ever been prescribed, but I am not a fan of injecting myself semi-long term.  I am pregnant and found out about half way in I am heterozygous FVL, no previous clots, but family history.  So I was put on purely as a precaution.	F	34	7  days30 MG 2X D	8/5/2011Email
4	DVT during pregnancy	Nausea and diarrhea, bad headaches, bruising and pain at injection sites.	I am thrilled that the pain in my leg is gone (the DVT was extremely painful) but dealing with the side effects stinks.  I feel wiped out, very sick to my stomach, and the headaches sometimes leave me in tears.  I'll have to take this until my pregnancy is over, so it feels like the longest pregnancy ever, but I'm happy to not be in the pain from my leg.	F	34	2  weeks100 mg 2X D	8/1/2011
4	Blood clots after breaking ankle	Weakness, dizziness, nausea (eating makes this better, not worse), headaches	Injecting myself is no fun, but considering that a CT scan had already shown some clots in the lungs, I don't have much choice, as ankle surgery remains a possibility (so no Coumadin -- yet).  As my mother said (regarding her cancer treatment), "it beats the alternative."  Glad to see that others have same symptoms, not all of which are listed by manufacturer.	M	48	9  days70 MG 2X D	7/8/2011Email
4	Blood clots	The first week I felt very dizzy and I got headaches. I felt weak. Now, I`m okay, just a slight sting after the injection and bruising on the stomach.	I hate putting this stuff into my body, before this I was on cumadine and that was no better. Wish everyone good life and strong health who has to take this drug. It`s not easy. Hang in there:)	F	21	1  months60MG 2X D	6/11/2011Email
5	Lupus anticoagulant syndrome	Burning, itching, bruising, lumps at injection site.  I dry the alcohol at the site with a hair dryer before the injection and that seems to help.	9 weeks into a very small dose of estrogen (HRT), I had permanent vision loss due to a central retinal artery occlusion.  Much testing revealed high levels of lupus anticoagulant antibodies.  I fall a lot because I've lost my depth perception and that leads to bruising, but the bruising isn't outrageous on the lovenox.  Supposedly I'll be on the lovenox for life.	F	50	2  months120mg 1X D	5/9/2011Email
3	blood clots	Lumps, black and blue, and itching at injection site, very uncomfortable.		M	64	2  weeks100MG 2X D	4/24/2011Email
3	P.E.-pregnancy	Pain at injection site, painfull burning and irritation of the injection site,tenderness, red rashes,mild bruising,vomiting, loose stools, shakes, dizziness, and head aches,	I was diagnosed with a Pulminary Embolis in September of 2010, I have been on the shots on and off the entire time and befor the pregnancy I was on the cumidin and the lovenox.  Doctors took me off of the cumidin due to it is unsafe for the baby.  I have had miscariages in the past but the doctors didn't do any test to know the cause they just said a force of nature, this is my 7th pregnancy and only 3 living. I am 12 weeks so far and no problems.  I had my miscariages up to my 11th week.  I've got good doctors and looking for the best.	F	26	1  months100 mg 2X D	1/24/2011Email
4	pulmonary embolisms	my husband, who vets his own cattle, administered the shots and did a stellar job. I didn't feel them. Only tiny bruises ocassionally.		F	52	8  days30 mg 2X D	1/18/2011Email
2	Coumadin failure	In the past two months, have been prescribed to take twice daily; stop Coumadin. Further past, have taken on/off when Coumadin has been unsuccessful and/or when preparing for a medical procedure.	Currently, I am having tingling, numbness in my spine, arms and legs, huge hematomas at injection sites, pressure in my lower adbdomen. I feel more uncomfortable with twice daily long term Lovenox than on Coumadin.	F	51	5  years100 mg 2X D	9/29/2010
3	3clots and 1 pe and MTHFR GENE	constant diarrhea yellow bile, have developed osteopenia and have had broken ribs, arm and now L1 2 3 4 5 are messed up. take infusion for osteoprosis doesnt wk. feel like crap all the time. bed ridden lots of the time. thyroid problems, virtigo, grummpy, sad. pissed off. coumidin resestant more pissed. I went all the way to UVA to see a specialist. I''m from tex. cost me tons thought I got answers. she said go back on coumidin sence havent had clot in couple of yrs. ( have trapeze filter)  idea was when inr reached 2.5 I could go off shot and take coumidin inr would only reach 1.1. even on legal highest dose.  Just last week found 2 superficial clots left ankle. but back is killing me can't sit down at all have to stand or lie down. Im wondering that it is the shots, I am so sick of this sometimes just want it all to stop. all the dr.s do is give me more pills like last wk.;pills for pancreas for stool prob. they make me sick. heart rate to high so pills 4 that, makes heart flutter an	saved me at first, now, killing me slowly	F	52	5  years120mg 1X D	5/23/2010Email
4	MTHFR, FACTOR V AND PREGNANT	Just a burning sensation the entire time the drug is being administered.  The needled doesn't hurt.  Just the drug itself.  Minimal bruising (so far).	I found it helps out with minimizing the bruising if you sit down, grab your stomach fat and put the needle in at a 90 degree angle vs. laying down and doing it.I miscarried after 3 months and the oncologist is hoping that this will help.  I knew I had factor V, but didn't know about the other one until he retested me for a bunch.  It's super important you have them check you for multiple blood clotting disorders, especially if you're trying to get pregnant.  Cross you fingers for me :)	F	28	9  months150 MG 1X D	5/9/2010
1	Rheumatoid  Pluracy	Severe burning at injection site followed by a skin rash. Burning continued and rash grew larger and itching began.	I have no history of clots or high blood pressure. After three days of intense burning, rash and itch I refused injections.If you need it take it.  In my case it appears the hospital was pushing lovenox to raise my bill.	M	69	3  days 1X D	5/7/2010
3	Stroke prevention cardiac ablation	I hit 2 threshholds.1) after 4 doses (spaced at 12 hrs.)-chills, nasuea, joint pain,confusion, balance problems. To continue taking I spaced at 18 hrs.beginning w/the fifth dose. 2)at 2 weeks (spaced at 18 hrs.) experienced intense arthritis throughout my body. Have continued with 24 hr spacing.	I also have had bruising, headaches and fatigue. This drug has a half life of 12 hours and stays in an average person's body for 96 hrs.or more. so each additional dose increases the concentration. Spacing more than 12 hrs kept the level from getting toxic for me.	F	63	30  days60 mg 2X D	5/5/2010Email
3	Pulmonary Emboli	Bruising, headache.  But the worst side effect by far, for me was the allergic rash I started getting on the 4th day.  Itchy red rash, worse all over abdomen, spreading to my scalp, legs, arms, crotch...horrible!	The rash went away within two days after stopping Lovenox.  Luckily my INR was in therapeutic range and I will be able to continue on Coumadin only.  My fear is that I will develop another clot...hope I am not allergic to drugs similar to Lovenox(like heparin).  The injections were not pleasant.  But they saved my life as my right lung was not functional due to the pulmonary emboli(multiple blood clots in lung).	F	44	6  days80mg 2X D	4/30/2010
4	Factor V, Pregnancy	Migraines... I wake up every day with a horrible headache, and usually get at least one more during the day. Doc gave me Fiorecet to help and so long as I take that, I don't notice any other side effects.	Since I'm taking this postpartum, there is enough fat in my belly that I don't really feel the injection or burning, though occasionally it will really get my attention.	F	28	6  weeks 1X D	4/27/2010
3	DVT	Headache. Slight redness at injection sites		M	57	5  days80 2X D	4/20/2010
4	splenectomy and blood clot	black and blue, itching, heaviness in legs		F	51	4  years100mg 1X D	4/16/2010
4	Antiphospholipid Syndrome	Bruising, hematomas, soreness until I experimented and became adept at giving myself the shots. Anyone who complains of these things would be wise to experiment and ask several nurses to demonstrate proper technique. I noticed someone here saying things improved for them AFTER they began pinching the skin while giving the injection. No subcutaneous should EVER be given without pinching the site. There's no way to avoid bruising and huge lumps if you aren't pinching the skin at the injection site. Those who complain of the liquid being "painful" need to pinch tighter.  Done correctly, there is virtually no pain associated with this injection unless you happen to hit some nerves.  In this case, pull out and move slightly.	Give the injection slowly. Count to 30 quickly while giving the injection slowly -- very slowly. Always pinch the skin. When finished, hold the needle where it is and count to 5 quickly.  Pull it out a little and count to 10 quickly.  Then slowly remove it the rest of the way.  NEVER rub the injection site BEFORE or AFTER giving yourself the injection.  You'll bruise heavily, get hematomas, and experience pain as a result.  This really should be no big deal. If it is, you're doing it wrong.	F	54	1  years120 mg 2X D	3/27/2010Email
4	MTHFR Pregnancy	burns during injection, lots of bruising & hard knots at injection sites	After losing 4 children during pregnancy, and having 2 successfully with this drug, I think it is a miracle.  Wish they could make it cheaper with less pain and bruising, but that's nothing if it means having living-breathing children.	F	32	10  months30mg 1X D	3/16/2010Email
3	Knee surgery	Some nausea, diarrhea, slight headache, minor sting in the injection site and bruising.	I would rather not take it.  Main thing I feel is like a light case of the flu.	M	42	10  days40 MG 1X D	3/9/2010
4	DVT	Bruising, stinging, headaches	Still do not have a cause for the DVT, which is over 2 feet long. Still testing. Shots are kind of a hassle with school.	F	13	90  days70 MG 2X D	2/8/2010
5	left ovarian thrombosis	bruising, stinging when injecing, some bleeding when injecting, some headaches and grumpiness.	I developed left ovarian thrombosis post-partum and was in the hospital twice. We did a second CT after 30 days and found a significant reduction in size but are continuing the shots twice daily for another 30 days with another CT to make sure that the clot is completely gone.	F	36	40  days	12/21/2009Email
5	Pregnancy	Headaches (cured by walking & eating ice chips), bruising, & hard knots at the injection site	I lost my first child & if I would not have been admitted for a rare blood disorder than I may have lost the present baby due to blood clots; the doctor's found the 2 mutated genes for blood clots and immediately put me on the injection of 70 & I am alive again...I am able to walk for almost an hour, work a full shift and eat.  My fiance administers the shot and yes it does hurt, but I love not having to worry about loosing my son	F	29	3  weeks	10/8/2009
4	DVT 6  years prior to pregnancy	Purple/blue bruising and large hardened lumps at some injection site. Pain when plunger pushed down on syringe and drug released into skin. Slightly more rapid heartbeat 10 mins or so after injection - could be anxiety/paranoia? Tiny bit of bleeding after injecting.	DVT after longhaul flight from Hawaii, to London Heathrow, then Newcastle in close succession, had recently taken birth control pill dianette at time. Now pregnant Lovenox offered as precaution given my history. Instructed to inject on side of thigh, not belly- started treatment at 23 weeks pregnant and will continue until 24 hrs before birth and afterwards also I expect as post=partum DVT just as much as a risk I heard. Concerned about getting an epidural while on Lovenox as I heard this can cause serious bad side effects if the two are combined..any know about this?	F	27	21  days	10/5/2009Email
5	DVT in right leg	Mild bruising at injection sites; burning sensation after injection; lethargic; lack of normal appetite; muscular throbbing/aching in chest and back	I have had two DVTs in the past two years. Currently on coumadin, which I love. No side effects. During my second DVT I was on Lovenox for almost 8 weeks and felt horrible. I am looking to get pregnant in the next year and fearful of the side effects from lovenox again. My dr. recommended Fragmin could be an alternative, but I can't find much about this drug and if it will cause the same side effects as the lovenox.	F	32	8  weeks	10/4/2009Email
3	full hip replacement	Hard to separate from post-surgery anemia, but did have extreme fatigue throughout treatment.	Used ice pack to dull the post stick stinging which is quite noticeable.  Also had headache.	F	60	28  days	9/7/2009
3	Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome	I have been very tired ever since taking the shots.  Irritable and almost short tempered.  I have been very gasy and have had some stomach discomfort.  Black and Blues at point of puncture small lumps at injection site.	I have a rare blood dissorder where the blood clots in my veins.  It is called "Anticardio Phospholipid Syndrome" and is also called "APS"  "Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome".   It is an auto imude disease where the body fightes against itself.   I am currently taking 15mg of coumadin daily as well along with the Lovenox 100mg twice a day.  We are having a difficult time making my blood levels theraputic.I noticed if you ice the area down before and after the needle it hurts much less and the stingy doesn't last as long.	M	33	11  days	8/10/2009Email
4	DVT/ PE/ Rare Blood Disorder	I dont feel anything like myself, low energy, Axienty, cant sleep at night(dont go to bed till about 1 a.m.), sore stomach, the injections hurt because of how thick the liquid is, when you clean the area with the alcohol let the area dry first before injecting, it wont hurt as much.  I am also on Coumadin taking 15mg a day regardless of if I have to give myself shots	Because i have a rare blood disorder (less then 1% of the population have it) i am required to have my INR tested twice a week right now, when its where it should be i dont have to give myself shots, but i find the side effects are more apparent, i have only been off them for a day so far, next week i go back to get my blood tested to see if my INR is still where it should be if not i have to take shots, Im taking Coumadin as well and it seems that when im not on the shots the symptoms are worse.  I am a Lifer of these two drugs, something im going to look into is a Homeopathy item called ARNICA MOTANA, its made from a plant and when taken oraly it CAN help with blood clots and work with Coumadin, im going to take what i found to my Doctor and get his take on it. Who knows if it will help but what the hell right?	M	21	3  weeks	7/21/2009
4	left ovarian thrombosis	large bruising, hard knots, stinging during and after injection	was admitted to hospital postpartum with pain in my left side due to left ovarian thrombosis, was in hospital for about 7days on antibiotics and heperan, sent me home on 100mg of lovenox every 12 hrs for 8 days also taking warfarin daily for the next 6 months	F	30	8  days	7/9/2009Email
4	Factor V Leiden, PE right lung	tiny bruises around injection site, constant diarrhea, HEADACHES that seem to never go away, burning/stinging after medicine is injected, hot/cold flashes, an itch as the medicine moves through my body, mood swings, fatigue, skin is very sensitive.	i went to the ER complaining of chest pains and difficulty breathing. once tested (xray, ekg, cat scan) they diagnosed me with a pulmonary embolism. they assured me it was treatable and that we had caught it in time. they told me if i had waited 2 more days, i would have died. at 17, thats a scary thought. so i have been on lovenox shots for almost 1 month and i do not enjoy the injections, but i dont really mind them. they are tiny needles and dont really cause that much pain.	F	17	1  months	4/19/2009
4	blood clots due to APS	bruising, hard lumps,	I had a blood clot in my artery behind my knee in my right leg.  Dr. removed it and put me on Coumidan.  About 3 wks later developed blood clot same place.  Dr said he was going to take my leg off 2 inches above my knee.  I said I wanted a second opinion.  Went to Baylor in Dallas.  Diagnosed with APS.  Dr put me on Lovenox injections every 12 hrs.  Took blood clot out and took vein from left leg and placed in right leg...also had to have my big toe amputated, due to lack of circulation.  Haven't had ANY problems since.  I feel VERY blessed!  Feel free to contact me!	F	53	7  years	3/28/2009Email
5	FVL MTHFR pregnancy	occasional pain/stinging at injection site, bruising, nausea when upping the dose	This was a relatively easy way to treat my blood clotting disorder during pregnancy/postpartum.  No monitoring needed, which was nice, although it is very expensive.  No problems with delivery - stopped the shots 24 hours before an induction and was on them again twelve hours after delivery.	F	29	10  months	3/8/2009
4	Pre-electrical cardioversion	Just prior to cardioversion because of my atrial fibrillation, the doctor discovered that my INR was too low, so I received two Lovenox injections in my stomach, quite painful and caused bruising, and then I had to give myself injections afterwards at home, too.  Nothing I would ever want to do for long.  Had a trans-esophageal echocardiogram prior to the cardioversion and somehow my tongue was traumatized (it looked like I may have badly bitten it somehow, but I was under Twilight anaesthetic) and due to the thinned blood, I bled profusely INTO my tongue and the next day after I got home it looked like a killer whale filling up the whole inside of my mouth (my tongue was black and blue and HUGELY swollen).  I went to the ER and the doctor said this was life-threatening, because the swelling tongue could block my airway.  However, it stopped short of that.  It was a horrible thing to experience, very frightening and prevented me from eating any solid food (there was no room in my mouth	I downgraded the score to a 4 because even though it did exactly what it was supposed to do, I definitely didn't like the idea of having to inject myself with it.  And it leaves bad bruises, but they do heal.	M	61	2  days	2/21/2009Email
5	Postpartum DVT	I don't know if it was encouraged but became mildly depressed as well as postpartum anxiety which I am still experiencing.  I was on 60 mg twice a day, I experienced some severe bruising as well as hard fluid collections under the skin (those took several months to subside.)	If I choose to have another child I will probably be on lovenox the entire pregnancy.	F	33	12  weeks	2/8/2009
4	ENORMOUS DVT IN LEFT LEG/PREGNANCY	Help!!!   Does anyone get anxious when taking this drug? I don't have tolerance for ignorant people and I'm getting shopping cart rage. When I was on this drug two years ago I felt this way but I wasnt sure if it was due to giving birth and having the large DVT.  Now that Im on the drug again (so that I can have another child), Im feeling the same symptoms.  Im not sure if Ill be able to handle this drug much longer!		F	29	3  weeks	2/3/2009
5	DVT right calf	EXPENSIVE and pain at injection site for a few minutes. That's about it. Am currently transitioning over to Coumadin and am having major side effects from that. Lovenox is such an easier alternative, I will miss it, my insurance won't cover it anymore ;(	Been on it for 6 months, 1st few weeks really seemed like a pain and literally was painful. But I got used to it quickly and doesn't bother me at all now. Gives  me great relief to not have to worry about clots anymore.	F	38	6  months	1/29/2009
4	Factor Five Leiden/pregnancy/PE	Fatigue, shortness of breath, tired, headaches that can last days or a few minutes, anxiety, irritability, sweating	I got multiple pe's in my right lung in 06. Was on lovenox for a few months after, then switched to coumadin. I preferred the coumadin over the shots, but hated the restrictions on my diet and weekly monitoring. Being on lovenox is great because of the lack of monitoring and diet control. But the pain can be unbearable. I am back on lovenox due to being pregnant and with my belly getting bigger I am freaking out as to where to do it next?!? I tried a different method of injection where you clear out bubble, tighten the skin (with index and thumb) and inject slowly the only pain afterwards was the injection site, unlike many other times having pain from the medication or hematomas etc. So far seems easier to find good spots this way.. hopefully it will continue for the next 5 months that is all I have left to be on this. Yeah!	F	30	5  months	1/1/2009
3	Pregnancy	Low energy, extremely awful sinus congestion-my nasal passages have been swollen since I started treatment, along with nose constantly running-can't breath through nose at all(I've never had a cold this bad before), always tired since taking, mild to painful headaches, don't feel well for a while after taking, rapid heartbeat and anxiety shortly after taking, very light brusing to none at injection site-painful to touch the next day sometimes though and sometimes not. Freezing a washcloth and holding to site before giving shot and after helps with pain and brusing.	I lost a baby in the past at full term, they think being due to a gene mutation with my blood clotting. So to be careful I don't lose this one they have put me on Lovenox 40mg everyday, on top of a baby asprin of 81mg a day, 3 doses of calcium and vitamin d a day, and my prenatal vitamins. The shot doesn't hurt going in just the medicine hurts-like a bee sting-going in. Sometimes I have no brusing and sometimes only light brusing, sometimes it never hurts to touch the area the day after and other times it does. This is my third pregnancy and it has been the best pregnancy I have ever had-I always felt great and wonderful. After starting these shots though I feel tired, no energy, mild to painful headaches, don't feel well for hours after taking shot, rapid heartbeat after taking shot, anxiety after taking shot, but worst of all my nasal passages are swollen and blocking so I can't breath at all-on top of my nose constantly running-severe mucus. I could handle all these side effects and	F	22	5  days	12/23/2008Email

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
