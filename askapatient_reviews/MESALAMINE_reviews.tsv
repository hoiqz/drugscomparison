5	Crohn's Disease	Hair thinning but not enough to worry	It's completely helped to keep me in remission for seven years. I take it with another medicine as well but we've finally got close to the right amount to keep my Crohn's in check. It's surprising. I can't drink dairy sometimes because I'll get a stomach ache, but I feel like I don't even have a disease.	F	19	7  years 2X D	5/11/2013
3	Crohn's	Annoying headaches... Bad hair loss that I am not sure is related... Bloating still		F	27	30  days4 2X D	1/4/2013
5	Crohn's Disease	Occasional Headaches	Was originally put on 2x500mg 3 times a day which seemed to control my Crohns, a few years later i was decreased to 2x500mg 2 times a day. It seems to control my Crohns, i still have the odd flare up but it is managable. Seem to have increased flare ups when eating salad type foods and dressing (sauces).

2	Crohn's	Hair loss, but not sure if it's the Pentasa.	I have been taking this drug for about 1.5 years now.  This was the only drug I was on for a few months and when I was having no improvement, my Dr. threw in some Entocort.  The Entocort really helped but when I tried to wean from the Entocort, my symptoms returned.  This gives me the impression that the Pentasa was doing nothing to help my Crohn's.  My Dr. is going to take me off of it and try something new.	F	32	1.5  years4 pills 2X D	3/2/2011
2	Crohn's disease	Kidney stone	I took it for years with no noticeable therapeutic effect.  I stopped it when I found it was promoting the growth of kidney stones.  I now take LDN at night and Omega-3 fish oil with meals and it seems to help.  Pentasa and 5-ASA drugs are on-label for colitis and are sometimes prescribed off-label for Crohn's disease.  They were never helpful for my Crohn's.	M	67	15  years	6/13/2009Email

5	Indeterminate Colitis	No side effects	I have been on this drug since 2001.  After 7 years of keeping me in remission, it has just now started to not work on my disease, and I have to look for alternative medications.  I have been completely happy with Pentasa, and would recommend it to anyone that needs to go on a maintenance therapy for IBD!  The approval of the 500 mg pill was a God send!!!

5	Crohn's Disease	None!	After I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease.  I was immediately placed on 2g/3x a day at a weight of about 100 pounds.  My dad also has the disease, and he was aware of the many possible side effects of prednisone.  Instead I just waited it out for the pain to go away.  Soon it did, and as long as I remember to take it, my Crohn's remains in remission, unless I make a big diet mistake.  Eating little to nothing one day except maybe a bit of candy will sometimes set off a minor flare.  I cannot explain enough how stress is also a tremendous factor.  I tried Asacol, but had bloody stools, that was about it, so we switched back to pentasa. At 150lbs, I currently take 4g/2x a day.  Bottom Line:This drug has worked wonders for me.	M	16	3  years	8/4/2008
3	Ulcerative colitis	Itching all over	Loved the medicine.  It was working... but after taking for 3 days, I started itching all over.  The side effects listed by the drug company said, rash with itching was a serious side effect and to let your doctor know.  I didn't have the rash, but couldn't stop itching everywhere for several days.  So I called doctor and he said he didnt have any other patients with that reaction, but to go ahead and stop the Pentasa and go back on Asacol.	F	44	7  days	7/21/2008
4	Crohn's Disease	None.	I started taking Pentasa on a *compassion-use* basis while it was still in clinical trials.  In addition to Pentasa, I was on a drug regimen that added up to taking about 54 pills a day of various prescriptions at various times.  Eventually, I stopped taking the 6MP, the prednisone (except for extreme flare-ups), the flagyl, etc., and have stayed the course taking only Pentasa, 4,000 mgs / day.  Yes, they're horse pills.  And I have gotten over it, a long, long time ago.  I appreciate it very much.	F	48	18  years	4/20/2008
2	Crohn's			M	49	2  months	3/27/2008
2	Crohn's	None that i noticed	It was a lot of pills to have to take, and i don't think they did any good for me.... I was on it as soon as I was diagnosed, and for about the first 4 months with Entecort (bad spelling?), and as soon as I was weened off the entecort, my cramping came back (but not the 'big D').  while I liked the lack of side effects, the number of pills and the little it seemed to do for me made it not worth it.	F	34	6  months	1/2/2008
5	ulcerative colitis	None	The best drug for colitis that I've used.  Asacol made me constipated and all the sulfa drugs made me burn after five minutes in the sun.  I've been on Pentasa for two years and it's been effective the whole time.	M	46	2  years	9/3/2007
3	Crohn's disease	headaches (but they went away after a few weeks)	Pentasa is just plain out annoying, you have to take so many pills, so often, and the pills are monstrosities.  Plus, I didn't really notice if it did anything.  My dosage had to be upped so many times and it was never 100% successful for me.	F	18	1.5  years	4/17/2007Email
3	crohn's	None	I currently take 4g/day alongside Entocort and Immuran so its difficult to know if it does anything. It did keep me in remission for just over 2 months though inbetween before my latest flare when i started immuran	F	21	1  years	2/16/2007
4	Crohn's Disease	None.	It's hard to say if this drug does anything at all, but I'm not going to stop taking it and see what happens. It certainly is not strong enough to stop a flare, but I think it can help a person maintain remission once they get there. The only negative to the drug is how big the pills are -- taking eight giant pills every day gets a bit tedious.	F	26	11  months	1/30/2007
2	Crohn's Disease	Headache	No benefits from Pentasa.  No changes from conditions.  Still had same problems with pain and inflammation as when I started.	M	44	6  months	12/5/2006
4	Crohns disease	None that I can definitely attribute to Pentasa.  Also taking Prevacid. Somewhat less physically active and have gained a little weight.  But when you go from 15+ bowel movements a  day to two, life is good!  	Remembering to take all those pills is tricky.  Its easiest to put them in a pill dispenser and you can see if you missed any, but the notion of carrying around a container labeled AM, Noon, PM and Night is psychologically disheartening.  Have to get over it!	F	67	33  months	10/28/2006
2	ulcerative colitis	sevrere hair loss after a monthof takeing 8 tablets a day 500mg each of pentassa	ive been taking pentasa for a month and noticed a lot of hair loss doctor told me to stop taking it 2 weeks after and still seeing alot of hair loss im panicking can anyone please tell me how long this will go on for as im desperate	F	29	31  days	10/6/2006
5	Crohn's Disease	I've had some hair loss but I don't know if it's Pentasa or something else.	Pentasa works great.  I was in so much pain before I got put on it and within 2 days I was pain free and eating whatever I want.  True it's expensive (300/mo without insurance) and it is a hassle.. I accidentally skipped a dose 2 days ago and really paid for it yesterday.. but it's amazing and I'm so glad that I'm on it.	M	20	5  weeks	7/15/2006Email
4	Crohn's disease	none	i took pentasa along with prednisone, entocort, and flagyl to manage my CD when it was active. have been in remission for over 2 years but still take pentasa (1000mg a day) on a regular basis just for maintainance. only complaint is the distribution shortage that plagued most of 2005. it was very frustrating to not be able to get my prescriptions refilled for most of the year without ordering them up to 2 months in advance in order to have a refill ready when i ran out. the fact that this drug typically only comes in 250mg-500mg doses bugs me b/c most ppl i know who take it have to take 4-16 pills a day to handle their CD. when i was taking 16 a day it made me very angry that i couldn't get it refilled regularly b/c of this distribution problem. i had to get creative and order from pharmacies in other states when none of the ones in my area could fill even a small script to getme through the week.	F	31	4  years	4/21/2006
5	Ulcerative Colitis	None	Pentasa has been the only drug to put me in remission. For me, it has worked better than even steroids did. I take 8 500mg tablets a day, I was on 6 a day previously but it didnt work quite as well. Now I very rarely have problems and feel like a normal person again.	F	18	1  years	1/22/2006Email
4		severe headaches at first. No other side effects	At first I had severe headaches but it was due to the serzone (depression) that I was taking. When I stopped the serzone headaches went away. Hate to take 12 pills a day but if I miss too many doses I atart to feel it.	F	42	2  years	11/9/2005
3	UC	I don't think this makes any difference to my condition at all. Have taken it with and without steroids and Imuran, and have taken Imuran without Pentasa, and I get the feeling someone's getting their money's worth out of me somewhere down the line. Saying that, have only ever been on relatively low doses compared to some people here - another question for the doc!	Make sure you drink lots of water when taking - when I was first swapped from asacol to pentasa I made the mistake of not taking a huge glass with it, and was in agony!	F	23	18  days	9/30/2005Email
2	Crohn's	No side effects.	I do not enjoy taking 16 pills a day, especially because I don't see any positive effects with my Crohn's.	F	25	6  months	9/22/2005
3	Crohn's Disease	Rapid heart beat.  Talked to my doc and apparently there is a VERY rare side effect that has something to do with the heart.  I stopped taking it for two months and then tried again with no side effects.	Did not help prevent flares.  I had to take 16 pills a day, but I understand that there is a new 500mg pill that has come out, so that might make it easier.	F	28	15  months	6/28/2005
3	crohns disease	none known	it's not enough to take alone. you have to constanly watch your diet. I also take Imuran as well	F	25	2  years	6/6/2005
4	ulcerative colitis	When I first started taking it I experienced incredible fatigue.  This effect went away within one week.  I began noticing improvements in my symptoms of colitis immediately, and never felt that the flare was getting worse.	Pentasa has definitely improved my quality of life.  It took about four months for a severe flare to settle down, but I felt it was working right from the beginning. (This after reacting poorly to Asacol after being fine on it for one year)  I take 4X(500mgs) a day.	F	47	4  years	4/6/2005
3	Crohn's			M	22	 	2/24/2005
4	Crohn's Disease	None	Was instructed by doctor to take to prevent my Crohn's Disease from reactivating after surgery; so far it's remained inactive for 19 months since surgery.	M	54	19  months	2/8/2005
4	chrons	none		F	17	5  times	1/29/2005
1	crohns disease	I took this for 1 week and had to stop because of severe headache and nausea. A few days after I stopped I experienced internal bleeding.		M	42	7  days	7/21/2004
3	Crohn's Disease	None	It is mildly effective for me. I still get flare ups while on it. Other drugs are more effective, like Remicade & 6MP (purenithol). Taking 16 pills a day can be annoying and it's easy to miss a dose. The only reason I continue to take it is beacause it's cheap under my insurance plan. I'm hoping to stop as soon as I get better results from something else.	M	46	10  years	6/11/2004
4	Crohn's	Knee inflamation, sore neck, fatigue, chest pain, runny/stuffy nose - most of these started at 2 weeks and lasted about 10 days. Now I just seem to need a little more sleep then usual.	Made an immediate difference in my symptoms but it didn't get rid of all of them.  I take all my pills with food and water.  I take the last ones 3 hours before bedtime or I have hours of cold sweats during the night.	M	27	45  days	5/7/2004
4	Crohn's Disease	A bit of hair loss	It seems to keep Crohn's in check...	F	36	1  years	4/16/2004
4	CROHN'S	NONE	You have to take up to 16 pills a day, so that can be cumbersome. Worth taking for long-term maintenance therapy but usually is accompanied by other meds too.	M	35	2  years	12/22/2003
4	Crohn's disease	None whatsover, surprisingly since I have been sensitive to so many drugs.	When mild active disease began again after a 20 year remission I was put on 16 Pentasa a day. Within a year no inflammation could be found by colonoscopy. However, I got brave and eventually dropped down to 8 a day. Two years later mild inflammation was found at the ileocecal valve plus a hyperplastic polyp in the cecum. I'm back up to 16 Pentasa a day, plus am now taking Imuran and started on Entocort EC. Once the fecal calprotectin test verifies I am in total remission I will not make the same mistake twice.	F	61	4  years	11/29/2003
5	crohn's disease	My major side affect is acne.If taken late at night it causes nightmares.	The US government should have approved Pentasa years ago. Pentasa was prescribed in Canada for ten years before the FDA in the US approved it. My father suffered for 14 years when he could have been treated sooner. Pentasa is much cheaper if you order from Canada on line, my insurance even pays me back for part of it. I like TheMedicineShoppe.com. As far as I'm concerned having to take 16 pills a day is a drag but I'd take 116 pills a day to feel as good as I do today. Pentasa makes life better.	M	20	3  years	10/6/2003
5	Ulcerative Colitis	Tolerated very well except when I increased the dosage to the max during a flare-up, then I developed severe joint pain, swelling and inflammation in my hands.  This disappeared when I stopped taking it for a few weeks, and since then I have resumed the usual dosage and it is working well.		F	51	4  years	9/11/2003

5	Crohns Disease	None	This medicine worked wonderfully for me. When I found out I would be taking 16 pills a day I was annoyed, but when I realized how great the results were I didn't care how many I had to take since I felt so good. The only reason I had to stop taking it was the cost problem (about $355 a month)	F	19	4  months	3/11/2003
3	Chrones	No side effects		M	40	1  years	1/28/2003
3	Chrones	No side effects	They need to make a stronger dose so I do not half to take so many pills.	M	40	1  years	1/28/2003
3	Crohn's disease	No side effects	I hate that I have to take 16 pills a day of this drug, that is the worst part. I dont know if it is helping or not, but Im told Ill be taking it for the rest of my life or until there is a cure for Crohn's.	F	29	1.5  years	1/25/2003
2	Crohn's disease	I did not experience any side effects.	I just don't think this drug works for me.  It doesn't seem to do much and I think it's a waste of effort, considering that the dosages are high and it has to be taken often.	F	27	1.5  years	1/21/2003
