3	It's in the Vicodin my Dr. gave me.	After taking Vicodin for three years, it and any product containing Tylenol/acetaminophen now gives me a perfect 10 migraine which only ibuprofen will make go away. Before this happened it used to be the best pain reliever for me.	My Dr. had to switch me to ms contin due to my reaction now.Short term duration of this medication is the ONLY way it should be taken in my opinion.	M	51	3  years325 3X D	11/23/2012
3	Shoulder Pain	I received a headache about 30mins after taking.Also a very weak tingle in my arms, like they were falling asleep.I still have shoulder pain =/	I think I will stick to  ibuprofen when it comes to needing a pain med.Since I have never had a problem with that medication.I also notice when taking Tylenol I end up having to take more then I want to take. With ibuprofen I take 2-4pills instead of 6-8 of Tylenol. =(	F	27	1  days6pills@500 1X D	8/17/2012Email
1	headache	Paranoia	Anandamide reuptake inhibitor`?? Terrible addictive and gateway to hell. Maybe.	M	30	2  days1 1X D	1/2/2012
3	Headaches.	None.	Tylenol is good for a headache. One pill never does anything, two eases the pain, but it's never 100%. To get rid of the pain completely (for severe pain) I take ibuprofen.	F	19	14  years	11/28/2009
2	Headaches	None	Either im immune to this or it isn't very effective. I've taken it many times and always have to take more than recommended for anything to happen. It also takes a long time to kick in. Waste.	F	19	4  years	8/23/2009
1	Pain	None	Seems to be more of a mental drug, where it won't relieve pain but make you think it is working. If you are in pain, try something else.	M	19	 	8/16/2009
3	Headache.	It helped my headache but it too forever to kick in. I only got mild releif. I didn't expereience many side effects from this drug.	Good mild pain killer.	M	18	2  days	4/19/2009
3	arthritis	I get mild headaches and feel sleepy. I also feel lethargic.None of these side effects is listed anywhere, but I have been experiencing them repeatedly.	It helps somewhat with my arthritis pain. Aleve worked really well for me, but I cannot take it (and other NSAIDs) because of stomach problems and other side effects, so I am glad I can take Tylenol sometimes. But if I don't want to fall asleep, I just put up with the pain until it bothers me too much ... There don't seem to be any good choices for me.	F	57	3  years	2/26/2009
2	Pain (post-op)	Taking Tylenol elevates my blood pressure significantly.  I have experienced this numerous times.  Most recently hospital personnel tended not to believe me and administered Tylenol for pain after my aortic valve replacement.  They became believers!	I know Tylenol works very effectively for most people.  Unfortunately I and I am sure others have suffered significant side effects which seem to be met with doubt and denial  by well meaning health care professionals. My side effect is significantly elevated blood pressure.	M	63	1  days	12/13/2008Email
1	headache or pain	When this drug wears off, I am always very depressed.  I cannot take it.  Switched to ibuprofen with no problems.	Kind of scarey that this drug guarantees depression in me when it wears off!	F	46	10  times	11/30/2008
4	Absessed Tooth	None	I have taken tylenol over the years for recurring headaches. Now I am taking 500 tylenol and 600 motrin for absessed tooth. Works great until bedtime. At bedtime I take 2 tylenol pms with motrin and if I take it early enough I actually get some sleep	F	29	5  years	8/25/2008
4	Myalgias	None		F	40	40  years	8/13/2008
1	headache	None	Pain did not go away at all. Tylenol has never worked for me and I have tried it many times over the years when ibuprofen was not available.  Aspirin does not work either and medications that are pain relievers that have aspirin or acetaminophen (Excedrin) in them do not work. Opiates that contain either of these analgesics have limited efficacy for me as well; I usually have to double the dosage to receive any relief.	F	35	 	6/7/2008
1	pain, headaches	Itching, like bugs crawling under my shin.	I've tried Tylenol over the years off and on, usually when I can't take anything else; however, Tylenol has never had any beneficial effect on aleving my pain.  The last 2 times I used it, I ended up with an allergic reaction ~ severe itching all over my body (no hives, just itching) that lasted for about 6 hours.	F	42	 	4/12/2008
4						 	1/16/2008
3	headaches	After taking tylenol regularly for 30 years I have developed a severe case of both diverticulitis and ulcerative colitis. My diet never included the foods normally associated with the cause of theses conditions, and I hardly ever drink and have always led a clean, healthy life style.		F		30  years	10/11/2007
2	headache and shoulder pain		Tylenol has never helped me with pain issues.  Regular aspirin works wonders for me. However, never take too often. Always check with the pharmacist for any drug reactions.	F	60	55  years	10/9/2007
4	dental pain and arthritis	headache, including pounding in head, throbbing of neck and temporal blood vessel (left side) and sometimes rapid heartbeat and/or palpitations, all these occuring only as the drug wears out of my system.	If I absolutely must take an over the counter analgesic, this is the one I reach for. It is especially effective on dental pain, and causes fewer side effects than NSAIDS. However, it sometimes gives me a headache as it wears off, and symptoms that suggest it may be raising my blood pressure, so I only take it when abosolutely necessary. In addition, it is supposed to be hard on the kidneys, although I have no information that it has negatively affected me in that way.	F	55	5  years	6/2/2007
4		rarely, nausea		M	60	 	4/11/2007
4	migrane	rash - don't know if it was caused by tylenol or not.	Usually works fine but wears off and the migrane returns.	F	40	2  days	2/9/2007
5	hadeache	n/a	works for me	F	40	100  weeks	7/17/2006
4	fever	severe farting, but worked great otherwise		F	25	53  months	7/17/2006
5	fever	None	Worked like a charm!  In fact, every 4 hours when it started to wear off I could tell.  Too bad the package recommends you taking it only every 6 hours.  That seemed just long enough where my fever would start to return.  But after I took my dose the fever dropped like a rock.  Amazing medicine and so benign.  Oh, I don't really drink but if you do, quit while you take this.  The combo is a big no-no.	M	31	20  times	4/13/2006Email
3	Arthritis in knees	Severe itching of legs		F	59	10  years	1/25/2006
1	post-surgery pain	After taking Extra Strength Tylenol for about 4 days I had extreme dizzyness, the feeling of extreme hypertension (I already take meds for high blood pressure, so I know what hypertension feels like), and a clammy, sweaty/warm feeling.	I took just slightly less than the maximum dose.  I cannot completely verify that the Tylenol caused my problems, but my physician recommended that I immediately stop taking it.  I felt better within two days after ceasing to use Tylenol.	F	42	4  days	9/10/2005
1	Headache	Racing heart, worse headache.	I even took no asprin tylenol and had problems breathing shortly after taking it. I will stick with advil and works better for me.	F	32	1  days	9/6/2005
4	pain & headaches	hives& stomach discomfort (like bloating and pressure).		F	30	1  days	7/24/2005
1	Headache	Worse headache! Dizziness.	Does not help at all!	M	45	1  days	2/3/2005
2	pain	none	ACTIONIS VERY SHORT	M	77	2  months	1/24/2003

5			headache, muscular pains	M	30	1  days	8/7/2002
1	pain	none	doesnt do anything,even if I take 20 or more at once ive tried many dosages it does nothing for me.	M	24	 	5/27/2002Email
3	pain		It did not help		57	7  days	4/28/2002
1	various pains	none	This drug has no effect, as in, I can't tell that it does anything for any kind of pain, from mild to severe.  Placebo. Time taken varied.	F	36	 	3/17/2001
