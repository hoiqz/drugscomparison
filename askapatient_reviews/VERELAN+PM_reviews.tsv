2	Migraines	Very rapid and continual weight gain.	I have taken Topamax for several years.  The drug seemed to quit working, and my doctor was not comfortable increasing the dosage.  He decided to add verapamil.  Topamax is known for weight loss.  Needless to say I was very surprised at how quickly I gained weight (20 pounds in a year) while taking verapamil in addition to a medication that causes weight loss!  I am quite certain it is related to the medication since I am a very health conscious individual.  Aside from the weight gain, verapamil has been mostly effective at relieving my migraines, with only a few breakthrough headaches.	F	28	1  years	6/28/2008

1	migraine preventative	SEVERE constipation, bloated abdomen, weight gain, night sweats	a 300 mg dosage and did not seem to contribute to helping my migraines lessen. The constipation was unbearable. I took colace and dulcolax every night. I went off the Verelan a couple of weeks ago and have already lost ten pounds and my stomach is almost flat again. I dont know for sure if the night sweats are related to verelan, but I havent had them since I quit this drug.	F	39	8  months	10/17/2005
