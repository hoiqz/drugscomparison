3	yes	This was prescribed for dental infection.I felt as if I had strep throat. I was tired and sleepy. I felt rundown and achy.Infection is gone, however.		F	44	10  days500 4X D	2/11/2011
4	Wisdom tooth infection	Severe headaches and pressure behind my eyes. Muscle pain in neck and lower back. Loss of all energy. Confusion and general innability to 'think straight'.	I was prescribed this drug along with amoxicillin for my infection. They certianly worked in clearing the infection, however I was on a 5 day course and only managed 3 days. Have been off it now for two and though they're lessening, the side effects are still there. I feel like I'm getting the flu - ALL THE TIME! I would definately ask for an alternative to this drug and wouldn't take it again unless there wasn't one.	F	29	5  days	4/19/2006
