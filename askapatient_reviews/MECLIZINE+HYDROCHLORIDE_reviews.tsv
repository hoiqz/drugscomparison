5	Motion Sickness on a boat	Not sure why, but coincidental that after I came home from my boat trip, I have been experiencing a sensitive tongue!!! Very weird, but my tongue is red, sore, tingily, and taste buds a little affected. Its been 3 days now and still symptoms. I think because I took chewed the swallable tablets, I had no water, so I just chewed them. My kids took it too, but they seem to be ok. I also gave a little to my grandson & seems like he acted excited at first, but then he was knocked out for 14 hours after. Scary...The medicine did work well!!! Wish I had it on the way to the island, we were vomiting. We took it as Dramamine Less Drowsy, but we did get drowsy alot later in the days, after taking 2 pills.

4	Motion sickness/Migraine/Vertigo	Sleepiness, dizziness, and sometimes even nausea, but it almost always worked at relieving my nausea.	I've always gotten motion sick easily, but about a year agoI began feeling off-balance all the time and started having migraines. I was having bad nausea almost daily. Meclizine saved my life. At 25mg/day to day and a half, I'm usually good. It does make me dizzy, especially if I take it before bed. It works better for me in the morning, but you do have to adjust to the tiredness. It would make me dizzy, but I didn't care about it because the nausea was gone. Occasionally, it seemed to make me sick, but I still use it when neededIt also saved my life on a cruise when I got extremely motion sick. I could not hold down even a little water, and thought I was going to die. The ship gave me 50 mg and I was cured in 45 min.	M	42	8  months	1/8/2010
5	Motion Sickness	The only side effect I had was being drowsy.  This side effect went away after 2-3 weeks.  I have not had any other side effects since I started this Medication.	I now take 1 25MG tablet twice daily and seems to help just fine!	M	27	3  years	6/26/2006
5	vertigo, dizziness, spinning	I didn't have any side effects that I can recall.	I took it after I suffered a skull fracture, petrious ridge fracture & torn dura. I couldn't lie on my back or look up without a spinning feeling.  The meclizine took it away as long as it took to heal.  I'm now off it and healed.	F	27	3  months	9/26/2005
