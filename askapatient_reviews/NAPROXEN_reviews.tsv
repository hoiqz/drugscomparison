1	Arthritis in hands and feet(age 40)	Severe dizziness which hit suddenly on Day 4 today (I won't be taking any more). Slight blurring of vision when reading computer screen or print, but it's hard to tell if it's just that I feel like I'm on a merry-go-round and want to get OFF! I feel mildly nauseous but am so dizzy that I cannot function... just have to sit still (and ask everyone not to move too much as anything that moves/makes a noise seems to make me worse). I had the same reaction to Mobic/Meloxicam, another NSAID, which also gave me tinnitus. The tinnitus (ringing in ears) is starting to kick in with Naproxen too now.	I was so desperate for this to work as my arthritis pain is interferring with my ability to cope with the demands of 4 kids and being a teacher, plus the fact that we're going overseas on a holiday soon.  The side effects/dizziness are completely incapacitating.	F	41	4  days 1X D	4/29/2013Email

3	Shoulder pain	stomach burning (when I took the medication), possibly gastric problems(after 2.5 years), increase in alertness	You shouldn't take it long term, it may cause gastric problems. The medication worked well but had some serious (long term use) side effects. I always took the medication with lots of food, otherwise it made my stomach burn. During the first couple of months I took the medication twice a day. Then I started taking it once a day. After 1-1.5 years I took the medication as needed (every 3-5 days). I am not 100% sure my gastric problems were caused by the medication, but they probably were.	F	27	2.5  years 1X D	8/4/2012
1	Knee pain (supposed sprain.)	Heart racing, dizzy/lightheaded, confusion, nausea, decreased concentration ability, paranoid (slightly),------------After two doses i felt like i was going to have a nervous breakdown. I consider myself allergic to the medication because of the extreme amount of my reaction.		F	18	2  days30mg	7/20/2012
1	Back pain	Took my first dose after my lunch half an hour later violently vomiting never ever would I take this again soo not worth it		F	22	1  days500 mg	5/1/2012
3	Wisdom tooth Infection	Drowsiness, Dizziness, Anxiety, Heart Racing, Nausea, Vomiting, Lightheadedness	I took this as it was prescribed for my husband for his tooth infection to relieve pain and inflammation before his dental visit. I should have eaten a little more, but I took 1 500mg tablet in the morning with 2 pieces of toast and some orange juice. Within 20 minutes I felt "high", and I knew something was not right. It did work for the pain, but it was not worth it. My heart started to race, my extremities felt cold, and I generally felt dizzy/lightheaded. I managed to finish getting ready for work. I then began to feel sick to my stomach, and vomited. I was kind of relieved as I was hoping I threw up most of the Naproxen. I drank some water, and I vomited again! A lot more this time. I didn't mind as I knew this would help me feel normal faster. I went to work and got through the day somehow. About 7 hours later I felt a lot better, and almost normal again. The pain returned with a vengeance! Overall I probably would not take this medication again. If I did I would take 250mg with a LOT OF FOOD. Unfortunately, I got the short end of the stick with the side effects. At least I didn't have stomach bleeding... that would have scared me to death.	F	26	1  days500 1X D	8/23/2011Email
5	osteoarthritis	took naproxen,500mg per day for many years with no side effects at all. I called them my "keep me going" pills.They were very effective...for releiving arthritis pain - although a new hip 8 yrs ago and a replacement knee 3 yrs ago helped somewhat.....	Recent stomach pains were diagnosed as mild gastritis due to too much naproxen and cessation of the drug was recommended....now diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and on steroids ie prednisolone which is working well though only taking it for three weeks or so....still playing golf and bowls though - Thank God.....	M	72	 	10/13/2009
4	Costochondritis	Acid reflux	Had to take omneprazole at the same time as the naproxen gave me really bad acid reflux.  It did make a difference though and well worth using.	F		6  weeks	11/12/2008
2	plantar fasciitis	Gas, BAD constipation.	It did not work.  It just gave me more uncomfortable symptons, like constipation.  Thank goodness for Metamucil, because eating fiber did not help.  I took 500mg twice a day I think.	F	46	2  weeks	6/5/2008
3	Herniated Disks in Neck	Stomach discomfort, constant hunger	Helped somewhat but not nearly enough.	F	38	30  days	11/12/2007
2	shoulder joint pain	slightly blurry vision and fuzzy kind of feeling	Has not helped the pain at all.  I cannot take Flexeril because it makes me very nervous.	F	60	10  days	9/26/2007
5	osteo arthritus	I was a bit dizzy when first starting, but, this passed in about a week.	Works great -- I take 500mg twice a day. As a generic, it's about $10 per 100 at Costco -- one of the better drug deals in the US.	M	49	1.5  years	8/13/2007
1	Knee pain	Upset stomach, heart racing and hurting, and nausea.	I was taking this because I get extreme knee pain when squatting or crouching. Well it didn't do anything for the pain and has made me feel awful.	M	25	1  days	7/28/2007
1	Neck pain	UPSET STOMACH, drowsiness	This pill made me extremely sick. I was throwing up for a few hours after I took it....with food as directed....and the last time or two I was throwing up blood. I cannot believe that this pill made me so sick. Stopped taking it and the stomach pain remained for a few days as a dull burning sensation everytime I ate. Little did I know that this pill is known to cause bleeding in the stomach, intentines, ect.	F	24	5  days	7/2/2007
5	Inflammation of chest muscles	Severe stomach pain, unusual hunger and slight constipation.	Naproxen got rid of the chest pain very well, but causedme severe stomach pain and an unusual urge to eat, as well as slight constipation.	M	23	5  days	5/4/2007
2						 	4/13/2007
4	ARTHRITIS	SO FAR NONE!  I JUST STARTED.  THIS IS MY SECOND DAY.		F	75	2  days	4/12/2007
5	arthritis in hips and thighs	no side effects	very effective, use the 500mg one a day	M	76	 	3/20/2007
5	low back pain	None	This definitely works - especially in conjunction with a muscle relaxer like Flexeril.	M	53	10  days	11/23/2006
1	Shoulder pain, then back pain	Hives	I cannot take this medication.  The first time I took it, for shoulder pain, it did nothing for the pain and caused me to itch.  The second time I took it, for back pain, again it did nothing for the pain and I broke out in hives.  From what I've read, inflammation doesn't really happen, it's just something the doctors are blaiming pain on when they don't know what causes it, especially chronic pain.	M	26	2  months	10/13/2005
4	back pain	none	I took this medication for back pain, turns out it's great for headaches too.	F	45	6  months	2/9/2005
2	PAIN	SICK TO STOMACH	COULD NOT TAKE IT	F	32	7  days	12/4/2003
4	Muscle pain, and tension	Blurred vision, but could have been from my other medication.	Really helped in taking away the majority of the pain.	M	25	6  days	1/8/2003
