1	HBP	Palpitations,Headaches,Impotence	Took 20mg daily from 1999-2007.Had frequent palpitations,docs said don't worry,they'll go away.Finally demanded a new med-Diovan 160.Took that from 2007-12 and had periodic impotence.Asked to go back to Lotensin and within 3 weeks the skipped heart beats are back and now the impotence has also occurred.Plus a continuous headache and extreme fatigue.I'm a long distance runner and this stuff makes me want to stop any exercise.I'm switching back to Diovan which is the lesser of these 2 evils.

3	bp	tired at first	slowly reducing bp	M	41	40  days50 1X D	2/17/2011
1	HBP	Dizziness resulting in falling down frequently breaking both hips and wrist in three incidents.	Should never have been prescribed in the first place.  BP limts currently in practice are set by the drug companies to sell product.	F	68	2  years10 mg 1X D	2/7/2011
2	HBP	On 10mg, cough, ringing in ears, heart pounding at night.	When I cut it to 5mg, cough better but not as successful with BP. Ringing persisted, and heart pounding. Will probably try something else.	F	74	3  weeks5 1X D	3/28/2010
2	high blood pressure	cough every night as soon as I lie in bed, decreased sex drive and erectile disfunction after a year of taking the drug		M	37	2  years10 1X D	2/17/2010
4	high blood pressure		Worked very well for controlling blood pressure with no side effects.	F	44	13  years	7/31/2009Email
3	Hypertension	None.	Added 5 mg Benazepril to my Beta blocker therapy about a month ago.  BP still not under good control so probably will have to go up on the dose. I did not experience the "ACE Inhibitor cough", but have experienced transient arrhythmias.	F	54	40  days	3/16/2009
4	Moderate HBP	mild dizziness, ringing in ears, some sinus/ear issues where I could hear my voice/heart in my left ear, which drives me nuts.	Initially on a higher dose, but lost weight and so experienced dizzy spells.  Dose was lowered so dizziness is rare, though I do still have the ear problems.	F	47	 	1/13/2009
1	hypertension	I took this drug (20mg) the first day and had dizzines and hallucinations so I stopped - a few days later I tried again and was really dizzy - I finally blacked out and then discontinued this drug.	I have changed to other meds to control my bp - but the dizziness never left completely...	F	40	5  days	10/29/2008
1	HBP	10mg, not a good drug, tired all the time, sex drive has been nil, constant cough after about 1 month, stomach pains, gas,	switched to diovan, diovan is worse! looking for natural alt's.	M	30	6  months	8/3/2007Email
3	HBP	Switched from Lotrel because of muscle cramps in back and legs.No more cramps. Occasional feeling of needing to cough but goesaway after 15 seconds. Worried that if I increase to 15 or 20mgthe cough will be a permanent side-effect.	Taking 10mg that's not controlling BP as well as the Lotrel soprobably need to add another 5mg until I can get up to the 20mgtablet or take the 10mg tablet twice/day. Benazepril is supposedto lower cholesterol & triglicdes 13-18% so hope helps that too.	M	50	25  days	4/10/2007
2	hbp	Severe upset stomach, nausea. Put in hospital for 3 days with pancreatitis.		M	40	3  months	2/9/2007

5	high blood pressure	None unless drink alcohol, then leg cramps which can be alleviated with 500 mg potassium (daily requirement is 3500 mg). Single incident of puffy lips, again caused by drinking red wine. Have been taking this drug nine (!) years with no side effects. Started 5mg daily, raised to 5 mg twice a day, then 10 mg, now 10 mg twice a day.		M	77	9  years	6/19/2006
2	High blood pressure	headaches and rapid pounding heartbeat that I could hear when I laid down at night. Sometimes my heart would add or skip a beat, I am not sure which....	I have now switched to another drug.	F	53	2  months	5/2/2006
