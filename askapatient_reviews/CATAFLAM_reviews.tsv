				F M	 	 	    
3	Rotor cuff strain	Stomach pains, gass, dry mouth and drowsiness. Wonder if arm rest wouldn't have delivered same result without the need to take drug		M	41	6  days100mg	1/15/2013
1	pmdd (really bad pms)	Dry mouth.	Go buy candy. It's cheaper and have the same effect on pain. I take it with 2 propain (40 mg each) at a time, or 2 mypaid forte (Ibuprofen 	400 mg Paracetamol 	325 mg each) (Don't do this!!!) and it don't work for more than an hour.

1	toe swelling	rectal bleeding, collapse. Emergency admission to the hospital	I would never recommend this drug to anyone. It is not worth the chance of GI hemmorage which is what I experienced.	M	60	2  days50 2X D	2/21/2011
1	torn rotator cuff	rectal bleeding/collitis	No symptoms of GI distress BEFORE Cataflam but 4 days on it and I ended up in the ER and hospitilized.....My drs dismissed Cataflam as the reason yet my discharge papers have NSAIDS" listed under patient allergies.?...	F	47	4  days	4/13/2009
2	fibromyalgia, cervical arthritis	none	was given this to replace ibuprofen (possible sun sensitivity developed with ibu) but it doesn't relieve any pain for me or reduce inflammation.	F	46	2  days	6/25/2007
5	Sciatica, Arthritis, Endometriosis	None, unless too much is taken too close together, then it can cause gassy abdominal cramping.	It is the BEST pain reliever I have ever been prescribed and I will never do without it!  I happen to have Endometriosis that has attached to "everything" in the backside, including my Sciatic nerve.  Sciatic Endo is rarely seen, but they found it in me.  I do Restorative Yoga postures to get myself loosened up every day, but keep the Cataflam handy as nothing works better for the pain, unless I have an extremely bad time where I have to take a Demerol with it (rarely).  However, I have noticed in the "patient info" they give with my Rx that now warnings of NSAID's causing heart attacks and strokes are written where they were not before when I started this Rx.  The best dose for me (per my doctor) is 2 pills to get in your system, then 1 every 8 hours afterward.  Luckily, I only need this a few days a week at the most, here & there.  I highly recommend this especially for lower lumbar arthritis and to women for dysmennorhea....it will do the trick!	F	45	10  years	6/23/2007
1		Cataflam Linked to Stevens Johnson Syndrome		M	29	 	6/30/2006
5	Dysmenorrhea	Side effects are some drowsiness and some dry mouth.  Can take it on an empty stomach with no problem.  The drowsiness is nice and helps me sleep, as well.  Overall an excellent drug that works better than any other NSAID I've tried!	I was surprised to find that this drug noticeably lowers my pain level after about 45 minutes.   I still have to take it in combo with a stronger pain reliever, but it's just a good drug for aches and pains.  Better than things like Vioxx and OTC stuff, for sure.	F	28	1  months	5/21/2006
5	osteoarthritis of the knee	Absolutely none!	I was originally taking 150mg per day, but cut it to 100mg because the lesser dose seemed to work as well. My internist had urged me to take Vioxx, Celebrx and Bextra (at different times, of course), but the relief I experienced was not as dramatic as the Cataflam. My orthopaedic surgeon prescribes the Cataflam. It has a slight effect on my blood pressure, but, since my pressure is usually low, that is not considered a health risk.	F	67	8  years	4/7/2005Email
5	chronic pain	Lower gut pain, diahrrea.	This is the only NSAID I've ever taken that gave me discernable relief within 90 minutes of taking it. Gastrointestinal problems were due largely to my taking the drug too close together, or after having consumed large amounts of alcohol. 	M	40	5  years	11/21/2002Email
