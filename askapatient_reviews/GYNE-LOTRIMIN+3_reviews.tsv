1	GYNE-LOTRIMIN7	HORRIBLE, DOESN'T WORK, INCREASES BURNING AND ITCHINESS		F	17	7  days 1X D	12/11/2010
1	thrush infection	Intense itching burning on application, then hives and very red inflamed skin inside vagina and on vulva.	I used this cream as a teenager but obviously have developed an intense allergy to it for some reason.  I had to have a long bath to wash out the product but in 24 hours the allergic reaction had subsided.  When I wasn't allergic to it it worked ok.	F	40	1  days	12/26/2009
1	Yeast infection	Burning, redness, swelling, irritation.  This is worse than the yeast infection.	Never again...I'll stick with Monistat or store brand.	F	34	3  days	4/12/2007
5	Vaginal yeast infection	None.  Great product.	This product consistently works well for me and doesn't cause the HORRIBLE burning sensation that I get from the competitor brand "Monistat."	F	41	 	7/22/2006
3	yeast infection	minor irritation.		M	29	 	2/12/2006
