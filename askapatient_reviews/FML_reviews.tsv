3	eye infection	Pretty gross taste in the back of my throat, made me sick to my stomach	About 10 minutes after putting these drops in my eye I got this strong bitter taste in the back of my throat. Tastes like soap and makes my stomach and head hurt. Taking this 4 times a day for a week is going to make me sick. I hope it works.	F	23	1  days0.1% 4X D	8/4/2011Email
5		I am taking the generic drops;  I have never noticed any metallic taste.  Since it is a steroid, I am wondering if it has prevented me from losing the weight I gained a year ago from taking neurontin for nerve-endings pain of shingles.	Taking for anti-rejection after corneal transplant.	F	68	22  months0.1% 1X D	7/28/2011
3	infection in both corneas	Bad taste in my mouth	I took my first dose of this today and about 20 minutes or so after my mouth tasted funny. I looked it up online to see if it was the drops that caused this and i believe it is. ALmost tastes like I have gotten a bit of pefume or soap in my mouth... yucky. Very bitter and stuck in my mouth badly. Just took my second dose a little while ago and the taste is back. I see I am not the only one.	F	24	1  days1DRP p/eye 4X D	7/21/2011
3	allergic conjunctivitis	TERRIBLE taste in the back of my throat about 5 minutes after administering the drops.  Skin irritation/burning around my eyes.		F	30	3  weeks1 drop 2X D	1/29/2011
4	Dry Eye	I may just have eye twitching for no apparent reason however, since I started these drops 3 weeks ago... my right eye has been twitching non stop.	Agree with other user... the taste is pretty terrible.  I've never realized just how connected my eyes are with my mouth until these drops!	F	26	3  weeks1 drop 3X D	3/30/2010
3	Scratch on Cornea	Horrible taste in back of throat 5 to 10 minutes after using.	The medicine helped my eye to not hurt and burn from the corneal scratch, but the taste that it caused in my throat made it hard to take.  I realize that most eye drops cause a taste in your thoat, but this one is almost enough to make you sick at your stomach!	F	27	1  days	2/3/2009
