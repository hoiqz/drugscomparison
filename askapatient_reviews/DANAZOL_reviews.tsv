4	Endometriosis	no menstruation, occasional to frequent spotting, occasional random cramps, possible slight weight gain in midsection (or am i just getting older?)	I am also on Yaz, where I take only the pills with the hormones (pink pills) and just throw away the placebos (white pills) and start the next month's pack.  I started this  at the same time as Danazol, so it is difficult to decipher what effects are from which drug... but overall I am very happy with my current drug situation.  I was on Lupron for a year after my initial diagnosis and first surgery - it was HORRIBLE.  I gained almost 20 lbs and had crazy hot flashes all the time.  Went off Lupron, was not on anything for 3 years, and my periods were much shorter than they had been before, and I'd usually only have cramps for 1 day, managable through advil.  Then they found an 8 cm mass doing an mri for something else, and I had surgery to remove the mass and my left ovary, which had been consumed by endometrial tissue.  I am taking Danazol and Yaz now - *the spotting is better/less frequent if I take the drugs at almost exactly the same time every day and night.  I might have had a sl	F	30	6  days	9/26/2007

5	fybrocystic breast disease.	Excessive hair growth in unwanted parts, shrinkage in breast size.	I have taken 100mg og Danazol almost everyday for 15 years (well over the recomended time) but I couldn't live without it.My breast pain was so severe I couldn't roll over in bed or even walk around without being in agony, so the good things far out way the bad, it changed my life !!

5	Endometriosis	Oily skin, acne, voice change, increased "bad cholesterol" & decreased "good cholesterol", muscle cramps.	It worked wonders for the endometriosis pain without causing any really bothersome side effects (except for debilitating muscle cramps during the first 4 months of use). No mood swings or sleep disturbances as with many other hormonal treatments. If my voice hadn't started to sound like a man's and my cholesterol levels hadn't become unhealthy I would most definetely have continued taking it. Bit of a bummer: pain returned almost immediately after discontinuing use. I was using a very low dose: 300 mg per day.	F	36	18  months	11/1/2005
