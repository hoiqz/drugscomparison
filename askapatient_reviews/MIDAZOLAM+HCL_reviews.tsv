5	several surgical procedures	i've had over a dozen surgeries and every time midazolam was used...it relaxed me so much and helped out a great deal!		F	21	1  daysnot sure	4/9/2013Email
1	partial thyroid lobectomy	total amnesia after surgical procedure	Had very bad results from this surgery. PONV, bronchspasms, you name it. Suffered a paralysed vocal chord but didn't remember anything at all post surgery. Only found out about the drug later. All day in Post Anesthesia Care Unit and I remember nothing. NEVER AGAIN!	F	72	  1X D	9/4/2012
5	Pre-surgery	Euphoria, slight loss of motor control	I was given this medication intravenously once before surgery and I must say I was highly impressed.  Within thirty seconds I felt high as a kite - much more so than the times I had taken Xanax.  This drug made me emotionally calm yet I was more physically in control than the one time I took 10 mg of Valium before surgery.  I am shocked to see all these negative reviews of this medication.  When it kicked in my first thought was "Wow! Now THIS is what I am talking about."  I had no negative side effects either.	M	23	1  daysunknown 1X D	6/23/2012
1		Cataract	Panic, trembling, tachycardia. Felt weird and unsettled for weeks after.	The emotions were bizarre and frightening. Not an anxiety reducer at all.	M	67	1  times 1X AN	2/22/2012
1	Unknown!	Given to me prior to a minor surgery, my memory of the events is intermittent. What I recall is barely being able to move or speak, and not being happy about it.	Fuzzy memory, slow thinking, mood swings, not at all my normal self for almost 3 weeks afterward. I learned of the Versed after questioning my dr.  and getting a hard copy of my record.

1	anesthesia induction?	Amnesia, anxiety, distrust, anger, flashbacks	I wasn't warned about amnesia like others posting. Was told it would "relax" me. I told them I didn't really need anything to relax, but got the shot anyway. It didn't help me AT ALL, in fact I am still upset and angry weeks later. Maybe some people like paying a professional (so called) to just mistreat them. No thanks. I changed doctors, and no one will ever give me anything to "relax" me again. Bad drug for me, and wasn't told about effects.	F	56	 2 1X D	7/22/2011Email
1	pre colonoscopy	Anger, depression, memory issues, unable to return to work the next day.	Was flat out told I'd be awake and responsive, not "out".  Was not told of the amnesia.  I was shocked and then angry when the process was complete and I had no recall.	M	50	1  timesunknown 1X AN	7/9/2011
1	colonoscopy	Prolonged amnesia, confusion, fear	Requested to be awake, amnesia was never mentioned, woke up terrified, confused, and angry, felt like hours of my life were missing, procedure itself only lasted 15 minutes.  I feel so betrayed by my doctor.  If it is truly given for the patient's benefit, it would be explained. The real problems  begin after the patients get home, and then they don't care, won't return your calls, deny there are any problems with the drug.  Hundreds of us know better.  Shame on the medical profession.	F	51	1  days5MG 1X H	6/25/2011
1	not sure: it was prior to surgery	immediate:amnesia. for weeks after:, anxiety, fear, nightmares,flashbacks, now at six months:finally anger.	This was a very scary experience for me. Like others, I was told it was "to relax" me. I was on a gurney, in a hospital gown, with an IV in my left arm running antibiotocs in a preop area surrounded by strangers. I cannot forget the smirk on the face of the woman that injected it into my IV. "Amnesia" was never mentioned. For weeks I had panic attacks and still cannot go for my follow up check up because of the nightmares and fear.  This drug took away my ability to remember anything for about 8 hours except severe pain, wanting to escape, and feeling like I was helpless because I couldn't move. This memory comes in waves, without warning.I could never recommend this drug to any one. They may as well have hit me on the head with a hammer: I really hope any one reading this post will be better informed than I was.I also hope the stinkers that do this get their pants sued off.

1	Inguinal Hernia	Totally blindsided by the amnesia part, was not told anything, I didn't even know anything was in the IV. I was in the holding area and instantly it was 90 minutes later and I was in recovery. It was mentally like being slammed up against a wall. Very jarring and I am still angry months later.	Let's see: a drug with the main purpose of causing amnesia. It is not a pain killer. Too bad if you go through hell, you won't remember to complain about it.I wasn't supposed to be having general anesthesia but to me it might as well have been.	M	40	1  times2 1X O	4/24/2011
1	colonoscopy	Numerous. I went from my usual calm couldn't-care-less to half-PANIC. There was an odd feeling that the drug actually forced TENSION on me. Breathing became laborious and  I felt I had to work at inhaling. I became restless and agitated. For weeks afterward I was slow at everything, memory was shaky. I had odd relapse episodes where my tension and anxiety would suddenly climb like a rocket and I would be shaken up for 15 minutes or so. 	I would love to see the world's supply destroyed so that nobody ever experiences what I did. Sign me up for the job. Judging from some of these "5" ratings, looks like there's a bunch of medical people trying to defend their precious drug. This drug should never be used for any procedure.	M	47	1  times2 1X AN	3/17/2011
1	Alleged "Anxiety"	Blackout	Nobody said a word about blacking out for hours.  Was told it was "liquid Valium."  That's about as complete a lie as I have ever heard.  I woke up strapped down.  They said I was strapped because I had a "reaction" to one of their drugs.  At no time did they admit that it was their "liquid Valium."   I've had valium before and it was nothing like this drug.  NOTHING!  I am angry and ashamed, neurotic about any more "minor" procedures where medical people lie and sneak a nasty drug like this into a person.  Rot in Hell you dingbats.  Unbelievable what passes for medicine these days.	M	36	1  times? 1X AN	3/3/2011
1	rotator cuff surgery	Groggy stupid feeling, major depression, anxiety, crying jags and feeling of hopelessness. DO NOT GET AMNESIA!!!	I have had Versed many times as you can tell and each time the amnesia didn't work and I was left in agony, unable to move and screaming in pain while my nurses laughed and said "you won't remember this honey" The last 2 times I have begged not to have it and they agreed. They lied and just gave me MORE! Last Wednesday I finally got them to agree to give me general anesthetic so that I could avoid Versed. I even wrote NO VERSED on my arm where they put the IV. They said OK, but when they got the IV running, they argued with me over Versed and gave it to me anyway! I still have not returned to work... I WORK in a Dr.s office and he won't have Versed given to him! So depressed that I can't do anything but cry. Thanks Versed and all those people in the hospital.	F	52	8  times2? 1X H	2/5/2011
1	endoscopy	Actually CAUSED anxiety when I was calm to start with, also dizziness, fear, and agitation; developed into rage, fear of falling asleep, and then deep depression when I couldn't figure out what happened to me, and the doctor & nurse evaded my questions and were COMPLETELY uncaring and cold to me	Something must be wrong with this drug if medical people are sneaky and forceful about using it, without explaining it to patients. There is almost universal lack of informed consent regarding its use. WHY ???	F	50	1  days 1X D	12/31/2010Email
1	ansethesia for same day surgery	Panic, breathing difficulties, scared both me and the doctors.	Highly recommend you stay away from it. Bad drug!	F	55	  1X D	11/30/2010
1	pre-op hernia repair	Plenty. I'm normally not afraid of surgery. It scared the hell out of me. My husband said I tried to get up and leave. I nearly fell since I had no coordination. Lasting memory problems. Vertigo. Weird semi-panic episodes during the day, nightmarish dreams at night.  Feeling unrefreshed after eight hours sleep for months afterward. 	Sorry I didn't Google this beforehand, but I didn't know this drug was being used until my husband called and asked. We had no idea.Add me to the list of people who were never told about the amnesia. This is a lie of omission and it angers me because it is deliberate.	F	44	1  times 1X AN	11/6/2010
1	Prior to Hip Replacement Surgery	I was not anxious prior to the surgery but my doctor ordered the versed added to the IV anyway. Why bother to ask if you're going to just walk all over me anyway?? Within minutes I felt a bizarre disconnect with reality. I was not sure why  I was there and began asking to leave.	In the future I will demand that this drug not be used on me!	M	52	1  times 1X D	10/26/2010
1	Upper GI endoscopy	I  had memory problems and cognitive difficulties for  months after the procedure. I had a second procedure three years later and asked to not have this of drug but it was administered anyway. The second time the side effects were even worse. I cannot in good conscience recommend this drug as the risk of side effects is too great.	I recommend against having this drug under any circumstances. The amnesia and other mental effects can linger in some people.  Versed is not a pain killer - it is used to cause amnesia and compliance. You will still feel the pain but you will not remember it, which is not the same thing as not experiencing the pain at all. I have found articles suggesting implicit memories remain.	M	51	2  times2mg 1X AN	10/13/2010
1	don't know	Blackout, anxiety and rage afterward	I was very upset about not remembering what happened to me.  The hospital told me it was "normal" to have a complete blackout of events at the hospital.  They refused to tell me why.  Imagine my shock when I watched an old "Law and Order" rerun and their Doc was talking about "Dazzle."  That's when I understood what those sneaky so and so's did to me.  No wonder I'm nervous, upset and angry.  Nobody ever mentioned this drug at any time, nor did I give permission for any drug of this kind.  They just snuck it in the IV and it was supposed to be antibiotics.  I wish I could have them all arrested for assault.	F	32	1  times 1X O	9/3/2010
1	set broken wrist	This was the second time I broke a wrist. I was not in pain, but just very uncomfortable. I was GLAD when they went to set it. But then the idiots, for no reason, decided to hit me with Versed (Midazolam). I went from a fairly calm, neutral state to downright terrified. In my mind, logically, I had no reason to be upset. It was like the drug FORCED me to become unstable. I do not drink or use drugs, maybe it only works on experienced "users".	I had a broken wrist when I was 7. They set it quickly and quite painlessly using no drugs at all. I was scared at the time, but would not have been if I knew how simple it was going to be. With the Versed (Midazolam), the situation is reversed. I will RUN to the nearest exit if I even know Versed is in the same hospital as me.	M	28	1  times?? 1X D	8/24/2010
1	outpatient surgery	Confusion, hostility and docility.  Long term chronic anxiety and PTSD ensued.  Took years to recover my mental processes.	Don't ever let anybody near you with this drug if you value your brain.  This stuff causes chemically induced Altzheimers if you are LUCKY!  Otherwise destroys your brain and personality for a time, and sometimes a long time.  Don't buy the line that it's for "relaxation."  It actually knocks you on your a**, but the control that it gives medical people and the ability to hide or mask the abuse they will subject you to is the real reason for using this drug.  It's unethical, immoral and pure patient abuse to inject anybody with this drug, especially without informed consent, just the "relaxation" line.	M	42	1  times7 2X H	8/20/2010
1	surgery -- D&C	had a panic episode later that day, some mild hallucinations, then felt disoriented for the next couple of days.		F	54	1  days	6/8/2005
