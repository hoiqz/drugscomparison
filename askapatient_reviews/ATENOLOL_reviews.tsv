4	Tachycardia	I'm not sure if it caused depressive symptoms or lowered libido, as I have had depression before taking Atenolol.	I fell into major depression characterized mostly by anhedonia/emotional numbness/loss of libido/apathy, so I was tried on a number of "stimulating" antidepressants. On the last antidepressant I was tried on, Vivactil (a tricyclic NRI), I noticed intolerable dizziness and rapid heart rate. My pulse was 120-130bpm at rest. My physician gave me a prescription for Atenolol 25mg/day. It seemed to keep things under control and lowered my heart rate to around 90-100bpm (which was not nearly as uncomfortable). I noticed that it seemed to wear off in the late hours and that excessive caffeine would cause my pulse to raise to uncomfortable levels even while taking Atenolol. Weaning off of this medication is very hard, and there is rebound effects. I have tried weaning off because I have heard alot about it causing low libido, apathy, lethargy, etc. This is unacceptable, and exactly what I am trying to TREAT. Right now I am at 12.5mg of Atenolol/day and am off of the Vivactil. My pulse is in the mid 80's. I am going to try to wean off of it over a 2 month period.	M	20	4  months25 MG 1X D	2/20/2013
1		There appeared to be no side effects	It is now known to raise blood/glucose levels.  It is also claimed to cause diabetes (google "Atenolol diabetes").  No longer reccommended by the experts.	M	70	35  years50 1X D	8/22/2012Email
3	Hypertension	I am feeling absolutely exhausted. Does this wear off in time??	It is the only med which has brought down my high BP, 180/70 down to 115/60 (roughly) but not sure if I can handle the constant fatigue. Have tried all sorts of meds and combinations and nothing else has worked apart from some which caused really bad side effects that were intolerable.	F	60	2  weeks50mg 1X D	8/1/2012Email
1	High heart rate	HORRIBLE. 3 YRS AGO I HAD A PANIC ATTACK THAT LASTED 2 DAYS, WITH HEART RATE 127 BPM. I WAS PRESCRIBED ATENOLOL BUT 50 MG WORE OFF, SO I NOW TAKE TWICE A DAY. AT 38, I FEEL LIKE I'M 80!! TOO TIRED TO DO ANYTHING, SO DEPRESSED, NO EMOTION, ANGINA, HAIR LOSS, DRY SKIN, THE WORST PART IS WEIGHT GAIN. I WAS 137 LBS FOR YEARS AFTER HAVING MY DAUGHTERS. SINCE 3 YRS OF TAKING ATENOLOL, I'M NOW 163 LBS! NO AMOUNT OF EXERCISE OR DIET HELPS. I JUST CONTINUE TO GAIN. BETA BLOCKERS SLOW THE METABOLISM SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BURN CALORIES! EVERY TIME I TRY TO DECREASE MY DOSE, I CAN SEE THE WATER WEIGHT ALSO DECREASING. MY DIURETIC ALSO DOES NOT HELP ME LOSE. THE ONLY THING THIS DRUG HELPED IS THE PANIC ATTACKS AND HEARTRATE, AND FAIRLY NORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE. BUT NOW MY DOC WANTS ME OFF THIS DRUG, AND TO REPLACE IT WITH MAGNESIUM. MAGNESIUM IS A NATURAL BETA BLOCKER, WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS! SO I WILL GRADUALLY WEAN OFF THIS NIGHTMARE DRUG! WORD OF WARNING: ATENOLOL CAN CAUSE DIABETES, CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, KIDNEY PROBLEMS!! ITS BAD ENOUGH WITH FEELING SO OLD, TIRED, SICK, AND DEPRESSED! STAY AWAY FROM IT, AND TRY MAGNESIUM!!		F	38	3  years100 mg	5/2/2012Email
1	High Blood Pressure	Every side effects in the book.  I keep complaining to my doctor, but he got me afraid to stop taking it.Legs & feet burn all the time,I,m cold all the time, can't sleep,tied and depressed and many others side effects.	I read on the internet Atenolol can cause kidney failure.	F	76	17  years50MG 2X D	3/16/2012
5	Tachycardia/Mitral Valve Prolapse	None	This drug has literally saved my life. I was admitted to hospital for chest pain that was caused by Tachycardia. Before taking Atenolol I could not climb stairs, walk for very long distances, carry in my groceries, or walk my dog because of shortness of breath and chest pain. My resting heart rate was in the 120 BPM.  During physical exercise over 250 BPM. I have been given back 15 years and feel like a new person.	F	50	2  months25 mg 1X D	12/23/2011Email
4	fast heart beat/hypertension	cold limbs	I'm very happy w/ this med. I can tell the difference when off it for a few days after being late w/ a refill. I have tachycardia and Atenolol also helps regulate my hypertension for which I also take Zestril and a thiazide. Only complaint is the need to wear warmer socks and sweaters/gloves in cold weather.	F	50	2  years100 1X D	12/3/2011Email
2	Tachycardia	Going to ask my doctor about weaning off of this medication because I have been very depressed on it (has made my depression much worse), severe water weight gain, chest pains (feels like someone is sitting on my chest, visual problems and my blood pressure is too low, and a few of my toes have gone numb	I was given this medication to counteract the side of effects of another medication, which causes me to have tachycardia, but this is too much. Only thing good it has shown is it doesn't help control your blood pressure but I can't take this anymore.	F	39	3  months25 mg 1X D	10/11/2011Email
1	irregular heartbeat	too many to list.  felt like I was having a heart attack 24/7 incessant chest pain, SEVERE anxiety and depression, MAJOR heartburn, itching, insomnia, body shakes, involuntary muscle jolts, dizzyness, irregular heartbeat (short PR interval - never had it before).... and MORE	I have heard that the old fashioned beta blockers like this can cause heart damage in the long term and alpha/beta blocker combinations are now recommended over the old school drugs like Atenolol.  If this is the "mild" beta blocker, I'd hate to experience the others... felt like I was having a heart attack for DAYS.	F	44	5  days25 1X D	5/20/2011Email
3	Hypertension	Difficulty breathing, purple toes and fingers, fatigue.	Lowered my blood pressure from 210/110 to 150/90, still needed another med to lower BP to normal range. Completely cured all headaches I was having, including my migraines. Also greatly reduced anxiety symptoms such as racing heart and flushing. But had to discontinue since I was having breathing difficulty and doctor worried about tissue damage in my toes.	F	26	3  months50mg 1X D	5/8/2011Email
4	migraines	After 25 years its hard to remember side effects.. perhaps a little dry mouth.. Also not sure if a little depression has been caused by this drug or not.	i suffer from migraines and this drug helped about 95 % with those.. i also have panic attacks and this drug helps somewhat..	M	52	25  years100mg 1X D	5/4/2011
5	SVT rapid heart rate	Maybe a little lethargy.	This is GREAT for tachycardia (SVT). Never had an SVT attack while on Atenolol. Good for PVC's and anxiety too. I am a harsh critic, but this stuff is great. Lowers heart rate. Better than Propranolol which caused me PVC's and trouble breathing.	F	37	5  years50 2X D	4/30/2011Email
2	Migraine prevention	Lethargy, mental fog, increased reaction time and general low mood feeling with irritability	Any cheap generic medication is worth a try when trying to control migraines on a budget.  But the lethargy and depressed moods are not worth the reduction in migraines, which 4 me was insignificant.	M	30	14  days25 mg 1X D	4/25/2011

3	Depression	Metallic taste in mouth, balance problems, altered consciousness, slurred speech.	Not sure if the side effects were the result of Atenolol.  Have you had any of these side effects?  Have you seen any of them mentioned in medical literature or journals? I'd like to know, if you have.  Thanks.	F	32	  1X D	8/27/2010Email
1	Blood pressure	Dizziness, joint pain, irregular heart beat, constant feeling of being about to vomit.	My heart rate got so low after one month on it that the physicians assistant told me to go off of Atenolol.  Two days later I was so violently dizzy, I literally could not stand up.  I managed to get to the Atenolol and take one which helped.  I then slowly tried to wean myself off of them.  I thought I had managed and had been off for three days when my heart started acting so bizarre that I was literally crying and I took an Atenolol.  That helped my heart but I believe that Atenolol may have permanently damaged my heart. I am still trying to go off but every time I do I start having heart episodes.  I wish I had never seen the stuff.	F	57	5  months25 MG 1X D	5/6/2010
4	Tachycardia	None	I take it in along with 3mg Warfarin and 20mg Famotidine upon rising.  I guess it's helping the tachycardia originally discovered during a yearly physical. I have never felt anything when my heart was occasionally beating too fast.  I do mind the annoyance of monthly checkups and blood tests but it.s a small price to pay as a sudden heart attack with no previous history is what killed my father at 53. I'm now 70 and in very good shape otherwise and kid people that I have something which wont bother me until it kills me.	M	70	2  years25MG 1X D	4/17/2010Email
1	BP due to kidney  disease	I had a very high blood pressure. I had a lot of initial side effects, drowsy, foggy brain etc these eased off after a month or so and I felt fine, just tired. Over 1 year I became more and more incapacitated, I struggled to get up stairs. I felt as though I was in my seventies instead of ealy forties. My blood pressure started to go back up to a ridiculous level. I had zero libido. I stopped (gradually) taking the medication.	I did have one or two killer migraines, really severe - when I took this medication, however, I would say overall I had far fewer migraines. When I came off the medication the rebound migraines were impossible to treat and I was very poorly. I now have a healthy blood pressure using herbs and a little bit of yoga.

5	Hypertension	No side effects that I've noticed.	One of the few medicines that I've ever been prescribed that seems to have no side effects and works well!	F	54	3  years	1/27/2010
4	Hypertension	None really at first (12) years ago. In fact, lost weight. NOWI am experiencing weight gain, tiredness, lethargy, joint pain,& a reduced sex drive. Not really sure if this drug is attributed to my side effects, or maybe its peri-menopause!	This drug does help. It is a beta blocker, so it slows the heart rate. I started out with 50 mg. now I am at 100 mg. I do believe it will make you gain the weight however. I really wish I never started taking this drug, and could have controlled my hypertension with diet & exercise, I may still try to get off of the drug and try creating a better diet/& excercise routine.	F	48	12  years	12/11/2009Email
3	blood pressure/teamed with LOTREL	Not sure cause of side effects, atenolol or lotrel,  Severe anxiety, confusion, light headed, hair loss, weight gain, muscle aches, swelling in legs, hands and ankles.	Really having trouble with anxiety and hair loss!!!!	F	60	4  times	11/8/2009

4	high blood pressure	insomnia		F	50	28  days	4/27/2009
5	mitral valve prolaspe	None	This also reduced migraine headaches when I used to get them. Reduces panic attacks. Reduces anxiety. I will continue taking this medicaton. It is a low cost Beta-Blocker. Highly recommend. I take 50 mg every morning. You can start at a lower dose of 25 mg. a day. A doctor can prescribe "off label" for panic attacks, anxiety or migraine headaches.	F	50	12  years	2/25/2009Email
3	Beta Blocker	Flushing face		M		2  years	2/17/2009
3	High Blood Pressure	It caused impotence.  The affect when I started treatment was to make me sleepy (nearly crashed my car)  this went away with time.  I also noticed trouble working out.  I had to push hard to get my second wind.  That seems to have gone away as well.	I tried other meds with worse side effects.  Atenolol takes time for your body to become accustomed to its effects.  Impotence I can live with (using Muse, Viagra, VEDs etc) its better then having high BP!	M	50	5  years	11/24/2008
3	Moderately High Blood Pressure	I can't get it up! Rare isolated dizzyness and light headedness. Heart rate 60/65.	I have a Trophy wife and Viagra doesn't even help? I hike 4 miles a day (up a mountain and down). My blood pressure is under control. I can function; but no Wood!	M	64	3  years	11/13/2008
2	migraines	really depressed, tired, lethargic, feeling of being drained of energy, low heartrate, extremely tired from exercise, appetite loss	It only helped my migraines slightly	F	20	5  months	9/8/2008
3	High blood pressure	Low heart rate, frequent dizziness on standing, difficulty achieving and maintaining erection, often very tired	My blood pressure was about 190/110 for over three years, I decided I should probably do something about it. First I was taking 25 mg of atenolol and it brought me down to around 155/100. Doc doubled me up to 50 mg and the first day my heart rate was 45 bpm. That was rough. Now after a few weeks I'm feeling better, bp is more like 135/85, heart rate usually around 58 or so. I have a desk job, in the mornings with atenolol I'm often light headed when I stand up. When I work out, it takes a long time to warm up, and I have to really fight it. But if I push long and hard enough, I'm amazed at how much energy and stamina I have. I like to do wind sprints. With atenolol I start out at a jog and get out of breath after a few hundred feet. Then I walk, and then jog again. Finally after about 20 minutes, I can sprint at high speed for a couple of hundred meters or so.I've doubled up on my weekly hours of working out also, and that seems nearly as good as the pills for bringing down the pre	M	51	3  weeks	5/30/2008
3	high blood pressure	no side effects	Helped with B/P but have to take other B/P medicine with it.	F	68	1  years	4/15/2008
5	Hypertension/HBP	Little dizziness, vertigo during the first week. After the body adjusted to the med it's done fine for me.	It's helped me a lot with HBP, norm is now 128/82-before this med it was 170/110 and higher. Glad my Doc found a med for me that plays nice instead of giving bad side effects. Take 50 mg at night before bed and it works perfect. I was taking it when I woke up for 2 months but found that I had a hard time falling asleep so I switched the times.	M	46	1  years	4/13/2008
4	Rapid Heartbeat, Borderline HBP	Cold hands, feet and nose during the day; vivid and constant dreaming at night. I suffer from seasonal depression and I think the atenolol may make that somewhat worse.	Even with the side effects, I appreciate this drug very much. My heart was constantly racing; even at my "calmest", my heart rate was over 100-120 bpm. Now, it's 60-70 bpm all the time. Blood pressure was borderline high and is now in the low normal range. I take 25 mg. once a day.	F	47	1.5  years	4/12/2008
1	High Blood Pressure	You name it. I had it. Depression, anxiety, mood swings, headache, heartburn, nausea, no energy, disappearing sex drive, loss of appetite and the list goes on.	The only good thing? I lost weight on this. That's it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It's terrible.	F	38	1  months	3/30/2008

5	Hig Blood Pressure	Limited Physical capability the first 8 hours	I have been taking this for about ten years.  No problems.dosage 25 mg.  I take it in the PM.  I think it helps me get a good night's sleep.  Knocks off about 15 points.  Don't want to take it?  Go exercise hard for 30 minutes/day. (Tredmill, Crosstrainer, digging in the garden, etc.)  That will make a big difference.  As big as the little pill.	M	67	10  years	2/16/2008
1	HYPERTENSION	I DEVELOPED SEVERE CHEST PAIN ASTHMA AND BRONCHOSPASMS AND I WAS WEANED OFF ATENOLOL BUT A FEW DAYS LATER I ENDED UP IN THE HOSPITAL WITH MORE SEVERE CHEST PAIN. I WAS PUT ON TOPROL IN THE HOSPITAL AND DISCHARGED AS ALL MY TESTS WERE NEGATIVE. I ENDED BACK IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM 10 DAYS LATER AND THE CARDIOLOGIST WEANED ME OFF TOPROL THAT DAY. TEN DAYS LATER I FEEL WONDERFUL. I AM ON NORVASC 5 MG AND PLAN TO EXERCISE AND LOSE 15 LBS AND HOPEFULLY LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE NATURALLY.BETA BLOCKERS ARE NOT FOR ME.	HORRENDOUS MEDICATION AVOID IF YOU CAN!	F	66	3  months	2/11/2008Email
3	Tachycardia	Slight Fatigue, Slight Depression	Haven't experienced many side effects so far.  Using it for treatment of Tachycardia in the 250's.  No attacks so far, and the drug has eliminated additional beats throughout the day.	F	25	1  months	12/17/2007
1	Hypertension	I became severely depressed after taking it for two days.  The third morning I awoke early, couldn't go back to sleep and started to think about killing myself.  I then realized that it was the medication and stopped taking it.  It took at least 3 days for my sanity to return and I did suffer rebound with rapid heartbeat and anxiety.	One doctor told me my brain was too sensitive for this medication	F	40	2  days	11/15/2007
1	Blood pressure 165/100+	A better question would be which side effects DIDN'T I experience.  Depression, getting angry at stupid things, fatigue, difficulty exercising.	This was an awful drug for me.  It completely changed my personality, to the point where family members barely recognized me sometimes.  I was always tired, I'd get angry and the stupidest stuff.  I couldn't get my heart rate above 120bpm, which made it impossible for me to run.  I also didn't want to talk to anyone, and I'd go out of my way to avoid conversations with anyone, including my wife.  All that and it didn't really lower my blood pressure much at all.  After about four months, my doc changed me over to Diovan HCT 80/12.5.  The transformation was amazing.  Within one day of stopping this awful drug, I was back to my normal self.  I felt good again, the depression lifted and I spent more time talking to my wife in that one morning than I did the entire time I was on Atenolol.  One positive effect is it got rid of my headaches, but I continue to be headache free with Diovan.	M	42	4  months	10/19/2007
1	High BP	weight gain,have trouble with my vision, weak feeling and need to rest. Had problems with depresson & it made my hair fall out all in which I did not have before taking this drug	JUST SAY NO	F	33	21  days	10/15/2007Email
3	Hypertension	Shortness of breath, feeling like I'm suffocating, very tired, dizziness, chest tightness	50 mg brought my bp from 155/95 down to 105/65. Although not taken for anxiety, it has almost cured my anxiety attacks. I can't stand the extreme shortness of breath, but every time I try to wean off, I have major rebound effects (racing pulse, pounding heart, chest pain, anxiety).	F	28	1  years	10/14/2007
3	hypertenson	lethargy and forgetfullness	25 mg. Atenolol maintained the systolic in the 145 - 155 range with only a few lower levels and some 160 - 200 when under stress. More effective on the diastolic which was not a problem. The heart rate dipped to 150's producing weakness and exhaustion.Warning - do not stop this drug abruptly - check Medline Plus	F	68	6  months	10/7/2007
5	POTS	Depression	Works very well for high blood pressure due to excess of adrenaline release by the adrenals. I would highly recommend this BB as it is selective, vs. Inderal, etc.	M	22	6  months	8/4/2007
1	atrial fibrillation	Nightmares, extreme disorientation, feeling of floating.  this drug can cross the blood brain barrier and cause severe central nervous system disfuntions.  Horrible for me and my sister also.		F	71	6  weeks	7/28/2007
4	hypertenson	fatigue and insomnia	Very effective in lowering blood pressure after spending 2yrs. trying 10 different drugs in the various categories all giving many side effects and only occasional low bp with episodes of BP readings of 200 to 120 in one day!  Now, mostly 120-130, with some 150's. Diastolic 60's - although never was a problem;pulse 60's. Also take 25mg. HCTZ which seems to produce a burning sensation to the tops of my feet in addition to swelling of ankles and lips. Stopped it for a few days and it seemed to alleviate this.	F	70	4  months	7/22/2007

2	AFIB	HAD 3-4 EPISODES OF AFIB A YEAR BEFORE TAKING ATENOLOL.  STARTED TAKING IT IN APRIL AND HAD SIX EPISODES THAT MONTH.  ALSO MY LOWER BACK HURTS.  DR. SAYS IT MUST BE ARTHRITIS.	I'M GIVING IT A BIG LONGER.  THE AFIBS ONLY LAST ABOUT TWO HOURS AND I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING BUT THE PALPITATIONS.  NO FAINTING, ETC.	F	72	6  days	5/9/2007
5	Tachycardia with my pulse and OI	None at all at 75mgs.	This medicine has really saved my life. It has taken my pulse from 150 to 75 and my B.P. from 150/105 to 130/80 from dsyautonomia. I owe my life to Atenolol! I am taking 75mgs and it is working so well.	M	25	2  months	5/3/2007
4	Tachycardia/POTS	Not many. At too high of a dose (over 50mg) tiredness, fatigue, etc. But with any beta-blocker that's expected.	Atenolol at 25-50mg daily is an amazing medication to control tachycardia (high racing pulse), symptoms of the Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, and various components of anxiety disorders such as agoraphobia and GAD.	M	21	1  months	4/22/2007
5	HBP	Slows heart rate but doesn't really help bring down BP. Slightlysleepy when reading or watching TV but OK when up and about.Does reduce labido but no potency problem.	What it does do is calm your emotions. I have a really bad temperand I found since being on this, that I don't seem to get soupset when something bothers me. Also helps endure going thrubad times (sister & bro both died within 2 mos this year of cancer while I was also moving to new house - never could havegot thru it all without this atenolol) - miricle drug!

I would not recommend this med without thorough discussion about side effects and what to be concerned about???	F	54	18  days	2/24/2007
4	hypertension, stent, afib	After taking atenolol with no problems for about nine years I began to experience elevated pain at sites of joint problems... lower back, knee, upper back.

5	High Blood Pressure, Palps, Anxiety	Mild Insomnia if taken at night. Mild tingling in finger tips. With the first dose in 4 hrs -it took by bp to 125/90.	I had high bloof pressure due to anxiety/panic attacks (I'm 5'7 -120 pds-no heart probs). It has done wonders for BP before 161/130 now 105/65 steady. I take 1/2 pill of 25 mg in morning before i eat.  I tried Zoloft 50mg and Xanax 25 mg together and was unable to decrease anxiety attacks which caused high bp. Now-it has been an anwser for me. I feel i have my life back.I wonder if anybody has info on it giving them arthritis or increased ANA titers?	F	40	30  days	12/23/2006
5	sinus tachycardia	None	It works wondefully for me. An hour after taking it (25mg), my heart rate slows into the 70s and I feel normal again. Depending on the time of my cycle, I sometimes take a second pill later in the day. It does the trick.	F	35	3  years	10/17/2006

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.
