3	endometriosis	Breakthrough bleeding for 2 weeks, horrible cramping, lethargic	I've only been on this pill for 5 weeks and I'm hoping some of the problems go away with time.  I've been bleeding now for 2 weeks, which is extremely annoying, and I've had cramping on and off during this time period as well.  I've suffered from endometriosis for a while, and the cramping is up there with some of the most painful cramps I've ever had.  I've also had a few days where I'm just so tired I don't feel like doing anything and just want to sleep.  I'm going to wait it out for the first full pack (3 months) and hope that I adjust to this pill!	F	26	5  weeks 1X D	6/27/2012
5	Control bleeding for endometriosis	Occasional night sweats, but that's about it.  This BC seems like a walk in the park compared to all the side effects I had while on Lupron treatments and surgery. I am extremely happy with it.		F	28	6  months	3/7/2012Email
4	fewer periods bc of PMDD/bipolar	Some breakthrough bleeding. Weight gain (I was underweight anyway so I'm not complaining).	The first month I was fine, no break through bleeding no side effects. The second and third months of the first pack I have been having a little breakthrough bleeding every day. I will take this over a full period any time but just something I have noticed. It's barely noticeable and usually only in the morning and I am bloodfree the rest of the day. I have also been cramping the past few days and breakthrough bleeding more than usual but I'm supposed to start the "period week" next week.	F	21	2.5  months 1X D	7/27/2011Email
4	endometriosis	my hair did fall out after 2 months.  I have gained 10 lbs.  The appetite did seem increased from before I was taking Yazz.   Also my breast are larger which I did not need.	I have a history of endometriosis. I went on Yazz years ago when my estrogen was low.  Lately, it seemed more increased that I started having uterine contractions and migraines.  It has really helped with the periods and contractions that I like it for that but I have not enjoyed the side effects.	F	46	4  months 1X D	5/1/2011
2		Loss of/thining of hair on top of head; vision loss and ligh-headedness.		F	35	8  months 1X D	4/9/2011
3	Dysmennorhea	Breast swelling & pain. 16+ days of bleeding. Some acne.	I was very hopeful about taking this medication as I have extremely painful periods both before & during menstruation in which the pain can last up to 2 weeks. I started the medication mid period and 4 weeks later by the time I got to the next period I began bleeding lightly and the bleeding has continued for 16+ days now. I have never had a period for more than 5 to 6 days. I have actually been bleeding more the past few days than I did at the beginnning. I have also been getting zits on my face:( I am discontunuing the medication & hope I will stop bleeding soon. I do not have the severe pain as I typically do during normal menstruation, but the incessant bleeding is getting rediculous. I did like having bigger boobs though, except for the fact that they hurt really bad.	F	31	6  weeks0.1/0.02mg 1X D	6/8/2010Email
3	PMDD, cycle regulation	High blood pressure, fatigue, hunger	I had great hopes that this would work for me, but it didn't.  I usually experience migraines with bcp's, but did not with this.  Everything seemed okay until week four when I experienced my heart racing and fluttering.  A trip to my pcp confirmed my blood pressure was high.  After I had my second child, I became very sensitive to medications, and it seems that I'm just not going to be able to take any oral contraceptives.  But on the whole, I did not have many of the other side effects women experience on this.	F	35	1  months 1X D	3/5/2010
4	acne & wanted fewer periods	developed a different smell "down there" (maybe b/c it changed the chemistry?); decreased sex drive	I had been on ortho tri-cyclen previously for many years, and wanted similar results for clearing acne, but to have fewer periods.  It seemed that as long as I took the pill within the same 3-4 hour period each morning, breakthrough bleeding was avoided.  It did clear my acne, although not as well as ortho-tri cyclen. However, because of the added benefit of not having a period but once every three months, I'll probably stay on this.  No cramps, no breast tenderness, no mood swings on this, which I was getting before I started this.  Period started after missing two pills.	F	31	42  days	1/8/2010
4	Birth control, anemia	Painful cramping, dull headaches, insomnia for the first couple of weeks, tired, breakthrough spotting/bleeding, breast tenderness.	I talked to my doctor about an oral contraceptive he would recommend to a girl like me (prone to anemia, vegetarian) after my boyfriend kept pestering me to get on the pill. My doctor recommended LoSeasonique saying his two daughters take it, one of them being vegetarian. I'm on month four of it and I can say I am satisfied. I get very nervous when taking prescription drugs and was disappointed when I got the common side effects of cramps, headaches, breakthrough bleeding etc. They were bad the 1st 2 weeks but subsided thereafter and have slowly disappeared. I did get breakthrough bleeding again for 2 weeks before the low dose estrogen pills, however. There is an unexpected benefit that has influenced my liking of this medication. With no periods, I have not had mood swings. Before every period, I would get really depressed, anxious and irritable. That has all been eliminated since I've been on the medication. Oh, and this medication is REALLY pricey, so be prepared to shell out some cash when your sample runs out. :/	F	20	3  months	10/19/2009
3	regulate heavy periods bc	some nausea and anxiety and PMS in first couple months,still a period first monthmore than usual hair loss in 2nd and 3rd month	side effects (except hair) seem to get better with time,first month or two had to take an advil almost every day for crampsdidn't have period after second month of pillsthis med allows you to have just 4 periods a year.will give it a little longer to see if side effects go away more	F	45	2.5  months	9/15/2009
