2	Migraines	Very rapid and continual weight gain.	I have taken Topamax for several years.  The drug seemed to quit working, and my doctor was not comfortable increasing the dosage.  He decided to add verapamil.  Topamax is known for weight loss.  Needless to say I was very surprised at how quickly I gained weight (20 pounds in a year) while taking verapamil in addition to a medication that causes weight loss!  I am quite certain it is related to the medication since I am a very health conscious individual.  Aside from the weight gain, verapamil has been mostly effective at relieving my migraines, with only a few breakthrough headaches.	F	28	1  years	6/28/2008

1	migraine preventative	SEVERE constipation, bloated abdomen, weight gain, night sweats	a 300 mg dosage and did not seem to contribute to helping my migraines lessen. The constipation was unbearable. I took colace and dulcolax every night. I went off the Verelan a couple of weeks ago and have already lost ten pounds and my stomach is almost flat again. I dont know for sure if the night sweats are related to verelan, but I havent had them since I quit this drug.	F	39	8  months	10/17/2005

2	Migraine Associated Vertigo	None that I know of.	I took verapamil for 24/7 dizziness and vertigo that my docs think is related to migraine. Since verapamil can prevent migraine, they hoped it would stop my dizziness. Unfortunately, I saw now improvements in my dizziness while taking this med. For this reason, I stopped after 2 months.

2	High Blood Pressure	Constipation and too much gas! Made the mistake of drinking a soda and was in pain for an hour due to gas trapped in my stomach.  Didnt control my blood pressure. Episodes of spiking blood pressure.	I am prone to migraines which happen when my blood pressure spikes. Although, I didnt get a migraine, several times I had "the buzzing feeling and pressure" of a migraine on the verge of happening. At that time, BP was 150/110.  I took this along with Benazapril.

I have never had a problem with gas...however since I started taking Verapamil (this is embrassing but I'm sure hilarious to a 5th grade boy) I pass gas @ least 6-8 times an hour and it is a continuous loud/explosive drawn out event that @ times is uncontrollable. The pathetic part is I have seen no improvement of my B/P. I do however plan on discontinuing this Rx asap, esp. after reading the other side effects described here.

5	Migraine	dizziness and headaches at first, nausea but it was tolerable	I started taking this after I hit my head on concrete and I was getting a headache for a span of a week and they would happen like up to 6 times in a month (i didnt finish the month, was on the 3rd week when i had already 6 headaches before started the pill), not what i usually would have for headaches...started taking them been almost a year and i have gone to where i was to begin with, like only one - 3 headaches a month and they only come around my menstrual period or when im stressed so I think these definitely helped!! I hope that I don't have to take them for a long period of time however maybe than the bad side effects of taking them too long would appear!	F	26	1  years120 mg 1X D	12/2/2011
1		long term side effects untold by mfg of drug and doctors - now cause loss of sleep -nightmares and spikes in b.p ! when wakeing up stress dreams !!! b.p spikes from 179/100 to 191/118*  forced to take nitro pill to lower b.p and stop chest pains that are mild but happen due to this.	cardio dr gave me verp 1/2 dose night and clonidine 1/2 pill -this is a banaid type fix  as it works about 65% of the time - verapamil is very strong drug! the longer one takes it ,the more it works and cause's these problems ! my cardio doctor refuses to take me off the ccbs ! iv seem to grow allergic to or can't tollerate anymore.. so this problem happens off and on . it also causes massive gas problems and does not always stop angina. going up on dose of verapamil only makes problems worse ,the less the better - however ween off it slowly dont not just stop it !  since iv been on it its caused meny problems -from gerd ,to hypoglyceima symptoms to happen, to not working at all for bp... and has caused hair loss and dehydration and muscular pains body aches to happen when on it .. it does stop palpations for the most part ,but not always..  I would rate this drug at zero ! being it has more side effects than about anyother ccb drug out there!  also it causes breathing problems and shortness of breath when you try and do anything.. active and can cause chest pains to happen.. doctors might love this drug ! but long term its crap ! and really does more harm than good !  its unsafe after 4years of taking it .. and should be recalled and or doctors forced not to keep a person on it long term !   there are hundreds of other b.p meds on the market today.. this one should be baned..  also cancer has been linked to all ccbs , this one by name was mentioned in a british test.   2003	M	58	8  years160 1X D	5/7/2011

5	Migraines & High Blood Pressure	No real noticeable side effect - I am normally constipated and this may be a little worse.  I haven't noticed any hair loss.	This has been the best treatment for my frequent migraines.  It doesn't give me dead head like the anti siezure or antidepressent med's I have tried.  I was having 6-8 migraines per month and for the past 3 months I have had 2 maybe 3 per month.  This drug also works to bring my blood pressure to within normal range.

1	SVT	Constipation, chronic nightmares, insomnia, severe bruising, hair loss, fatigue, sweating, cofusion	This drug was poison for me.  While it did slow down the frequency of my attacks, the side effects were far worse than my symptoms.  I have discontinued usage now, and i am hoping to feel better soon without this toxic sunstance in my body.	F	38	5  weeks180 1X D	3/18/2011
1	SVT & A-Fib	Constriction (a feeling like I am having difficulty breathing when I'm actually not), Anxiety, PACs and constipation.	I have been on Verapamil for over 3 years now. It has never helped to keep the heart rate of my tachycardias down that I know of. I was prescribed this for "rate control" but the side effects are now no longer worth it to me.

3	pvc & mild hyperstension	Hair loss, hot flashes or sweating, cold hands and feet, difficulty swalling or dry mouth, hormonal imbalance, sinus tachycardia several times a month during first stage of REM from ovulation to onset of menstral cycle, followed by episodes of chills.	I am 42 and this drug seems to prohibit some of the production of FSH and or the blance of estrogen and progestrone in my body. I have only found one article indicated this problem with this drug. If anyone has any additional information please post. I really hope my beautiful thick hair grows back, and it feels like a nest of hay and the color has changed.

1	high blood pressure	Sever palpitations, atrial fibrillation, fatigue, blurred vision, mental fog.	I was on Verapamil for 3 years. The side effects came on gradually and became worse over time. In a year and a half's time, I ended up in the ER 3 times for Atrial Fibrillation and once for severe palpitations. Doctors all said I had atrial fibrillation and not side effects of Verapamil. After reading here that some people cut their dose in half and their palpitations decreased or disappeared. I tried half dose and palpitations decreased dramatically. Asked Dr to change meds and he refused. I went to a new Cardiologist, who told me I should never have been on Verapamil and changed to Tekturna. He said Verapamil is known to have too many bad side effects and this is well known in the medical community. He said palpitaions and atrial fibrillation are among them. Palpitations disappeared completely in 2 days. What more can I say? If your doctor won't change your BP med when you are having problems with it, you can FIRE them and get a new Dr.	M	55	3  years12 mg 1X D	11/27/2010
5	Migraines	Mild dizziness/drowsiness, more noticeable when changing dose (take the day off!). The constipation you get on this stuff is no joke, I've never had problems with constipation before being on this drug and now I have to take miralax daily.	I've been on several migraine drugs and this one is definitely my favorite, it doesn't have the cognitive/emotional side effects that many migraine drugs do. My migraines are definitely less frequent and severe since going on this.	F	33	1  years80 3X D	10/26/2010Email
2	Migraines	Weight gain, belly bloat, insomnia, severe sweating, hair loss	15 pound weight gain in 2 months (while on diet/exercise AND metformin? no thanks!), quite a bit of hair loss in the shower drain - luckily I have thick hair so it isn't too noticeable at this point.  The sweating is severe and rather embarrassing.	F	28	2  months 1X D	9/9/2010

THIS MEDICATION WORKS TO CONTROL BLOOD PRESURE BUT IF YOU'RE A WOMAN AND IF YOUR EVEN SEMI VAIN THIS IS NOT YOUR DRUG. HAIR LOSS YOU CANT STOP. I QUIT TAKINGING IT A YEAR AGO AND HAIR STILL HASNT THICKENED BACK UP HORRIBLE MEDICINE. HAVE YOUR DOC  LOWER THE DOSAGE AND MAYBE TAKE A LOW DIURETIC WITH IT I THINK ITS ALSO DOSE INDUCED TO CAUSE THE HAIR LOSS. IVE READ THAT ON MAY SITES. SO BEWARE AND GOOD LUCK HUMANS!!

5	migraine	Mild dizziness, fatigue, and occasional itching, barely noticeable once I had been taking it a couple weeks. Constipation, which was easily treatable with fiber supplements.	The side effects I got on this drug were very minimal and comfortable compared to other migraine meds I have tried. I will have to report back after a few months about the success with the migraines, but so far I am noticing an improvement.	F	32	2  months	12/28/2009

1	Lft. Ventricular dysfunction, Hi BP	Immediate Extreme uncurable constipation, had to take huge doses of laxatives. Took days after getting off it to get a bowel movement. Depression, dizzy spells, tingling in face and hands, anxiety, and finally anaphylaxis. Had to dose myself with benedryl and go off of it immediately. It was poison to me. I flushed them down the toilet.	My High Blood Pressure wasn't brought down even 1 point. I have a faulty closuer of the left ventricle, a flow murmur and very high BP. I have episodes of extreme breathlessness. I got a reading of 166/98 after 10 days on this terrible drug...at least terrible for me.	F	58	10  days	5/18/2006

I take it at night because I feel so lethargic afterwards.	I had a heart attack at age 37 and now have a leaky valve. The cardiologist has prescribed this drug to slow my heart down and relax the muscle so it won't beat as hard, as to slow the leak.Working so far, but I feel like I'm 92 after I take it!!

Awaking at night led to slight panic attacks where heart would race which would bring on heart palpitations.  One night I woke up and swear that my heart was beating so fast that i couldn't even count, but who knows.  Generally a healthy 32 old here without any problems up until now.  I have been off of Verapamil for a week now and the sleep disturbances continue.  Hopefully this will taper off the longer I am off it. UGH!	I wish I had never met this drug.  Not a fan!

5	Headaches.	No side effects at all.	Since the age of fifteen I had severe cluster headaches that often lasted for several days and tried many types of medications that didn't help at all.  A doctor suggested I try Calan and it worked right away.  I take one every morning.  Whenever I have an occasional headache it is generally relieved after taking two regular aspirin.

5	cluster headache	none	nothing else prevented cluster headache until i found verapamil.this med is a godsend and i urge anyone with cluster headache to ask to try verapamil.note : dosages are a lot higher than they would be for heart problems. eg im on 720mg a day	M	28	1  years	12/28/2006
5	migraines	none that I noticed	I've suffered from migraines for over 14 years and this is the only thing that has worked to prevent migraines.  I went from a migraine nearly every day to a couple times a week.	F	23	6  months	12/3/2006

5	High Blood Pressure	Actually gave me some palpitations.	At first this med was Godsend. Made me feel 25 years younger and lowered my BP quite nicely and even warmed my feet toasty warm!*BUT...then after 1 week I had annoying heart palpitations. Didn't hurt me just annoying. So I give it a *5*   for good measure. I am still experimenting with it some (lowered dosage) and so forth, but alas, I still can get annoying palps from it. Still a good med though.
