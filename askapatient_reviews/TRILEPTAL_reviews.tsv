				F M	 	 	    
5	Bipolar II	Occasional dizziness. Sodium test slightly slow.	Regulated my sleep; slowed me down during the day in a good way - racing thoughts, anxiety, irritability much much better.Slight weight gain but I attribute this to not adjusting my calories down. Now that I'm not going hypomanic, I have to eat a bit less since I'm not fidgety/moving around as much. Adjusted for sodium by having some salty soup and a pickle or two each day.	M	43	1  months300 2X D	6/4/2013
3	bipolar	I have dark circles under my eyes at eight days of use. I've experienced some bad headaches.		F	40	8  days300 mg	4/5/2013Email
1	BiPolar	It began on the second dose with a stiff neck on my right side. Over the next seven weeks the muscle stiffness, pain and muscle exhaustion intensified. I felt almost as if I was living in a dream. Itchy skin, Hives rash on back, red spots all over, walking became difficult due to joint pain. Confusion and memory loss. Dry cough and shaky hands. VERY PAINFULL  headaches, stiff painfull joints and muscle fatigue. ER Dr. said it was coincidental to my meds and discharged me with a sore throat (which I did NOT have) I was treated COMPLETELY different when he asked WHY I was taking Trileptal and I told him BiPolar.		F	35	2  months300 MG 1X D	2/25/2013Email
5	Bipolar	Constipation at current dose.  Higher dose gives me numb lips, anxiety and difficulty concentrating.	Within a week of the first dose, the mood swings  I was having lessened. Life became much more manageable. I was much less irritable .  I have tried about 20 other meds and usually I can not tolerate the side effects. This one has been a lifesaver for me.	F	46	6  years150 2X D	2/5/2013
4	Bi-Polar	So my side effect increased with higher dosage. I started with 900 mg, raised to 1200, then 1800 then 2400 mg. Vision blurry, hand tremors, gas, extreme anxiety. I lowered my dose back to 1200 mg(300mg 4x day) and it sub-sided some. My moods however are stable now.. Guess it took some time to adjust the meds for the magic number. I originally thought 1500mg was it....		M	52	7  weeks300mg 4X D	1/4/2013EmailHistory
3	seizures	Headaches, numb lips, short temper, hard to go to sleep some nights, depression.		M	35	2  days600 mg	12/1/2012Email
2	bipolar disorder	I never had acne before, and this medication has made me look like a monster. It makes me really tired, forgetting eveything and very nervous. And the worst part is my doctor suggested I stay on it..hell no!!!!!!		F	31	1  months300mg	11/12/2012
3	partial complex seizures	Sometimes makes me feel drunk, numb mouth and lips, very scary, headaches, vision problems, craving salt which i never did, gained weight not happy, memory loss can't remember if i took medicine or how much, short term memory loss is horrible	I am not sure going back into hospital for that dreadful eeg with video for 5 days to see what is going on i think it is a medicine issue trileptal has to be adjusted or something or is this it from being on it not happy	F	53	8  months1800 2X D	10/19/2012Email
5	bipolar ; mood stabilizer	Had to slowly work up to desired dose or I would get double vision. Now years later my life has never been more stable.		M	28	3  years1800	9/14/2012Email
1	seizures	bad insomnia, memory loss, frozen thoughts, 'smashed' feeling	The wacko neurologist who prescribed this med for me is the *same* md who wrongfully prescribed Seroquel for me for atypical trigeminal neuralgia, which I developed after having sinus surgery. Had I never had my right turbinate burned with a CO2 laser I would have never had the seizures which tore my rotator cuffs up on my shoulders and on one time in May of 2009 I went unconscious while driving and crashed into a tree. The damage to my trigeminal nerve from the CO2 laser burns were how (at least phsically ) the seizure started. Don't EVER have it.	M	54	3  years300-600mg 2X D	9/4/2012Email
5	seizures	I have had the sensitivity with sunlight.  Drove out of town and could feel leg burning.  When getting to place, leg was hot and noticablly discolored.  Had my second child without any difficulties.  Pleased with med so far.  I also take with dilantiin.  Combination works.		F	41	2  years1200	8/28/2012Email
5	Tonic colonic seizures	Coordination issues, extreme sweatiness, Trouble sleeping, slight weight gain, walking patterns( problems walking in a straight line)		F	18	9  years300 mg 2x	8/23/2012
1	BiPolar II	Headache, blurred vision, SEVERELY WORSENED DEPRESSION, paranoia, fear. This is the worst drug I have ever taken.		M	61	5  days150 1X D	8/23/2012
3	bipolar1,rapidcycling,mixedepisodes	Just started having a severe yeast infection that will not go away with treatment, abdominal distension, upset stomach after eating, stiff joints with muscle weakness	Trileptal is a pretty good drug for me.  I have taken it for a year and a half with few problems.  The side effects I have didn''t start until I stopped taking AAP's.  Now they are coming on fast and furious.  I don't understand it, but it is happening.  I fear I may have to move to a different AC, not something I want to do as there are only worse alternatives.	F	56	1.5  years600 2X D	7/27/2012Email
5	Bipolar I mixed episodes	Allowed me to focus and controlled mixed mood episodes. I have loss 5 lbs since taking it which made me happy since I became overweight on depakote. Did not cause loss of libido.  No side effects except for first 3and days had nausea and vomiting.  I feel better than I ever have on any other mood stabilizer. Works great for me.		F	39	1  months1200	7/22/2012
4	simple partial seizures	Incredibly tough time adjusting, but after finding correct dosage, became seizure-free and have been for 11 m! Downside: Need to get 8 to 9 hours sleep, or feel nauseous and horrible. Can't get a buzz from alcohol, exhaustion, dry eye and nose, and awful memory loss, even tho i'm only 43. However, given that seizures were ruining my life, it's worth it. I can work, extremely demanding job. Just have to write down EVERYTHING. Stick with it. Give it a chance.		F	43	18  months600 mg 2 x 2X D	7/10/2012Email
5	seizures	weight gain, wich is counteracted by change in diet, and more activity, used to be awake somewhat at night, but that went away.		M	28	2  times900mg	6/30/2012Email
5	seizures	About an hour after taking the medication I become very dizzy and uncoordinated for about and hour to two hours. My sodium levels have become very low and I am unable to drink water because this aggravates the problem.	This is the only seizure medication that I have been on since I started having seizures six years ago that allows me to function normally. I can remember things from years ago that I thought I had forgotten, I can read a book with great comprehension, and I have a personality that my family and friends recognize as me again.	F	28	6  months600 2X D	3/1/2012Email
5	Epileptic seizures	:2 daily doses 900mg &1200mg Fatigue, sleepiness, lethargy-all severe. IBS, Low sodium levels, causing craving for salt. Very poor concentration and short/long-term memory. Skin sensitivity, especially to sunlight. Also have problems reacting to high and low temperatures, cannot control body heat and don't sweat as much as used to. My hair has lost it's curl, apparently to do with hair follicles changing shape, happens with lot of medication.	Major symptom is the tiredness, no matter which word I use it can be described as debilitating. I am currently in a wheelchair if I leave the house and cannot push it myself-I'm too scared about having a seizure to use a mobility scooter. I ahve managed to control my sleep so that I have 8-9hours at night and 2-3hours in the afternoon, only if absolutely necessary.I have a strict sugar free/yeast free diet to control the IBS and it works to a certain point. The low sodium means that I drink less water/tea than I would like, it's either that or have a seizure due to excessively low sodium. I have never been able to go out to work or even study or work from home, initially from the seizures, but now from the tiredness. Doing very little and spending most of my day in bed or on the sofa is the norm and I will get dressed at weekends and go out with my husband for a couple of hours. I have given Oxcarbazepine 5 stars because it has very nearly totally controlled my  severe convulsive seizures	F	36	10  years2100mg 1X D	2/14/2012EmailHistory
1	Bipolar	My son was on 600 mg in the evening and 150 in the morning when the Dr increased it to 600 in the morning and 600 at night he became very aggressive felt like he was going crazy and extremely hyper		M	15	4  months600 2X D	1/15/2012
1	bipolar 1	Awful side effects hallucinations, lethargy, confusion, slurred speech		M	45	2  weeks300mg	12/16/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Drowsiness, tiredness, depression, severe lack of motivation, lethargy	I did not like this medication at all. I hade been taking Lamictal before this, however I had to stop due to the severe side effects I experienced (unfortunate! Lamictal worked so well). While I was not completely stable when I first went on Trileptal, my instability became increasingly worse over the month that I was on this medicine. By the end of the month I was so depressed and lethargic I could barely make it to school. On the other hand, Trileptal did not cause any other side effects besides the severe drowsiness. I am also on 2mg Abilify, 100mg Wellbutrin, and 30mg Adderall XR. I was also taking 25mg Lamictal while I was on the Trileptal, however I've since had to stop taking the Lamictal, again, due to side effects.	F	18	25  days150 mg 1X D	12/5/2011
1	Tonic-Clonic Seizures	Twitching right eye, trouble focusing, memory loss, loss of appetite, tingling sensation in face, stability problems, vertigo, trouble remembering what I was doing 2 seconds ago, lack of social interest and sex drive, trouble sleeping, anxiety and/or impatience, nervousness, trouble accomplishing any task, new-found ability to move one eye indepently of the other, occassional "zoning" out for the first 6 or so hours after taking a dose, when I'm zoning out one eye tends to cross while the other stays normal	Generic Oxcarbazepine is the only anti-epileptic medicine I've taken except for dilantin (which was a temporary fix from ER doctor).  So, I don't have a lot of experience in the matter.  Also, I don't really remember but I think the side effects got MUCH worse when my dosage was raised from 450mg to 600mg	M	30	7  months600mg 2X D	11/6/2011Email
2	meningioma causing partial seizures	Cannot concentrate, blurred vision and twitching eye.  Vertigo and brain is misty.  Can not remember peoples names or what they said 3 seconds ago.  Lack of libido and get very anxious.  oh and have trouble with itchy rashes.	I hate to think of the long term side effects of this drug	M	42	90  days150mg 1X D	10/8/2011
2	Complex Partial Seizures	Anxiety, OCD, Sleepy, Blurry, Post Nasal Drip, and Bi Polar	I've been taking Trileptal since I was 15. I have horrible OCD. Ever since I raised it to 1200mg twice a day I've had this horrible post nasal drip. I've never had post nasal drip before after I raised it to 1200mg. I can't wait to see an ENT. I'm mad all the time. I can sleep for hours all day and it makes me stay up all night long. Everytime I take it I'm blurry and dizzy. I feel like even though I'll eventually get off this medicine these side effects may be permanent and my doctor won't even care. I've even lowered the trileptal to 900mg in the morning and the post nasal drip didn't even go away. I'm just so sick of it all.	F	27	12  years1200mg 2X D	8/30/2011Email
4	Seizure	Constipation, post nasal drip due to inflammed nasal passages (not related to allergies-I never had any before), urinary retention, I feel intoxicated if I take it on an empty stomach, inability to find the right word, slight tremors, barely noticable facial ticks, off balance when I first wake up, sometimes it's difficult to concentrate, occasional insomnia.	The constipation has been the worst!  I'm taking a prescription laxative b/c nothing else is working at this point.  The post nasal drip gives me a terrible cough.  An ear/nose/throat Dr. said that my nasal tissue is very swollen & that it could be due to either the seizure or the medication, I have to take another medication to deal with that.  Recently I have been experiencing what has been diagnosed as urinary retention.  I'm not able to completely empty my bladder.  The other side effects are merely annoying.  When I first started the drug I felt stoned each time I took it, now I only feel that way when I take it on an empty stomach.  On the occasions I do feel intoxicated I also experience dry mouth & lips.	F	39	1  years600 mg 2X D	7/28/2011Email
2	Mood disorder	Vertigo, dizziness... probably should not have been driving, due to poor judgement.  Itchy skin, face breakouts, lazy, tired.	Started at 300 mg. gradually increased to 1200.  Not happy at all with how I felt.  I just knew it was not a good drug to have in my system, and we know our bodies better than anyone else knows them.  I am down to one 300 mg tab at bedtime with a 50 mg Trazodone for sleep.  I am content with how I feel, and could probably drop this dose eventually.  I started taking a wonderful multi-vitamin for my moods and am sold.  No more mood medications for me.	F	44	2  months300 4X D	7/18/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Loss of libido, terrible upset stomach, nausea, diarrhea, start of an ulcer, ringing in my ears interfered with audio, numerous vision problems including feeling cross eyed, blurry vision and seeing spots in front of my eyes, deep pitted acne. Worst side effect: I became so suicidal I went shopping for a gun.	I got worse rather than better on Trileptal. I would not recommend it to anyone. I was in a car accident while on Triptal. I wrecked my car and totaled it. I was too loopy on Trileptal to be driving. I was taking 200 mg 3x a day when I wrecked my car. Previously, I have been hospitalized for suicidal ideation, but that experience was not as bad as being on Trileptal. Trileptal made me obsess over how to kill myself and not get caught or stopped. I became suicidal very, very quickly on this drug. If you want to kill someone secretly give them this med in their juice or smoothie and before you know it....they will attempt to kill themselves.	F	47	5  months200-600mg 1X D	7/8/2011

1	Bipolar I	Thought it was withdrawal from Effexor.  Nausea, Blurred vision, sexual impotence, heightened anxiety, exhaustion.  These side effects are still present 4 months later.  Now I know it's the trileptal.	Almost went to Pysch Hospital about 5 times now due to extreme anxiety.  Never had this anxiety on anything else.   Quit taking it today.  Started smoking again after quitting for 9 months.  My doctor told me to keep taking it but I am going to stay on Wellbutrin and Ripserdone only.  I'm using some amino acids-just basics like shakes.  Can't wait to feel better soon.		40	4  months600mg 2X D	7/4/2011Email
3	temporal lobe epilepsy	Nausea, indigestion, sleepy, darkened urine and decreased frequency, water retention/swelling, skin burning, (felt like had a sunburn) and reddened.	Started at 150 mg, but didn't develop urinary and skin problems until increased to 300 mg.  The medication pamphlet I received said the urinary problems were very serious.  Would have loved to stay on this but couldn't with side effects.  On the plus side it leveled out my moods.	F	28	2  weeks300 2X D	6/29/2011Email
5	my son has seizures. he takes it	my son is 3 and has been on it since oct. 2010 and he is very tired after taking it, and now he is having a side effect from it, its causing him to have hand tremors.	he actually takes 5ml in the morning and 6ml at bed time. and he takes this medicine at the same time every day! that is very important!! this medicine has worked so well for him! his seizure decreased tremendously once they got the dosage right!	M	3	 5mL 2X D	5/29/2011Email
4	Complex partial/generalized seizure	Tiredness, weight gain, depression, blurred vision, sensitivity to sunlight,stomach sensitivity.Side effects have been worsening since switching to generic.	Helpful in controlling seizures(nocturnal).Was on name brand initially, but cannot afford them now and have been on generic for 6 months.Put on weight, depressed and lack of motivation.Want to lay around.Never feel like I've had enough sleep.Pretty bleak when you are the sole support of your family.Have to live on pots of coffee throughout the day.But I do not have seizures which is a fair trade off I suppose.Thank you Folgers.	F	42	5  years600 MG 2X D	5/19/2011
2	depression	weird dreams,extreme mental slowness, hard to carry out conversation, still depressed	900mg at night, 150 in am. when first started experienced bad nausea(has resolved) and concentration problems (which has only gotten worse).	F	33	9  months1050mg 1X D	5/18/2011Email
1	partial Complex epilepsy	blurred/double vision, weakness, fatigue, startled, sleepy, cramps, tingling in mouth/ numb lips, dry eyes	Great to control my seizures at first but will be switching off next week.	F	22	6  months375mg 2X D	5/9/2011Email
1	Bi-Polar	I have all of a sudden developed serious nausea with unbelievable headaches		F	46	2  days40mg 1X D	5/7/2011
4	Simple Partial Seizures	None at all.	Since I started taking this drug I am seizure free.  Its only been a month, but I would usually have had at least 1 or 2 seizures in that amount of time.  I hope it stays that way. One down side to this drug is the price if you do not have insurance.  I only pay $5 for a months worth right now, but when I lose my health insurance in a few months it will be $175 dollars a month.	M	25	4  weeks300mg 2X D	4/26/2011
4	seizures	major fatigue	I have been taking trileptal for about six months now, and i have been seizure free but after being on a dose of 300mg twice a day my neurologist had me double it.  After about three to four weeks of taking 600mg twice a day I couldn't even function for a whole week....I wasn't able to work or do anything productive.  Just the simple task of straightening my hair in the morning made me have to sit down and rest.  So I ended up just going back to taking 300mg twice a day and I have been back to normal.  Other than that week of major fatigue trileptal has been great to me.	F	24	6  months300 2X D	4/6/2011
3	Bipolar	headache, bloody nose, pimples, tremors, slow thoughts, no concentration, blurry eyes	started at 150 mg for 2 weeks at bedtime & had blurred vision for about an hour after waking and had headaches for about the same upon waking for the first 4 days. Transitioned to 300 mg after 2 weeks with no differences occuring. after 1 month, tried to increase to 300mg at bedtime & 150mg upon waking. That is when I got the tremors, slow thought process & inability to concentrate.	M	40	1  months300 MG 1X D	4/3/2011Email
1	Bipolar I	nausea, dizziness, light-headed, my skin itched but there was no visible rash; body aches starting on the 4th day, throbbing headaches, sleeplessness	The side effects came on slowly and compounded until it got to be too much to handle.  By the 6th day I was lying in bed with a bucket wishing to vomit so that maybe I would feel better.  I felt so terrible that I took a pregnancy test.  It was negative, but I have NEVER been that nauseated, not even when pregnant.  Everything felt like it was spinning.  I was dizzy even with my eyes closed.  I will never swallow one of these pills again.	F	32	6  days300mg 2X D	3/12/2011
1	Bipolar 2	constant headache, constant and woresening dizziness, cross-eyed, vertigo, etc. etc. etc. etc.	This is BY FAR the WORST MEDICATION I have ever been on for bipolar and I have gone through most of them. It should be BANNED by the FDA. DO NOT TAKE THIS!!! I think I am permanetly brain damaged thanks to this drug...	F	54	3  weeks600 1X D	3/8/2011Email
3	complex partial seizures	TIRED! I could sleep 10 - 14hrs a day, dizzy, feeling off-balance like I'm falling, feeling drugged,high, or drunk. Inability to find the "right" word, memory loss, dry itchy skin, blurred vision, constipation, emotionless (don't get angry or happy), acne.  Sex drive has not been affected. Also, I don't care for alcohol anymore..weird, but I've noticed one drink feels like 2, 2 drinks feel like 4, etc.	Started low at 150mg 2x's per day.  Side effects lasted 3 months, then finally leveled out and gone by 6 months. Doc just increased me to 300mg 2x's per day.  Back to the old side effects again. I have always been active, gym 5 days a week, extreme sports. 4.0 graduate in comp science, technology field. Now I am a total drag, cant spell C-A-T, too tired to get dressed and leave my house, and did i take my meds this morning..? memory is terrible. Trileptal has controlled my seizures 100%, so I'm hoping side effects level out soon. BTW, I see comments about weight gain.  Trileptal can drop sodium levels, and your body could be craving salt, which may be translated into those wild urges for Pepperoni Pizza or Super Nachos Supreme:-) I have been adding salt to my meals, and it's kept down my cravings to "munch out" a lot more...not sure if it's all 'in my head', but I've not put on any weight...Lost weight actually (without the gym).   Drink LOTS of water on this medication, include lots of fiber in your diet, and ladies take folic acid supplements. I'll see how things look 6 months from now.

5	Brain Bleeds which lead to surgery	When I first started on Trileptal it was really hard.  The tiredness, lack of sex drive, dry skin, mouth, and eyes as well as weight gain (I've worked out for over 26 years).	I was first put on Lamictal but had an allergic reaction, so they put me on Trileptal.  My initial dosage was 1200 mg a day but as the years went by I've been able to slowly scale back and have not had a seizure since before my surgery (2006).  I just finished an ambulatory eeg and I'm waiting to see if I can come off the drugs all together.  If not, my dosage is pretty low now and that is something I can continue to live with since all of my side effects have gone.	F	51	4  years150mg 2X D	1/26/2011Email
4		Some fatigue,libido lower	This med has not pooped out on me as so many others have.  It is, along with lamictal, the best med for me!  Grateful to have found this med.  I notice also that I have no desire to drink alcohol. I wish that I found this med 20 years ago.	M	47	4  months900 2X D	1/25/2011
3	seizures	In the afternoon i take me dosage right after dinner and it immediatly kicks in and makes me feel drunk and my mouth go numb, probably does not help that i chew tobacco right after a meal either. double vision also kicks in about the same time.	so far i am seizure free and i hope it stays this way.	M	19	1  months900 2X D	1/19/2011
1	severe depression	horrible drug. side effects immediately were dry mouth, fatigue, twitching of my eye, lips, tongue, arms and legs. The tip of my tongue and my lips were constantly tingling to the point they got numb. the last night I took it, it gave me an asthma attack, then after tending to that I felt like I was having a heart attack. it felt like my blood was hurting as it ran thru my veins. Then I threw up for 6 hours straight. the next day I couldn't move at all my muscles hurt so much. horrible drug don't take it. there are better options out there. that episode was scary as I've had a heart attack before and it was very similar feeling.	my quack doctor started me off on this drug at 1800mgs. you are supposed to start at 150-300mg tops. he also started me at double the dose of wellbutrin after he took one day to wean me off Lexapro. not sure if this added to the episode I had from Trileptal.	F	28	5  days1800mg 1X D	12/30/2010Email
4	bipolar ptsd	forgot to mention the unfortunate sexual side-effects  decreased libido.  also i tried to go to 1200 but seems that 900mgs is better for me.  i take 300 in am and 600 pm.  also the price of this med is almost 200 bucks a month.  i have no insurance.  still it is worth it!

5	bipolar II	first few days, was almost knocked out by sedative effect, but cleared up within 3 days - made me drowsy, dizzy when standing up, sometimes I lose my balance, and have trouble finding the right words.	drowsy cleared up completely when I started taking 1,000 mg of Vitamin D daily. All the other effects got significantly better at 6 months -- now on it for 11 months and it's like a miracle -- I feel like myself again -- no more raging anger or spending sprees. Thank god for Trileptal.	F	42	1  years300 mg 2X D	11/14/2010
3	Seizures	Severe depression, joint pain, weight gain, memory loss, confusion, serious loss of D vitamins, fluxuating blood pressure.	Be sure to have your doctor check your vitamin D levels.  Normal is 30-100, mine was 7 after taking Trileptal.  Now on prescription-strength vitamin D supplements.  Was extremely confused, had difficult time understanding instructions or doing simple tasks.  Gained 30 lbs in 4 months.  Depression was severe.  Joint pain remained after being removed from Trileptal (didn't have any before trileptal).  Beginning to think the arthritis-like joint pain is permanent.		50	4  months750mg 2X D	10/16/2010
5	Bipolar II	Drowsiness, cross-eyed feeling, slight weight gain	I've been on several anti-anxiety, anti-depressant, anti-seizure medications and this is BY FAR the BEST!!  I had to adjust the amount of mg taken at each dose, but finally found that if i take 300 mg 4x a day, its just the right amount to work and yet not too far between doses to have side effects of my bipolar to come back.  Since the medication comes out of your system pretty fast, i can feel a difference after only 5 hours and I know i need another dose.But Trileptal works wonderfully for me.  It takes away the moodiness, the angry feelings and all other lows.  I dont feel like a zombie and I feel happy when i take it properly!!  I know I will probably be on it the rest of my life, but i'm ok with that.  :)	F	36	11  months300 4X D	8/24/2010Email
5	bipolar	numbness of lips and fingertips. While I do have constipation and dizziness and weight gain, I am on quite a few other medications for other conditions and some of those other side effects also apply to these other meds I am on.

4	Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder	I have some side effects just started takeing it loss of memory cant spell nothing anymore stomach problems	I have been on just about every Bipolar Med I am very sensitive to medication took Risperdal dont remember two months of my life.Lithum stopped working and I tried to kill my self when takeing Depakote. Trileptal has some annoying side effects but I laugh more now. Anger has decreased I no longer hit the walls I am not up to dose but this drug is seeming so far to give me my life back..........

5	Anxiety and Panic Disorders	Chronic headaches	I was taking Topamax at a very low dose and was confused a lot and my feet were falling asleep so my doctor put me on Trileptal. It seems to be working well. One of my anxiety/panic points has been driving in the car. Since I started this med, I have been driving a lot more and on the highway. Additionally, I can go out and do things with my family without being afraid of freaking out. Since I can't take anti-depressants (I am allergic) mood stabilizers are about the only thing I can take. I am happy with this - I haven't taken Xanax for 6 weeks and that in itself makes me very happy. I have had a chronic headache for the last few weeks, but I also have migraines so I figure change in meds is a good reason for it.	F	39	2  months150 MG 2X D	7/18/2010Email
5	complex partial seizures	weight gain, acne, reduced vitamin D, progesterone and sodium levels in my system, although these conditions were easily treatable with supplements and salty foods. also, some dizziness at first, but that went away.	this drug has kept me seizure free for 10 years with only subtle long term side effects.  it's worth it.  all the side effects can be counteracted with minimal effort. I recommend you supplement with vitamin D if on this drug and if female have hormone levels checked regularly.  if you gain weight like I did, I have found I can keep my weight down by significantly increasing the amount of vegetables in my meals. not sure if it's the fiber or nutrients.  I gained 35 pounds ( I was skinny though) over 3 years but lost 20 of those when I began eating better.  The weight gain didn't return.	M	44	10  years600 mg 2X D	7/12/2010
4	Borderline personality dis.	back then when i first started..i had tremors..memory loss..trouble speaking..dehydration in eyes..slow reaction to things..confusion..laziness..mild lethargy..but im very laid back due to this. Its not that i have no emotion..its that i have little reaction to conversations and events.	Just remember..this IS an epileptic medication..im getting into the END field and i know that if u are on a high dose and ur in a hurry to get off..u WILL have seizures..be sure to have ur prescriptions filled ON TIME. I had incidents where i ran out of trileptal and i took 1,200 mg per day and i blacked out 3 times in 15 minutes before school and rushed to hospital. I shook and shook then fell then got up and couldnt talk for a minute cuz i was in some state of shock. It was very scary. Do not start on a high dose either. Dont let TREMORS scare u..its usually normal with meds. This is a med u need to be patient with but it has helped me alot considering ive been on it so long. Its good to combine with an antidepressant as well like wellbutrin. I am NOT epileptic and i still had seizures during withdrawls. This medication acts/was meant for seizures but has its other purposes. Just remember to be careful. This doesnt have serious long term effects like an antipsychotic would. Thanks :]	F	20	7  years600 mg 2X D	7/11/2010
3	atypical trigeminal neuralgia	Controlled pain well but have a pretty bad rash on left forearm, not as bad on right. Ithes like crazy and looks terrible. Have had some lightheadiness or feeling like I'm falling. Often can't seem to find the words I want to say. Some memory problems. Have a lot of twitching in my fingers and hands, makes tasks like typing difficult.	I was diagnosed with atypical trigeminal neuralgia on Mar. of this year after about a month of severe pain in the left side of my face, my temple, forehead, cheek, upper teeth, roof of mouth and eye. No matter what I tried I could get no relief. I went to my doctor who refered me to a ENT who refered me to a Neurologist who prescribed oxcarbazepine. I started out on 150 mg twice a day for a week, then increased to 300 mg for the second week and finally 300 mg twice a day. Controlled pain very well but after about a month developed a rash, mostly on left arm. Looks and feels like lizard skin and itches a lot. Doctor took me off trileptal June 10 (gradually) and started me on Lyrica. Some side effects gone or reduced but rash still bad. Can't wait to see what surprizes new med has. Overall if it were not for the rash I would still take trileptal. Does anyone know if exposure to the sun causes a rash to develop while taking trileptal or any other drug, like Lyrica?

Its a toss up lol.	I stated it at a psych hosp after a history several single and combo med attempts to manage my BP. Trileptal and ECT where last on the list.

Yes this medication does make u doped up @ 1st & very drained but it is worth it if u stick with it & 600mg is the lowest doseging 2 take it will get easier! Im glad i was put on it cuz i am pregnant & its a C rated drug which makes it the best kind 2 be on when pregnant! I feel for ppl who r just put on epileptic drugs outta the blue cuz i was too. They dnt kno why i go epilepsy but so far this is better than keppra & carbatrol! Best of luck 2 all who r put on it!

1	complex partial seizures/ epilepsy	Stumbling, dizziness, somnolence, double vision, blurred vision, very foggy to brain dead, could not be left alone, markedly impaired decision making, irritable, inability to process what others were saying, blanking out.	My partner is normally a high-functioning oncology nurse and has been out of work now for over six months due to increasing frequency of seizures. I think it's too early to determine if the med helps with her seizures but unless it stops them completely, we are not going to be able to tolerate this drug. It has made her a blubbering idiot and she is simply not the same person I have known and loved for the past 8 years. She is not safe to be left at home alone due to the disabling side effects. Doctors say to keep taking it and have even increased the dosage, telling us the side effects would diminish over time. I know there are many more options but the Docs seem resistant to change.

1	Anxiety, Bipolar II	This drug has been a horror for my wife.  She has had her face swell up, trouble breathing, trouble walking, and trouble with her memory.  We were advised to reduce her medication by 150mg every three days, but once we reached below 300mg, she started to have tremors.  We increased the doses until they stopped, but now she's waking up in the middle of the night with convulsions.  I've had to up the dose back to 600mg so she doesn't suffer any permanent damage, and we will talk to her doctor this morning. ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE HOPE THE TREMORS AND CONVULSIONS ARE NOT PERMANENT.	Think twice before taking this, my wife's convulsions and tremors are really frightening.  She's taking this for Bipolar Disorder not for epilepsy.  We hope to god these effects aren't lasting or permanent.  No one seems to have an answer as to whether they are or not.  I've even called Novartis, but they weren't much help.

2	Bipolar 2	Restlessness, waking as early as 3am, anxiety, high blood sugar.	I was not on this medication for very long. I'll admit it improved my mood somewhat, but I was waking as early as 3am and feeling very restless (at first the medication made me drowsy but the longer I was on it the earlier I would wake up). It increased my anxiety to the point that I couldn't work on my uni assignments without freaking out. I had high blood sugar while I was taking it (blood sugar is normal now).

3	Bipolar 2	I was hypomanic after the death of my father in November. Began taking Depakote in early December for anger/rage/mood problems.  Psych suggested Abilify might help Depakote work better.  While my mood is better and my anger issues are nearly non-existent now, I'm finding I'm still a bit hypomanic and the Abilify creates extreme restlessness in me.  While my house has never looked better and I'm getting lots of project done, I find I can't sit still for longer than 10 minutes and by the end of the day my feet ache for being on them so long running around in the house and doing all my projects.	Together with Depakote.  Doc now prescribing propranolol for agitation/restlessness/irritability - would rather prescribe additional med for side effect than change primary meds...and I agree with his decision.  Doc now bumping me up to 10mg 1xday and propranolol 10mg 1xday.	F	36	7  weeks5mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med.

This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me.

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011

2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

I cant afford a lawyer or I would sew. SERIOUS BRAIN DAMAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!	I wish i could sew them and make it to where these companies can not sell their poison to another child teen or adult.

Worst feeling ever-it made me not able to think clearly, and keep my train of thought. I got off of it within 1-2 weeks	Spare yourself and don't try it	F	18	2  weeks 1X D	1/9/2011
2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify.

1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.

5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick.

I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again.

3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped.

Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.

I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue. Negative - I find myself much more emotional - memories, key phrases, smells, songs, pictures, etc.can bring me to tears.	M	50	9  months50 MG 1X D	4/11/2010
2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now. I have woken up from a 12 year-long medication-induced nightmare.	M	57	 15 MG 1X D	4/7/2010Email

2	Chronic Depression, Anxiety	Massive weight gain - cannot control my appetite - I am a very strong willed person and yet I cannot come close to fighting the urge to eat. When it comes to causing the "munchies" it is like pot gone nuclear (haven't had a toke in more than 35 years)	NO APPETITE CONTROL - OBSESSED WITH EATING - ANYTHING - ALL THE TIME.

2	depression	Nausea the first few days, some constipation, cloudy thinking, increased appetite	Combined with Wellbutrin XL which suddenly stopped working for me after 3 years. After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

Insomnia (but the Seroquel has completely cured that.)	Abilify has helped me like no other drug.  I am on it along with cymbalta, deplin, seroquel and ativan.  Within just a few days I was feeling better and am now able to exercise, clean my house and just moved across the country-something I could never have done during my depression.

I feel kind of leveled out, but I hate the tiredness all the time.  I can sleep for 10 hours, take my son to school, come home and go back to sleep for another couple of hours.  Then still have little to no energy for the rest of the day.  I was previously, taking 60 mg. of Cymbalta for almost 2 years, but my dr. switched me to this when I started to feel like dying again.

3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!

2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010
1	depression, of all excuses	This is to the PARENTS out there who believe that if their child looks passive on the drug it is a godsend:  Beating someone over the head with a baseball bat can also make them sit still.  Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.  No more for me. Abilify- Forgetaboutit!!!!!!!	F	57	3  days	1/30/2010Email

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.

I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug.

At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying. I am very uncomfortable giving a child this age any drug that is diagnosised by trial and error.	M	8	14  months	12/17/2009

I am taking 50 mg of lamictal concurrently with 7.5 mg abilify.  Affect is flatter, less mood swings, but more non-reactive than anything.  I'm not sure this is where I want to be. I have been able to get projects done that I had difficulty starting.  Some days I have energy, some days I don't.  I a fasting blood draw yesterday and haven't heard the results yet.  Continuing to take abilify is a quandary -- do I feel worse or better if I factor in all the weird side effects?

4	autism spectrum disorder/ bipolar	Weight gain - up to 30lb	My daughter has had tremendous improvement in energy, concentration, and mood. Before taking Abilify she was on Geodon and had terrible akathisia. It also interfered with her ability to learn, and she had to withdraw from college courses to avoid failing. (She wound up finishing college with a B average, so you can see she's normally able to learn. ) Once she got off the Geodon, the irritability and stupidness went away but she became suicidal and self-injured. Since starting the Abilify she hasn't tried suicide even once. (Before that it was 14 times in six years.) I am grateful to the Abilify, but I wish she wasn't so hungry all the time.

I take Cymbalta 60.mg and now 2 mg  abilify.I would stick with it since it works within 2 weeks.I sleep better, and  am more focused. I do eat more but I think it's the winter and I needed to feel better from the headaches. Diet tomorrow!		F	49	6  days	11/23/2009
5	Autism/ADHD/Bipolar	Muscle pain and sleepiness	My son started taking 10 MG about a year ago.  He has made drastic improvements in his schoolwork and social skills.  He is now making friends and getting good grades.  Besides the leg pain and sleepiness at night it has been great.	M	9	1.5  years	11/19/2009Email
1	bi polar	Weight gain within weeks. I felt bad enough w/o the extra pound a week.Went From 110 114 IN 3 Weeks. Very restless as well. I stopped taking my 10 abilify and continue with ambien and clonazepam	made me feel worse. I would rather deal on my own	F	39	1  months	11/15/2009
1	depression & anxiety	I took this and right away I had more energy. Even joined a Gym for the first time in my life. But than within a week my blood sugar sky rocket, I mean I was in the hospital with sugar over 600, my meter couldn't even read it, and the hospital had trouble bringing it down with fast acting insulin. Then my legs started shaking couldn't keep still. I had to go off it cold turkey because of my dangerously high sugar. It might work for some people but be careful of the side affects.		M	26	1  months	11/9/2009
4	major depression and anxiety	the first night i felt like i was coming down from meth. i adjusted the times i took my meds, because i take asprin, reglan, nexium, and effexor 75's.  i took the asprin, nexium, and reglan with dinner, and the effexor and abilify, plus a half of a klonopin at bedtime, and i sleep through the stomach upset.	the second day i felt much better.  i was able to clean a room, take care of bills, and just never thought of negative things more than twice.  this is my third day, and i was able to joke around with my husband at the store, and though i still haven't showered, i may do that tonight, after i clean the bathroom.  i have great hopes for this med, and hopefully, i won't have to take it very long.	F	47	3  days	11/8/2009Email
5	Bipolar depression	Some weight gain and insomnia.	This drug saved me from the darkest, deepest depression I have ever had to endure.  For over two years, I lost my will to see people, clean house, get dressed, etc.  After just three days on Abilify, I was able to get up, shower, go visit friends in New England (I live in South Florida), clean up my messy house and talk on the phone again.  I have gained a great deal of weight over the years from all different types of medication.  I accept the fact that medication makes me heavy and I am grateful to be heavier and sane than thin and crazy.	F	54	30  days	11/2/2009
5	Depression/Anxiety	Occasional headache.  Woke up in the middle of the night a few times but that got better.  Still sleeping well.	Doctor added 2 mg Abilify to my 10 mg Lexapro because I was still having suicidal thoughts despite the Lexapro.  Its worked great so far and has been a real boost in energy and mood.	M	17	5  weeks	11/2/2009
4	anxiety, paranoia and major depress	restlessness at 20 mg, eye tic at l5 mg, now down to 2 mg daily.  No weight gain at all on any of the doses.	Because of side effects including diabetes risk tried to go cold turkey at l0 mg.  Okay for about 2 weeks then experienced major nervousness, disorientation, jaw clenching, etc.  Now taking 2 mg. daily and feeling much better.  Still worried about side effects.  Not taking any other drug along with it.  Still experiencing anxiety but it is manageable.  You must wean yourself off this drug and not try to quit at once.	F	62	3  months	11/2/2009
3	ADHD	uncontrollable muscle movements, especially when in the car.	My son has been on Abilify (1 mg) for over a year.  We started on .5 mg because of his weight.  I did not want to medicate my child but I had no choice.  He was diagnosed at 2 with ADHD, but I didn't believe the psychologists because it's hard to diagnose something like that at age 2.  He is also ODD.  Last summer he was almost kicked out of daycare because of impulsivity, aggression, and inablility to sit still.  The Abilify worked for him then and continues to work.  I would love, however, if he didn't need it but now he's in kindergarten and has to take it to get through the day.  I was also able to get him a 504 plan with the school since I got another diagnosis at age 4 which was ADHD.	M	5	1.5  years	11/2/2009Email
2	add on for depression	none except rapid and major weight gain	I was very hopeful at first. I felt improvement after the 3rd day when this was added to my Wellbutrin. But in 5 months time, I gained 40 lbs on a petite, 100 lb frame!! I'm really struggling to lose it, and am currently discontinuing because of it. People that I bump into at stores and such ask when I'm due!!Really too bad, I had no other side effects. but now I'm left with this big mess with my weight to clean up.	F	34	5  months	10/29/2009
1	GAD/Depression	weight gain, extreme fatigue, depression worse	I was taking 2 mg of Abilify last Spring after Paxil didn't seem to be working as much any more. I felt ok then I felt bad again. Dr put me on 5 mg of Abilify. I feel terrible!  Extremely tired- so much so that I can barely move. I am going to ween my self off immediately.	F	47	6  months	10/28/2009
3	Mood stabilizer along with Zoloft	I took 1 mg daily and it helped but caused too many side effects. I'm very med-sensitive. I've stopped Zoloft at this point.	I was on Zoloft and Abilify but stopped both due to weight gain. After a lot of research I'm adding Abilify back at 1 mg every three days. I'm very med-sensitive and tend to respond at lower doses than other people do. Will be back to post how this goes. Something has to help. I'm a wack-job right now. Can't control my thoughts and I dwell on bad stuff too much. Can't get sad events out of my mind etc. I have to give Abilify another chance at a reduced dose.	F	62	 	10/27/2009
4	Oneiric states	jittery at low doses, sleepy at high	It has helped me stop feeling like I'm in a dream all the time                                   but my mood is only a little better so far	F	59	3  weeks	10/25/2009
2	Depression	Insomnia, chest pain, blurry vision	Only on 0.5 mg. for three days.  Horrible insomnia no matter what time of day I take med.  Makes me drowsy during the day, hard to tell if my mood is improving due to the side effects.	F	35	3  days	10/24/2009
5	major depressive episode	Energy and hope restored.  Insomnia, head ache, speedy, shaky,visual disturbance,constipation.	Hopefully the side effects subside as my body gets used to the med.  I'm not willing to stop taking the med as I feel so much better with just 2mg of Abilify as an adjunct to Lexapro.  I have hope again.  I got my butt out of bed by day 3 (went shopping) then cleaned the house on day 5.  What a change from the depths of deep epression to my old self in less than a week...WOW!	F	46	10  days	10/23/2009
3	bipolar II	agitation, shakiness, acne, loss of libido, weight gain, inability to urinate	This med helped stabilize my mood a bit, but I could not get the full benefit because I could not increase the dose.  Every time I would go up on the dose, I would be hit by an avalanche of side-effects.  Had to get off eventually.	F	26	5  months	10/23/2009
3	To help my mood	Strange itching in my nose. I made myself bleed by trying to scratch it but couldn't help myself. It tasted good so I'm okay with it.	I've had depression of one kind or another most of my life.  I wanted to feel normal.  But, I ran out of samples after a week.  It wasn't long enough to find out if it would help.	M	56	7  days	10/22/2009
3	Mood Disorder	My son is 9 years old. He started in June on a mood stabilizer.  Abilify 5 mg, worked on mood, however he has gained 25 pounds. He can not stop eating.  He even sneaks food!! I don't know what the doctor is thinking.  We are taking him off.		M	9	4  months	10/19/2009
5	Bipolar Disorder	Very hungry, but able to manage it. Some difficulty sleeping, usually for an hour in the middle of the night. Spending money a little more than usual. Initially had a few days of headaches, not major.	This drug immediately snapped me out of low-grade depression that was steadily worsening. I started taking 2 mg of Abilify each morning and all of my depression symptoms lifted. I only realized how bad my concentration had been because it was so improved on this drug. Like others have said, I lost my hyper-sensitivity to people and situations and replaced that with a high tolerance for life's challenges -- big & small. The side-effects are very minimal at this point, but I'll be paying attention to see if this continues. Lastly, the fact that it works so quickly is a powerful asset if it works for you.	F	39	2  weeks	10/17/2009
1	depression/schizoaffective	can't stop pacing, feel like someone is inside me trying to get out of my skin, insomniac, no sex drive, having to put car into park at stoplights to keep from ramming into someone in front of me; insane.	i stopped taking this today and hope to G-d it doesn't last long in my bloodstream.	F	29	2  weeks	10/16/2009
2	possible bipolar	feel like a crack addict, hard to even sit here and type, hitting wrong keys, clenching jaw, restless beyond belief	on 10 mg...gained about 5-7 pounds, doc swears I need it, am bipolar but w out mania, just very low lows.......need to get off this but afraid of geodon...feel like a speed freak.  sleep is my only relief.............	F	38	6  weeks	10/7/2009
1	Mood stabalizer	makes me gain weight, tired, not sure if it is what causes memory loss, fatigue, moodiness, irratability.		F	35	2  years	10/7/2009
5	Anxiety, depression, mild mania.	Jitters, sleepiness, stomach distress.	This drug is very strong and very good.  I am taking 2 mg in conjunction with 7.5 mg of Lexapro.  It has reduced my severe PMS and helped me with my previous need to sleep 11 hours a day.  Note that I am on one tenth of the recomended starting dosage for someone who is bi-polar; I can only imagine the side effects, however for my purpose it has been a god send.	F	29	1  months	10/3/2009
1	Bi-polar	pacing, high blood sugar, foamy urine, severe thirst, fatigue, pancreatitis, kidney damage	Please stop taking the Abilify immediately.  My husband was prescribed Abilify and it almost killed him. He was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis for 10 days and then on home care hooked up to ivs for another 2 weeks. He is now diabetic and needs to take insulin shots 4 times a day. He is on a very strict low-fat no-sugar diet and may never have even a sip of alcohol ever again. His pancreas is permanently damaged. We are very lucky he is alive. Abilify is evil. Please do not take it. It will kill you.	M	30	 	9/30/2009Email
5	depression, OCD	more alert, motivated, racing thoughts greatly diminished, some nausea, no weight gain!	I was leery about taking this, others make it sound like a nightmare drug. I have no doubt that it affects some people badly, but for me, it made a huge difference. I do wonder if this will wear off after a few months, but so far 5 mg have allowed me to think clearly, get off the couch and accomplish things. No weight gain but dr has me on Metformin to regulate blood sugar and cravings, so that might be the trick there. Important for everyone to monitor their own reactions carefully, or ask family members to help, because every drug works differently for every person. YOU know best what helps YOU.	F	45	2  months	9/19/2009
3	depression/ bipolar	flattening/apathy, word-finding problems, short-term memory loss, trouble concentrating, not able to articulate thoughts and feelings, muscle weakness. To be fair, it made me manic for the first month I took it, which was wonderful, and I say I'm not depressed now, but is apathy really that different from depression?	When trying to stop taking 5mg, severe akathasia that literally kept me from sleeping at all. I'm tapering, now on 2.5mg, but still fearful that I will have the same symptoms when I discontinue again. Feeling a little trapped.	M	35	7  months	9/17/2009
3	Childhood Bipolar, ODD	WEIGHT GAIN, MUSCLE PAIN/STIFFNESS	My son has shown improvement in mood, decreased mood swings, more even temperament, however, he constantly complains about pain in his feet and legs. He describes as burning, stinging pain, mostly in his feet. We have observed more nasal stuffiness. He appears short of breath, at times, however, we are linking this to his weight gain (approx 12 lbs) and history of asthma. We are still observing and waiting to gauge any affect in cognitive abilities (school grades). Time will tell if the side effects are actually worth taking the medication.	M	11	3  months	9/16/2009
1	Bipolar 2-PTSD	Eating abnormal amounts - lethargy - no libido - no personality - sweating	This shit, and yes I say this profanely because that's what it is. It made me more depressed than ever. Yes the headaches and voices went away. But it made me socially anxious , paranoid , ripped me of my self esteem and made me gain weight because all I did and wanted to do was eat. I am an athlete, model, and full time mom. I kissed my life goodbye when taking this shit. Desparate, I stopped taking it. Which made life even more worse. I wanted to kill myself so badly because I wanted the pain to go away. It's all in my head. Mind over matter. I'll be the moodswingin crazy gal I am than risk my life. Also causes muscle weakness. Lucky to be able to carry anything up a damn flight of stairs. All in all, just stay away!!! Spent the whole summer in bed sleeeeping getting fat and suicidal. Whack!!!	F	25	2  months	9/14/2009
1	GAD/BPII/PTSD/OCD	Severe depression/out of touch	I was on Abilify for three weeks.  I started with the 10 mg for two weeks and up to 25 the third week.  On the 10 mg I started feeling "funny" and experiencing some side effects.  By the third week I was self mutlilating (something I have not done in 15 yrs.  I was so depressed I could not function at any level, very irritable and people just were too much to deal with.  All I wanted to do was sleep and just disappear.  My Therapist said it was like I did a 180 in two weeks and was so concerned she called my Psych.  After seeing my Psych, she immediately took me off it and put me on Geodon...not sure if that is a possitive change or not.	F	37	3  weeks	9/14/2009
3	Bi Polar 2	Akathesia, insomnia, anxiety, weight gain, head aches	The Akathesia was awful.  I would lie in bed thinking I was weak or flu-ish, but once in bed I could not get comfortable.  My workouts decreased as I felt weak, dizzy, short of breath, lost balance while stretching. My face would sweat way more than normal.  I could tell I was starting to gain weight and would pack on the pounds rapidly if I did not stop taking this. Since exercise is therpeutic for me, the abilify took that away from me.  BUT it did help control my mood swings (by making me feel like an emotionless zombie) and the need to act out my irritability. However, inside I felt increasing anxiety and irritability.  The side effects just aren't worth it.	F	30	2  months	9/8/2009
3	Depression/Anxiety	I have gained 20 pounds and am not eating any more than normal.  The medicine definitely lifted my depression, but the weight gain now has me looking like a pig.  And, it seemed to increase my libido.	Started off with 5 mg; now am down to 2.5... but, because of the weight gain, I am asking to get off of this medication.	F	40	4  months	9/5/2009
1	anxiety	Akithesia	Do not take this med. I had severe akithesia whereby I had a constant feeling of having to 'move' It was exhausting and I thought it would never leave which made me feel even more panicked. It was the most scared I'd ever felt on a medicine. Before this I truly never paid attention to side effects on labels, now I do.	F	38	 	8/29/2009
4	Bi-Polar	Akathisia, increased libido, insomnia	Loved it the first week until the Akathisia kicked in.  Then I wanted to jump out the car while it was moving... Halfed my dosage, no help.  Halfed the dosage again, no help.  Now I am on 1/8 of the pill.  Akathisia is gone, but increased libido went away.  Still have insomnia taken care of by Ambien.	F	46	1  years	8/28/2009Email
5	for incentive, to mk decisions	none except lots of hope, energy, lack of fear,loss of procrastination, able to make decisions, ability to focus just an all around zest for life with unlimited happiness	If your anti depressant or anti anxiety meds work but you still have no energy, ask your Dr to add Abilify. I had never heard of it but now instead of thinking of everything I need and want to do I am optimistic and bubbling with enthusiasm and energy. Now instead of reading all day long I am cleaning and doing hobbies, kyaking, running, dancing and marching with my grandchildren Whats next a sea plane ride and travel. Was just weeks ago I was close to Agoraphobia. If your meds only get you to the bottom of the mountain looking up and wishing you would, try Abilify, you will climb that mountain, maybe even run up it and then dance on the top!!!	F	62	3  weeks	8/23/2009
2	bi polar 2	weight gain, sugar cravings, excessive sleepiness, inability to exercise (no stamina, gasping for breath)	It helped with irritability (because nothing seemed to matter) but left me unable to live normally and my friends all asked if something was wrong because I was so quiet and getting more quiet with each passing day.  Because the side effects were so crippling, I have stopped taking Abilify and switched to Geodon.	F	60	4  months	8/18/2009
1	Bipolar I	Akathisia, loss of interest in life, Always sleepy, high anxiety, catatonia	Got really bad Akathisia after only 3 days on 10mg. Was taken during a bad manic/pschotic state so was forced to stay on it. Initially was bumped to 20mg which made me catatonic. Back to 10mg kept hallucinating. Added Cogentin, made Akathisia go away but severe anxiety came in it's palce along with lack of motivation and no interest in anything. Severe confusion followed. This sucked my will to live. The Akathisia was so severe I was suicidal.	M	32	7  months	8/17/2009
3	depression; withdrawal aid	VERY rapid weight gain (10 lbs in a month!), constipation, swollen legs and feet, back pain	GOOD NEWS: This drug helped me in the horrible phase of discontinuing Cymbalta.  I was no longer moody and nasty-tempered.  BAD NEWS: the fact that my face is so puffy I now look like a fatter, older version of myself and I now have GOBS of fat in places I never gained weight before (back of arms, waist) proves this stuff is POISON.  It may inhibit thyroid function, because I am not eating more than I usually do (in fact my appetite is less than normal--wierd!) yet I am piling on weight. The constipation, nausea and fatigue aren't fun either.  And I look like CRAP: bloated, haggard, pale, and unhealthy. Phasing off this med asap!	F	31	2  months	8/14/2009Email
5	depression	I have experience swelling of the calves. This may not be related to the Abilify, as I have had a kidney transplant.	My family has a history of serious depression to the point of being institutionalize. For many years now my brother and I have tried one drug after another. Nothing helped us 'open the curtains'. Two mg of Abilify each morning, after just a couple of days, has given us our lives back. This is a miracle drug for both my brother and my self. I must include, we have only been on this medicine for two or three weeks.	M	60	18  days	8/8/2009Email
5	wellbutrin	somewhat more tired, some difficulty urinating..	A Great help.. relieved pain in my shoulders and elbows.. and has rid me of most of my suicidal or weird thoughts and voices.	M	57	25  days	8/5/2009
4	bi-polar 1 disorder	nausea, vomiting, insomnia	I am 5mg, for just about a week, first 2 days I was very hostile, last 4 days restless with insomnia and cant eat much.However I have energy, I get things done, I am back to being social which I was not for over a year and half. No fears of public and can focus to read, play games etc.  My patience level is much better.  Just would like to know when the insomnia and nausea will pass.	M	41	1  weeks	8/5/2009Email
2	Possbile Bipolar 2	Extreme sweating, extreme nausea, weird chest movement, insomnia	Been on Celexa for 10 years now, up and down in dose as lifes stresses went up and down... 40mg now for past 2 years. Doctor added abilify for possible Bipolar 2. I took at 7pm and within 2 hours I was sweating profusely and kept doing so for the next 24 hours, then it started to go away. I wasn't hot, I even cranked up the air conditioner, didn't help at all. I soaked my clothes and sheets. This caused some dehydration which didn't help the nausea. That was also extreme. I never actually vomited but still laid on the bathroom floor just in case. The first few bouts of it I could barely move. I was flushed and weak and trembling it was so bad.I also couldn't sleep, which I'd already been fighting insomnia the past few months. But this made it worse as I couldn't sleep more then 10-30 mins at a time. The constant sweating didn't help when trying to sleep.I'm not saying don't take this med. I dealt with bad nausea for weeks when I first started it, and also when I went without for over a week. Just wanted to share what happened to me	F	32	1  days	8/2/2009
5	major depression/Bipolar	None really..Some initial insomnia but got better with time. Sexual sides are minimal and never a problem	A great medicine.It worked the 1st day I took it (5 mg)..I felt so much better..NOTHING has worked for me except Abilify and Parnate. People love to rant and rave when something is not working for them. Fine. But please don't tell other people to stay away from the drug because it doesn't work for you. If your having a hard time finding something that works, try this med. It works quickly so you'll know if it's for you without having to wait 2-4 weeks.	M	49	60  days	7/31/2009
1	Bipolar Disorder	Weight Gain	I was taking this medicine for about half a year and was recommended to not go off of it. In this six month period I gained 67 pounds. It also made it very hard to lose the weight afterward. Here I am almost two years later, and I am five pounds away from getting rid of the 67 I initially gained. Although the weight is gone, the stretch marks remain and still will. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE.	F	22	6  months	7/27/2009
5	schizo personality disorder	I LOVE ABILIFY!!  It is my favorite antipsychotic.  Side effects range from mild tiredness and hunger spells to insomnia at bed time.  But that helps with Ambien CR which my doc loves to prescribe like candy to me!  Abilify helps tremendously with voices and does not give me the akathisia movement disorder like the "dones" risperidone and ziprasidone antipsychotic do 100% of the time.	This medicine is a mild antipsychotic when it comes to side effects when compared to other antipsychotics.  I would recommend ABILIFY (aripiprazole) over the other atypical antipsychotics any day.	M	29	6  years	7/23/2009
1	Schizophrenia	Couldn't stop moving, couldn't sleep.  Paranoid, anxious.	This is hell.	M	18	4  weeks	7/22/2009
1	major life long depression	I had a STROKE after 9 days on this awful medicine. I've been on wellbutrin for years and started to feel a deeper depression than normal. My psychiatrist put me on Abilify as a boost. Within 3 days I became very confused and very tired. It was the weekend, on Monday I called the doctor. He said it was the side effects and would clear up, that I had only been on it 6 days. On Thursday, I called and told him that I was stopping it. In addition to the confusion, I was having a hard time talking. He said the side effects would probably be gone by my appointment. They got worse! I couldn't remember how to use my utensils, my toothbrush etc. I couldn't spell or write, was mixing up the phone number even if I was looking at it. Monday, he still felt that it was side effects but at my insistence he sent me right to a neurologist, who ran me through a number of tests. He agreed that it was side effects. If I wasn't better in 3 weeks, he'd do a CAT scan. After 1 week insisted on the scan and lo	I was 62 years old and do not have dementia. My doctor did not consider me elderly. At what age does the drug company consider elderly? My doctor said that this shouldn't have happened. I am better but not back to the way I was before Abilify and the stroke. After 13 months I don't feel that I am getting any better and I honestly feel the problems I am still having are permanent. But it could have been worse, I wasn't paralyzed! Even with the computer, this write up has taken me 2 1/2 hours to compose.	F	63	9  days	7/15/2009Email
