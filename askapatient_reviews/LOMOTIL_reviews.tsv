5	IBS-D	little dizzy some days but not too bad. The IBS was way worse. I love this drug..took my pain and D away. I can go out and have a life.	If your doctor gives you this for IBS-D .  give it a try and may it help you as much at it has me.	F	49	5  years 2X D	9/20/2012Email
5	Celiac Disease/Nervous diarrhea	Light headedness, drowsiness, blurred vision	This is drug was made by angels! I have a life again after suffering from diarrhea daily for roughly 4 years being housebound from the ages of 19-23 i missed out on a lot but now thanks to these tiny little miracles im back at work and out and about! The drowsiness etc i get from time to time but its nothing too bad..	F	24	3  months25mg 2X D	7/22/2011Email
5		Mild bloating, occasional constipation.	I started taking it several years ago due to diarrhea from being in nervous situations.  What a Godsend.  It helped me relax and not have to worry about panicking when I could not find a bathroom right away. I don't take it on a daily basis and the most I usually take is 2 tabs once daily.		46	20  years	6/27/2009Email
5	Severe IBS-D	Dry mouth	Absolute "godsend".  I had the worst case of IBS my specialist had ever seen. (8-12 severe bouts of diarehha a day.)  I hadn't left my house for 6 months at that point - couldn't leave home without extreme panic attacks.  Just 2 tiny pills in the morning stops my diarrhea, cramps, gas, everything!  I can go out in public, eat in public, drive, have a job, etc. I have a life because of this drug.	M	42	7  years	5/20/2009
4	crohns disease, fistula..3 surgerie	fatitgue, dry mouth, blurred vision, dizziness	I have taken lomotil consistently for 4 years after my last surgery.  I have taken as many as 8 a day, 2 at a time with each meal.  The side effects are taking its toll so I am going to look for something different, like cholysterimine (sp)again.	M	46	4  years	4/16/2009Email
5	IBS	None	I really like Lomotil.  I used to take Bentyl but it didn't work very well.  The only thing I dislike is having to take pills several times a day (at least twice).  It works pretty quickly and I feel pretty safe being away from restrooms as long as I have taken a couple of doses.	F	36	7  months	9/8/2008
5	constant diarreaha	fine for first 2 years, since then experienced variety of curious problems that have no answer. I've been depressed to the point of bringing on panic attacks. I didnt know what they were so went into partial paralysis with severe pins and needles to the extreme of pulling car over and was found on side of dual carraigeway by bikers in complete mess! Now can be very moody and depressed easily and feel panic attack starting but now can control easily with breathing exercise.		M	40	3  years	3/19/2008
5	IBS	Little sweating but that's it.	The only drug that works on my IBS.	M	40	5  years	1/2/2008
5	ibs	It stops the diarrhea.  However, when it wears offf the syspoms come back.		F	60	 	12/23/2007
3	diarrhea	euphoria, constipation,moderate abdominal pain	13 mths ago I came down w/ IBS; the first 3 mths. it was d-dominant and PCP prescribed Lomotil. The rx was for 2 tabs 3 times a day; I got so stoned I couldn't move; next day pleasant hangover but very constipated! I then took only two a day, which didn't stop d but minimized it (once in a.m..)I read up on Lomotil and no surprise it contained a mild opiate. The Dr. overprescribed, gave me 60 tabs with 4 refills!My IBS became more c-dominant after 3 mths so I only take about 2 lomotil a mth for occasional d.I still have 10 tabs left from 2nd refill after a yr. Lomotil IMPOSSIBLE to take for kicks or any reason other than d. The atropine will cramp you.	M	55	90  days	8/31/2007
5	diareaha	None	Works great- I only take it occasionally- when needed.	F	36	5  years	5/18/2007
1	Severe Diarrhea	Dry mouth, drowsiness, those went away. Then PANCREATITIS that because I was taking the lomotil for extended peiod of time turned into chronic pancreatitis.	Be VERY careful, if you have ANY abdominal pain, stop taking it and tell your doctor	F	32	4  years	8/24/2006
4	IBS-D	Dry mouth, fatigue, and nausea if I take more than one dose in an 8 hour period.	In combination with Imodium, it keeps my IBS-D under control.  I take one pill in the AM and one at bedtime.  I've tried cutting back, but the diarrhea & cramping return.	M	46	10  years	2/9/2006
5	IBS-D	Slight nausea in the beginning, slighly drowzy, dry mouth, but not as bad as imodium	Works great, no cramping like with imodium, no adverse reaction as I have had more than once with imodium	M	35	12  months	8/13/2005
5	IBS-D	No side effects whatsoever, except it took away all my IBS symptoms, including cramping, gas and diarrhea. So far, so good. It's been just a few days and something had to change because I was taking almost 100 Imodium every two weeks. Just a little dry mouth was the only side effect but I can live with that, compared to the other symptoms of IBS-D(	It's just too bad you need a WRITTEN prescription for this medication and that your doctor can't call a new one in. I think it's because of the narcotic ingredient, even though it is on such a miniscule amount. Oh well. To me, it will be worth the time and visit and I'll ask for more so I won't have to go back for a new prescription. However, with my prescription plan I have to be half-way through my Rx before they will refill. So I'll have to wait 15 days before filling another Rx. But that's ok.	F	50	3  days	4/16/2005
4	Crohn's Colitis	Sleepy, dry eyes and mouth, general fatigue/mild depression	When I take it at night it helps to get through the night w/o getting up as much with bm's. Definitely helpful with cramps but does not get rid of diarrhea completely.	F	38	2  weeks	3/27/2005
5	ibs	none	worked well,gi system normalized,not too strong like immodium	F	38	2  years	1/1/2005
3	Diarrhea	Anxiety, short temper	The drug works but it is not good for long term use.	M	38	2  years	10/16/2004
5	UPSET STOMACH	NONE	VERY GOOD - TAKE ON WAKING EVERY DAY. HAVE GOT MY LIFE BACK.	F	44	8  months	10/13/2004
5	chronic diarreah, ibs	none	it's a lifesaver	F	57	 	9/7/2004
5	Crohn's colitis	grogginess	It works better for me than Imodium, but I use Imodium when I drive.  I only take it occasionally.	F	44	8  years	2/23/2004
4	diarrhea with Crohn's	It makes me sleepy.	Lomotil stops diarrhea, and it stops it fast. I recommend.	F	29	1  years	1/25/2003
4	Crohn's disease	Side effects included [until I was used to the med] fatigue, dry mouth,  a bit of gas.	This med has been a great "bandaid" in my doctor's words.  But I have been taking it for quite some time and it has in the past been able to manage my disease.	F	39	2  years	1/22/2003
5	crohns disease	drowsiness		F	27	2  years	3/27/2002
