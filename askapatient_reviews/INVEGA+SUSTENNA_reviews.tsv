3	bipolar	This drug is a break through in delivery medicine.  Sustenna replaced my Consta Shots.	I only have to take one shot a month.  Thats equivalent to 30 or more pills a month.  There talking about delivering the medicince through an inhaler.  I don't think it's in testing for Sustenna, but I read articles about Consta being distributed through inhaling the medicine versus injecting into your arm.  The side effects are not fun for the medicine and I hope to not take it much longer.  After taking this medicine, there sometimes feels like there is no alternative.  The injections are sometimes sacry, but i'm use to them from being on Consta.  I some times feel desperate and alone because this drug takes away all your feel good emotions.

3	schizophrenia	tired, less energy, elevated prolactin, weight gain, depression.  Injected into shoulder.	Updated version of Risperdal Consta bi weekly.  Sustenna only has to be taken every month vs two weeks for Consta.  Been on both.  Like Sustenna a lot better, because of less injections.  It made Consta obsolete to me.
