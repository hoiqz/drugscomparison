3	osteoporosis	Hair Loss -It is getting really thin and everyone is noticing.  I am seeing a Dermatologist next week but may be too late for me?  I don't want to lose bone, but I don't want to lose my hair either.  I am a female.		F	60	3  months 1X D	2/16/2013
5	osteoporosis	I'm taking Calcitonin Salmon, same as Miacalcin, and have had no side effects at all. What a relief after taking the awful Fosamax.		F	55	3  months 1X D	12/23/2010
2	Osteoporosis	Painful pimples (whiteheads) that took forever to go away; mostly in my nostrils and eyebrows, some in mouth. More sinus congestion.	Very expensive; I saw no improvement in the joints but the aggrivation and pain of the whiteheads convinced me not to finish the bottle. Wondering if others had this experience.	F	70	30  days	6/17/2009Email
1	Osteoperosis	Severe pain and enlargemnet of the lympnodes. Pain in joints, and so tired I could not exercise. Also, all recent dental surger keeps getting infected and is painful		M	48	365  days	6/10/2009Email
5	Osteoporosis	None	I really like taking Miacalcin. Its the only one that I don't get side effects. Has anyone had a bone scan and has it helped?	F	54	10  months	4/19/2009Email
4	Osteoporosis	I experienced hair loss.  I found out this only happens in 1% of the people.  I really liked Miacalcin...had no other side effects.  Fosamax and Actonel made me violently ill.  I do not know what I am going to do now.  Doctor took me off Miacalcin only today.		F	67	5  months	3/24/2009
2	osteoporosis	No side effects at all. And I usually react to drugs. Easy to use nasal spray	Osteoporosis was worse, not better, after 1 year. Went to an osteoporosis specialist, who said Miacalcin is not a very effective drug. Guess he was right. Basically threw away $500 in copays.	F	55	12  months	5/2/2008
5	osteoporosis	None	Easy to use. Had to stop Actonel after only 2 doses due to severe pain in esophagus and stomach.	F	57	2  months	3/15/2008
5	severe osteoporosis	None at all.	It is the only one I trust to take. I have no side effects at all.	F	56	7  months	3/7/2008
5	Mod. to severe osteopenia	None at all -- very easy to take...one spray in alternating nostrils at night.	I took Actonel and ended up with an ulcer. My doctor switched me to Miacalcin 3 years ago, and my bone density has increased each year since, going up 10% each year. I also walk 30 minutes most days, and do PiYo (pilates/yoga hybrid) classes 3-5 hours each week. Also take 600 mg. calcium citrate + D each day.	F	59	3  years	2/12/2008Email
3	osteroposis	just going into my 3rd month.  I have been experiencing sinus pressure in my nose, I have a headache, my pinky finger is throbbing, my joints ache, I cough at night and I feel flu-like.  These are the same symptoms I had with actonel when I took it.  My 3rd month I ended up in E.R with severe chills, back and side pain.  It was terrifying.  This is my last chance before running out of drugs.  I wont take Evista either. I really want this Miacalcin to work, but I don't know how much longer I can stand this.		F	54	3  months	8/12/2007
5	osteoporosis	none whatsoever	My mother had sever osteoporosis, so I'm naturally concerned that I'll end up the same way. I take this nasal spray first thing in the morning. I also take 600mg Calcium Carbonate with Vitamin D with breakfast and dinner. I haven't gone for a followup bone scan yet, but I can tell you that my loose teeth are now rock solid, so I think it must be working. I had a terrible reaction to both Actonel and Evista and am glad to find something that has no side effects	F	54	2  months	4/27/2007
4	osteoporosis	None....in fact, I have way fewer sinus problems in the years I have been using this spray.		F	70	3  years	2/28/2007
2	osteoporosis	Took Actonel first and got terrible stomach aches. Dr. put me on Miacalcin in April 06 . Not sure yet if it was from Miacalcin, but I had severe pain in my legs and hips. Had difficulty getting up from a sitting position. Woke up numerous times during the night with terrible pain in legs and hips.I stopped taking it Monday and already I think I feel better, at least I'm hoping. I just never thought the medication might be causing it. And I'm still not 100% sure that that is what was causing it.	I'm just on Combipatch HRT now and taking Calcium pills and a multivitamin every day. And watching my diet and trying to get more exercise. I'm hoping that is enough to stop the progression of this disease. Anyone else out there that had the same problem??	F	53	7  months	11/17/2006
2	osteopenia	Headache, flu-like symptoms, joint pain, particularly hip pain	Had to discontinue Fosamax due to severe jaw pain. Will be discontinuing Miacalcin because of severe hip pain.	F	58	3  months	11/5/2006
3	Osteoporosis	No idea, of course, if it's from the Miacalcin, but I've got a drippy nose and am extremely fatigued.		F	60	12  days	9/12/2006
2	Osteoporosis	Dull headache not feeling like myself at all, I had the shacks like I had to much caffeine. I do not dring anything with caffeine. I have tried Fosomax and Boniva I had to discontune bothe of them.		F	46	 	8/15/2006
