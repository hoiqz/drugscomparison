5	Hashimoto's thyroiditis	This medication resolved many of the health effects I was having from auto-immune hypothyroidism.  My wrist joint and foot pain subsided.  My unprovoked mood swings and anger subsided.  I no longer has mood-related PMS symptoms.	Very thankful for this medication!  It has changed my life and made me a much nicer person to be around.

1	Hypothyroidism	Went from 118 pounds to 124 pounds, swollen eye lids, frequent urge to urinate, diarrhea, pelvic pain	Thanks to Shirley Grose, a thyroid patient, for sharing with us the following powerful letter she wrote to her doctor, after he insisted on prescribing Synthroid (a brand name synthetic levothyroxine sodium/T4 thyroid hormone replacement drug) instead of the Armour Thyroid (a brand name naturally derived T4/T3 drug) she'd been taking. (See "A Quick Look at Thyroid Hormone Replacement" for more about these different drugs.) Shirley's letter is strong and clearly asks many excellent questions many people want answered. She's generously agreed to allow her letter to be posted for other thyroid patients to read or modify for their use, in the hopes that it might help empower her fellow thyroid sufferers who are having the same problems with their doctors. (Note: Shirley's doctor never responded...)	F	71	30  days50 McG 1X D	1/5/2011
1	For hypothyroid	As a person who would not expect to have any side effects I felt a buzzed head the first day on this one. Second day I felt slightly queasy at the end of the day and from each day after I had a gassy stomach.It got to the point where I knew it was not for me. Would not recommend this pill at all and am surprised that the Drs office acted like there would be no side effects.Drs office was unhelpful-would not even change brands when I asked.I was thinking maybe the stomach upset happened from taking it on the empty stomach which you are supposed to do.
