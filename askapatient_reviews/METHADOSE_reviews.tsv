1	Chronic pain	I could not stay awake, bump into walls, lost weeks of my life due to not much memory while on this drug, severe vomiting, constipation, and an anaphylactic reaction..my lips and tongue swelled. I ended up in the ER where doc said I was having adverse reaction to methadone. I was so sick during this time I lost 4 lbs and I am not a large woman so four lbs. was a lot to lose. I could not eat for more than a week after stopping this medication. This medication is a very serious medicine and should not be given as first choice as many pain doctors seem to do nowadays.	Please only take this medicine as prescribed as it can have very serious side effects when taking as prescribed and even worse if not followed exactly as prescribed.	F	51	2  weeks	10/8/2009

5	severe back pain	sweating,decreased sexual function,itching,dental carries at the root of the tooth beneath the gumline,dry mouth, constipation	I was a competitive figure skater for 10 years. Six hours a day six days a week. Began having low back pain at the age of 15. After having three children the pain progressively became unbearable resulting in depression and thoughts of ending it all. Started out on Vicodin, Lortab, Norco progressed to Oxycontin.  The Oxycontin was very constipating among other unpleasant side effects.  As a nurse of 23 years I was apprenhesive to even try the Methadone given it's reputation.  I finally gave in and found the Methadose to be less harsh on the constipation and was less "heavy" feeling than the morphine. I was not informed about the effect on my teeth (they are basically rotting from the roots) nor about the near impossibility of getting off of it should I choose. I despise being controlled by a pill but I must admit the drug has been a God send in my life. It has allowed me to be an active mom and wife and to participate in things that I was previously unable to do.	F	42	8  years	1/31/2009
5	opiate addiction	sweating, constipation	This medication saved my life after 20 years of active opiate addiction and 13 trips through rehab!  I cannot say enough good things about it! If only people would learn what it is and how it works before making prejudiced and ignorant remarks about it.	F	44	4  years	5/8/2008Email
4	Chronic Pain management	Tired, numbness, dry mouth & addiction	I started taking this about 8 years ago and even had to continue with it after Back Surgery about 3 years ago. Probably the best Pain Management medication out there if you have to continue taking 1 thing. Warning, this is addictive & I am addicted. However, the benefits outweigh the bad side effects. I am very drug intolerant and have tried every other Pain pill out there, they either give me Nasuea, Constipation or Dizziness. Methedose or Methedone became the only viable alternative for me. Fortunately I have not had to increase my dose in 8 years.	M	41	8  years	7/8/2007
5	RLS and insomnia	I do not experience any side effects except what one would on a drug in this catagory. dozey,calm, relaxed.	it cured my restless leg syndrome. use it in combo with klonopin.	F	49	3  years	6/6/2007Email
4	fractured spinal cord in back/pain	tierdness/constipation/light headedness	it helps pain a great deal and last a long time for me	F	22	1  months	9/25/2006Email
5	chronic pain from leg amputation	Mild buzz but not as disorienting as oxycodone or hydrocodone. It does make a person relaxed and should not be used when a person is driving or doing something potentially hazardous.	Definitely habituating when used long term. I have run out before my prescription was due for refill and I felt very "blah". I tried to quit a couple of times and the withdrawal, while mild, was truly annoying. No regular withdrawal symptoms (like with regular opiates) but I felt sluggish,"blah", tired and had listless. My pain is strong enough that it is worth staying on the medication.	M	46	4  years	9/11/2006
1	chronic pain /fibromyalgia	Constipation, headache when it starts to come out of my system and I then HAVE to take another dose!	Was taking vicoden before this and doctor switched me..he said it was due to vicoden's potential for addiction.  But since being on methadose I need more and more every week or so and it doesn't last long at all...maybe an hour.  It is horrible!!!	F	25	6  months	6/2/2006Email
2	Deg. Disc Disease & spinal stenosis	I felt like I had Narcolepsy! I was always (24/7) absolutely EXHAUSTED while taking Methadone. I would fall asleep while standing, in the shower, at the computer, and while driving (scary). I never had this kind of a reaction to any other narcotic analgesics before, and I've been on various opiates for a couple years (started with Percocet & Oxycontin before and right after surgery -- moved to Oxycodone HCL during physical therapy -- then to the Fentanyl patch when they decided my condition was long-term -- then finally to Methadone when I quickly developed a tolerance for the Fentanyl).Methadone is a great long-term treatment option for a lot of patients with chronic pain. All I want to say, though, is that if you start taking it and the drowsiness doesn't go away after a week or so, TALK TO YOUR DR.! Pain relief is pointless if it makes you fall asleep at the wheel and wrap yourself around a telephone pole (or worse, another car).	I was on it for 5 weeks before I gave up. My doctor said that the sleepiness people usually feel on Methadone isn't as bad as it was for me, and it goes away fairly quickly for most. Just be sure to be aware of the potential for serious exhaustion problems.	M	31	5  weeks	1/18/2006
4	heroin addiction	Methadose: weight gain, sweating, heart problemsMethadone: no adverse side effects	I never had heart problems until I started on the Methadose program.  Since then, my heart has had problems with tachycardia, arrythmias.  I switched to Methadone, and the problems completely disappeared.  The clinic I was at for the Methadone sold two days ago, so I had to switch back to a methadose clinic.  My heart is already doing its freaky thing again.  I asked the doctor upon my admission if methadose has anything in it that might cause my heart problems.  he said no.  I'm telling you, something is not agreeing with me.

2	As a 2 week break from Oxycodone	1.  TREMENDOUS WEIGHT GAIN - My doctor changed my other meds to help me lose a few pounds! I requested a break from Oxycodone because after a year, I felt it was not effective as a pain med for me.  I gained 9 lbs in 10 days! I gained about a POUND EACH DAY I took it! I stopped taking it and just took extra Kadian.  2.  SWEATING - I would wake up and find the middle of my chest completely sweaty. I would run an errand and have a dizzy/ SWEATING EPISODE LIKE I WAS IN 100 degree weather. 3.  CONSTIPATION - like I've never experienced before. Even after taking Colace & other softeners, it would take me hours, then I felt like I was delivering a baby rhino, horns and all, in the bathroom.          4. It helped with the pain, but the other factors so outweighed the benefits that I did not want to take it after a week. 5.  I did not sleep normally. I would wake up several times in the middle of the night. 6.  I would FALL asleep DURING THE DAY while working at my computer. Luckily, I work from home. I would become extremely tired after taking my dose. 7.  Since I started Methadone, I seem to be craving sweet Fruits (bananas, Pineapple, Papaya ) which is unusual for me. I may eat the occasional piece of fruit but usually save it as a treat becase I know fruit is fattening due to the high sugar content. I don't think it would cause the 9lb weight gain because as I told my husband, he's seen me wolf down two chocolate bars and not gain weight.      		F	44	10  days	4/13/2005
4	chronic pain, arthritis,deg. disc	At first VERY tired all the time. WOuld sometimes fall asleep while eating, standing...even during sex!!  Eventually got used to it.	I take 8x 10 mg. a day for break through pain. Worked super for the first 6 months or so.	M	35	6  months	3/26/2005Email

5	for severe back pain	just a little drowsiness but it subsided after a week	very cheap but very effective about 16 cents a pill for 10mg	M	23	3  months	11/15/2004
1	Chronic Back Pain	Dizziness, nausea, continuous	I tried to give this drug a chance - tried to at least last a week on it to see if I adjusted.  Finally gave up after 6 days because I couldn't function.  Total lightweight - 2.5 mgs every 12 hours and I was totally miserable.  Had to stop.  Will be trying Duragesic next.  One good thing, unfortunately, was that it did help with the pain quite a bit.  Just couldn't tolerate the side effects!  Yuck!	F	39	6  days	10/28/2004
5	Chronic Back Pain, Opiate Addiction	Nausea, Lowered Sex Drive.	I was put on Methadose as a means of getting me off of Loritabs and as a long lasting pain relief of my back. I love this medication as I am now free of the Hydrocodone for 5 weeks now with absolutely no withdrawl pains. While on the Hydro's, I was always in fear of running out too early due to my taking too many and having to wait until the 30 days were up and I could get another re-fill. This would happen alot and I would go through the withdrawl pains every time, but when I had my pills, I would take too many as I was caught up in the	M	43	8  months	8/26/2004
4	addiction to pain meds	constipation, considerable muscle jerking even at 155mg.		M	46	2  years	4/16/2004
5	addiction to loratab	sideaffects were not that bad constipation, but I take milk of magnesia everynight and I am not constipated. Sex drive a little off but my DR.gives me a shot of tostestorone and now that is fixed.Nodding a little but if I get a good nights sleep and go to bed at resonable time I don't really have a problem with that.	Saved my life and my family. That addiction will kill you also send you to jail break up your family lots of bad things but this medication helped me get control of my life again, no cravings,feel good, no worry or sick thinking of waking up and never being able to quit thinking about my next loratab,not any more. I am 100% better however,I can't hardly afford it I don't have insurance and the clinic I go to is a round trip drive 100 miles,(gas)the fee is $11 daily $70 weekly $150 biweekly $300 monthly.I have kids,my mom has lung cancer so I don't have extra money however,I have gone to this clinic almost 3 years, so maybe GOD will help me keep going.If anyone out there has any suggestions on help with pay clinics,discounts or how to recieve them I am not eligable for medicade and I don't think these clinics would take that anyway.there has to be some sollution for me.If you have any suggestions please let me know, I live in Georgia, about 50 miles from Atlanta.

4	opiate addiction	weight gain, reduced sex drive	mm has helped me bigtime, currently stable on 80mg and otherwize drug free for 7 yrs. Split doses hold me much better	M	44	15  years	11/25/2003
1	Back Pain	Sub-potency	I switched to this from the roxane brand.  This drug is about 80% as potent as the name brand or roxane.  This is true because with generic drugs, the potency can vary from .8 to 1.2 of the name brand potency.  For some reason the folks that make methadose choose to put the least possible amount of active ingredent in their product (probably to save money.)  Go with the Roxane or name brand if you can (request if from your pharmacy.)	M	29	4  months	11/24/2003

3	back pain/leg neuropathy/sciatia	excessive sweating, vomiting	very effective for pain relief, can actually stand more than 10 minutes and walk about 30, however i have only started taking. Am taking 10 mg 2 times a day I am very worried about the side effects. Neurosurgen prescribed darvocet but no pain relief, pain management Dr. prescribed the methadone.

4	MMT	I have had alot of weight gain, but the most bothersome side effects are constipation (which comes with taking ANY opiate) and the bad swelling of my hands and legs. Also a dramatic loss of my sex drive!	I was on the orange 40mg diskettes prior to using the cherry liquid methadone and my dose had to be increased by 80 mgs!! Just to get the same effect! But once at the stable dose, things as far as craving and withdrawal are totally non-exsistant! Thank God!	F	35	3  years	6/20/2002

1	opiate addiction	The cherry liquid seemed to cause terrible heartburn along with some mild swelling of my ankles and such. The cherry liquid seems to be a inferior product and though it may come on a bit faster it leaves the body very fast and does not hold well at all.		F	38	1  years	6/19/2002
