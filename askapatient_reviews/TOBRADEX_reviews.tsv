2	Internal Stye	dry throat, cough, congestion, post nasal drip, dizziness, irritability, headache, fullness in ear drums	I felt uneasy about taking this drug. It gave me a lot of unpleasant symptoms and I read that it can make you deaf. I stopped taking it after 4 days, as my stye was already in remission. I would rather take a safer antibiotic next time.

5	allergic conjunctivitis	none	I was allergic to the brand of contact lenses I was wearing and was not allowed to wear them for a week during my treatment.  I was prescribed Tobradex to get rid of the itching, redness, and swelling.  My eyes feel much better now, and I have changed my brand of contact lenses.	F	21	10  days	4/2/2006
5	Outer Ear Infection	Ringing in ears but I did not know if it was due to drug or infection. When doctor gave it to me he told me it was made for eyes but to use it in my ears? After my swelling went down in canals and I got a full dose inside it felt like it affected my lungs in some way? I couls also taste it for a few hours. Yuck! Also made my eustachian tubes burn and sting allday, everyday.	It helped clear my ears up so as far as I am concerned it is a good drug. I guess I would use it again :)	F	41	10  days	12/5/2002Email
