5	continuing diarrhea	None .. IT just worked.	Motofen is the only medication I have found that works for the diarrhea, after trying many  many other drugs. Without it I am homebound, and in the bathroom 24/7.I will be so relieved and able to get back to the living when I can get it again.	F	55	15  years	11/1/2008Email

5	crohnes disease	Have not experienced any side effects to speak off, other than maybe some gas, but that could be due to the crohnes disease	I have been taking motofen sense 1992, Its been a godsend, lomotol wasn't working anymore without takiing it by the handful. I have the entire portion of my elium removed so lots of bm's. There's been some talk about it not being available much longer and it scares me to death. I hope they come up with an equivalent.
