5	Pain in back	Sleepiness	I love Motrin and will take this whenever I have any sort of pain. Why are people rating this so poorly? It works great, no side effects, except for sleepiness because the pain was keeping me awake. I ahev alot of back problems and it helps.	F	18	5  days600 2X D	8/15/2012
1	Hip pain	Extreme Stomach cramps, bloating, constipation	Helped with pain, side effects weren't worth it :( perhaps because I took it without food.	F	31	3  days400mg 1X D	8/15/2012
3	shoulder pain	I could not figure out why I had sudden water weight gain, to a shocking degree.  I found this site here where others report the same issue.  I will stop motrin today.  It helped only slightly with pain management.		F	35	3  days600-800mg 1X D	6/22/2012
1	Torn ligaments,Swollen knees	Extreme Fluid Retention, Wheezing, Acid Reflux, Anxiety, Depression, Nightmares and Panic attacks	Okay...allegedly this drug is supposed to aleviate pain and reduce inflammation; however, it did none of the above.  In fact, I quit taking the motrin 800 and began taking the standard excedrin (I had some pre-recall excedrin left) and it worked wonders.  Anywho, since ceasing motrin 800 my body has naturally began relieving itself of access fluid and my ligament pain isn't as agitated anymore since it isn't experiencing pressure from the swelling anymore....well maybe the celery and dip I've been eating has helped aleviate fluid retention since it is a natural diuretic.  Best wishes to you all for a speedy recovery.	M	32	8  days800 mg 2X D	5/11/2012Email

1	pain after breast augmentation	*severe* and painful constipation	I never normally have constipation. Once I worked out that the ibuprofen was causing it I immediately stopped taking it; other pain medications work just as well without this side effect.	F	36	14  days200 mg 1X D	4/4/2012
2	Rheumatoid arthritis & Fibromyalgia	Water retention in my legs that was so severe that when I elevated them to alleviate the swelling...the water pooled around my heart and landed me in the ER with arrhythmia and sky high BP!  This happened to me several times before I realized that the cause of my edema was NOT any of my health conditions but rather was caused by my pain medication.  Thankfully I finally made the connection and have had ZERO edema since stopping the motrin.  I am currently relying on hot baths, Traumeel and the occasional Tylenol to manage my pain.	While this medication is, without a doubt, one of the best I have found for pain it also comes with a large kidney insult as a price tag.  I won't ever take it again.

1	arthritis	raised blood pressure, relief wears off after 2 weeks	Natural cures are better; apple cidar vinegar can effectively cure arthritis and headaches; vitamin C crystals can help pain at high doses; see doctoryourself.com. Hyaluronic acid cured my sprained ankle which I believe happened due to a lack of synthovial fluids in our joints as we age. 'Just say no to drugs' (Nancy Reagan).

1	sciatica pain	wasn't effective treating pain and woke me up in the middle of the night repeatedly (about every hour) with major anxiety and panic attack. racing heart, loud sharp ringing in ear and nightmares.	never will use again!	F	29	3  days38 1X D	12/4/2011Email
3	Level 2 to 3 Ankle sprain	Ringing in the ears, like when you put a sea shell over your ear. Very Vivid dreams, no panic attacks, but I'm  susceptible to them.	Dr. doubted me when I told him about noise in ears. First time I've had the dreams, but don't generally take Motrin. Glad I found this site, today is the last day, will switch to Aspirin tomorrow.	M	57	15  days600mg 3X D	10/24/2011
1	headache	Stomach cramps, bloating, panic attacks, anxiety, weird dreams depression.	I usually take Equate Ibuprofen but in hospital they have MOTRIN.  Same medication supposedly.   It made me have cramps and still have them over a week later.   After the 3rd pill I found myself being nervous, then panicky, then anxious and when I went to sleep I had weird dreams.   I finally had the nurse walk me up and down halls at 2:00AM because I was so figidity.  Since I can take ibuprofen brand Equate without this happening, Motrin must have an additive to make patient feel good so they'll use it but it made me a psychological mess.   No more Motrin.   I'm glad to read I'm not the only one who had psychological problems from this medication.   Try Walmart's Equate brand.	F	73	3  days 3X W	1/10/2011Email
1	Tooth pain	Dizziness, heart racing, felt like I was having a heart attack.	I took Motrin regulary for at least a year for bad tooth pain.  Then I started having these "panic attacks."  I made the connection - on days I took Motrin, I would have a "panic attack" that night.  I quit taking the Motrin and I haven't had another "panic attack" since then.  Also, I have two friends who had been taking Motrin for long periods of time for back and neck pain.  BOTH of them started having "panic attacks," and their doctors said they needed anti-anxiety meds.  Both of them stopped taking Motrin, and no more "panic attacks."  Doctors need to be informed about this side effect so that they won't be prescribing anti-anxiety meds unneccessarily!	F	51	1  years 1X D	12/13/2010Email
5	for pain after surgery, etc.	Never experienced any bad side effects, but you have to follow directions and take this medicine with food or milk, to prevent stomach upset.	I have always been exceedingly happy with this medication, it works better for me than any other pain reliever. After I had my children, it was the only thing that could take away my pain. I had tried darvocet, tylenol 3s, vicodin, and others but only ibuprofen eased my pain and never made me feel loopy.	F	22	2  years800 mg 4X D	11/30/2010
3	Degenerative Disc Disease,Migraines	I developed severe GERD, with esophagitis	This was prescribed in a formula with 30mg of Codeine,  It works good for me for moderate pain, but I developed severe gastric problems because of it that took 6 months of Prevacid and complete abstinence from Ibuprofen to heal.  I now take it ocassionally (1-2/day, 2x per week)  with Prevacid and have had no side effects.	M	48	2  years400 3X D	8/30/2010Email

5	Chronic Back pain	There was a time that I stopped taking Motrin and when I went back to it, it gave me small bumps under my cheeks. They went away after 1/2 hour.	I surf every weekend and could not if I didn't take Motrin.	M	49	20  years600 MG 2X D	3/25/2010
3	inflammed trapezius muscle	Severe discomfort of upper abdomen and extreme bloating.  Could not wear my normal clothes without extreme discomfort.  Clearly no digestive issue; but did not know what it was until recently	The doctor suggested I take anti-inflammatory meds for my muscle problems.  I will now discontinue using Motrin and try to find a substitute	F	56	60  days220 mg 2X D	3/25/2010
5	FOOT BONE SPURS	NO SIDE EFFECTS	I literally could not walk without Motrin.	M	67	20  days800 3X D	3/8/2010Email
4	Back pain; anti-inflammatory	Stomach pain; ulcers	This stuff is HARD on my stomach.  I have to take omeprazole to protect it when I use Motrin or Advil.  But it really is effective for my sciatica and as a general anti-inflammatory.	M	45	2  years600mg 3X D	2/18/2010Email
5	pain, inflammation	None until I over-used it, and now if I take it my guts are sore for three days afterward.	Ibuprofen is the best NSAID I have used. Unfortunately I over-used it (in an anti-inflammatory regimen on the recommendation of my doctor) and developed a sensitivity to it so that if I take more than 400 mg or so I have lower abdominal soreness for three days afterward. I still use it occasionally for severe pain as it's the only OTC painkiller that I can count on to really knock out the inflammation.	F	23	10  days	1/1/2010
4	depression	Helps boost my Zoloft response for depression without triggering anxiety unresponsive to Zoloft. I would take Cymbalta, which works similar to NSAIDS, but that would make me too hyper. I take a small dose of Lithium Carbonate at night to make sure the Motrin doesn't give me the stomach nasties and to make sure the Motrin doesn't turn up the borderline hyperthyroid and make me anxious and nervous.  I do have back spasms. That's why I discovered how Cox-2 inhibitors are serotonin and norepinephrine enhancers and actually boost an antidepessant's effects. No wonder I had a depression-free summer. I was taking Motrin for back spasms and was wondering why I was feeling better than I have had in four years.	For those who have anxiety, depression, and mood swings, please keep in mind that Motrin can deplete folic acid and that *can* lead to depression. You may try folic acid rich foods to see if that may be the problem. Over time I eat lots of folic acid foods but find that they make me hyper, so I also get a plus from Ibuprofen's anti-folate effect.  I have high blood histamine that is worsened by folic acid.	F	45	5  months	11/16/2009
3	Severe Menstrual cramps from  IBS	none.	It helps some of the pain from severe cramps but that's it.	F	26	7  days	11/6/2009
2	back/neck pain	I had an increase in gas/bloating, hemorrhoid pain, and bruising. I've had bouts of vertigo, ringing in the ears, and nausea.		F	48	10  days	8/11/2009
3	inflammation post hysterectomy	After taking for 3 weeks it as prescribed 3x daily after a total hysterectomy, I developed significant stomach upset and chronic heartburn (which I've never had before).  I did not how hard Motrin can be on the stomach until I looked on the web.  Wish I had known.  I don't think my post surgical pain was much from inflammation, so I could have stopped it sooner, or just taken a lower dose, like Advil.		F	51	25  days	6/23/2009
5	rheumatoid arthritis	malabsorption, pernicious anemia, GERD	I have taken 800 mg 3x a day for 27 years-yes,27.  From time to time the doctor would make me try another NSAID but Motrin has always been by far the most effective w/ inflammation. I would sometimes forget I had arthritis (dx'd at age 16) but if I didn't take the motrin, after a couple of days literally could not move. Never had any obvious side effects-HOWEVER...recently after long and winding series of tests discovered I have GERD (no heartburn, didn't know this was possible, but diagnosed via endoscopy) which caused complete lack of B12, neurological damage in legs, and various other GI issues including slightly enlarged liver (and I am a non-drinker). Who knew? Sad, though because now I have to find another NSAID and Motrin just worked so well.	F	43	27  days	6/14/2009
2	Severe Lower Back Pain	Headache and stomach pains	I've been taking 800mg tablets and as the medicine starts wearing off I get a headache that doesn't go away untill I take another tablet.I also get occasional stomach pains that come really fast and go away really fast. It's odd.	F	39	4  days	6/8/2009
1	post cesarean abdomninal abscess	I had ongoing abdominal pain after my abscess healed, but kept taking motrin for the pain. After a CT Scan & colonoscopy, it was discovered that the extended motrin use had caused inflammation in my large intestine. As soon as I stopped taking ibuprofen to treat the pain, the pain stopped completely. I felt 100 times better within a week.	None of my doctors warned me about prolonged motrin use. I thought it was safer than narcotics with a new baby. I only thought to mention it to my GI specialist after my nurse friend warned me that I had been taking it too long. It is really dangerous to take it regularly for extended periods of time.	F	35	5  months	4/24/2009
2	Knee injury	the first day or two, just had the water retention, now severe vertigo which can't be attributed to anything else		F	46	4  days	4/13/2009
4	Wisdom Teeth and Head Pain	Very mild Dysphasia, cannot concentrate on typing that well or any common task, lose track of thoughts easily.	Works good and I like how it doesnt give you the high feeling like Vicoden does but the dysphasia bothers me the most but not too much.	M	17	3  weeks	3/26/2009
3	shoulder pain, arthritic	mild relief in a.m. when it is intense. On motrin 600 mg daily as needed	Unusual nosebleeds. Stopped, but will try again.	F	70	3  days	2/17/2009
1	pain	Anxiety, depression, insomnia. Anger and weepiness. On 800+ mg/day per doctor's order for pain flare-ups. Also taking maintenance oxycontin and oxyIR and Lyrica for osteo pain.	Very sneaky drug. Rxlist.com shows 1% or fewer taking Motrin get anxiety, depression, and insomnia. No one would suspect an nsaid could do this, but I finally figured it out. No more Motrin for me!	F	54	3  months	1/31/2009
2	plantar  fasciitis	After two weeks of being on 800mg three times a day I became very bloated. I'm normally a size 6 and had to wear size 10. I was suppose to stay on it 3 X's a day for three weeks, however, I would rather deal with the pain than have stomach problems not to mention I wasn't sleeping well.		F	48	2  weeks	1/23/2009
5	broken ribs	none		F	42	9  days	1/21/2009
4	pain from possible staph infection	Certainly nausea, copious gas and I guess accompanying bloatedness; maybe some sleep interruption.	Seems surely to relieve the pain and burning sensation at the infection site.  So much so that I mistakenly think the wound area is better healed than it really is.  Pain relief? Great, so far.  Side effects?  Jury is still out -- its been only 2.5 days.	M	50	2.5  days	12/2/2008
3	fever			F	20	2  days	11/2/2008
1	Severe back pain...	Terrible stomach aches.	After I had my baby, I suffered from severe back pains. I was prescribed this to reduce pain in my back, but it did NOTHING. All it did was give me terrible stomach aches. It didn't touch the pain at all. It was a joke medicine to me. I have switched to Flexeril, which is working wonders.	F	22	14  days	9/25/2008
5	Absessed Tooth	None-I usually eat before I take it, so I am not sure how it would be on empty stomach.	600 motrin and 500 tylenol killed the pain, exept at night time. If I took it Tylenol PM with the Motrin early enough I can actually get some sleep	F	29	5  days	8/25/2008
3	Post-hysterectomy pain	Nausea, headache	I took 600 mg every six hours for almost six days. The first three days it worked great. Day four I had nausea and a headache. Day five I switched back to Darvocet-N for temporary relief to get a break from the Motrin. Day six I tried the Motrin again -- nausea despite taking with food and the headache was worse than ever. Tomorrow, I'll go without. If I get a bad bought of pain, I'll try regular strength acetaminophen (Tylenol) instead.	F	49	6  days	8/21/2008
5	Osteoarthritis	Slight stomach upset, slight dizziness	Motrin in prescription form is Ibuprofen in a large 800 mg dose. The large 800 mg dose worked well for me but b/c of the stomach upset, I take Advil or Motrin IB over the counter(same medicene, lower dosage). It comes in 200mgs so I can take the smallest effective dose. Taking the smaller dose helps a little with the stomach upset. The smaller dose took away the dizziness as well.	F	31	5  years	7/22/2008
1	knee, hip and back pain	SEVERE stomach pain.  Ringing in ears.  Some dizziness, but the worst was the stomach pain and nasea.	This isn't fit to take.  All docs want to do is push medication, rather than actually fix the root cause of the problem.  I never didn't take the med, even after the doc prescribed because I don't like to take any sort of medication.  But the pain got so bad, I gave in and took one 800 mg. pill on a full stomach.  Was fine for about 8 hours, but then had horrible stomach pain and nasea for 20 hours-plus after taking just one pill.	F	45	1  times	5/25/2008
3	Shoulder strain/injury	Bad constipation, gas.  I had to to take Metamucil.  A high-fiber diet did not do the trick.	I was prescribed 800mg to take 3 times a day for 2 weeks.  It took a week before I felt some relief.  With what sounds like a high dosage, I expected it to work better.  My first time taking it was over 25 years ago (I believe it was pretty new on the market then) when I got severe menstrual cramps.  Back then, I would have rated it a 5.  It worked FAST, and I don't remember side effects.  But I just took it the first or second day of my cycle, and I think I only took one each day.  About 6 years ago I was prescribed Motrin to ease the "killer cramps" I got occasionally which was related to a previous major surgery even years earlier.  It was like eating candy.  It did NOTHING.  I would have given it a 1 for that.  My doctor gave me Vicodin instead when I said Motrin wasn't strong enough. (Vicodin WORKED)  Also, since the cramps were so bad, it'd make me throw up.  That would make me not only throw up the food I was to to take Motrin with, but up would come the medication as	F	46	2  weeks	5/24/2008
5	Menstrual cramps	none	Motrin tends to work better than Tylenol for menstrual cramps.	F	18	 	4/28/2008
1	Rheumatoid Arthritis. joint pain	high blood pressure	Never had a blood pressure problem until I began taking this drug on a regular basis to control pain/inflammation.  This NSAID is definitely not for me!	F	45	4  months	4/16/2008
1	plantar fasciitis	severe cramping in upper abdomen	After taking 800mg motrin every 8hrs for two weeks, my plantar fasciitis was better but I developed a severe pain in my right upper abdomen. So severe that I went to the emergency room and ended up having my appendix removed and IT WASNT MY APPENDIX!!!I will never take a drug again unless it is a life threatening reason to do so.	F	50	2  weeks	3/31/2008
4	fever	peeling of skin on hands	after 6 days of giving my son motrin for a fever noticed skin was peeling from his hands. Bottom of the soles of his feet also very dry.	M	7	5  days	3/23/2008
5	tendonitus bursitus shoulder	If I take 800mg on an empty stomach it will give me a bad stomach ache.	Motrin is better for me than even any perscription painkiller I have taken. It reduced the inflamation in my shoulder enough so I could sleep at night and have so far avoided surgery. After suffering with debilitating pain in my shoulder while 9 months pregnant I was thrilled when I had my baby and could take Motrin.(You cannot take it in the third trimester of pregnancy due to blood thinning)	F	33	2  months	2/19/2008
4	Severe migranes	upper stomach (ribcage) type pain, bloated feeling, gas - very uncomfortable. appitite gain, depression	Worked great, but 6 hours later left a feeling of nausea or pain in abdomen and stomach. It brought back my feeling of depression.	F	15	2  weeks	1/4/2008
1	Absessed Tooth	Horrible Cramps, Gas, Diarreah, Vomiting, Nausea, Headache, Neack Ache, Sleeping Problems	Horrible drug, Destroys the stomach.	F	15	2  days	12/5/2007
3	severe menstrual cramps	none	Worked well with my cramps, but I didn't like that it only lasted 4-6 hours.  This meant I would be waking up at 1 or 2 in the morning with pain.  Not fun!	F	15	4  days	7/5/2007
5	herniated disk in my neck, hedaches	On an empty stomach, some cramping,	I love this! Nothing else helped with the pain. Would not go back to anything else.I've been taking this form 6 years.	F	44	6  years	3/16/2007
1	Back Pain	I took one 800 Mg Motrin for 2 days and it greatly relieved the pain of a low backache.  On the 3rd day I begin to get a very sick background headache.  On the 4th day, it was horrific, far worse than the debilitating back ache.	Can anyone explain to me why a medication that is suppose to relieve pain, even headaches, causes such a terrible "explosive" type of headache...........not a "pounding" headache?

3	menstral cramps	headache		F	38	3  days	1/23/2007
3	Back Pain	If taken on an empty stomach...not good but loss of appetite makes it hard to have a full stomach! Bloating, and very bad gas! It is like some one put a bag of air in my stomach!		M	25	6  days	12/20/2006
1	Teeth, spine and herinated disks	I had NO idea that motrin was even causing these:  severe heart palpitations and acute arrhythmia( resulting in extensive tests over a period of 4 months), extreme difficultly urinating and inability to empty bladder completely, water retention and weight gain, insomnia, shortness of breath leading to hyperventilating and eventually debilitating attacks that at first appeard to be severe panic attacks.	I used both over the counter motrin as well as prescription over a period of about 5 years. It relieved my pain immediately and I trusted that it was not causing any physical damage.  The pain was so excruciating that I began taking 4 (over the counter) pills at a time up to 4 and 5 times daily.  The symptoms that began in 'side effects' here, developed so gradually that I didn't realize they were being caused by motrin.  This past summer has been an absolute horror when these side effects eventually took me to the hospital and MANY tests.  Because I had no idea that motrin could be causing any of these accumulating effects, particularly my heart, when I was asked about daily medications, motrin was mentioned in almost casual passing.  When I was asked how MUCH I was taking and for how long, serious bells blazed.  I no longer take ANYTHING unless I am in VERY great pain, and then only two pills about once a month.  I was terrified to NOT be taking motrin because I'd been living with su	F	59	5  years	10/13/2006Email

Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email

It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

1	deppression	shaking twitching over emotional		F	23	60  days30 1X D	11/3/2011
5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
