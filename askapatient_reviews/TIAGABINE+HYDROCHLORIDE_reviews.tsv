1	Anxiety	Staggering, falling, difficulty speaking--forming and thinking of words, complete disorientation, bizarre behaviors, forgetting how to speak/stand, confusion, temporary amnesia (forgetting names of parents, getting lost and ending up in unfamiliar places & a loss of awareness of time.

1	Chronic Headache	I got this drug because I have a f**ked up tension headache which has ruined my life and I have tried everything.  The only thing that works is Desipramine in small doses.  Anyway, this drug made me stupid and disoriented for about a week, but it did seem to cut the sensation of pain in my head.  I upped 8mgs a week for 3 weeks and my headache waned, BUT one day I took an extra 8mg accidentally AND I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA DIE so I went to the ER.  I can't explain it ... I thought I was going to lose consciousness and cease to exist.  Needless to say this scared the crap out of me.  I would rather be addicted to vicodin than have any more bad experiences like that.	I think I am cursed with a chronic headache and I hope one day they make a medication which gets rid of it, but Gabitril isn't it.  Its a very very powerful drug that causes severe mental retardation and is very difficult to dose up.   I will say that it did cut the pain in my head and maybe if I could afford to stay in a hospital while dosing up I would try to make it work.  But who wants to feel like they are going to go out of their mind and die? Not me.	M	46	4  weeks28 2X D	4/27/2012Email
1	Taking for anxiety	My experience with this drug seems to sound like a broken record from all the posts I read here.This med is absolute poison and the Bozo the Clown Dr.and his Carmel Psychological Associate Group, located in Westchester County, NY should be sued and shut down for prescribing it, amongst other things. Just like many posts, right out of the blue I became like a zombie,like a switchwas thrown in my head, confused, babled when I talked making no sense and doing weird things. Rushed to ER who thought I was having a stroke or bleeding on the brain. I was terrified I was going to die and cried like a baby in the hospital and they had no clue on how to treat this, so they just kept me until it wore off about 12 hours later and aftersuffering from a spinal tap with no anesthesia, which they performed. I can not insist enough how BAD! this drug, Gabitril is. I give it a 1. I wish I could give it a -5.		M	42	2  weeks6 3X D	1/27/2011
4	headache	I have had a disabling tension headache for 20 years.  I have tried everything and this is the only medication besides Pamelor that helps dramatically!   Its really unpredicable and can have some major side effects (like sedation/intoxication/psychosis) but it does help with my headache noticiably and nothing else does.	Very strange medication because a small dose acts so strongly and if you go up to fast you can get hospitalizing side-effects, but it does have some use for pain and headaches.	M	40	60  days24 2X D	5/1/2010
5	Panic Attacks		Taken as needed up to 4 times a day	F	43	 2 mg 2X D	2/10/2010
3	social anxiety	Definitely helped decrease anxiety. Became more sociable at work. After a few weeks started having feelings of unreality or coming unraveled. Discontinued after one month trial.	Initially Gabitril was great. Thinking about trying it again at very low dose.	M	48	30  days	11/29/2009
4	post epilepsy brain surgery	After 7 years on the medication I have had seizures but this drug combined with yoga has helped me control the seizures. I do get the occasional twitches but i feel a lot stronger in the mind control.	Some days i feel not in control that is where yoga has helped me control to mindset of epilepsy Gabitril is like background help when control is lost.	F	42	7  years	9/20/2009
2	Feelings of un-reality, anxeity.	I took Gabitril for about two months and nothing happened. I guess this medicene really had no effect on me at all. I was on a low dose of six miligrams a day though.	No huge reaction that I am aware of.	M	18	2  months	4/19/2009
5	Anxiety, Fibromyalgia	Only in the first month, dizzyness.	The studies done that came out bad are so wrong. They only tested for 10-weeks. It takes longer than that to really know it's working. Within one year all Fibro patients I know have eliminated their anxiety and got some limited pain reduction.	F	45	4  years	4/7/2009
5	anxiety and depression	I don't experience side effects.  It's the first antianxiety medicine that's helped supplement an antidepressant without making me feel spacey or slow.  I take 12 mg at night.	My social anxiety has diminished.  I sleep well and have had no appetite changes.	F	43	3  years	3/26/2009
3	severe neuropathy	tremors like I am vibrating all the time.  Deep muscle twitches.  Foggy head, feeling like i am higher than a kite or really drunk.	when I first started to take this is was wonderful!!  nerve pain in my legs went away!!!  as the time went on, small twitches started.  I figured if the pain was gone, I could deal with the twitches.  Now 5 years later, I am experiencing severe tremors, and STRONG deep muscle twitches.  I kick people accidently if they are too near.  I have dropped countless things, and gotten burned by a twitch putting me in dangerous place.  I want off this med.	F	38	5  years	2/19/2009
1	control seizures	I am writing this for my father, who was prescribed Gabritril as an add-on seizure medication in 2002, and as a result, experienced status epilepticus, resulting in an 11-day hospital stay.  Additionally, he experienced peripheral neuropathy that impairs his mobility to this day (six years later).	His current neurologist (he moved, and is now under the care of a neurologist specializing in epilepsy treatment) told us on my father's most recent visit last month that he will not prescribe Gabitril to *any* of his patients due to the side effects.	M	76	2  weeks	10/3/2008
1	Bipolar II Disorder	Feel weird, exausted, headache, words "swim" on the page, can not concentrate or absorbe anything, clumbsy, can't walk without triping, sore throat, thinking slowed down, sucidal thoughts and plans, hard time catching breath, anxiety.	I took only three 4mg doeses 24 hours apart. The sucidal thoughts are what made me decide to discontinue this medication.	F	19	3  days	4/25/2008
3	nerve damage/burning all over	After 11 weeks of being so very happy with not feeling the burning...I got double vision which is a hard thing to live with! I just found out it was this drug that made it happen and I am still waiting for my vision to return.		F	46	11  weeks	4/20/2008
1	Anxiety/Bipolar 1	Difficulty breathing, feeling of being drunk for two hours, increased heartbeat, impossible to work, panic attacks, I made no sense when I spoke, slurred speech, confusion	How can a drug prescribed for anxiety cause so much of it?  People at work thought I was drunk.  I had constant trouble breathing.  Just thinking about Gabitril puts me into a panic.  Two weeks of this was enough.  I would have lost my job if I continued on this drug.	F	26	2  weeks	4/18/2008
4	GAD, Depression	Drunkenness, inability to read or concentrate, sedation	I started this drug very slowly from 1mg/day up to 16mg and it has worked wonders for my chronic anxiety and depression. I could tell a difference with the first, tiny dose. It is very important to take this drug with food and just before sleep as it is sedating and causes general loopiness, especially in the first few months.  My body has completely adjusted to it and I feel better than I ever have.	F	30	18  months	4/10/2008
5	Anxiety and depression	The combo causes a bit more frequest urination and a little less enrgy but overall worth it for the mood stabilizing effect.	4 mg Gabatril with 150 mg Effexor and 200 mg Lamictal works great.  Mood very stable for first time in along time after being on alot of different meds and then on none.	M	58	6  weeks	2/19/2008
1	Agoraphobia, Depression	Intense mood swings (intensified anxiety and major depression), suicidal thoughts and behaviors, self-harm, intense headaches, memory and cognitive problems, dissasociation.	I started this med in feb of 2007 as augmentation for Topomax, I was experiencing depression and agoraphobia. within two weeks of starting this I made a major decision to take off from grad school and go to Thailand, while in Thailand I dropped out of school. I returned to my native state argued with my spouse and tried to kill myself. I took off back to the state I was going to grad school in, entered a hospital, and spent months fighting homelessness, Major Depression,head pain, intense anxiety, and depersonalization. I tried to kill myself several times through all of this. My family threw-up their arms, turned their backs as they no longer knew who I was, and neither did I. During all of this, i could not control my moods. The night before a major holiday my therapist informed me that she was through, I was distraught and scared. I knew I needed to stop the meds, all through that I had too been scared to stop, but I could no longer take the pain and the "tuning out" that	F	39	10  months	1/13/2008Email
2	Insomnia	Headaches, disorientation, memory loss, lack of attention.	I tried to quit but I am back on the drug, for it is imposible for me to sleep. I tried weening going from 6 mg. to 4 mg. during a week and the 2 mg. the following week. The 2 mg. week I could not sleep. I don't kow what to do next. I also take clonopin 0.25 mg and Atarax for alergies, which also makes you drowsy but for a short period of time.	F	40	2  years	11/27/2007
1	Mood Stabilizaton	Initially fatigue; 3 weeks later severe lethargy (reduced doseage); Months later, out of the blue, SEVERE disorientation, confusion, unable to find home, slurred speech, stumbling, unable to "find" words to describe symptoms.	I ended up in the ER as my PCP believed I was having a stroke or had a blood clot in my brain.  I graduated suma cum laude, and I was reduced to being barely able to put together a sentence.  I got lost near my home in a part of town I was familiar with.  I passed out several times during the day; I "lost" time during the day.  I could not pass simple sobriety tests.  I would daze out and not remember where I was.	F	28	5  months	10/30/2007
5	neuropathic pain	none	this works well for me and is non sedating	F	49	2  days	10/29/2007
4	explosive behavior	feel a bit heavy headed	still horny	M	40	68  days	8/30/2007
1	mood swings from bipolar	Started med on July 18 2007; July 31 had hallucinations;Aug 1 had multiple seizures. Aug 2&3 weak, tremors, memory, speech,thinking, spellings, comprehsion problems.	don't take it. this is day aug 3 and I'm afraid	F	54	13  days	8/3/2007
2	penile pain	At first wow pain gone. Then on the 11th day my lips got as big as a cartoon. Then my feet swelled up. Got hard to get air. Benadryl did the trick. Just had a allergic reaction. First thing in my life that I am allergic to.		M	45	11  days	6/3/2007
1	bipolar disorders/sleep problems	terrible speech problems (slurring or can't find words or nonsense statements), sleepwalking, severve hallucinations, confusion, bewilderment, loss of judgement, unsteady walking -- these continued/worsened after stopping gabitril	seems extremely dangerous for some people -- he was on it only a week, still having terrible symptoms eight days later, no one seems to know what to do, can't find any information	M	40	10  days	5/11/2007
1	lability from head injury	seizure		F	52	7  days	3/13/2007
2	very poor sleep quality, depression	The first 4 month on 10mg/night helped me sleep much better.  For the first time in my life I would wake up in the morning feeling awake and refresshed.  However, after 4 months I started to wake up each morning with a bad headache. I am in the process of gradually reducing the dosage and still have headaches each morning.	When it worked it GREAT and helped me fall asleep and stay asleep. I wish this medicine was somethinng I could use longer term.  Now it causes severe headaches and I am back to square one in trying to find a way to get a decent nights sleep.	F	34	5  months	1/24/2007
2	Nausea and Lightheadiness	Have not taken it yet, just filling out form, will get back to you		F	30	0  days	1/16/2007
5	insomnia & anxiety & depression	nausea	Added to my other antidepressant at 12 mg. Within a few days I felt like I had my personality back. By far the best response to any psychotropic med I tried. But even a little higher dose made the room spin like I was drunk (not in a good way). Stayed on it for about 6 months but relapsed into major depression and changed my whole regimen. Tried it again recently, but even 4 mg made me nautious.	F	42	6  months	12/22/2006
1		painful joints dizzy..and gas and constipation ^^^^READ THIS^^^^to take care of constipation each a salad but you will still have gas...now..this is important...put chopped onions, and fresh garlic on your salad...now I'm not playing here, but your farts will make your house smell like fresh cooked onion rings..honestly!!!		M		1  months	5/24/2006
5	anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia	None that I am aware of.	This drug combined with Lexapro keeps me very even. It stops panic attacks in their tracks. My agoraphobia symptoms are much improved. I highly recommend this drug for these symptoms and will take it forever.	F	51	2  years	5/22/2006
1	Chronic Pain	Extreme sedation (mental straight jacket effect) tiredness, hypersomnia...then after a few weeks...bouts of nervousness, shakiness, feeling that I was going to go out of my mind, slurredspeech, deathly fear. IF YOU ARE ALREADY ON PSYCHE MEDS DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT TAKING THIS MEDICATION!	OK...this drug might be good for some neuropathic pain, but the potential side effects can seriously F**K you up.  I got offthe drug, because three weeks into it I thought I was going to die, my mind has not been quite the same ever since.  Very dangerous drug and should be taken off the market.  If you experience any strange side effects on this med get yourself to the hospital immediately for observation.	M	35	3  weeks	5/19/2006
2	Chronic Tension Headache	>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>	I experienced the same horrible seizure episode as the other poster.  Ended up in the ER unable to speak, psychotic, thinking I was going to die.  They had to sedate me unconscious for 4 hours until I finally came out of it and luckily landed on my feet.  $2300 hospital bill.  BUT GUESS WHAT AFTER 4 WEEKS AND 20MG AT NIGHT MY HEADACHE PRETTY MUCH DISAPPEARED SO I'M GIVING IT A "2".  My girlfriend flushed the pills down the drain. And 3 days after leaving the hospital I got major depression.  Am still recovering.  Medications that used to make me happy, now make me sad. Sucks big time.A very bad experience.	M		1  months	4/21/2006
5	To augment Paxil for OCD	No side effects.	Has been great in augmenting the Paxil.  If it worked as good for others as it has for me - there would be no need for benzodiazepines.  Am taking 6 mg. in morning.	M	57	12  months	2/13/2006
5	Restless leg syndrome/poor sleep	None that I was acutely aware of.	I can't say that I had any noticeable problems with this drug. My Dr. gave it to me for restless leg syndrome; I toss and turn all night no matter how tired I am, and have difficulty falling asleep. I told him that when I take a Benadryl or two it seems to help. He said taking Benadryl will help me FALL asleep, but Gabitril will help me STAY asleep. At the beginning, I slept like a baby!!!!! He started me on 2 mg (saying it was still okay to take the Benadryl), which worked like a miracle for awhile, but then seemed to loose effect. We upped it to 4 mg, and the same thing happened, so I decided to quit. Well, after being off it totally for 6 weeks, I'm going to ask to take it again, 'cause I'm back to tossing and turning!!!!! I think it was helping more than I thought it was.I also quit taking the Benadryl during that time, so that may be part of what I noticed. I am taking a few anticonvulsants (hx: of grand-mal seizures; under control), and a 100mg of Neurontin at night for mild peri	F	49	 	2/10/2006

4	sleep disorder/narcolepsy	if i don't sleep for long enough, confusion, incooridiation, and sleepiness for about an hour or so in the morning. also each time i have increased my dose (started at 4, gone up to 6, now at 8) i have had slight jerking twitches while laying in bed. I take 8 mg at bedtime along with lunesta.	Pretty good drug but I am afraid that those twitches are going to get worse as I work up to my full dosage.	F	21	6  days	12/10/2005
5	sleeping problems/parkinsonsymptoms	Briefly tired the first few weeks...also loss of short term memory, however that was a complaint before I began taking the drug	THIS DRUG HAS CHANGED MY LIFE>>>  I sleep better!  Frequent urination has stopped.  Tremors have stopped.  Muscle spacticity has stopped.  Balance has improved.  Mood has become stable and consistant.  Stuttering has stopped.  I briefly stopped the drug to see what would happen.  I WAS MISERABLE.  I will stay on this forever!	F	33	10  months	11/3/2005
1	Severe anxiety	Speech problems,confusion, memory problems, weakness in legs WORST ANXIETY EVER!!	Been on lots of meds -this was HORRIBLE. Had two seizure episodes, became psychotic and rushed to ER. Couldn't speak, only scream and grunt - thank god for Benadryl -one shot and I came out of the seizure. Dr. took me off Gabitril and I improved slowly. Speech took 3 wks to improve. 6 months later & I'm ok. Doc told me he had one other reaction almost as severe as mine and no one in his practice (psych) had any success with this med.	M	24	6  weeks	11/3/2005
3	nerve pain in leg	terriable dizzieness, lethargic, sleeplessness, confussion, afraid to drive,cannot concentrate,Iriatable, moody,	I have only taken gabitril for 6 weeks at 16mg./per day. It has helped the pain in my leg a little since a spinal fussion of L5 disc. The side effect are terriable but the Dr. wants to double my dose to 32mg. I was on Neurontin 1500mg./ day with no relief. Neurontin side effects are similar to these. I dont know if I can tolerate the upped dose but I am going to try.	M	47	6  weeks	9/9/2005
4	stop side effects of opiate w/d	Like most others, very sleepy & lethargic on dose of 2 mgs twice daily for pain and	I'm surprised to see that no one else has taken this drug for the reason for which I took it (or maybe some won't admit to it). Anyway, when I needed to get off of my prescribed opiates, this was used with neurontin 100 mg for 3 times a day X 2 weeks and clonidine hcl 0.1 mg 3 times a day for one week. Ask your physician -- this helps, but does knock you face down in the dirt for a week or two.	F	34	2  weeks	6/23/2005Email
2	insomnia	I slept for 5 and one half hrs but felt really bad all the next day.  Confused, blank, depressed (horribly).  Zombie.  It's not for me.		F	54	1  days	6/16/2005
1	Severe Anxiety	Oh boy---Now I had soooo many side effects on these pills, I have no idea where to begin.  Slurred speach, did not rememeber where I was, what time it was, what day it was, what I did yesterday...complete lack of concentration, acted as though I was belligerantly drunk!	Although I was taking a low dose,I consider myself to be able to handle large doses of medicine.  I have been on a plethora of meds since I was about fifteen.  But this drug knocked me off my feet and into outer space.  I was taking 4mg TWICE daily and my doctor was in utter shock when I told him I can not go on like this. He actually thought I should up the dosage because he thought I sounded too anxious.  All of my family and friends said that I sounded like I was on drugs or like I was about to fall asleep.  Some suspected that I was ODing on sleeping aids during the day.  Not a person that I came in contact with did not express their concern with my behavior.  IT WAS AWFUL so I stopped pretty much	F	26	4  weeks	5/17/2005Email
1	Back pain	lost consciousness, convulsions, hallucinations	After taking this medicine for the first time, I went into convulsions and a coma state and was rushed to the ER and stayed in the hospital for 4 days. The drs thought I had a mini stroke or needed a pacemaker, but then determined it was all a drug reaction. I would have died if my husband had not been home.	F	53	1  days	4/13/2005
1	ulnar nerve neuropathy	Horrible side effects after two weeks.  Could only sleep for four hour and woke up going 100 miles an hour.  My neuropathy got much worse! Muscle tightness and shooting pain down my right arm.	After trying and failing to contact my doctor about side effects,  I stopped taking Gabiltril and my condition improved.  Soon afterward my doctor called and ask me to double the dosage!  Medical community needs more info before giving this pill.	M	46	2  weeks	4/5/2005Email
5	Panic disorder	derealization	As an add-on to Xanax XR and Lexapro, this brought panic attacks to a standstill! No real side effects to speak of, except for the occasional upset stomach if not taken with food and some minor episodes of feeling	M	31	1  years	4/2/2005
1	Anxiety	Confusion, nervousness, unable to concentrate, dry mouth.	I would not try this drug again.  I would rather be anxious, alive, and employed than scared, confused, and stupid.	M	52	30  days	2/25/2005Email
4	Pinched sciatic, 2 ruptured disks	I felt mild sedation and a dry mouth.  I was on a massive dose of Gabba Penten (Neurotin) it helped at first then it just gave up.	My first day taking it, I felt relief almost immediately.  I still need to see the neurosurgen for surgery.  I am certainly glad that I am taking this med.  My twisted back nerve was sending signals down my leg and I had continual muscle spasms.	F	39	7  days	2/17/2005Email
3	sleep	don't sleep any better but	this medication stopped my 20 year IBS dead in its tracks..would not give it up for anything	F	66	4  months	12/30/2004Email
5	Sleep Disorder / Bipolar	I figured out that I got a headache in the evening if I did not take my gabitril on time.  Now I set an alarm to take it in time every evening.  I also notice an annoying side effect if I have to get up earlier than I usually do.  I get	I have been taking seroquel at night for years to sleep & felt I was sleeping ok.  I did a sleep study a couple of years ago & they found I have an abnormal sleep cycle.  I would go to sleep, just start into REM & then rouse myself. After my M.H.N.P. suggested adding gabitril to see if I got a better night's sleep, I was amazed.  Like I said, I thought I had been getting a good night's sleep on just seroquel, but I was still always tired in the day.  With Gabitril, I wake up & feel great because my body is getting what it needs...real sleep!  Oh & for all of you who complain about abnormal dreams: Yes, I have wierd dreams with Gabitril, but it is because I am SLEEPING!  I finally hit my REM sleep.  My husband who takes no meds & sleeps like a baby had wierd dreams too.  It means you are sleeping normally.	F	32	9  months	12/27/2004
4	Panic attacks and anxiety	dizziness, weard dreams at night and during the day, inability to drive, confusion, inability to concentrate	I had to cut back to 12 milligrams from 14 milligrams because of these side effects.  I feel much better now and it does help with my panic attacks.	F	39	6  weeks	12/9/2004Email
1	bi polar disorder	I took to my bed for the entire 3 1/2 weeks of taking this.  I have three small children and this was unacceptable.  I got severe pain in all areas that made contact with my once soft bed.  Good friends said that I had conversations with them about nonsensical things and that I talked so slowly they thought I was high.	If you take this drug, please be very careful.  Make sure that someone else is aware of the serious side effects and is available to help you in case you get them.  I still after 5 weeks off the drug have trouble saying what I want, and have a horrible time sleeping.  It also brought on a huge manic episode after dialing down the dose.  I am lucky that I have good friends to tell me when I really need to get off a med.	F	30	3  days	12/1/2004Email
5	convulsive disorder/partial seizure	This drug has been well tolerated for me. It has eliminated all of the symptoms I had suffered for the last three years of my life. It is wonderful to have my life back!!		F	32	60  days	11/26/2004
4	GAD	None	Now up to 8mg. and I do feel more calm, yet not tired. Mood is more consistent as well. Sleep is still fairly erratic.10 mg. is the goal, and I'll make that increase this weekand report again.	M	47	3  weeks	11/21/2004
4	Neuropathic pain, I.C.	I had some drowsiness for the first few weeks.  It has all but disappeared.  I also take pain medication for the pain.  I do notice a decreased ability to concentrate but hey, it is difficult to concentrate in pain as well!	I noticed if I take it consistently for at least two weeks it can decrease my pain significantly.  Combined with my pain meds, I can actually spend a day without focusing on my pain.  it has also helped with my depression and anxiety.  Things seem brighter.  I had no benefit from Neurontin and a lot of side effects.	F	30	4  months	11/19/2004
5	fibromyalgia pain and sleep problem	This has been an amazing medicine for me. I was VERY reluctant to take it but I had NO side effects and the burning in my arms and neck has vanished. I used to hurt so much I would wince if someone poked me on the arm and had trouble opening the double doors at work. That's gone! I have my life back!	I had no side effects from it.	F	38	6  months	11/10/2004
3	GAD	None	2mg. in the morning. 2mg. at night for 1st week. Then 4mg. at nightweek 2. So far, I really don't feel anything. Subtle at best.	M	47	6  days	11/7/2004

4	Bipolar/depression	Gabitril 4-8mg/day + Wellbutrin 300mg/day stabilized my mood swings and depression.  My male libido was slightly enhanced. This combination, oddly, also lead to an ability to regularly have multiple orgasms; typically one ejaculation followed by several orgasms 1-2 min apart continuing for 10 or 20 min with minimal stimulation.  Also I've found somewhat less ability to stay focused on work tasks, less motivation, lethargic, apathetic.	on and off gabitril for about 12 months...	M	45	12  months	8/24/2004

1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email
1	Depress or  Bipolar	All side effects what listed on Abilify's instraction. was hospitalas, digestiv sistem  not functionable for  3 dayABILIFY : best killer	only 5 MG of Abilify can kill you in 4 Hs	F	52	1  times5 1X D	2/2/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out!

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.

5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
