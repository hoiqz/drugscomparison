MUSCLE MASS IS LEAN AND MEAN, BRAIN IS ALERT AND LIBIDO IS AWESOME.	M	57	6  years	11/8/2009Email
5	for adult growth hormone deficiency	None to date.	Before taking Humatrope, my growth hormone levels were so low that I couldn't even stay awake.  I lost my drivers licence because they didn't know what was wrong with me.  Finally, my endo tested me for this and since injecting daily, I can finally stay awake and have my licence back.

4	Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency	No side effects.	Deficiency was diagnosed nearly 2 years after a head injury.  Take a very low dose daily and it has changed my life!  There may not be a "cure" but the treatment is certainly sufficient and worth every penny.  I would not be able to function without this drug.	F	54	6  years	2/25/2008
4	Adult growth hormone deficiency	Muscle & joint pain when dose was on the high side.	I was prescribed Humatrope for adult growth hormone deficiency secondary to a brain mass. It has helped with increasing my energy, concentration, and lean muscle mass.	F	39	7  months	11/7/2007
