5	UC	Just irritation from inserting a foreign object. (enema nozzle)	Relieved a lot of rectal pain.	M	66	4  days	6/18/2008
4	IBS	Just the fact that it was messy to use. I am going to ask my Dr. if I can do a tap water enema before the cortisone enema so that it is less messy.	Enemas are never any fun, even little ones like this..... It seems to be helping, though. I am using cortenema for 14 days in the evening until my next appointment. Be careful with this. It likes to sneak up and "OUT" later when you are not expecting it.	F	36	7  days	3/8/2006
4	Inflamed rectal tissue	It was difficult to hold in. The next time I used it I first took a tap water enema to get everything out. This made it much easier to hold for the prescribed time. I think it also made it absorb better as the symptoms were less the second time around.		F	36	14  days	9/26/2005
