4	Low back pain and sciatica	Took every other day as I knew it would cause stomach problems. After taking it maybe twice a week, I started having asthma attacks which I never had before. It's unfortunate because this med helped my inflammation and decreased my pain.	Must take with Prilosec to protect stomach	F	58	1  years600 1X D	12/19/2012Email
5	Sciatica/Sciatic Flare-up	Drowsiness, Nausea, Heartburn	A miracle worker.  I was prescribed 800mg tablets for an absolutely horrific Sciatic nerve flare-up & if it weren't for them, I don't think I could have made it through those 5 weeks.  I typically use the OTC version for minor problems (headache, Aunt Flo, etc) with no side effects.  However taking 800mg x 3 times a day actually did cause a few uncomfortable side effects, especially the drowsiness and heartburn.  Taking the tablet with a full glass of milk helped a LOT.

1	migraine, muscular pain	pinpoint bleeding in bladder, frequent urination, bruising	after developing bladder bleeding, taking this increased inflamation of bladder and bleeding, couldn't hold urine, and obvious bruising with no known injuries	F	62	5  years 1X D	5/24/2012
5	headaches	No side effects	I love Ibuprofen. It seems like the only things that will work to take away my headaches and body aches.	F	28	1  weeks800 2X D	3/12/2012Email
5	lower back	none	2 tabs  per day	M	65	5  years	3/24/2009
1	Flu-like symptoms	Stomach pains, acid reflux and bleeding, plus skin rash.  Already over two months have passed and these side-effects have not disappeared.		F	57	5  days	12/4/2008
5	headache; menstrual cramps	mild stomach discomfort if not taken with food	works fast to relieve pain	F	42	1  days	10/16/2008
5	hip pain	none	It is very helpful with no apparent side effects.	F	55	1  years	9/9/2008
4	arthritis	none	I Would like it better if it was more effective against pain, but it generally works as described. Lasts about 3 to 4 hours.	M	50	6  months	4/11/2008
4	menstrual cramps, mild pain	the main side effect for me is drowsiness.	ibuprofen for me is a miracle drug for menstrual cramps, does zero for migraines for me personally, however. wonderful for little aches and pains that i am getting now that i am 40. i would not recommend taking it too often as i find it loses effectiveness. always take with food. if you take this drug too often or habitually ( not that it is addictive, it isn't) you will have major stomach problems and possibly ulcers. use caution. if you are a chronic pain sufferer and take this daily for pain you need to find another doctor. nsaids are great but can have alot of risks if you take them daily.

2	Joint Pain	Nausea and dizziness	Did give very good pain relief.Thought i'd try an ibu[rofen cream but that made me dizzy too	M		1  days	8/14/2007
1	joint pain	Generalised edema, erythema, hives and worsening of eczema.	My allergist subsequently told me that she advises all her patients to use acetaminophen for pain relief, not ibuprofen.	M	43	2  days	7/19/2007Email
2	Various muscle/joint pain	When I first took them I got a little tired, that stopped after a couple of days.  May not have been related.	Lost effectiveness after a week or so.  took 2 800 mg 2 to 3 times a day when needed for pain. (Not as written)  Great hangover headache med, take 1600 mg before sleeping and no headache in the am.  works good for female cramps I am told.	M	41	7  years	4/25/2007
3	Buttocks joint/nerve injury	Unsure yet:  Acid-reflux/laryngopharyngeal reflux, chronic gastritis (definitely) and/or bile gastritis.  (You don't ever want these problems.)	800 mg @ 3x/day at 1st, myself reduced it to 2x after few months, then to 1x later.  Also, always had a pill in morning w/o food (NOT good idea - don't do that).  For this problem, I'm not sure it helped much, but I was scared NOT to take it; my buttocks had been in so much horrid pain that I could only baby-step walk, and only very gradually got better.  NOTE:  I have much confidence in Ibuprofen as a pain-killer; I've used it temporarily for many things and it's good (including an earlier accident hurting my neck) and would get a 5, but my problem here was so bad I don't think much could help me but time - and physical therapy (started way too late).  The side-effects of long-term use are not pretty.  GI problems are horrible.  I've gone from 1 horrid problem to another.	F	36	7  months	5/12/2006
3	Car accident - back pain	Hallucinations - dizziness - nausia	Weird hallucinations - first time I've had them on Ibu... But bad enough for me to stop taking them just now...	M	21	2  years	1/4/2006
2	Rheumatoid arhtritis	Strange feeling in my head. It even hurt to move my eyes	Didn't work at all	F	31	7  days	7/6/2005
