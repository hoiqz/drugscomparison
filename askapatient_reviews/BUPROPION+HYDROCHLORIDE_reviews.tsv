1	Depression/Anxiety	Anxiety, binge eating, racing toughts.	After being on the brand name Wellbutrin XL for 3 years I decided to change to the generic.  Slowly over the course of that month I had extreme anxiety return, depression and wild binge eating issues.  I did not realize that the generic would be so different but it was....argh!  I will never go back to generic for any of my anxiety/depression related symptoms.  The money is worth it.	F	40	30  days300 mg 1X D	10/5/2011
3	fatigue, anxiety	Severe abdominal cramping and bloating, constipation, lack of appetite, and teeth sensitivity.		F	23	2  weeks150 mg 1X D	7/20/2011Email
4	Depression, SAD	Agitation, weight loss, dry mouth, constipation, headaches, insomnia (at first), decreased appetite	Felt awesome for the first few days, then was depressed/agitated for two weeks. It really started to kick in a month later and the effects were subtle. I have to say that this medicine made me very very habitual all of a sudden. I was eating *perfectly* as religiously reading food labels and never eating anything unhealthy. I started all sorts of good habits on a daily basis, and I think this can help people get out of depression as long as it doesn't turn into OCD. I had cotton mouth for the first couple weeks, and for the whole rest of the time I had to carry a water bottle everywhere I went. I was also severely constipated, and even with those magnesium drinks that are supposed to empty you out within minutes didn't do anything. It got easier with time, but then the effects started dying out and it was like I was taking nothing (maybe six months?) I had to increase my dose to 450mg total...it helped, but I think I just became more agitated. I think this medicine is only made for short term so you can build healthy habits. One more thing -- whenever I drank alcohol, even just one drink, it would make me extremely tired and quiet. I wouldn't get any sense of well being or sociability at all. If I drank two drinks then I would be really depressed for 2-3 days. Couldn't feel alcohol until I fully came off.	F	22	10  months150mg 2X D	6/20/2011Email
3	depression, anxiety	Significant and ongoing abdominal bloating and frequent cramping.	I haven't been on it long enough to realize the benefits in full but I've noticed increased energy levels and being more focused on tasks both of which I like but the abdominal bloating and cramps are too inconvenient for me.

4	depression	decreased libido	This drug was given to me as a generic for Welbutrin xl and I don't notice any difference between the two. It works and has the least amount of side effects of the many other ssri's I have tried.	M	61	3  years150 1X D	8/13/2010
4	Depression, Anxiety	Insomnia.  Only get about 4-6 hours sleep a night, but it does not seem to affect my performance during the day.	Now I just have insomnia.  It does help to boost your energy and improve mood.  I take the Actavis generic brand.	M	47	1  months150 mg XL 1X D	6/25/2010History
