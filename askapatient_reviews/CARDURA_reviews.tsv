5	BPH	Initially I experienced occasional dizzy spells until my system stabilized to it. Possibly contributes to dry eyes, but age and other meds are more likely culprits.	Started on 2mg and doubled dose each year until now at current 8mg which works well to control urination urges and increase flow	M	58	12  years8mg 1X D	3/6/2011
1	High Blood Pressure	Absolutely the worst.  Even with the mimimum dose- memory lapses, extreme nervousness, anxious and irritable,shaking and trembling. Discontinued use after about 2 weeks.		M	58	6  days1mg 1X D	6/18/2010
4	BPH	Feeling weak & tired.  Disturbed sleep at nite.  Somewhat depressed.  Dizzy when getting up.	Less side effects with lower dose.  Better than Flomax on side effects.  Maybe, I should go back down to 2 mg a day soon.	M	70	1  years4 mg 1X D	3/22/2010
3	high blood pressure	much reduced sensation on ejaculation.  one event of a lot of blood in urine.	when on this drug i did not have to get up in the night to urinate.  i stopped taking the drug when i had a lot of blood in the urine - my doctor did not think the drug caused this - it could have been too much exertion during exercise.  however I have had no recurrence since stopping the drug.	M	58	1  months	1/23/2010
2	high blood pressure	dizziness, eye problems, disturbed sleep		F	85	7  days	1/8/2010
4	BPH AND HBP	DIZZINESS, TIRED		M	54	10  years	12/23/2009
1	High BP	acne like breakout on face, severe muscle pain in back and neck, eye pressure, sore throat, stinging skin, nasty headache, extreme weakness		M	55	4  days	12/15/2008
2	for symptoms of BPH	Side effects include shortness of breath, palpitations,dizziness, pre-syncope, fatigue.	I continued taking Cardura for several years for relief of urinary symptoms, especially problems urinating at night. The side effects were bad to alarming, but other alpha blockers including Uroxatrol and Flomax were ineffective by comparison to Cardura.  I found that between 1 and 2mg nightly were enough to improve urination while keeping the side effects to a barely tolerable level.I finally decided to go with surgery and had a TURP, and will thankfully say goodbye to Cardura.	M	70	5  years	11/28/2008Email
4	hbp and bph	weakness,fatigue, weight gain		M	52	5  years	7/25/2008Email
1	High Blood Pressure	Terrible dizziness. Tired, lethargic, neck ache, headaches, snakes in my head. Tingling lips, and toes.	I've had BP problems for 20 years. Taking 10mg Norvasc on its own for 2 years, but it suddenly stopped working. Added 2 mg Cardura, but after 3 weeks, I could not stand the side effects any more, so quit.BP went up to 180/90 but I felt better than on the Cardura.I had some atenolol and went back to the old system and took 1/4 tablet once a day. Feel great and bp is now 148/70.I hate Cardura with a passion.I guess I'll be in trouble from my doctor  - too bad!	M	61	3  days	4/1/2008
2	High blood pressure	Short of breath, weak, swelling in joints (6mg), retaining water, irregular heart beat,	Started on 4 mg evenings, then had a breakthrough after first 2 months (BP when back up), started on 6mg at bedtime and the bad side effects started.  Not worth it to feel this bad all the time - skip this one.	M	52	4  months	3/26/2008
3	BPH	Anxiety, headache, foggy head. Very vivid dreams at first, but that seems to have gone away.	Helped BPH symptoms a lot.  Went on a five hour plane ride with no bathroom trips.  That's a real change for me.	M	63	2.5  months	3/5/2008
1	High Blood Pressure	out of breath walking, pounding heart, severe migraine, numb legs and arms at night, palpitations and terrible 'fitting' type tremours.  The last straw was when I kept on passing out every so often, so ended up in hospital for 5 days.  It had affected my nervous system (fight or flight).  I know not everyone has same outcome but I wouldn't reccommend this drug, there are better ones with less side effects e.g. lisinopril		F	34	28  days	2/6/2008
5	Uremic poisoning aftermath.	Fantastically vivid dreams. Wonderful detailed dreams in technicolor.	The first night I took it I had insomnia--couldn't go to sleep for 7 hours. But my brain raced all night and went through my entire 2 year residence in Germany. I laughed so hard at things that did not seem funny at the time I was really living them that I had to stuff the sheet in my mouth to not laugh out loud. Very strange experience. The second third and fourth nights I had such detailed fantastic dreams that I was looking forward to the fifth night. My husband, a GP took it away from me and would only give me the original dosage (I was supposed to double it on the 5th night) and I didn't have any more dreams. After 7 days he threw it out. Probably thought I was enjoying it too much. I am an artist, and extremely sensitive to color. Have you questioned any female artists about their experiences on this drug? I loved taking it.	F	61	7  days	1/28/2008
1	Adjunct to prostate infection	Started with dizziness; massive rush of blood to the head.  Felt I would pass out and almost fell down.  This occurred 5 hours after first dose.		M	56	1  times	7/27/2007
4	High Blood Pressure-BPH	Extreme fatigue - feel like "Dead Man Walking".	Effective in lowering blood pressure from average 150/65 to 127/63. Increased urinary flow.	M	80	2  months	7/6/2007
4	High Blood Pressure	Nasal congestion. Side effect transient. I have not experienced common side effects such as dizziness on arising or headache.	I have had difficulty controlling blood pressure for years taking sometimes up to four classes of drugs - diuretic, ACE inhibitor or ARB, beta blocker and calcium channel blocker. Cardura, far and away, reduces my blood pressure more than any other drug. 4 mg taken at night does the trick.	M	50	1  months	7/4/2007
2	prostate	very tired, depressed	still getting up at night ,even more to go to bathroom	M	62	4  days	4/30/2007
3	BPH	Heart palpatation/rapid heartbeat early in regimen.  Retrograde ejaculation part of the time. I think I have diminished libido and it seems harder to maintain erection and when I'm otherwise performing well, to attain orgasm.  More difficult to have repititions and almost impossible now to have multiple orgasms on one erection. More urination urgency -when I have to go, I HAVE TO GO!	Definitely improved urinary flow.	M	60	6  months	4/2/2007
1	Blood Pressure	Pounding, racing Heart; Headache, couldn't sleep, dizzy.	This drug truly scared me. I thought I was going to have a heart attack.	M	63	1  days	10/19/2006
1	high blood pressure	I was told to take a dose at bedtime for four days and then add a daytime dose.  The first night I experienced severe nasal stuffiness.  I slept with my mouth open, and I developed a sinus infection.  I was dizzy and nauseated.  When I added the daytime dose, I began to feel very sick and weak.  I felt as if mybody had no bones.  I was unable to get out of bed one morning, and I crawled around my house on the floor.  I was graying out repeatedly, and I finally passed out.  I fell out of a chair onto the floor and hit my head.  I live alone and have no family. At that point, I stopped the drug.  It was the worst.		F	64	6  days	9/23/2006
1	high blood pressure	At first I experienced dizziness and nasal stuffiness.  The first two days, I took the med only before bed.  When I added the second dose during the day, I immediately began feeling very unwell, weak, extremely fatigued, as if my body were made of jelly, as if I were going to black out at any moment.  I also experienced sweating, blurry vision, and headache.	I was prescribed this med by an endocrinologist who said it is safe for people who have adrenal problems.	F	65	4  days	9/17/2006
3	high blood pressure	i take a combo of drugs, but i think cardura has given me a persistant cough.	i switched from norvasc due to severe swelling of legs. since the switch to cardura swelling is down.	M	53	60  days	8/10/2006
3	BPH	no side effects observed	Has helped somewhat with urinary frequency, better flow rate, more complete voiding. Considering the size of my prostate it is amazing that this works at all.	M	61	50  days	4/28/2006
3	BPH	no significant side effects	has helped with feelings of bladder congestion but has had no beneficial effect on the principal problems of frequent urination and nighttime arousal.	M	76	9  years	4/16/2006Email

1	high blood pressure	dizzy, and a feeling of not being well	I would never take Cadura knowing what I do about it.  There are other blood pressure medications that are much better and safer.	F	57	2  years	11/10/2004
