1	Severe Depression	DO NOT USE THIS MED!!! This has been the worst medicine I have ever used in my life. At first it seemed to help. I tapered up with the kit, going from 10mg to 20mg then on to 40mg. The 10 and 20 seemed fine and the 20 were when I actually felt happy-but literally I think that lasted like a week or 2 before the bad side effects began. And when I say side effects I'm talking stuff like I've never imagined. Terrifying does not even come close to describing the nightmares you get while on this. I still, 4 months into it, have brain zaps nightly, a strange taste in my mouth that occurs as if to remind me I need to take my vybriid, tiredness, irritability-all of which I could handle. But I can NOT handle feeling like I'm going to die every night. This med causes a symptom called sleep paralysis. It's where your body feels paralyzed and you feel as though you're not breathing but  your brain is fully functioning. You try to scream or wake yourself up but you can't move. It is a horrible thing to experience once, but on this medicine you win the sleep paralysis lotto!! As for my depression, I'd rather deal with the depression than the side effects at this point. I've had very vivid nightmares of being gang raped, beaten, chased,etc. I'd wake up sweating, screaming, crying, begging for my life. All I want is a normal nights sleep!  I've scoured the Internet and read up on people's reactions to weaning off of Viibryd. This is bringing on a whole new set of fears. Why the crap was this		F	36	4  months40mg	7/8/2013
1	Depression anxiety	Do not take this medicine close to bed time! It will have you in a restless sleep, give you crazy dreams and having you waking up panicked! This medicine scares me. I should have stayed on celexa. Yes my orgasms are easier to achieve but this medicine is not worth the other side effects. I have had 2 horrible cystic acne breakouts and have never had cystic acne in my life! I am slowly weaning off of this medicine. I am hopefully going to be med free with exercise to help with my anxiety problem. However I will go back to celexa to help with anxiety if this doesn't work.		F	31	2  months20	7/1/2013Email
3	bipolar depression	Well, I was excited about a new anti-depressant that claimed fewer percentages of sexual side effects.  I have tried several ssri's before, and they worked, but I had sexual side effects. So tried the new craze "Viibryd"First week I felt anxiety starting to lift, then i moved up to 20 mg in the starter pack. Three days afterward now my penis literally feel numb. I cannot get hard or ejaculate. MAYBE they will go away in a few weeks but Im debating on what to do.If you are wanting to take viibryd because of the claim about sexual side effects I would not risk it		M	27	14  days20 1X D	6/23/2013
2	Anxiety, depression	Weight gain, binge eating, diarrhea, brain fog, dizziness, hallucinations, decreased libido, vision problems, strange dreams	I used the starter pack and after 1 day started having diarrhea that continues to this day. I crave horrible foods (junk food, fast food) that I know better than to eat but don't have the willpower to not eat them. I eat even when I'm not hungry! Stay feeling dizzy, seeing strange things, can't think clearly and having weird dreams. I've been on 40mg for about 3-4 weeks and I've decided to wean myself off this crap! I got a pill cutter and I'm going to do 20mg for 2 weeks then 20mg every other day for 2 more weeks and QUIT!	F	37	2  months40 1X D	6/22/2013Email
5	Intermittant Explosive Disorder	Mild GI distress, sort of like cramps, decreased appetite, which is great, slight dizziness and slight blurred vision, which I'm guessing will resolve with time. Also feels like my heart is racing after a few hours but it goes away after a few more hours.  BP and pulse are normal though.  I'll take these side effects over my IED ANYTIME!	So far this stuff is working great for me.  I have been dealing with IED for years now, and tried Cymbalta for a couple of years, but it seemed to lose it's effectiveness over time.  Got off the Cymbalta, and even with slow tapering, the withdrawal was pretty rough.  The IED returned so now I'm trying Viibryd.  I felt better the very first day on 10mg.  My Dr. gave me the trial pack to taper to 20mg and stay at that, but I think I'm going to stay at 10mg since it's doing the job for me at that dosage. I can't remember the last time I was always happy!	M	50	4  days10mg 1X D	6/21/2013Email
4	Depression, Anxiety, Panic Attacks	Med worked GREAT to get me out of the "black hole." Unlike other SSRIs and SNRIs, didn't have terrible head pain or nausea, and it worked within a couple of days instead of weeks. Could begin to exercise and participate in activities. Made a huge mood difference. Unfortunately, side effects of constipation, insomnia, acne and big increase in appetite made it uncomfortable. Dr. just changed me to Pristiq today to see if that works any better. If not, because it helped so much with mood, I'm willing to go back to Viibryd despite the side effects until I find another med. I was never able to tolerate higher than 10 mg because of worsening side effects. Like most people, it's a difficult decision to decide whether it's better to be constipated, fat and acne-covered, or not be depressed.		F	46	1  months10mg 1X D	6/20/2013
1		This is not the drug for me.  It gave me horrible side effects and did not mix well with other meds I am on.  The combination of drugs, a sinus infection and a crowded optic nerve left me blind in my right eye.  Also make sure your doctor realizes that this is a drug that adds to your seritonin levels and if you are on meds for HDHD, it could give you more than you need.		F	47	6  months40 mg 1X D	6/10/2013
2	SAD, Mild depression, Low libido	Increased libido, decreased anxiety, decreased muscle tension, increased fatigue, low energy, increased depression, apathy, withdrawal from social interaction.	Viibryd decreased the physical components of anxiety, but mental components were increased. The pounding heart beat went away, but I lost charisma and gained social awkwardness. I was getting very negative mental flashes, including images of my own death, yet before the med, that never happened. I am not suicidal. It was just disturbing.	M	24	40  days20 1X D	5/27/2013Email
4	Major depression - still taking med	- I had only a very slight queasyniess for the first three days. - The medicine kicked in the very first day for me. I felt so much better, I refused to believe it until I had been on the meds longer.- Vivid dreams the first few days, but nothing too crazy. The doctor also recommended melatonin before bedtime which I think helped ease the dreams.Cons:- Expensive!!! Even with insurance and a $30 coupon card, these still cost me $100 per month.- Do NOT run out of your prescription. OMG. The dreams are for me what everyone else on here says. They are crazy, paralyzing, talk-in-your-sleep, can't move dreams, can't wake up from them. They SUCK. They are awful. I was out of money to pay for this med for about a week, and they do not go away.- Manic. Could not stop talking. To myself, to my kids, to anyone.- Irritable- Pissed off AT THE WORLD- Crying spells return- Agitated- Just want to sleep (great, more nightmares)- Dry itchy skin everywhere- Appetite loss	My doctor knew of all the side effects, so she titrated me very slowly with the starter pack. Instead of 10, 20, 40, we chose to cut the pills in half and do a 5, 10, 20 then 40 dosage.For me, when I am on this med, I feel great, normal, I have the ability to be happy. It works for me.When I am off/out of this EXPENSIVE med, it really makes me angry that I have to take these in the first place. I understand why so many people switch meds or try to quit them altogether.Depression sucks. It runs in my family. I would not wish it on anyone.	F	44	7  months40 MG 1X D	5/15/2013Email
1	anxiety and irritability	My doctor gave me a sample pack and told me to take 10 mg for two weeks then call and tell her how I was feeling.  I weigh 130 pounds.  I was very dizzy and sick to my stomach within an hour of taking it with food.  I took it at lunch time and the rest of the day I felt terrible.  I also felt some heart racing and foggy vision.  When I woke up the next day, I felt very off balance. I decided not to take this anymore after feeling so awful.  I hope I feel better soon.  If I feel this bad after taking 1 10mg pill, I cant even imagine what the side effects are like when taking more.		F	35	1  days10mg 1X D	5/9/2013
4	depression..anxiety...Add fybromyal	Headaches brain zaps crazy demonic night terrors I can't wakeup from.But I see from reading it's my fault. I increased myself to 60mg. from 40mg. I knew something had to change but actually I think  20 mg. is what I need. I need to go down. Doc appt set. I should have never done this. 40 mg. max for anyone!!! If it seems to not work at 40mg decrease dosah. This med. has given me life again. Loss of weight and able to deal with things better. Miss a dose and I cry, so dont need to do that. 		F	49	3  months40mg.	4/26/2013
1	GAD	Stomach issues. I suffered stomach issues almost immediately but never made the connection until I started reading blogs.  Went to 2 different doctors who didn't make a connection either.  Was put on Prilosec for my stomach issues.	After I started researching my meds and stomach issues I made a connection.  One doctor suggested that if the Prilosec was working then everything should be fine. I don't understand what is fine about having to take another drug because of ones side effects. I quickly made the decision on my own to wean off the Viibryd. Oh boy it was rough! At 1st I tried too fast & ended up with panic attacks, but the second try I did much slower, probably took me 2 months or so to wean off completely.  I now take nothing for the GAD, also no Prilosec & can honestly say I have never felt better!!!	F	36	1  years20 1X D	4/20/2013
1	social anxiety	Felt better about myself, but it caused me to vomit often (I haven't thrown up for 8 years because I had surgery to eliminate GERD), after drinking one half of a small bloody mary, I began to vomit violently and became so dizzy I could not walk and became disoriented. I could not eat, had no desire to drink water, food had a strange taste to it and everything had the same strange smell. It also gave me very vivid and sad dreams. It took a good month before I began to feel somewhat returning to "normal." I still seem to have balance issues still. I believe this drug poisoned me. If you take this potent drug, pay close attention to any changes you experience!		F	69	2  weeks10 mg	4/5/2013
1	have tried several other meds	Major digestion issues, diarrhea, gas. Loss of appetite. Couldn't seem to force food down...it just looked unappealing. Jitters and very anxious.		F	32	3  days10	3/24/2013
3	Major Depression	Initially started with 10mg for the first month along with 5mg of Ritalin.  I was suicidal and I immediately got relief after taking the pill.  It stopped all negative/depressive thinking although I was still depressed it just wasn't overwhelming.  Soft stools, weight loss, night sweats, HAIR LOSS.  Also, affected libido and caused anorgasmia.  After one month felt suicidal and doctor increased to 20 and instantly felt better and relief.  Have stayed on 20 for 6 months.  I have been trying to taper off at 15 but that made my mood down.  Quit cold turkey for 12 days and my mood and brain felt better, quicker thinking and more alert.  However I had terrible joint pain.  It took 10 days to figure out the connection.  Now I'm not sure if I can ever get off it.  I'm taking 20 then 15 every other day but I still feel the joint pain.	It helped me a lot in a very rough patch.  However, it seems the side effects of joint pain will not allow me to taper or stop.  That is a big issue.   Plus the  hair loss being so bad is upsetting.  I wish I could stop it.    I'm in a pickle.	F	48	8  months20 1X D	3/11/2013Email
1	anxiety	Only taking viibryd for about 4 says have gotten bad jitters and terrible anxiety. Now i am trying to deal with the withdrawal which are even worse. I have had some crazy thoughts and can't function..praying it wears off soon		F	24	4  days10	3/8/2013
3	Depression	This medication helps with my depression. However, the brain zaps are getting worse & are very scary. I have also been exhausted the entire time I have been on it. I have had occasional restless leg syndrome from it and a little weight gain due to the fact I'm too tired to exercise. My libido has suffered as well.I have horrible withdrawal symptoms each time I have tried to wean myself off. After 1 year on it I'm thinking of switching to something else due to the tiredness and brain zaps.		F	30	1  years20	3/6/2013
2	Depression,Panic Disorder, Anxiety	I was taking Prozac for many years with very positive results but then unfortunately, it stopped working for me and I started to feel depressed, anxious, having anxiety and panic attacks again so my dr. put me on Zoloft hoping it would work for me. It didn't so I was then put on Paxil. It also didn't work for me. Next was to try Viibryd. I was given the trial package to see if the medication would work for me first before my dr. went ahead and wrote me out a script for a three month's supply. I was happy about that because for the past few months, I was paying for the Zoloft and then the Paxil which left me with spending money on meds for a three months supply on each medication only to have the meds not work for me and having to stop taking the med and wasting medication and my money. I started on 10mg of Viibryd and then went up to 20mg. I really haven't felt much better at all since I started taking Viibryd. The negative side effects that I've experienced since beginning Viibryd are	It's been very difficult to control my urges to eat more, especially sweets. I feel hungry ALL THE TIME. Also, I've been having night sweats-it's horrible. I wake up soaked in sweat. I have also been crying alot for no real reason and I'm very emotional and "moody". The ONLY positive thing I have experienced with taking Viibryd is I haven't been as tired as I usually feel and I've been able to function on less sleep. So I have experienced an increase in energy somewhat. I am currently back down to taking 10mg 1x per day and I've decided that Viibryd is definitely not for me and I'm going to see what my dr. suggests next. It's been very frustrating for me to be switched from medication to medication, but I went through 3 medications prior to finding relief with Prozac so I know there has to be hope in another anti-anxiety, panic, and depression medication that will help me. 	F	44	6  weeks10mg 1X D	3/5/2013Email
3	depression, anxiety and im coo coo	None at all the first week except soft stools for the first few days. Increased anxiety after the next several weeks	Viibryd is a gentle drug and it worked very well for me at first. It worked well for my depression without that "medicated feeling"  and it had no side effects. Usually APs make me feel lethargic and/or wired and I look pale and sickly. Viibryd made me feel just normal and motivated with the relief of non-existent depression. I would've given this a 5 but it turned down to a 1 when my anxiety was growing highly intense towards the end. So I give it a 3. Now I'm back to the journey in search for that illusory magic pill or cocktail again.	F	29	1  monthsTiltration 1X D	2/22/2013
5	depression		I have been taking Viibryd for about a year. I gradually increased to 40 mg a day.  I am very restless in the evening when I sit down to watch TV.  It causes me to have restless leg syndrome so I have to take a pill for that.  Lately I have a hard time remembering things.  I have to take Trazadone to sleep.  I have taken several anti-depressents and this one really helps me.	F	78	  1X D	2/10/2013
1	depression	Viibryd wears off fast; when it is wearing off I have suicidal thoughts, suicidal plans; makes depression worse; lots of crying.I guess the company pushed Viibryd on the market too soon, just to try and make money.  No long term studies were done. I guess we are the long term study guinea pigs.	Don't take it.	F	30	3  weeks40mg 1X D	2/10/2013
3	Depression	Initially diarrea, then vivid, bad dreams and night sweats, Bad headaches. Dry throat mostly at night. Fatigue, I'm taking day naps which I've never done before. Then cannot sleep at night. I am also crying more.	This medicine has good and bad effects. On the good side the sexual effects that I had from Lexapro are totally gone and that is great. Lexapro also made me numb and with Viibryd I feel more intensely both good and bad experiences. Viibryd is not perfect for me but I will stick to it at the lowest 10 mg dose.

3	Major Depression	6 episodes of sleep paralysis with extremely disturbing nightmares.  Demonic in nature.  Never had this before. Started 1 week after 40mg. A little dizziness.  About 5 lb weight gain once on 40.	I have to say I've been on a slew of meds over the years and this is the first med that I actually feel like a normal person, the way I used to be. A good mood and lots of energy.  Very positive feeling. But the sleep paralysis is very upsetting. Can't even describe it. Nightmares are horrific. Due to that alone, I may stop taking it. The weight gain is too early to tell. Not crazy about that either.  I've had no other symptoms other than what is noted above.	F	41	2  months40 1X D	1/10/2013Email

4	depression and anxiety	gas, vivid dreams, and excessive sleeping	first medicine for me to have a positive benefit without a slew of negative side effects.  i have been on medicine for about 2 months, taking samples, and now am fighting the insurance company for pre-auth.  however, i slept for 16 hrs today, NOT wanting to and very unlike me.  this is the 3rd time i've slept like this in the past 2 months and i don't like it.  it's the least of the negative side effects--i can just set my alarm but i still don't like that it's making my body so tired.	F	34	2  months40 1X D	12/23/2012
5	Anxiety and depression	Started taking viibryd at 10mg then 20 then 40.  At 40 mg got brain zaps and felt really tired.  It was a strange experience.  Dropped back down to 20 mg and felt much better.  This medication worked VERY well for me.  Side effects were:  I have gained 20 lbs over the year and got a few headaches.  I did find that taking the medication at the same time every day was very important.  I did so well in the last year on this medication that I am now weaning off it.  I reduced the mg to 10, then 5 for 2 weeks.  Today is my second day without it and I feel great.  I did notice some sore muscles when I started reducing it but otherwise - all good.	I recommend this medication.  It worked for me.	F	39	16  months20 1X D	12/16/2012Email
3	Depression/ Fibro/ Anxiety	Nausea, very gassy, bloated abdomen, craving for sweets, weight gain, worsened constipation	I felt Viibryd working just after 2-3 days. The crying spells and feelings of hopelessness were gone. I have been taken Cymbalta for 1 year which seems to have stopped working. I started Viibryd with 5mg and still 20mg Cymbalta once a day. Worked up to 15mg. Tried 20mg yesterday and felt extremely nauseous all day. I'm concerned about the weight gain and the increased appetite. Adderall doesn't seem to work with Viibryd which is weird. So far better than Prozac (zombie) and Pristiq (unbearable restless legs AND arms). I'll try for another two weeks and then will decide if this is for me.	F	42	2  weeks15mg 1X D	12/16/2012

5	Depression with  peri-menopause	Gas mostly, which I treated with 180 mg of simethacone that I take twice daily. 1 cap 1/2 he prior to medication and 1 cap mid day. Decrease carbonated beverages and drinking with straws. I  drink protein shake or coat stomach with oatmeal at night prior to bed time to prevent weight gain since it has to be taken with food.  This seems to work well. I am perimenopausal so I attribute feelings of doom to that and I take black cohosh twice daily who h helps a great deal.		F	49	10  days10mg	12/8/2012

5	PMDD, Anxiety	This is for those who are stopping viibryd after increasing dose to 40mg: 40mg just may be too high for you. I've been on this med for 8wks now; increasing my dose to 40mg caused increased anxiety, severe HA, insomnia and diarrhea. Therefore, I went back to 20mg and instantly I felt the best I've felt in years. Eventually I would like to be med free but until then I will be taking viibryd 20mg.		F	33	2  months20	12/2/2012
5	Depression anxiety	Some stomach upset.  I resolved by taking with a protien shake in the morning.  Heart racing when switched from 10 to.20 mg.  Resolved after a few days.  I seem to be experiencing some muscle fatigue and a change in my skin.  Its oily now and I am experiencing more breakouts.  Has anyone else had this experience?		F	33	2  months20	11/29/2012Email
5	Depression & Anxiety	Midly upset stomach when going from 10mg to 20mg, but then no issues moving up to 40mg.  Some night terrors - waking up from a deep sleep with a feeling of impending doom - but it has always gone away quickly.	Finally!  A depression medication that is actually working!  I've tried just about everything over a 13 span: Welbutrin, Effexor, Zoloft, Lexapro, and others like it.  Even some stronger options such as Lithium and Nuvigil.  Nothing worked to any noticeable level and the side effects were as much an issue as the depression and anxiety in many instances.I've been on Viibryd for nearly two months and am amazed.  The depression that always seems to be following me (like the Abilify commercials) has disappeared.  I saw a substantial improvement after just 3 three days, and it has been mostly positive ever since.  It does not leave me with a "caffeinated" feeling or render a "drug induced false happiness".  Things just seem more NORMAL.  What a great feeling to actually feel like getting out of bed, going to work, taking a walk, going to the mall with my family, or whatever.  I finally have hope again, but can't help but be nervous that it will stop working.  I'll cross that bridge when I get there (if it ever does). For now, I'm just enjoying being alive again.

4	Suicidal	First week:  slight queasiness, lots of abdominal bloating and gas, dry mouth, stiff neck, constipation.Third month:  Vivid dreams, slight queasiness for about an hour, weight gain, craving sweets, apathy.	Prozac quit working and was extremely suicidal.  Started taking the Viibryd and the thoughts were gone within 3 days.  In that regard the drug was a miracle.Now that I have been on it for 3 months, although I no longer think of it as the perfect med, I don't want the thoughts to come back so I am staying on it.I tried increasing the dose from 20mg to 30mg and the gassiness and queasiness was just too much to bare.  Decided to supplement with 20mg of prozac.  So currently I am taking 20mg Viibryd and 20mg prozac and I feel relatively normal mentally.Most of the side effects were gone at the 1 month mark.  As long as I don't take the pill on an empty stomach I'm OK there... Dreams don't bother me.  The weight gain bothers me so I joined a gym, but the cravings for sweets are still there.

1	Depression/anxiety	While it was great at keeping my anxiety under control my depression worsened. Suicidal. Almost put in hospital. Personality changes. I was awful to my kids and husband. Major weight gain. Restless/ sleepless nights. No energy. My kids did not like me on this medication. Went back to doctor and revisited a pat medication and just played with the dosage. Had to taper off of viibryd...nightmare! My doctor said he had 5 patients he had tried this on. Out of 5 one was a home run. I can't say don't try it because it could be someone's miracle drug. Everyone is different.		F	32	3  months40mg	11/27/2012
1	Depression/anxiety	Weight gain, horrifying nightmares, diarrhea, extreme anxiety, panicky, nausea, dizziness, irritability/anger/rage, sexual side effects. I've not finished my starter packet for the month which has gradually increased my dosage. I've been on several antidepressants and this one is one of the worst yet for me. I've gone from feeling crappy to feeling almost manic. Scared to finish rest of packet.		F	32	1  months40mg	11/25/2012
1	anxiety, depression	To the 33 year old that wants to know if anyone has ever lost weight from Viibryd.... According to most of the reviews I have read about Viibryd (and I have read a lot), most people are experiencing RAPID weight gain and food cravings. I went off of Viibryd, one week ago, because of its horrible side effects on me, and I have already lost 4 pounds. My mind is A LOT better too. I have only read of a couple of instances where people have actually lost weight. If you are hoping to lose weight from this drug, I think the odds are against you. I think that initially, when people start taking Viibryd, they feel better. After you have been on it for a while and your MG's titrate from 20-40, the side effects that Viibryd have on you are very scary, to say the least!		F	47	7  months40	11/23/2012
3	Anxiety, Depression	Just started taking this med.  I was on Lexapro for a number of years.  Went from a size 4 to 12 within a few years...not happy about that.  Sexual side effects.  Has anyone dropped weight switching to this drug?	Concerned about insomnia, as that was the original reason why I started taking any antidepressants.  The whole experience has just been annoying, to say the least.	F	33	1  days10 1X D	11/22/2012Email
1	Depression, anxiety	Increased depression and anxiety. 30 pound weight gain. Irritation, horrible craving for sweets. Very tired and unmotivated.	Viibryd is the worst antidepressant that has EVER been put out on the market!!! I stopped taking it TODAY. It  makes me MORE depressed, anxious and aggitated. I am ALWAYS tired and run-down. I can't get my work done at my job, because I don't have the desire or motivation. I sleep all of the time! I never want to do anything or go anywhere, because it takes too much energy to get ready. Viibryd has also caused some damage in my relationships with my family. I have become very short-tempered, aggressive and impatient with my kids and husband. It is not my nature to be so aggressive and angry. I use to exercise everyday, but I no longer do it, because it takes too much energy to get out of bed. I have joined a gym to MAKE myself get out and exercise. I use to exercise five times per week. I had high hopes that this medicine would help my depression and anxiety. However, it made it worse. I did not expect that!!! I'd rather be on NOTHING at all than on Viibryd.I hope, that by reading my experience on Viibryd, I have helped someone.	F	47	7  months40 MG 1X D	11/21/2012Email
5	major depressive disorder	Initial stomach upset with bouts of the runs. Joint pain as well. Over all less long term side effects than others Ive tried and the medication works great and started working within the first few weeks.		F	30	7  months40 mg	11/20/2012
2	major depression/bi-polar	anxiety, major dry mouth, my arms, hands and legs started loosing feeling. and all my joints ached. I didn't put the two together at first, it wasn't listed a side effect.  but it kept getting worse so I stoped taking Viibryd and the feeling is coming back, I'm not 100% - still have the joint pain and its still a bit hard to walk.	I'm sure that this drug has or is helping people.  It's just not the right med for me.  I'm also hopeing that the side effects I have from the drug will go away completely.  i've tried what seems like everything.. from the newest pill on the market to ECT and nothing is working.

5	To get off Effexor	A little diarrhea at first. Went away quickly.	Wonder drug. After 15 years on Effexor and almost complete sexual dysfunction, I am a new person. The sexual side effects are about zero and it works for D as well as the Effexor did. Absolute miracle.	M	59	6  weeks20 1X D	11/10/2012Email
2	depression	If you like having diarrhea, then this is the drug for you. Also very bad joint pain (knees & elbows) starting around the 4th week. Jaw clenching, difficulty staying focused.  Constant stomach churning at night. Constant yawning. Frequent urination.	Started with the 2 week pack. 10mg first week then 20mg second week. Never went higher than the 20mg as I was already having issues and was concerned about increasing the dosage. Got tired of trips to the bathroom so I have been off the drug now for 12 days. Lots of lingering side effects still. Dizzy off and on during the day. No sudden trip to the barhroom though. Frequent yawning has slowed down some but still there telling me that some of the drug is still floating around in me. Waas on Lexapro for 4+ years but that stopped working and it to had side effects but never as bad as Viibryd.	M	60	6  weeks20 1X D	11/10/2012
1	depression	Constipation, night terrors, paranoia,hallucination. The Dr gave me a starter pack I started on 10mg then 20mg then 40mg. By the time I got to 40mg my hair was falling out I wad so constipated that no type of laxitive worked. I was so paranoid that I thought I was going crazy. I called my Dr he took me off right away. Although it helped right away with my depression the side effects where more harmful than the depression. I wouldn't recommend this med to my worst enemy.		F	32	3  weeks40mg	10/22/2012Email

1	depression/anxiety	Paranoia,diarrhea,severe panic attacks,oh yea did I mention DIARRHEA.Wow after reading other peoples comments I dont feel crazy anymore, not the drug for me. I have never felt paranoid before it is really bad to the point I cant sleep, would not recomend this medication to a friend.		F	42	10  days20	10/16/2012
3	Depression and Anxiety	Very vivid dreams but I'm a dreamer anyway so these didn't effect me much. Sometimes I feel restless at night but not consistently. I feel it really has helped keep my emotions under control while I continue to work on daily. I would recommend as long as you gradually increase your dose.		F	35	3  months30 mg	10/14/2012Email
3	Anxiety, depression, OCD	I've taken a wide assortment of antidepressants (both SSRIs and SNRIs), and the one that helped the most was Lexapro.  Unfortunately, it stopped working.  I was recently put on Viibryd by my psych, and I've had relatively few side effects so far.  No digestive problems whatsoever.  I have become much more emotional, though--like reliving past tragedies in my head and sobbing about them for a few hours.  It's almost like reliving the grief cycle.  Also, Viibryd has made me prone to bouts of aggression.  Some days I think about punching some of my annoying co-workers (ha, ha), but I've managed to control my anger thus far.  I've also had some really bizarre dreams and night sweats.  Fun times all around.  As for anxiety, it's only somewhat effective.  I'm hoping it will decrease over time, since I've only been on this for a month.		F	33	1  months20 mg	10/2/2012

3	Bipolar 2	I was hypomanic after the death of my father in November. Began taking Depakote in early December for anger/rage/mood problems.  Psych suggested Abilify might help Depakote work better.  While my mood is better and my anger issues are nearly non-existent now, I'm finding I'm still a bit hypomanic and the Abilify creates extreme restlessness in me.  While my house has never looked better and I'm getting lots of project done, I find I can't sit still for longer than 10 minutes and by the end of the day my feet ache for being on them so long running around in the house and doing all my projects.	Together with Depakote.  Doc now prescribing propranolol for agitation/restlessness/irritability - would rather prescribe additional med for side effect than change primary meds...and I agree with his decision.  Doc now bumping me up to 10mg 1xday and propranolol 10mg 1xday.	F	36	7  weeks5mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email
1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.	F	52	8  years20 MG 1X D	1/13/2012Email
2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
