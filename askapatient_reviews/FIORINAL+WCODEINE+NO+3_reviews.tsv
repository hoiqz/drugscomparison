5	Sporadically over past 5 years	Slight drowsiness, not a huge appetite, other than that really nothing unpleasent, bothersome, or even worth mentioning.	This medication is a Godsend for my sporadic tension headaches.  I've tried numerous things: Fioricet, regular Fiorinal, Ultram, Vicodin Voltaren, Imitrex, Treximet, Zanaflex, Relpax, Keppra, and Bystolic, and the only 2 that really seemed to help to a worthy degree were Fiorinal/Fioricet (which are basically the same drug, except Fiorinal has aspirin where Fioricet has Tylenol instead), however these drugs lasted barely 4 hours and the comedown/crash was HORRIBLE.  F.w/codeine seems to last much longer, almost 8 hours, helps take away the pain and tension much better, and oddly enough doesn't make me near as loopy/drowsy as Fioricet/Fiorinal...actually it kinda jolted me up.  I can function at work when I take this med, unlike the previous two when I'd get loopy, start slurring my speech, and was quite dizzy and appeared buzzed to my coworkers.  Plus, when I took Fioricet/Fiorinal at night and then fell asleep, I'd wake up the next morning usually earlier than normal, my heart pounding and on the very of feeling like I was gonna have a panic attack.  When I take F.w/codeine at night then goto bed, I wake up the next morning completely fine, granted a tad groggy, but that passes.  I recently started taking it again, after about 5 years of not, and I'm working on getting the medical records from the previous doctor who oversaw me on this med.  I've just noticed it's difficult to talk to any doctor about it, because when they hear the word "Codeine" it's like you can	M	29	3  weeksusual 1X D	7/16/2012
4	severe migraines	I never got drowsy when I took it, I felt really hyper, and had alot of energy. This drug helped me so much with my migraines, I have had migraines for 30 yrs. When I was a kid I would get frequent headaches, as I got older severe migraines, I always end up  vomiting, sometimes I cannot stop. I would get heartburn once in a while from the aspirin, I couldn't sleep when I took it usually but it really did stop the migraine pain.	I do not take this medication anymore. I started abusing it, and Ativan 2mg. I was taking up to 10 or 12 Fiorinal a day and about 20mg or more of ativan. I would go through the script so quickly, and then the severe withdrawal would start. I started having seizures after abusing benzodiazepines for a lot of years, and then running out. I do not blame the drug(s) I blame me, because otherwise these drugs are generally safe and very effective. If you have any addiction issues, or you think you could start abusing the Fiorinal, please do not take it. I haven't had a seizure since 2007, but I lost my drivers license (of course), and I scared so many people who witnessed the seizures.	F	42	12  years 10X D	4/28/2012Email

1	Migraine	Fatigue, rebound headahe	I have suffered from Migraines for 20 years. I have been prescribed everything...Imitrex, Topomax, Fiornal, Axert, Relpax, Zomig) & used to go to the emergency room 1x week to get demerol shots! 10 years ago I found my miracle drug: Maxalt. As the years have gone by my body has built up a tolerance to it and it stopped working so for the past 2 years I've been combining Maxalt w/Excedrin Migraine which has been a great cocktail. Until recently, again I've built up a tolerance and it no longer works unless I take several Maxalt/Excedrine over a period of days and since my insurance only allows 9 Maxalt pills a month, so I need something new. I was searching the internet and came across this blog and I thought I'd found the Holy Grail! Fiornal w/Codeine #3 made total sense as it has the aspirin/caffeine combo that I had created myself with Maxalt/Excedrin! I got a prescription, but alas...it isn't working. My very first onset of a headache 2 days ago I took one: nothing. I took another one & it made tired so I slept & woke up feeling good. Then boom, another one started coming on...same thing: 1 didnt work, so I took 2 and now 2 didn't work so I made it through the day/night, went home/put an icepack on my head fell asleep and didn't wake up until 2:00 today...I slept for 15 hours! Worst part is that I can feel the headache still lingering in the backround waiting to pounce.	F	41	3  days 2X D	12/11/2010Email
5	Migraines	No side effects	I have had migraines all of my life, from childhood on.  This is the only medication that helps, and I have tried everything including participation in the Faulkner (Boston) Headache Center.  I do not understand why it is becoming difficult to find a prescription insurance program that covers this drug.  If anyone knows which company covers this drug I would appreciate hearing from you.  I'm dropping AARP/United Healthcare because they've just dropped this drug, and, as you have all noted, the generic doesn't work at all.	F	71	30  years30 MG 2X D	12/1/2010Email
5	tension headaches	occasional fatigue or rebound headache,constipation,upset stomach if taken on an empty stomach	In my opinion,this is one of the best pain killers on the market.It was prescribed to me initially for tension headaches and I have taken it off and on for nearly 25 years. One word of caution...This drug is or can easily become very addictive. Proceed with caution especially if you have an addictive personality. In my opinion,it is much stronger than hydrocodone. Unfortunately for me,after years of taking it,I became very dependent and at times would either take more than was prescribed or take it to "relax" or soften the blow of a stressful situation. (It had that affect on me). Before long...You get the story. That being said,if you need serious pain relief,this medication most likely will do the trick...Just proceed with caution as I mentioned and take it only as needed. (Over time,if taken regularly,(daily basis),it will lose its effectiveness and you could possibly end up addicted. No fun at all...	F	47	25  years 1X AN	10/3/2010Email
5	Migraine	Always: Dry Mouth, Euphoria, Anxious feeling Occasional: Constipation, Gas pains (if I havn't eaten, and lessened if I eat and take a Gas-X), Indigestion, Drowsiness	Best migraine releif I have had.  I have been on the same dosage for 8 years and never had to be bumped up from C1/2s.  I take these for migraine pain as well as Topamax now for prevention.	F	24	8  years 1X AN	7/14/2010
5	tension & migraine headaches	dry mouth	I have been taking this medication 4x a day for years and now the Insurance Companies won't let me get the brand name unless I want to pay $310.00 a month so they are forcing me to take the generic which I tried years ago and it didn't work. I'm hoping this time it works because I can't afford brand name. This is the only medication that works	F	47	25  years	1/8/2010
5	chronic migraine	withdrawal is scary, make sure you don't take it every day, it will also lose effectiveness that way	the best drug I've taken, manage your dosage well and you can enjoy being highly functional and pain free for periods of time, I swear the generic is not the same as brand, but if expense is not an issue get brand	F	51	32  years	8/7/2009
4	Tension headaches	Drowsiness, reduction in mental alertness.	This drug is quite helpful for treating tension headaches, but not extremely effective for treating migraine headaches.  Often, a combination tension/ sinus headache will mimic the symptoms of a migraine. I have found that combining Fiorinal along with 60 mg of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (pseudophed), almost always eliminates a bad sinus headache, and usually eliminates a tension headache. The only medication which works for my migraines is a migraine specific medication called Maxalt. I take the Maxalt first, wait 20 minutes, then take the Fiorinal. Works every time.	F	47	21  years	7/21/2009
5	Migraines & Neck pain	Mild stomach upset if I have not ate.	I have suffered with Migraines since I was 15, this is the only medicine (I have been on almost everything)that lets me live a normal life. I take 1 - 4X a day & also have a rhisodomy (Cauterization of the nerves between the 1-6 vertebrae) on my neck every 6-12 months. My use has been almost nonstop since age 25, yet I am not bothered with any withdrawal symptoms or nervousnous when I am able to go without them. Which I do, at least 3 days a month. My Pain Control specialist has no problem prescribing these, I just have to be seen every 6 months before he will renew them. It is the pharmacists & the generic pill pushers that have a problem with them. The Generic does not work!!!!	F	55	39  years	6/30/2009
4	migraines	Extreme fatigue	Wonderful for managing my migraines, however I find it difficult to function on the job with even one pill (I'm begging to go to sleep).	F	31	6  months	4/24/2009
5	Hurt fingers using a maddock	This medicine really helped reduce the throbbing and the pain experienced when I accidently had the steel end of a maddock (pick axe, flathead)ricochet back onto me . . . but, as a side effect, gave me the sleep I needed as well. Some lethargy was experienced the next morning after a really excellent sleep, but that only lasted until about lunchtime(about 5 hours).	Fiorinal also assisted my wife with periodic migraines, it's effects really giving relief to her ! I really recommend this medicine when other pain relievers, such as Panadiene Forte, can not be acquired "over the counter".	M	57	4  days	4/4/2009
5	Migraines	Drowsiness (which is a god-send with a migraine)	I take 2 at the first hint of a migraine and can usually abort it. With a severe mirgraine I may have to take 4 to 6 fiorinal a day. Have tried other medications and have had severe side effects, this is the greatest medication ever for migraines.  I use brand name fiorinal w/codeine, it is more expense, but generic does not work as well for me.  Be careful to not overuse, it won't work as well and you may develop addition.	F	52	20  years	3/25/2009
5	MIGRAINES	HYPER, CONSTIPATION	I have suffered migraines for SEVERAL YEARS and this is the only thing that works. The key is to take as soon as you feel migraine coming. It will knock it RIGHT OUT, and you can function. Even the worse migraines were lessened due to this medication. I was amazed!	F	36	5  years	3/6/2009
1	severe migraines	Light headed, nausea, AND ADDICTION	If you are loving this medicine!!! you ARE addicted!! it is true that it relieves the pain but at a certain point your body start craving it more and more.. and without you knowing you will not be able to function without it... your body is very smart and will get you a migraine just to get the drug!! BEWARE...!!!! I just got out of a week of hell... withdrawal symptoms: Anxiety, shaking, sleepiness, nausea/throwing up, short breath, and more... and I was on 2  day as well thinking I was making myself feel better with the medicine but for real I was intoxicating myself little by little... if you are in doubt try to stop for a couple of days and see your body's reaction you'll be surprised. there are plenty of other drugs that do not have narcotic but still work just as good for migraine relief... and I'm going that way. I'm started loosing my memory a lot lately and I'm pretty sure it because of this "medication".	F	34	15  years	2/15/2009
5	Migraines, tension headaches	Constipation	I have used this for years for migraines about 2-3X a month.  Lately I have needed to take more (2-4x week) mostly for tension headaches.  I think this is because of a job change in which I am in front of a computer 10-12 hours per day/6 days per week.  I've found that if I don't take it for the tension headaches and try to push through the pain they get worse and feel like a migraine (vomiting, severe pain).  My fear is that I will develop a dependency but like others have tried many types of pain management and this is the only one that works.  Is there anyone out there taking as much as I am--about 10-14 per week?  Not everyday but often have to take 2, twice a day to get complete relief and up to 6 per day for severe migraine episodes that usually last 1 day. Any advice is appreciated.	F	49	17  years	2/3/2009
5	Chronic headaches	Minimal	Raises pain threshold to levels where I can function. Prior to taking F#3 I was ressigned to driving my head into walls and sliding into vortexes of pain - perhaps lasting days.  F#3 is better than stronger narcotics. Why suffer?	M	45	12  years	9/6/2008
4	headaches/migraines	a bit sleepy	Great drug, would not be able to function at my job without it. I get frequent headaches and being a teacher of High School students, without the medication, I would not be able to teach and the kids would be jumping out of their seats!	F		5  years	7/16/2008
5	Migraines	None, this drug has been a God send for me.  It is the ONLY drug that has every worked for me.  I am able to lead a normal life because of it.	I have never experienced rebound headaches.  I have been using it for 40+ years and have never become addicted.  I only use it when I need it NOT DAILY.	F	58	40  years	6/3/2008
5	Nerve damage(eye) headaches	Fiornal #3 keeps me pain-free between nerve blocks and able to function. I take 1 3x day and if having shooting pain down side of face can take 2. They tried other meds. but my pain management dr. knows this is what help me. He prescribed (dugesic, morphine...etc.(much stronger drugs) but these left me unable to function normally and did not get rid of pain lke Fiorinal #3. My mother takes it for migranes and so that is how I knew to try it. It is really a life-saver so I can have a normal life!....TR   I had 4 sinus surgeries...that produced nerve damage above eye.	Best medication on market.Do not understand WHY drs. have a problem w/ prescribing insted of Vicodin, and Tylenol #3.	F	39	3  years	5/29/2008
4	chronic headache	sometimes mild stomach upset if taken on empty stomach	what can I say? have fibromyalgia and allergy headaches triggered by airborne pollutants like the perfume put in those awful clothes dryer sheets. Fiorinal knocks the headached out. Except for those dryer sheets. Avoid those like the plague undying. They are loaded with toxic chemicals and headache triggers. Do a websearch on those; avoiding that stuff cut the number of my headaches by 50percent.	F	49	8  years	10/8/2007
5	Tension headaches	Constipation	This is a wonderful drug is you take it at the onset of a headache. It can unfortunately cause rebound headaches, so be careful, and only take it when necessary. A huge problem is with getting physicians to prescribe it without problems!	F	42	17  years	10/5/2007
5	SEVERE Tension Headaches	None	It's a God-send!!  Already taking Lortab 10/500 and Soma for advanced degenerative joint/disc disease and they do NOTHING for these tension headaches.  This script even helps my most severe migraines!  What a relief to have discovered Fiorinal #3!!  I have had the same tension headache since 6/28/07 until today.  AMAZING!!  But thank God for my Medicare Part D supplement!!  A little "pricey."  But even if not covered by a supplement - worth every cent!!  Tell all your friends.  It's the only combo. that works.  My doctor is awesome in knowing what to prescribe.  J. Audie Lim, MD, PA - Wichita Falls, TX.	M	43	1  days	8/15/2007Email
5	migraine headaches	constipation	it changed my life when i began useing fiorinal/codeine.before i would be in bed for days with headaches and was always worried about getting headaches.i also take imitrex and sometimes use  fiorinal as a preventative.i do worry about dependence though.	F	56	10  years	7/18/2007
4	chronic headaches/neck pain	a little nausea, constipation and drowsiness	this has been the only medicine that has helped me, as well.  I seem to have tried everything on the market!  You have to be careful to take this only when needed, but as long as you follow the doctors orders, this medicine should really help.  Taking it at nighttime really helps the pain...I no longer wake up with headaches...and, since it does tend to make me drowsy, I find that taking it at night is the most helpful for me.	F	26	2  years	7/9/2007
5	migraines,neck & back pain	occasionaly have indigestion	Best pain medication for migraines I have ever taken..I've taken many...gives me a life...cannot continue as a floral designer w/o it	F	58	21  years	4/21/2007Email
5	migraines, fibromyalgia syndrome		This is a great medication for migraines. It helps me function with a migraine and also helps with the daily pain from fibromyalgia. I have tried many other pain meds for my chronic pain and this works very well with the least side effects. My doctors are reluctant to prescribe it for the chronic pain - I wish they would let me decide what works for me.	F	50	20  years	3/31/2007
5	Migrains	Constipation (light), memory lapses, vulnerability to rebound headache.	Great, complete relief from pain. Taken no more than 2 or 3 times per week. Benefits subside if taken more often. Best medication I ever had for headaches.	M	77	46  years	3/24/2007
5	severe migraines	stomach ache, gurgling stomach, feelings of constipation (even w/ none)	Excellent for migraines. Initially took Tylenol #3 and then dr prescribed fiorinal #3. The difference is amazing, I can finally function again. The only problems I have is that my headaches come on late in the evening and the caffeine makes it hard to sleep. I also feel that it wears off quickly and I'm so paranoid about abusing it that I don't like to take more than 1 per day.	F	33	9  months	3/15/2007
5	Migraines		Absolutely the best Medication prescribed. I was on Fiorinal without Codeine for 2 years, but after a relapse, my Doctor prescribed it again with Codeine.	M	39	6  years	3/11/2007
5	migraine	sometimes a dry mouth	It works! The best migraine medicine I have taken in the 30+ years I have been fighting with migraines and trying all the meds.	M	48	90  days	3/4/2007
3	migraine	When I was taking topamax for prevention, taking fiorinal made me very hyper, and when that feeling wore off, the headache was usually gone, too-- unless it was one of my worst.  Now that I am on Depakote, it makes me feel sick and sleepy.	Basically a good match for break throughs if you're on topamax.	F	40	6  years	2/14/2007
4	Migraines/tension headaches	A few times, several hours after taking a second dose, I got such a bad stomachache that lead to vomiting for hours.  Mostly though I just get a gurgly stomach if I only take one.	It does really get rid of the headache though so I continue to take it. Nothing else has really worked for me but this.	F	38	1.5  years	2/8/2007
5	tension headaches	Constipation, dry mouth	I agree - the only thing that works for headachess - in response to the person who had problem with pharmacies - I had problems with one pharmacy - would not fill as doctor prescribed (limited qty) - however, they are usually very good.Did find another nationwide pharmacy that has filled mine without any question (according to way prescribed).  Since I don't abuse it and only take according to directions, I switched pharmarcies for that presc.	M	50	4  years	1/18/2007
5	Migraine headaches	Dry mouth (only after menopause); occasional constipation; some drowsiness	Have taken this drug on and off for 33 years (since age 19) for migraines. Although I use Imitrex for severe migraines, I still take Fiorinal as a backup for less severe headaches. I have a low tolerance for pain and a very high tolerance for drugs. My doc lets me have 2 capsules every 4 hrs., max. 4 capsules per day for 3 days in a row, then says I should stop for at least 3 days before taking it again. But I've taken as much as 6 capsules per day for 4 days without any side effect more severe than drowsiness (which is better than pain). My mother also took this drug in the 1960s and '70s for migraines, but she could tolerate only one capsule every 4 hrs. It got rid of her pain but made her very nauseous. My idiot sister took it once and claimed it gave her hallucinations -- go figure!	F	52	33  years	12/4/2006
5	Headache/neck muscle ache	Some chance of constipation if taken for more than a day	I started taking it 40 years ago and it has been wonderful--allowed me to have a life when the pain was interfering with my activity (had three sons). I've been extremely careful not to over-use it and not to drive while taking it, just in case. I take one pill every four hours and seldom have to take a third one. If I do, I then feel a bit woozy. I always feel I have to reassure the doctor that I will use the drug with moderation. In Canada the fiorinal required a triplicate prescription while I had thought the codeine was the part to watch out for! Excellent medication for me. My extreme achiness is relieved every time.	F	55	40  years	10/15/2006
5	dibilitating migraines	dry mouth	I would recommend this medicine to anyone who experiences migraines.  It keeps me functioning most days.  I have tried all there is to try, and nothing else works, (including fioricet with codeine for some reason).  It is frustrating that doctors and pharmacists have such a hard time prescribing this. I have been taking it off and on, mostly on now, for over 20 years.	F	48	 	9/12/2006
5	Migraine headache	Constipation, tiredness as effects wear off, stomach upset	This drug has kept me on my feet, having a life for 20 some years. It is the only thing that I found that took away the pain but did not incapacitate me with side effects. I have only recently increased the dosage from 1 to 2. Problem is that pharmacists seem determined to roadblock refills even though it is clear to my doctor that it helps and I am not selling or abusing. Anyone else getting resistance from pharmacies?	F	57	22  years	6/30/2006
5	Severe daily pain due to accident	I do not have any side effects if I take Ranidine (excuse sp) with Fioninel-3.	It is the only medication that allows me to continue working. I am 62 and work as a paralegal.  I would not be able to keep my job if I could not function as well as paralegals half my age.  I have restricted movement in my right arm and shoulder due to a fall and have been injured in a car accident as well as a fall down a flight of stairs.  However, with the relief I get from this medication, I can continue with my life in a normal fashion, with limited right arm/shoulder range of motion.	F	62	4  years	6/14/2006Email
5	Severe Tension headaches	Some GI irritation - nothing in comparison to the relief provided for my headache.		F	36	 	5/9/2006
5	h/a and body pain	none	this is the first med that takes my h/a and body pain away. i was hit by a car as a kid and broke lots of bones and they ache now. i broke my head, back and pelvis to name a few. i get a good nights sleep with this med. i only take it at night. i wake up w/o a h/a if i take it at bedtime if i don't i can't sleep due to all the body pain.	F	46	6  months	5/4/2006
5	Severe headaches, neck injury, FMS	None at all. If I go the day without eating sometimes will get a sour stomach, but goes away after some food. Have had severe migraine type headaches since childhood, this is only thing that works and lets me function. With my other conditions it helps relieve the pain and lets me have a life. Have only good things to say about it and only have had a good experience. 	Rx for headaches in '94. Used only as needed. In'98 got fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue, plus (auto related)permanent neck down nerve damage. Dr. increased to daily for chronic pain. Worked very well, allowed me a life. Anyone else use Fiorinal#3 daily for chronic pain? (New Dr. wants to try ultram. Tried,had side effects, did nothing for pain.)	F	52	12  days	2/8/2006Email
3	back pain	none	na			90  days	9/9/2005
5	Severe migraines since childhood.	Since this is the only migraine medication that has ever worked for me (I have tried everything on the market, even becoming a trial study patient of Imitrex before it was approved by the FDA) I no longer have any side effects. I have been taking this for almost 40 years. On very rare occassions I might get constipated but either I take Senokot or eat ice cream, and that answers the constipation problem.	Many doctors do not want to prescribe this since it is a narcotic. But in all the years I have been on it, my dosage has stayed the same once the proper configurations for me finally got figured out. I never abuse this drug, never take more than necessary, and rather than taking it	F	50	37  years	8/17/2005

5	Severe migraine	Occasional sleepiness or eurphoria (not uncomfortable, just there). Also, occasional stomach upset.	Fiorinal #3 is, in my opinion, the best drug on the market for people who suffer from true migraines or tension headaches, and the ONLY drug that effectively and reliably relieves my migraines. It really should only be used occasionally, though, because it will start to be less effective if used too frequently. One more hint...avoid caffiene when using fiorinal.	F		2  years	5/7/2005
5	Migraine headaches	Thirst, stomach ache once in a while	This medicine is the only drug that will touch my migraines. I strongly recommend it to anyone who suffers from them...as all migraine patients know, the pain is usually unbearable. Fiorinal really works when used correctly.	F	26	3  years	5/7/2005
5	tension headaches with neck pain	minor thirst & drowsiness that went away after a few uses	Fiorinal #3 is the only medicine that has worked for me, and I have tried many of the newer triptophans such as Imitrex. It is great to have something that keep headaches from totally incapacitating me. I strongly recommend it to anyone who has frequent tension headaches or migraines.	F	30	6  years	5/7/2005
5	migraines	dry mouth, a little nausea	this works best for me as it helps to relax the muscles in my neck while the opiates and aspirin take care of the pain.	F	52	2  years	4/7/2005
5	Tension and Sinus Migraines	None	This is the ONLY prescription medicine that works on my migraines that are stress, neck pain and sinus related. I recommend this medicine and it does not cost a lot compared to other migraine rx meds now on the market.	F	28	12  years	4/3/2005
5	Tension Headaches	First couple times taking it, I experienced minor constipation and lower abdominal cramps, which went away.	Absolutely better than any other medication I have tried for tension headaches: including it's	M	17	3  months	2/28/2005
5	Dibilitating Migraines	excessive thirst,	Very effective for my Migraines. Need to take it at the first hint of migraine starting. It is the only medication that gives me any relief from severe migraines.	F	53	25  years	1/18/2005
5	migraine					 	12/30/2004
4	migraine	Heart rate increases, sleepiness, constipation.	I also take for neck/shoulder pain and its the only thing that helps.  Sometimes makes me energized, and sometimes makes me sleepy.  I have taken for 12 years off and on, now mostly on.	F	47	12  years	12/20/2004
