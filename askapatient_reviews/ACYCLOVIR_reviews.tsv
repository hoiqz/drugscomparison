5	Genital herpes	I love it! It's like a wonder drug for herpes. I haven't had any side effects with it either.		F	23	4  years400 mg	3/5/2013Email
5	cold sores	None		F		5  years800 mg	2/3/2013
4	Cold sores	Ive suffered from cold sores as long as I can remember. If I can catch it at the tingle,  I can prevent it from ever becoming a visible sore to anyone other than myself with acyclovir pills.  It's amazing. If I catch it later it drastically cuts healing time down. I've used it as a preventative medicine as well if I feel like getting sick or going on a trip and realllllly don't want to worry about getting one. I also use tea tree oil with it. Side effects: severe acid reflux- regardless of what I eat or drink and I'm not prone to it otherwise. I also have pain in my back and head and just feel kinda lousy overall for the couple days of the heavy dose while killing the thing. I'm willing to deal with it. The pain, embarrassment and general discomfort of the cold sore is far worse in my opinion.		F	34	4  days400mg	1/28/2013
3	shingles	severe throbbing headache		F	27	5  days800mg 5X D	1/26/2013
2	Shingles	Extreme nausea and pain in abdomen when I Am about to pass gas. Been taking for 4 days now and the breakout has cleared up some but I have noticed a few areas popinjay up on my eye lid again. Every time I eat I feel extremely sick toy stomach some to the point where I vomit. Due to this I have lost over ten pounds.		M	37	4  days800mg	11/29/2012Email
2	Shingles	Horrible stomach cramping and diarrhea, headaches, tiredness, shortness of breath by day 4, when I decided to stop.		F	27	4  days800mg 5x/d	11/20/2012
1	HSV2	None. This medicine hasn't worked at all. I was diagnosed visually. Im having a culture done just to make sure i wasn't misdiagnosed. I'm still burning still itching. I feel like I'm not taking any medicine. I'm going to get a second opinion.		F	25	2  days200 MG	11/1/2012
5	Shingles	At first the drug only caused chronic diarrhea, and G.E.R.D..  Then as time passed, I developed fatigue, joint pain, weight gain, loss of sex drive, muscle stiffness, and mood swings.	Prior to taking this drug I had constant shingles for almost 25 years without any relief.  I participated in many studies (as a subject) on shingles without any signs of relief.  Much of the time I also had cases of Staff infection from the open sores and blisters getting infected.  I always had to be careful of anything causing physical or mental stress (loud music, too much sun, catching a cold, becoming angry or agitated, etc...) for fear that the shingles would become more prevalent.  When I began my treatments, within a week 25 years of constant agony was gone!  I do occasionally get brief bouts of shingles with only a fraction of the previous severity.  I have developed Krohn's disease-like symptoms (without having the genetic disposition for it), but it is STILL worth taking the pills for me not to have Shingles.

5	Cold sores	Bad taste in mouth for last month.  Nothing else unusual.	I have had cold sores since I was a baby.  I discovered Chapstick SPF 15 when I was in my twenties.  That has helped me as I spend a lot of time in the sun.  However, stress and illness still triggered breakouts.  I averaged about 6 to 8 breakouts a year.  After a lifetime of enduring random painful breakouts, I decided enough was enough.  I consulted my doctor and he put me on Acyclovir 200 mg daily.  After I had two minor breakouts the following 2 months, he upped it to 400 mg daily.  Worked for almost 8 months, and then I had three breakouts in less than a month.  This third one is on top of my bottom lip and it is a large one, but it crusted over the next day.  I have been taking 1600 mg (800 mg 2xdaily) for five days.  I still have it but it is almost gone.  Before this medicine, it would have taken a week or more to reach the crusty stage.  I am going to talk to my doctor about upping the dosage to 800 mg daily.  Hope it works to prevent future breakouts.  I do use a topical product called Oil of Mercy.  That helps as well to heal sores.	F	47	9  months400 mg 1X D	8/21/2012Email
5	genital herpes	I had no bad side effects. It doesn't make the outbreak go right away, but it definitely shortens the time, and cut the severe pain I was having in half. Sucks to have to take it so often though.		F	21	3  months400mg	8/2/2012
1	genital herpes- prevent shedding	abdominal pain, lower back pain, gas, fatigue, spotting in between period	I wanted to get started on suppressant therapy just because I never want to experience an outbreak. I chose acyclovir because I did research and determined that it had a pretty good success rate and the side effects are minimal, plus it is cheaper. Well of course my body doesn't go for the affordable medication and I have been experiencing a dull pain in my back and abdomen. I can mostly deal with this, but the gas and the spotting are a big nuisance. I haven't seen spotting as a possible side effect, but I know I'm not getting my period because I just had it. And I never experience this much gas during a period either, so I really know it's not that. Any other females experience spotting between their periods? I want to switch to famvir, but I'm afraid it will put me in the same situation, same with valtrex. Plus they are both way more expensive than acyclovir and I don't have insurance. Ugh.	F	28	7  days400 2X D	8/1/2012Email
4	Outbreaks every 3 weeks	Very tired. Very. Some days not so bad. But always wanting to nap. Have not had a breakout since though, and they were so frequent I think It's worth it. 400mg twice a day works for me.		M	23	3  months400mg 2xD	5/29/2012
2	HSV-2	Extreme drowsiness.	It's a pain taking all these pills so many times a day. I recommend Valtrex instead. I'd honestly rather put up with an outbreak than have to take these pills.	F	21	1  weeks400MG 3X D	5/13/2012
2	Suppression and to avoid shedding	The medicine is causing symptoms of an OB such as tingling in the back of the leg and at the lesion site.	I have had no problems for over 20 years, but I am dating someone new and want to minimize the risks for him. I am so shocked to read that other people are experiencing similar issues that I'm having, the tingling as if an outbreak is coming.  I am going to stop.  Life and past relationships were perfect previously and I don't want to start having any OBs.	F	42	8  days200mg 2X D	3/27/2012Email
2		Nothing not working		F	29	1  months	3/16/2012
1	Herpes, types 1 & 2	Fatigue, drowsiness, constipation, flatulence, nausea, hair loss, acne, GU pain (along the whole system), insomnia	Is it worth taking?	F	33	365  days1g 1X D	3/12/2012
5	Cold sore on nose	Dr recommended this after I had a severe breakout that covered the entire bottom of my nose. Helped heal it a lot faster. Now I start taking it when I feel one coming on and it stops it in its tracks. I love it.		F	26	3  years400mg	3/6/2012
5	shingles	No real side effects other than a bad taste in the mouth. 1 day, I did not drink enough water, and my urine was dark and smelled, but the days I kept well hydrated were fine.	took 5x a day, which isn't in the options on this site. Within 3 days the rash stopped spreading, mostly gone at end of scrip.	M	28	7  days800mg 4X D	2/15/2011
4	Cold Sore HSV1	None so far	I feel so much better and I have loads of energy as before I was exhausted and a wreck. Also before each outbreak I usually have lower back pain from a bulging disk and then get sick sometimes followed by a cold sore and strange rash on my face. I wonder if this is my immunity being lowered by stress and a combination nerve disorder.	F	29	7  days500mg 3X D	12/8/2010
4	episodic cold sores/fever blisters	NONE Length of time taking drug (listed above is duration of each episode.. but i've actually taken it for about 15 years.	keeps blisters from getting as large. shortens healing time. i keep a couple on hand to make sure i can take it the second i feel an outbreak coming on so that it's most effective, and then call my doctor for refill in order to continue taking the full script.  After reading various other sites, i do believe that perhaps i need to take the 200 mg 5x a day or increase dosage to 400mg (various suggestions for frequency of dosage were listed)in order to get the maximum effectiveness from the medicine..and possibly even shorter healing time--- but i'll have to discuss it further with my doctor first.i do use abreva and curasore as topical meds to ease the itching/burning.	F	33	10  days200 mg 4X D	11/3/2010
4	Herpes 1 Chin	Awake, alert, better concentration, mild back and leg pain.	Had breakouts on cheek for 6 years.  Went to 7 doctors and all kinds of tests.  I recently found out that the dermatologist misdiagnosed me 3 years ago. I am taking this drug now for 3 weeks and the cheek is healing, but slowly.  But the side effects have helped me with being chronically fatiqued all my life.  The back and muscle pain could be due to not drinking enough water.  So far I am very happy with this drug.	F	42	21  days800 MG 2X D	7/19/2010
5	herpes simplex 2	none yet	I like this drug. and my bf does also. he never would take valtrex because he seen how it made me feel. i wish i would have known about it before i spent 230.00 on valtrex. it works better anyway i'm not tired and we don't have outbreaks anymore.	F	23	1  months400  mg 2X D	7/16/2010
5	SHINGLES*(on back and chest)	The drug made me feel tired, and I was constantly thirsty--but my doctor warned me of these likely side effects, so I expected to be tired and drank lots of fluids/water.  I noticed that my urine was dark yellow every time I peed, no matter how much water/fluids I drank--that was mildly disquieting, as I worried about kidney function, but it returned to normal the day I stopped taking the drug, so it's temporary kidney stress.  I would not use the drug if I had kidney disease, and many elderly people have that without knowing it.  *(perhaps that's a really good reason for elderly people or people with kidney disease to get the new live shingles vaccine--to prevent needing to use a kidney-stressing drug)**	This drug(generic ACYCLOVIR) is MUCH cheaper than many other anti-virals, and it really worked to reverse the wicked shingles on my back and chest----and it did so in 5 days!  I have never had oral or genital herpes, and this was my first episode of shingles, but from what I've read and been told, my shingles episode was really minor compared to ones not treated with Acyclovir.  i heard horror stories about shingles lasting 6 months in some people!  OUCH-UGLY-NO THANKS! I have very minor pain in the area where the shingles lesions have healed, but i don't really expect this to bother me even if it takes a while to disappear.  I was told that untreated shingles often lead to horrible post-herpetic pain and that the drug is mostly used to prevent that--thus, the reversal of the painful and ugly blisters is just a superficial side-benefit and not the main goal.  I would definititely recommend this drug to anyone with shingles, unless they have kidney disease.  I am young and healthy so could use it in the strongest oral(non-IV) dose as needed.  I was warned that even with use of the drug, I remained "highly contagious for Chickenpox" to any baby or other non-immune person, so I didn't let it's effectiveness allow me to forget that.  I had to be careful who I was in close proximity to until the lesions were healed.  I can see the effectiveness of the drug being a negative--persons might be so happy with the results that they accidentally forget they have a contagious di	F	47	5  days800 mg 4X D	6/26/2010
4		ashy, dull skin, facial swelling, mood swings, low back pain, exhaustion	This works, but always take with food and drink plenty of water through the day.  I tend to break out just before my menstrual cycle begins. Do not exceed the prescribed dose ever as it does not help any faster, and side effects are more severe.  Keep a good cocoa butter lip balm, water and lotion on hand at all times as your skin will most likely become parched.	F	29	5  days800 2X D	4/14/2010Email
3	not sure, in a research study	insomnia	I have only been taking this for 2 days now. The only side effects I have seen so far is insomnia, not sure if it's from the medicine , or from the other meds I take...	F	34	2  days400mg 2X D	2/12/2010
5	HSV 2	Initial headaches, but none now.	I have been using it to prevent outbreaks for 3 years. It just works. Tried Valtrex and it made me dizzy, and it costs a lot more. So I am sticking with generic Acyclovir. It is a pain to have to remember to take it twice a day, but it is so worth it.	F	52	3  years	11/23/2009Email
4	genital herpes	diarrhea	It stops outbreaks erupting if you take it soon enough and reduces recovery time to 2-3 days.	F	47	10  years	11/13/2009
4	genital herpes	None come to mind.	This doesn't work all the time. I do still get the occasional outbreak. But hey it's cheaper than valtrex and it's decent.	F	17	10  months	9/23/2009
1	Shingles	Horrible abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting	After horrible nerve pain in my left thigh, I was diagnosed with a stress related shingles outbreak. I never had any leisions though. I took acyclovir for aprox 30 hours the began experiencing crippling abdominal pain along with nausea and vomitting. I ended up in the ER and the docs thought I had a bowel obstruction. After a negative CT scan they told me it was caused by the acyclovir! It was not worth it at all!! I may think that because I had no leisions so I don't know how horrible they are but I will NEVER take this drug again!	F	25	 	9/13/2009
3	Herpes	exhaustion, lower back pain,depression, sadness, constipation, stomach ache, hair loss, numbness in fingers, legs and feet and toes	It works! I have a lot of side effects tho.	F	22	4  years	8/25/2009Email
5	genital herpes	Worked great in suppressing breakouts. Took for a long period of time everyday. I started noticing a very significant amount of hair loss. I had very long hair. Hair loss ( alopecia ) is a side effect. Wish I had found out about that side effect before I almost went bald. Doc has now put me on Famvir. Don't know much about it, but seems to work good and hair loss is not a side effect.		F	25	7  years	8/10/2009
5	Shingles	Sluggish, depressed, sad, tired anger.  Loss of appetite. Loss of interest in activites.	Worth the side effects.  Solved my pain from shingles of the ear and face within days. Side effects were minimal enough I didn't realize they were related to the medication until day seven out of 10 days total.			10  days	5/7/2009Email
4	oral herpes	weakness and fatigue; headaches initially.	I have been taking it for a week after a first time horrific outbreak of oral herpes with fever, swollen glands and soreness following a period of high stress.  The sores began healing after about 3-4 days on the medication(outbreak began 10 days ago) but I am extremely exhausted and achy still, and I think it's caused by the medication.  Taking 800 mg 5 times a day.  Had headaches for the first 3 days, then those tapered off.  Makes me feel spacy and very physically weak, but I think it helped shorten the infection time, so I'll take the side effects	F	52	7  days	2/16/2009
2						 	1/19/2009
5	herpes	sluggishness, mild indigestion, loss of appetite, looser stools, occasional gas with oily discharge, general increase in flatulence	Helped clear the rash after an initial two days of "why is it getting worse?" and then everything being gone within a week.  The side-effects annoying but they beat having nasty sores for more than a few days that make sitting down very uncomfortable.  Eating something with the pills do help as does keeping well-hydrated.  I'm hoping I don't get anymore outbreaks but I know if I get another one, there's some good stuff to relieve the worst of it.  First time I took it was 10 days, subsequent times have been 5 days by the way.	F	29	10  days	12/22/2008
4	Herpes Simplex	Generally tired and fatigued and also caused me to have mood swings. The slightest raised voice or critism made me cry and become depressed for a few hours.	I break out less often, sores are milder and heal faster. I only take Acyclovir when I have a break out now or know I am getting a break out (times of high stress or illness). When younger, the severity of my sores left me scars and eye damage on the entire left side of my face. I haven't had a sore in months.	F	24	6  years	8/14/2008
1	Herpes simplex	dark red/yellow eyes, headache, light sensitivity, swollen face, general feeling awful	had to stop taking after two and a half days. (was on 800mg five times a day)	F	46	2  days	2/25/2008
3	Herp	Makes me extremely sleepy, because of this I can only take it at night. When I do take it at night I cant remember the night when I wake up in the morning.	Clears up my outbreak when I take it right. However the side effects are too great.	F	21	7  months	1/15/2008
5	Fever Blisters	NONE	It works use to have outbreaks monthly.Have not had one while on it 2 years.got off had one a month after off i take200mg every other day. i break a 400 in half and use the half every other day.	M	46	3  years	1/7/2008
5	herpes	none.	so far, so good.  only had one outbreak and started it during the intial one to treat it and reduce the time it lasted.  it did that and i felt better within a couple days.  take it now, 2 pills a day as a preventative measure.  very cheap, even without insurance (although I do have it).	F		 	11/11/2007
5	cold sores herpes	none	i have had cold sores since i was a child. the breakouts always occurring on my face. very embarrassing. i also have fibromyalgia and infections make my symtoms worse. this drug has been a godsend for me. i use to take it just when i started to get a breakout, but now take one 400mg tablet, a day and  have been breakout free for 1 1/2 years. i use to have 5 or six breakouts a year.	F	51	10  days	4/24/2007
5	cold sore/herpes simplex	none	It works great. It starts working on the same day I takeit and prevents a full out break of a blister. If I take it before a blistet appears, then I never even get one.	F	24	2  years	2/16/2007
5	Fibromyalgia and EBV/CMV	No Side effects. I use Ivax Generic 800mg Pills, Great Pain Specialist Doc Has things under control. My Dosage is 800mg 5 times a Day for 4 months on and 4 months off.
