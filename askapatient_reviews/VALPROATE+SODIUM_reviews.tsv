4	Borderline Personality Disorder	Tiredness, bloating, weightgain, yawning, bizarre dreams, blurred vision	This drug, also known as Sodium Valproate/Epilim in Australia, has been instrumental in helping me get some balance and self control in my life. I am calmer, my self hate has decreased to mere dislike on occasions, mainly because I am not having ridiculous highs of being the greatest person in the world followed by extended bouts of being the only shitty human being the world has ever seen.  With my moods stabilised, i am more rational & less reactive and the prospect of actually being alive for the next 40 years doesn't seem so terrifying. I am not taking anti depressant (effexor) anymore but there would have to be some incredibly compelling reason for me to stop taking this drug Depacon/Sodium Valproate because it has helped save my life and helps me feel "normal", more in control of what happens inside my brain and not subject to the whims of my emotional state.

3	Bipolar II	Initial flu-like symptoms, weird dreams and tiredness. Subsided after a couple of weeks. OUTRAGEOUS outta control hunger. Gained 10lbs so far. Obsessed with eating more & more even if I've just eaten a full meal.	Felt 'level' after about a month on 1000mg. Then after 1 week of that it stopped working. Upped to 1500 after that, still not feeling any benefits for my bipolar. Obsessive hunger getting worse and worse. Trying to persuade my psych to let me try something else.	F	37	2  months	10/30/2008
1	fibromyalgia, cfs	I didn't realise until I was prescribed this that there are three ways to feel temperature. This drug made me depressed and it made me feel cold. I don't mean chilly. I mean existentially I-will-never-feel-warm-again. It took me 18 months after I stopped taking it to feel even vaguely normal. And I never used to feel cold; now I have to rug up in winter just like normal people.	This made me so ill I ended up in front of a welfare department psychologist. She was the only person who actually believed this drug was responsible. She even explained why. She was very angry with my doctor. Of course, if I hadn't been so depressed I could have worked it out for myself - 'anti-manic' is just a politically correct term for a depressant.  My doctor thought I was depressed about my illness to start with.  I now know what real depression feels like. This drug may damage your hypothalamus. Approach with extreme caution.
