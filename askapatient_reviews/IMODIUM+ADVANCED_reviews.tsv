1	for a week long diarrheal illness	Taken only once, I had severe cramping, pain, vomiting and bloating, which necessitated a trip to the ER where they thought I had appendicitis. Only after a white count and xray revealed I had a colon full of gas, did they cancel the surgery. Finally 6 hours after taking the Imodium AD the gas began to pass and relief came.

5	IBS Triggered By Anxiety	Somewhat gassy, but not very problematic. May try the anti-gas form of the drug.	Amazingly effective at controlling irritable bowel syndrome triggered by anxiety, e.g. having to use the bathroom because of being in public. This drug works at controlling this terrible aspect of my anxiety/depression/OCD where Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac, Lexapro, Lorazepam, Xanax, and Valium have failed! I cannot recommend it highly enough.	M	22	1  months	4/24/2007
