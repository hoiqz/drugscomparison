3	lupus	I have had no bad side effects at all. i must say I'm baffled by all these people blaming their symptoms on it, especially when they have other medical issues.		F	54	4  years4mg	4/30/2012

3	Laparoscopic gallbladder removal	I had severe itching all over my face, I woke up literally every five minutes due to itching, but since I was drowsy and out of it from the anasthesia, it took me a while to realize that the dilaudid was causing the problems. Once they stopped it and gave me IV benadryl I felt much better.	The pain dulling effects were not particularly effective for me, perhaps because of the allergy, hydrocodone was much better for me.

1	Pain	Please please please don't ues this stuff. My best friend hung herself a week ago.  She was a happy happy person with 3 grandchildren that she adored.  They spent every other weekend together.  She was packing to move closer to them and her son in a few days.  The meds caused her to halicinate and become agitated.  While packing, she suddenly became frustrated and minutes later took her life.  She would never never have done that in her normal state.  What a waste of a wonderful person.....all because of this very dangerous drug. I would destroy every last bit of it if I could.		F	57	  1X D	6/22/2011Email
4	post surgery shoulder/chronic pain	After being on this medication for a short period of time it become ineffective. I also noticed you go through withdrawal symptoms really quickly, throwing up and headaches. It must be taken every 4 hours	Coming off of it now after almost a year needing it to help me with the chronic pain and two shoulder surgeries/ I am rather than pathches and eviler demons! So side effects of coming off ANXIETY, rapid heart beat, moody, itches, severe pain. However. I will and need to do this. I am using ativan for anxiety and the upset stomach. I am only on my second day off the medication and the "real" pain of my shoulder is so very real. I also am a	F	35	10  months4mg 8X D	5/21/2011Email
3	severe pain	I have to say it stopped my severe stomach pain immediately!	Had a bad reaction. it was given to me through an IV, and it immediately took the pain away, but then the  room was looking like when you blink your eyes really fast, but at the same time your not blinking fast. The nurse left the room so I couldn't ask her if that was normal reaction and I didn't have a call button so I waited for her to come back. I didn't get to ask her. I came to a few hours later and nurse was doing something next to my bed and she said, "ah your awake, you scared us, you turned blue and wouldn't wake up and something about having to almost being intubated" and I then put my hands to my face and yup I had the oxygen mask on and saw some kind of gadget on bed. I asked at some point if I was allergic and she said NO just sensative. That stuff will put an elephant down! I guess it made my blood pressure drop really really low. I surely don't want that drug again EVER! But I think kinda the nurse should have known I could have had a bad reaction, since I did tell her I had a bad reaction to morphine, and with that I was barely breathing!	F	52	1  days? IV 1X D	2/9/2011
4	Brain Hemorrhage (from Cavernoma)	Difficulty breathing, vomiting, urinary retention.	Was given dilaudid through my IV once it was found that my brain stem was bleeding and it took the head pain away immediately. However, I didn't realize until later that many of the effects I was feeling were due to the drug being administered to me. In the MRI, I had trouble breathing as my soft palate kept collapsing. I would go to the bathroom to urinate, but couldn't. I would vomit instead. Once the drug cleared my system, I stopped vomiting and was able to urinate again.	F	25	1  days 1X D	10/14/2010
5	pulminary embolism during pregnancy	very very very bad sweating for about 10 minutes after getting the shot.	this is what the hosp emergency started me on, i could not take anything else, ive never needed pain meds before, and i feel like if they started me on something less potant it would have worked, but bc i started on this it made my tolerance go very high, so in no time i had to take large amounts to get rid of pain. however it got me though eveything, but i did have trouble converting from pump and iv dosages to pills. and my body went through withdrawl, because to ween me off they tried morphone fenteyl patches and everything else so it was like i went cold turkey	F	25	7  months10mg 6X D	9/25/2010
1	hospitalized for diverticulitis	Immediate dizziness, tightness in chest, sensation of heat, extreme sweating, feeling of extreme intoxication, nausea, vomiting		F	53	1  days 1X AN	9/18/2010
5	Kidney Transplant and C-Section	Fatigue, seeing double, feeling calm	This drug was wonderful following my Kidney/Pancreas Transplant.  Controlled the pain perfectly.	F	30	1  weeks	11/23/2009Email
1	migraine in ER	uncomfortably high and dizzy, very short acting, migraine rebound is equal or worse than originally	way too strong in knocking you out of it (i am used to fiorinal3 or tylenol3), successfully covers pain quickly but completely not worth the experience because migraine comes right back	F	51	1  days	8/7/2009
4	kidney stones	I had taken this medication before and had little to no side effects, however was surprised to find that I woke up in the middle of the with a SEVERE migraine headache, which is ironic because I keep reading all these posts about how wonderful it is for treating migraines. I am a migraine sufferer and am curious to try dilaudid again for a migraine, because maybe the headache was kidney stone related?		F	22	1.5  days	8/1/2009
5	Damage of S1 nerve root (back)	constipation (I use Miralax and Colace with great success)	I was a prisoner to chronic pain. I have many medication allergies including Percocet and Morphine. I took Tylenol w/Codeine for 3 years. After my Physician convinced me to try Dilaudid I wouldn't go back to anything else. After stopping the Codeine I realized how much GI distress it caused along with headaches.  I have no side effects and my pain is manageable.  I am also an RN (that's how I injured my back)and was afraid because Dilaudid is a major narcotic, but it works for me without causing any drowsiness or sedation.  I am alert and can drive.	F	47	5  years	7/28/2009
4	Back pain / hand injury	constipation, head ache, depression,	After a crushing injury to my hand I was given morphine in the ambulance then I was transfered to a Care Flight helicopter (several bones were turned to powder and I was bleeding from an artery) and in the helicopter I was given Dilaudid.  Dilaudid did fantastic job of relieving pain.  after the hand injury I was perscribed it in a lowed dose for my back pain from an injury 10 years earlier.  I stopped taking Dilaudid because of the side effects specifically the depression with the head ache a close second.  I still use and prefer Dilaudid for break through pain with a pain level 5 or up.

4	Fall/Injury	Warm, flush sensation, nothing ill toward.		M	39	4  times	4/17/2009
3	post-op ortho surgery	Awful unrelenting nausea and vomiting, severe sedation	It was probably a combo of coming off general anesthesia and the dilaudid PCA, but I was so incredibly sick I almost wanted to die. It helped with my pain but also knocked me out and caused me to vomit for days	F	24	1  days	11/30/2008
5	severe back pain	trouble urinating, weak flow starting and stopping	whats the difference of regular vs hp?	M	52	 	11/28/2008Email
1	post bilateral mastectomy	Insane itching on my trunk then all over, from my scalp to my toes. The itch felt like it was on the inside of my body so nothing helped it. I had small waves of some type of numbness from my head down my face. That did not hurt, it was just a strange sensation. All this ended when they took me off of it.	I was on the pump. I woke up in recovery in severe pain. Further doses over the next few days didn't really seem to help the pain. I was switched to another drug after they realized I was having a bad reaction to the Dilaudid. For me, the newer drug worked much better.	F	49	3  days	11/4/2008
5	Groin pain, testicle pain	Other than the typical narcotic buzz, nothing. 	This is some great medication to kill pain. I got an IV shot in the ER and it stopped the pain dead in its tracks. I've had no side effects at all, have found this drug to be a godsend.	M	45	1  days	9/12/2008
5	back surgery recovery	i didnt have any side effects. i woke up in the recovery room in pain that i cannot describe after back surgery. (L4/L5 laminectomy) morphine, demerol... nothing took the pain away and tho i didnt realize it at the time, i thought i was moaning when i woke up. my husb said he could hear me outside the double doors!  i remember hearing the name DILAUDID and the nurse asking me if i was allergic or ever had it or wanted some. i said YES GOD give me whatever you have, i am about to die.   NEEDLESS to say, she put it in my IV and i woke up some time later in my room. i was tucked in my bed.... and out of pain.  when it wore off they began a regimen of 20MG oxiconting (time releaseed) every 12 hours: 2- 10 mg lortab every 4 hours: and 2 5mg oxycodone every other 4 hours when i wasnt taking the lortabs.  All i know is that was in March 2008 and it is now September and I am still in pain. even by taking soma, loritab and NSAIDS........ i wish i had my own dilaudid for the night time when i		F	37	1  times	9/3/2008

5	Severe GI tract Pain	withdraw effects after being off it.	This was given to me through an IV at the hospital for 5 days. It worked wonderfully.  Your body/brain does need to be opiate tolerant to handle narcotics though. This is a potent analgesic. The only bad thing, as with any narcotic, is the withdraw.  That cleared up in a few days though and consisted of mainly a "wanting or needing" the drug after I was home.	M	39	5  days	8/2/2008
5	Back Injury and Endometrisis	Short acting compared to other narcotics, headache	Did not make me sleepy or feel "drugged". In fact I went from grumpy and in tremendous pain, to feeling like my happy self. You would never know I was on medication. I felt "normal" the only problem was it was short acting and I did develope a bad headache that was relieved with 2 Excedrin.....however, I am no stranger to headaches/migraine. Unlike other narcotics, constipation wasn't an issue either......TMI?	F	40	5  days	7/16/2008
3	MCL strain and ACL tear	nausea, sweating, dizziness, hot flashes, light-headed	I went to the ER after I injured my knee (not knowing what had happened yet) and they gave me an injection. I got a little light-headed at first but nothing bad. After we left the hospital to get my crutches I started sweating profusely and dry-heaving. I couldn't talk well and we had to pull over multiple times because I thought I was going to throw up. I was very disoriented and it took a good 30-45 minutes for it to pass. It helped with the pain, but the side effects were too unbearable for me to think about taking it again.	F	26	1  times	5/29/2008
2	Post- surgery pain	I did not like the feeling of not being able to keep my eyes open while at the same time feeling wide awake.  I did not notice much pain reduction.		F	51	1  times	11/25/2007
1	PCA Post Surgical Knee Replacement	Difficulty breathing.  Two episodes of gasping for breath requiring the respiratory team to be called to the hospital room STAT.  Felt like throat was closing up completely.	It was hard for them to diagnose as a reaction to Dilaudid since I had been receiving the drug since surgery (5:00 PM on Monday).  On Tuesday morning I begin to have a hard time breathing (felt like I could not get a good breath).  During physical therapy (I had just used the PCA prior to Physical therapy coming to my room) I had a very hard time breathing.  Around 4:30 that evening I was experiencing surgical pain and used my PCA again, within 10 minutes I could not breath at all, gasping for breath.  They increased my oxygen and put a humidifier on the oxygen and gave me a shot of morphine.  The last episode occurred around 7:30.  I was again experiencing surgical pain and pressed the PCA on recommendation of my nurse.  Again, with 5-10 minutes I began to experience the same thing again.  I could feel it coming on this time.  I could not get a breath at all, it was like my throat had completed closed up.  They removed my PCA and gave me a breathing treatment. Eventually	F	63	2  days	11/23/2007
2	post-op	Helped with pain issue but side effects horrible.Delusional thoughts,halutionations,paranoia.		F	47	2  days	11/13/2007
2	post surgery	2 psychotic episodes, hallucinations, panic attack	worked for a few days, then the episodes happened.  Changed off to Vycodan, which was OK.	F	87	3  days	9/30/2007
3	Migraine	The medication worked fine, but I felt it was serious overkill.  Plus I learned later that I had medication overuse migraines.  The after effects of a narcotic when I don't take them for anything else were that my Medication Overuse Headaches got worse, became almost daily instead of bi-weekly.  Since this happened after the medication and not before, I can only assume it was partially the cause.		F	42	1  times	8/13/2007
4	migraine	Withdraw if not taken constantly.  Must always make doctors appointment on a timely basis so as to not be caught short.	This has been a life saver to give me a normal life again. I have been taking stadol for a longer time period but it was so expensive		47	6  months	7/24/2007
3	YES	AT FIRST I HAD A LITTLE NAUSEA BUT THEY LOWERED THE AMOUNT THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME IN MY PUMP. AFTER THAT I DIDN`T HAVE THAT SIDE EFFECT ANY MORE.	I KNOW THAT DILAUDID DOES HELP ME WITH MY SEVERE LOWER BACK AND RIGHT LEG PAIN. ESPECIALLY NOW THAT I JUST STARTED HAVING EXTREME PAIN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN AND COME TO FIND OUT THERE WAS A REASON. THE TUBING WAS RIPPED AND THE MEDICINE WAS OUTSIDE OF MY PUMP. SO NOW I KNOW FOR SURE THAT THIS DRUG DOES WORK FOR ME.	F	60	8  years	2/1/2007Email
4	severe sciatic/back pain-4 years	sleepiness......dry mouth...	I've been on the 4 mg tabs for a few days now...went into hospital COMPLETELY unable to walk and can now with cane and the help of this drug....it's not for everyone but it does help me....however will be going on ms contin soon also as my condition is deteriorating.  was on the 2 mg tabs for 2 weeks to start	F	36	3  weeks	10/7/2006Email
1	For some reason after a seizure	EXTREME itchiness, then another seizure	I'm sure it was just an allergic reaction I had to it, but I relapsed into another seizure...  it's not for me, that's for sure.	F	20	1  times	8/31/2006
1	After Surgery	It just sucks	Don't get this crap, it's horrible!	F	25	3  days	4/20/2006
4	Broken arm	Nausea for the first 4-5 days, blurred vision, extremely slow colon, after 10 days trouble sleeping, itching on and off for 10 days which may mean a bit of allergic reaction, not as effective for pain the longer I took it, mild to moderate sedation at first and your brain does not work like it should!!!	Get a prescription for an anti nausea medication just in case, do not drive, drink large amounts of water, eat more fiber, and if possible some form of exercise to help keep colon working or get a colonic.	F	44	17  days	2/19/2006
1	pain after surgery	terrible, disorientation, dry mouth, irrational thinking verging on hallucination. Feeling of emotional upheaval, for the most part it releaved the pain but metally it was like a trip to hell. This is  not like other narcatics which help pain and give you a slightly good feeling opposit of Demeral.	If you can not take percocet don't take this it is awfull!!!!	F	46	5  days	10/16/2005Email
5	Migraine	Some constipation. Disruption of sleep.	This med without question alows me to live a normal life dispite intractable migraine. I have been taking it for years and although I require 10-14mg IM doses, it still works. It relives pain with fewer side effects than any other by far. I am preparing to return to work for the first time in 8 years-on the medication. I have twin new baby girls-on the medication. I am thankful for it, and I am very careful with it.	M	46	5  days	8/13/2005
5	kidney stones	itchieness, stoned feeling	i received dilaudid intravenously in the ER. as soon as the injection got into my IV my neck muscles tightened then loosened and i was enveloped in a chemical haze. no pain	F	18	2  days	7/15/2005
5	Sciatica-Lumbago-Disc Degeneration	It works very well for breakthrough pain incidents which tended towards strong nerve pain -- all other things being equal...many people may require a metabolic adjustment in dosing this medication and several other factors seem to cause the relative strength of hydromophone to vary from patient to patient.	While it is a more comprehensive painkiller than even morphine with a more rapid onset, it had proven unreliable over my years of taking it intermittently until very recently when the doctor wrote instructions which allowed for rapid dose escalation to acheive the needed pain relief.	M	33	 	7/13/2005
5	extreme neuropathy whole body	hyper, constipation, sleepy, vomit for 4 hours every 5-6 days with the morphine I vomitted every other day for 4-5 hoursDilaudid in the pump gave me my life back!	a Intrethecal Infusion pump was put inside me in 2002 filled with morphine I developed morphine poisoning and dilaudid was put in the pump in 3/04.  it is wonderful! In 2000 I spent most days in bed and walked with 2 canes now I can play golf no canes	F	58	15  days	7/10/2005Email
5	ONLY GIVEN WHEN I HAVE MIGRAINES	THIRSTY AND SLIGHT SLEEPY.	THIS IS THE BEST MIRGRAINE MED EVER!!! SHOT OF THIS WITH PHENERGAN(FOR NAUSIA) AND YOUR MIRGRAINE IS GONE IN 10 MINTUTES. I WISH THE STUPID DOCTERS WOULD PRESCRIPE TO THOSE WHO REALLY NEED THIS FOR MIRGRAINES.	F	25	6  times	2/28/2005
4	broken wrist and arm	Only side effects for me have been fatigue and weird dreams.	I like the way I can still function around the house when I take it.	F	52	14  days	2/2/2005
3	bulging disks, bone spurs	dizziness, sleepiness,headache	seemed to work well for the first few days, then suddenly stopped working by about 50%.	F	32	2  weeks	1/29/2005
4		asdfasdf				 	1/17/2005
4	neuropathy, severe muscle pain, etc	barely any, mild lightheadness first few minutes when getting it, some drowsiness at times	I have a rare disorder that causes me severe chronic progressive muscle and nerve pain and also causes me migraines, abdominal, pelvic pain and some back and joint problems. I've tried all the pain meds out there it seems and oral pain meds seem to have way too many side effects on digestive disorders I have, the IV med so far has none at all. I just get slightly lightheaded at first and then it does run out about half an hour early and I get kinda drowsy and figity then. I dont have a pump yet, am going to look into that and hopefully that will help with those problems. Otherwise its a blessing.	F	25	2  weeks	11/25/2004
5	P.O. pain	None, mildly euphoric.	Worked great for P.O. pain after I had surgery on my hand for a boxing type knuckle fracture. If I need a script for a take home pain killer I'd rather have them give me a script for dilaudid instead of percocet.	M	23	1  months	11/5/2004Email
4	kidney stones	extreme feeling of being high, hallucinations, dizziness, dry mouth, slight constipation.	I have suffered with kidney stones for 14 years and have had 12 attacks. If anyone on earth knows pain.. it's me! I have had every kind of pain killer available and dilaudid seems to be the best choice for me.	F	31	2  days	9/21/2004
