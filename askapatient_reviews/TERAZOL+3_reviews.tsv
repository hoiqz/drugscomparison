3	Yeast	Vaginal pain	I had a stabbing vaginal pain and cramps.  My doctor thinks I may be allergic, but sometimes pain is a symptom of yeast, so who knows.  The first day I used it, I swear it was like a miracle drug.  After the second dose the pain started, so my doctor said no more.  The pain is starting to subside, so I think it was the Terazol 3.  It also gave me chills and a general feeling of malaise.  It got rid of the yeast though!	F	40	2  days	1/8/2010
5	To prevent yeast infection	None	My Dr. had me use this a follow up while treating cervicitis/BV with cleocin (I did 2 rounds of the treatment).  It can often cause yeast infections so this was used as a preventitive measure.  He also did not recommend any of the OTC type of monistat products and thinks they are highly ineffective in treating yeast infections. Go to your Dr., get a proper diagnosis and treat with prescription products.  Diflucan is also a very good drug for yeast infections.	F	33	6  days	2/5/2008
5	yeast infection	no side effects	Im not sure if it went away. But i had no burn, no itch! I think this stuff is great!!! I personally think it is way better than Monastat, which totally burns and itches.	F	28	3  days	9/14/2007
3	vaginal yeast infection	my vagina still itched the entire time I used this medicine, and still itches though I am on the last day of using it. I noticed the longer I went without using it, the more the itch would subside so maybe the medicine itself makes you itchy down there. I really hope the yeast infection goes away.
