4	CHF	None as far as I can tell.	I was put on digoxin and spironlactone (water pill) at the same time when I was diagnosed with CHF. Due to the water pill I peed 11 lbs of water the first 24 hours I was on it, and could finally sleep flat and not sitting up on 4 pillows. it was glorious to curl up in a little ball with no irregular heart beat and just sleep! one thing i learned is that it is imperative to drink enough water while on digoxin, as if you don't, it can turn into a poison and you can slip into a coma, especially if exercise is involved on say a hot day. so drink plenty of water plus other liquids. blood tests to check your digoxin blood levels are also imperative, it must be at a certain level to work effectively. My blood levels have just gotten too low and I have been having heart problems again.	F	56	3  years	8/29/2008

5	chf; arrythmia; svt ; cardiomyopath	none	its made a big differene in the symptoms i used to notice as well as keeping my heart beating at a healthy pace (not too fast for me). sometimes an extra dose (dr tells me to take via phone consult)keeps me out of the ER- which we all hate! :)	F	36	6  months	9/13/2005Email
2	Heart problems	Mom was given Lanoxin, within 4 days she had stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea, was anxious/nervous and was mental slow. It took 2 weeks of contacting the doctor and a week in the hospital to convince the doctors that her problem was caused by the pill - not age. Within 2 days of stopping the pill, she started to feel better.	The doctors said it created a toxic gas in her stomach causing the nausea and not eating feeling. At first the doctors said she was just not wanting to eat but..   Note:  Please ensure you take care of your elderly family members and listen to their comments. Get to know what medications they are on, what is changed and why and help them find a solution to their health problems.	F	91	4  weeks	4/5/2005
