5	Dr. recommended	Welchol has made me normal again, able to live without looking for the nearest bathroom. No side affects as of yet. Just more energy and no longer losing weight.	I love Welchol. I went from a size 20 to a size 12 in like a 4 month span from constant diarrhea. My regular dr. couldn't find anything to account for it and sent me to a specialist. I suffer no side effects that others have experienced, thankfully. My energy is back and the headaches and shakes I was having due to diarrhea are gone.	F	54	18  days625 mg 6X D	5/31/2013Email
2	High cholesterol	Stomach cramps. Ringing ears. Flu symptoms. Bleeding gums. Constipation.		M	70	9  months3200 mg	5/11/2013
1	High LDL	CONSTIPATION, bloating, nasua	46 yr old petite female. Family history of heart disease. Total cholestorol of 255 LDL 156 HDL 80 Triglycerides 94. Not bad but doc concerned about LDL. Tried statin last yr. Horrible joint pain. Changed diet to exclude almost all dairy (my beloved icecream!) and changed workouts. HDL went up, Tri's went down, LDL still high. Thought we'd try this little pack of powder once a day. Did not read the side effects as like most, I tend to think I "might" be having an effect? Five days in and OH MY! Thought I had a touch of the stomach flu going around but everyone with the "bug" was rushing to the potty. NOT ME! Stomach upset, bloating, nasua, and miserable. Up until last week, you could set the worlds clock on my daily BM's. Constipation is beyond anything I've ever experienced! I've always felt bad for family and friends that have dealt with this but I now know first hand how horrible this is! Three days after last drinking a packette of WELCHOL I am still not "normal"! Stool so hard it might as well be concrete! It's the little things in life we take for granted. Tried prune juice with butter, no luck. Hoping this will "pass" soon and I get back to living a normal life. I'm ok with living with high LDL. If I pass because of heart disease so be it. I will pass happy and enjoying life! Not sucking down one drug to do one thing and taking four more to counteract the one! Not to mention, I've had to skip my workouts because I'm so bound up! I	F	46	5  days3.75g 1X D	4/11/2013Email
5	Bile Salts diarrhea	Sometimes I feel bloated and have muscle aches.	I had my gall bladder removed in 2011.  I take one of these as needed when stomach is acting up. It has really helped.  I spent half of my time staying close to a restroom.  Not anymore!!	F	54	2  years625mg 1X AN	3/23/2013Email
5	chrone's disease	headaches once a week. muscle weakness\soreness. impotence	This drug was prescribed for regeular diarreah and 15+ trips to the bathroom a day. My life was ruled by locations of the closest facilities. Im very active and my work is very physically demanding which led me to discover this muscle weakness and need for extra sleep daily once on welchol. An issue with my mojo was also directly noticed! Other than an occasinal C.D. bout this drug has changed my life to fewer than 5 restroom breaks a day! WHEW! I can now live a mostly normal life which I lost to C.D. 20 yrs ago!

3	High Cholesterol - genetic	constipation, indigestion, constantly stopping up toilet!	I took only half the dose given to me because I am very prone to side effects.  It did lower the numbers even with half the dose, but not enough.  I can't imagine if I had taken the full dose of 6 pills.	F	51	3  months3 pills 1X D	7/23/2011
2	chronic diahrrea	Awful bloating, gassy, generally quite uncomfortable.	This stuff does control my diahrrea so that I can now leave the house and live a more normal life, but I feel as if I've been stuffed all the time an can eat only a few mouthfuls before I feel terrible.  I hate feeling like this!	F	68	3  months625mg 1X D	12/30/2010Email
1	high cholesterol	muscle ache, joint stiffness, stiff neck, headaches, dry cough.	It took a month for all the side effects to manifest....not a day goes by without the stiffness, and I have been awakened in the middle of the night by an extremely stiff neck and headaches.	M	57	45  days	1/25/2010
2	High Cholesterol	Constipation, gas, bloating	I read the normal dose was six 625mg pills a day. My dr put me on two twice a day. I was taking it because of high cholesterol/LDL and I am a 15 year CABG survivor and cannot tolerate statins. I am normally very regular, but this stuff made me plug up like concrete. I felt bloated and had bad gass, and when I did go I bled like a stuck pig. After two episodes of that I gave the drug up and regularity returned in a few days. Also no more rectal bleeding. I'm trying to control my numbers now with diet and Niaspan.	M	60	2  weeks	11/24/2009Email
4	High Cholesterol	Right in the very beginning I had constipation but that stopped. Now I have none.	My numbers have decreased but not my triglycerides. I will continue to use and see if that improves.	F	52	3  months	4/8/2009
5	high cholesterol	Moderate gas and constipation...much worse at high altitude.	It works.  My cholesterol and LDLs have dropped to very low levels and I can eat pretty much what I want but still watch my diet.	M	63	3  years	3/13/2009
2	High Cholestrol	I had no side effects while on Welchol.	It didn't lower my cholestrol at all. The LDL totals went up big time (bad) along with HDL (good). I watch my fat and sugar intake. If this drug had worked I would have stayed on it. I didn't even mind the 6 horse size pills a day. I can't tolerate statins. They make my brain numb and my muscles weak. I felt very good on Welchol, but that's because it wasn't doing anything.	F	54	6  months	3/11/2009Email
5	IBS & Post Gall bladder surgery	A slight tendency toward constipation, but considering the prevalence of diarrhea previously, I can live with it. After decades of suffering, I count this a miracle drug.		M		2  years	2/13/2009
1	High cholesterol	Constipation, gas, ringing in ears	I was glad to see someone else above complained about ringing in the ears as a side effect of Welchol, because that's what I experienced. Besides the constipation and bloating that are a noted side effect, about 10 days after starting Welchol I started to get the ringing in my ears -- at random, multiple times a day.  I finally stopped the Welchol due to the constant constipation and gas problems (just not worth the discomfort), and lo and behold the ringing in my ears stopped about a week later. Haven't had any ringing since (and never had any before), so I'm sure it was the Welchol. Just like statins, too many side effects. Would not recommend.	M	52	4  months	9/14/2008
5	Gallbladder Removed	None.	Gallbladder was not functioning properly; thus, it was removed.  It continuously leaked into my intestines causing irritation.  I used Welchol to bind excess bile and flush it out my system.   I used it for about 8 months after the removal of the gallbladder.  It worked great for me.	M	35	8  months	7/18/2008
2	high total cholesterol and high LDL	constipation, gas and general GI discomfort; sore throat; and ringing in ears which started about one week after starting Welchol and continued until I stopped.	Had tried statins several years ago but had way too many serious side effects.  My cardiologist recently convinced me to try Welchol for three months, but the GI distress plus the new ringing in my ears (which I never ever had before) forced me to stop after the three months.  Did reduce my LDL, but only slightly.  Not worth the side effects.	M	60	3  months	6/22/2008
5	IBS-D	none	Stopped my IBS-D and the pain and cramps on day one. Only had three attacks in 6 months.  I can travel again and eat things I never have been able to in years. This has changed my enjoyment of life, have suffered 30 years with this until Welchol.	M	55	9  months	5/20/2008
5	BILE SALT DIAHHREA - NO GALLBLADDER	NONE	I had my gallbladder out in 98.  They put me on Questran.  That was horrible - terrible constipation!  Then they put me on Welchol - still binds the excess bile in the digestive tract but no side effects.  Best of all no bile salt D and I can eat all the fat I want.  3 tablets after breakfast and dinner.  They are BIG pills, but I don't care.  Gave me my life back.  I can however see how someone with a gallbladder could wind up with too little bile in their system from these pills and wind up with terrible side effects / that however was not my situation.  I had too much bile to start with.	F	42	5  years	2/9/2008Email
1	high cholesterol	Took it for over 3 years but the last 8 months I was having continued bowel problems.  Constipation and such and then my colon started hurting and was full of discomfort just before I relieved myself.  I've stopped it now and feel much better		M	58	 	2/6/2008
5	biliary problems	weight gain, stiff neck, weird dreams, legs hurt		F	46	 	10/20/2007
1	High lipids	Gastritis, abdominal pain, nausea	Stopped taking it when I got Ischemic colitis	M	64	 	8/6/2007
2	High lipids	Extreme gas, loose stools, abdominal pain.	During treatment I ended up with ischemic colitis and was hospitalized.  Do not know if it caused it.  Once stopped, however, my colon settled down and is now OK.	M	63	90  days	6/21/2006
3	High Cholesterol	None that I am aware of.	Took in conjunction with Niaspan and Lipitor.  Niaspan and Welchol alone did not seem to reduce cholesterol significantly -only when Lipitor was added was significant reduction seen.  So I don't know to what extent Welchol is helping.	M	44	5  years	5/11/2006
5	Stomach Troubles	Ocasional muscle and joint aches.	My gall bladder was removed 3 years ago, and 2 years ago i developed many problems because of it, I could no long er eat meat, because anything with fats in it would upset my stomach.  Now, it's like everytihng is back to normal, I feel normal again.  this is my miracle drug!	F	21	3  weeks	7/20/2005Email
1	for high cholesterol	sick after every meal to much bile and constipation and also muscle weakness		M	76	2  weeks	3/27/2005Email
4	high cholesterol	I don't notice any major side effects other than an upset stomach once in a while.	I have only been taking it for one month but it seems fine for my body. No pains or complaints yet.	F	22	1  months	1/5/2005Email
