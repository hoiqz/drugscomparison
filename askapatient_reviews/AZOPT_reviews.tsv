1	Glaucoma	Bad tastte in mouth. Blurry vision. Chest pain, heavyness. Congestion. Headache. Dizzyness. Nausea. Cough. Tiredness due to not being able to sleep well. Backache. Pain in kidneys.	I have had problems with all the eye drops that have been prescribed to me. I recently stopped taking my drops for a week because I had a bad cold and I couldn't breath. When I started to get better I was reluctant to start taking them again because I started to feel well for a change. However have been taking them for a week now and realise how ill they make me. I work full time and have a 2 hour commute from home to work each way. I drive and suffer with dizzyness on the road. I feel sick and depressed as well as everything else. I am going to stop taking them as they badly effect the quality of my life. My glaucoma is getting worse anyway.	F	50	6  days1 drop 2X D	10/12/2012Email

1	Glaucoma	Foul taste in my mouth.  Blurry vision, at first only after taking the drops but later throughout the day.	The drug had very little effect on my ocular pressures.  I used it simultaneously with xalatan.  Alone, the xalatan reduced the pressure to 17/18 mm.  With the azopt it was down to 15/16, not much of an improvement.  I quit taking it.

1	Glaucoma	Insidiously increasing dyspepsia. Started out with mild "acid" feeling in stomach after eating. Eventually became frequently recurring severe heartburn to the point where I was scheduled for an endscopic exam.	Neither opthamologist nor gastroenterologist knew about this side effect. Chance question by eye doctor's assistant led to discovery. Quit the drug and all symptoms were gone within 3 weeks.	M	65	6  months	5/6/2007
4	Glaucoma	Blurry vision for about 30 minutes after application.  I think this is due to the fact that Azopt is the viscosity of 90 weight gear lube.	I've tried all the glaucoma drops over the last two years.  Each one seemed to affect me in a negative way.  From lower back pain to complete lay-in-bed-because-you're-too-dizzy-to-stand.  The tear ducts provide an excellent path for eye drops to enter your body.  It's just like an IV.  Azopt lowered my IO pressure from 17 to 11 and it's a tolerable drug for me. No stinging like most of the others, too.	M	59	6  days	3/3/2006
