3	HPV anal warts	I had two patches on either side of my anus with random small ones surrounding. Was prescribed Condylox, I am on day 3 and have only noticed slight pain when first applied...I am trying not to get too discouraged. I have only noticed a slight change in the color of the warts. Hoping to see more improvement.		F	25	3  days	2/3/2013

3	Genital warts on anus	Tried a Few things, DR suggested condylox. I had a few warts and two dime sized clusters on inner part of anus cheeks. I used gel 2x per day for three days. Tried to keep it off normal skin but difficult w location. I LITERALLY burned the first two layers of skin off a large area and have been couch/bed ridden for three days waiting to heal. Can't walk, sit, drive, etc. if this happens to u don't panic. Get A and D ointment and Bactine cleansing spray w lidocaine (no sting kind). Take warm soapy bath three times a day to keep clean, use Bactine 3x per day and A and D as often as u want. Bear down and pray. I have had some pretty serious surgeries in the past ( over 85 stitches in my back). That was a cake walk compared to this. Looked like a horror movie down there. Blood splitting cracking etc. after 3rd day of rest I am able to move. All treatment I recommend did come from my DR not my ideas so they are safe. But, warts are gone!  USE sparingly and as carefully as possible.		M	30	3  daysGel 2X D	1/10/2013Email
4	HPV	Very minor soreness, no pain whatsoever.	I've been struggling with this condition for a few years now.  I've had multiple visits to the dermatologist for freezing (which has had limited results), and was prescribed Aldara which did absolutely nothing for me.  Condylox has so far been the most successful treatment.  I'm on week 3 now and my smaller warts have shrunk in half.  I have a cluster about the size of a penny on my waist line (which had previously been misdiagnosed by my doctor), and it's receding each week.  I don't feel I'll be completely rid of them by the end of 4 weeks so I may have to switch back to regular cryo/freezing visits to finish them off.  I've seen others' experiences stating that they were in a lot of pain but the treatment seemed to work very quickly for them.  I have absolutely no pain but my progress seems to be slower.  Maybe there's a correlation there.  Ultimately this treatment works for me but as I've learned, the preferred treatment varies from person to person, so don't be discouraged if your mileage varies.

3	Anogenital warts	Holy hell! About to take my 5th dose (6 doses required each three-day round of treatment). This is my first experience with anal warts. I am laying in bed as I type this cringing from the burning, stinging pain around my rectum. The whole area is red and raw and wiping after a bowel movement makes me want to cry. And passing gas. Never thought THAT could hurt. Anyways, Because of the position of the warts around my anus, its difficult to see well enough to apply only to the warts, so a few times I have just taken a small amount and smeared it over the entire affected area. The only improvement I see so far is that some of the warts are getting a black spot so I hope that means they are necrotizing. I am going to look up home remedies for the relief of burned skin because the pain is constant and bothersome.		F	31	2  days0.5%	8/18/2012
5	bumps in genital region.	Gw is super common, rarely has any serious ill effects,and is mostly embarrassing, so cheer up!  We can make it through this.I have like 10 bumps.  The doctor froze 4 (worked wonderfully, they fell off in 3 days with no pain)So, i have just completed the first 3 days of using.  day 1:  no feeling, didn't know if i put enough onday 2:  mild burning after applying,day 3:  area around bumps is red and they are tenderday 4:  no condylox today.  Holy shit this stuff makes you sore.  I know that i put a little too much on last night.  It is very difficult to get that hard gel applied to a tiny bump.  It is definitely working.  Skin is red, but bumps are white and soft like they were left in the bathtub too long.It does seem to be working	This stuff works very well, just be ULTRA CAREFUL to only apply to the wart or bump.Make sure you let it dry for a while before putting clothing on or doing anything that could spread this stuff around.

4	Genital warts	Mostly burns once it is rinsed off after 4 hours. Wasn't to bad til my skin blistered. But well worth the pain!	I had done 5 treatments at the doctor and the warts were slowly going away. We decided to try condylox and I'm shocked. After the first cycle (3 days on, 4 days off) my warts that I thought were impossible to get rid of are gone. Though I had gotten a huge blister around the cluster which is now almost gone as well. I'm on cycle number 2, only see one small wart so I'm treating it.	F	22	  2X D	7/7/2012Email
2	Genital warts	Had no side effects if applied correctly	Forget Condylox.  I tried it several times and my warts never fully went away and they always returned quickly.  I went to a dermatologist. First he froze the warts then applied a substance similar to Condylox which I was told to wash off in 6 hours.  After 3 treatments 2 weeks apart my warts were gone completely and never returned.

3	HPV Anal Warts	3 on, 4off, 3 on was the schedule for a max of 4 weeks. Have warts and hemorrhoids. I had my husband put the medicine on ONLY the warts very carefully. I missed 2 doses so I extended treatment to 4th day. On my first day of being off (5th day) I'm experiencing the worst pain. Some of the condylox got on good skin when my cheeks pressed together and ate surface away! Ouch! Haven't been able to have BM's very easily due to pain. Can't wait to see Dr in 2 days for check-up! Its VERY painful and hard to clean.The majority of the warts are gone, but Im not sure its worth the pain.By the way, is this the least painful at-home treatment?!		M	22	4  days.5%	2/4/2012Email
4	Genital Wart	No side effects!	My wart completely fell off within the first application cycle!  I began using Condylox on Friday morning and I applied the medicine as directed  twice a day, three times a day.  I woke up Wednesday morning and I noticed the skin around the wart tore.  I left it as is and that same evening, around 7 p.m. used the bathroom and noticed the wart was complete gone.  What a relief!  Now I have to focus on getting rid of the HPV, if I still have it.Despite the side effects of the medicine, I didnt feel a thing.  I did notice the skin get darker and darker as Wednesday approached.  Its like watching paint dry.  Nevertheless, no itching, burning, headaches, none of that stuff.  Some people may experience side effects, others dont.  If you dont feel anything going on down there, that doesnt mean the medicine is not working.  Best wishes to all of you.

4	HPV- GENITAL WARTS	I have a large patch in my rectal area, that I just found out about. I'm on day two of treatment, mine is a large cluster of small warts so very hard to apply just to the affected area. The first time I applied I stood up quickly and it burned so bad I almost fell over, but after reading these reviews I used some of the tips. Ladies (or men) the hair dryer really helps. I haven't seen any improvements with the warts yet, but the pain has started going away somewhat. But I've also read the pain doesn't really start until the first rest day. So we will see. i can say reading these has helped me feel a lot better about the situation.		F	22	2  days	1/3/2012

4	HPV	burning/itching	If you are not a male with a high pain tolerance I do not recommend this method of "treatment". After applying condylox for the last day i experienced scabs and pain. For the whole duration of application I applied the gel all over the base of my penis where the legions existed. The first and second day I experienced Immense pain. I headed to wallgreens and stocked up my operation cabinet and mentally prepared for immense pain (no painkillers whatsoever). I had picked the remaining scabs off the second day off the gel. I then poured rubbing alcohol (70%) all over the raw skin. CAUTION: THIS WILL BURN AND YOU WILL USE EXPLITIVES. the rubbing alcohol is to prevent any infection. I also used surgical gloves when dealing with the genitalia. It's not worth spreading the infection and doctors wear them when examining you for the disease so why not. After the rubbing alcohol i sprayed on neosporin with pain relief. After letting the neosporin dry somewhat I caked on vaseline. This keeps the neosporin in tact with the skin. Next i wrapped my whole penis in gaws (not the tip of the penis). So far this has made everyday movement possible. ONLY APPLY THE CONDYLOX GEL TO YOUR WARTS PRECISELY!!!! CONDYLOX IS AN ACID! The goal of condylox is to rott of the wart so if it comes in tact with healthy skin it will rott it away. Alcohol will be painful but it will keep your tender areas protected from infection. By the way i was wearing a condom. Email me for more or just to talk.	M	18	3  days.5 2X D	10/5/2011Email
3	Genital Warts	Swelling, burning (especially when wiping), slight bleeding	I had about 6-7 one lg one one medium and the rest small...  I do not understand how ppl keep saying to not get this gel on healthy skin...  with extremely small warts it is impossible not to!  However the results seem to be worth the pain.  None are gone, I wish they were but the ones that can be felt are noticably smaller.  How are women seeing them?  I don't understand lol I wish I can see down there to see what the heck is going on ne us girls are going in blind which also leads to this medicine going on to healthy areas of skin :/ ..  One thing I can suggest is not to use too much and dry with a hair dryer before and after application.  This is my third day on my first cycle so hopefully I see more results soon	F	24	3  days.5% 2X D	9/18/2011
4	Genital Warts	Pain,Swelling, Ordor	This shit burns like crazy but if you want to get better you will suck it up and just deal with it. The 1st day applying the gel it was not that bad. But then the 2nd and 3rd day OMG burning and a nasty smell, its hard to walk, get out of bed, sit, wip anything. So I'm on my first day of rest and I'm sprying Neosporin with pain all over and apply warm rags it makes it feel so much better. But I'm going to the doc Saturday just to get a week check up because the smell is REALLY bad. Make sure you put the gel on the warts only and have a fan to blow on it to help it dry, make sure you let it air out. It is very nasty but its working =) ready for it to be over 1st and last STD	F	21	4  weeks 2X D	8/18/2011
4	gw	I was just reading the instructions again, now i understand what they meant by "erosion". this stuff BURNS whatever you put it on. hence any bleeding (fold of skin touching the applied areas), and the redness, and the swelling, and the painful days of work walking around. Only using it for 3 days and noticeable discoloration of warts to slight black.	3 days in and its going good. Ive had em for about 3 yrs, thought they'd go away on their own. Fed up, I turned to the real deal. I have about 30 warts on the shaft and base of my penis ranging from tiny to pea sized. After 3 days its getting slimy on some warts, and some turn black and start to shed... Good advice about the neosporin Ill try it.... overall if you need it, use it carefully and let it dry! Hopefully they all leave for good but honestly I dont think they ever really will... But who knows, maybe ill eat those words.	M	25	3  days7mg 2X D	6/18/2011
5	genital warts	Severe burning, a bit uncomfortable	Just found out last Tuesday I have warts. Used the 3 days 2x a day and I'm on my second day of rest. I had 6 warts on my vagina and only one that was larger is left.  The pain isn't too bad, but definitely worth it. Try aloe. It soothed the burn and heals the sores from the area where the wart was. Highly recommend it!!	F	22	3  days 2X D	5/14/2011
3	GW	a little redness, didnt feel any burning that everyone else seems to have felt	i went through 2 of these bottles and the warts pretty much went away however i had more and more reappear after i stopped apply...i would start my cycles again and they would disappear, again i stopped and more would appear, guess it didnt work for me	M	24	3  months.5 2X D	5/9/2011
4	genital warts	slight burning, skin irritation, tiny open sores	Like everyone says: make sure you apply only to the warts and not to the healthy skin.  I accidentally bumped my healthy skin with the Q-tip around my anus and the next day I noticed it ate away at my skin and left a red open sore.  I also assumed the more cream I applied to a wart the better the condylox would work, but all it did was cause the excess cream to spread onto my skin and cause irritation.  You really only need a small amount.  I had many warts surrounding my anus, some of them were very large so I was skeptical that this would work for me.  I just finished my third day yesterday and they are already gone!  I was so excited because it's frustrating and embarrassing to have genital warts.  Now I'm experiencing some slight burning (nothing unbearable just a bit uncomfortable) and there are some open sores where the warts once were which I expect will turn to scabs during this 4 day period of rest.  I've been using Vaseline (as my doctor instructed) to help with the soreness and it really provides some comfort.  I would definitely recommend conylox; it's used in the privacy of your own home, they experience is less painful then having them treated at the doctor, and most important it works!  I finally feel like there is hope for this embarrassing STD!  	F	29	3  days 2X D	3/27/2011
5	Genital Warts	Burning, itching, minicule bleeding	I hate to comment on such a thing, but I guess it's best if it helps others.  I had a cluster a little bigger than a dime on one side of my penis and a smaller one on the other.  I was so afraid to go to the doctor when I first saw small bumps there that I tried to ignore it for around a year and a half.  I abstained from sex which was hell, but I didn't want anyone to have to go through it.  When I finally broke down and told a doctor he sent me to a urologist where I was burned repeatedly once every six weeks three times with severely strong wart remover before I asked due to the pain if there was anything else.  He prescribed condylox and I used it as prescribed.  It did burn and there was white flaking, but I was applying it myself so no more embarrassment of laying on a doctors bed while he painted my privates with acid.  When I finally went back for the last time he checked with the solution that makes them visible and they were all gone, finally.  About a week and a half later I noticed a small growth which I quickly applied the gel to as instructed, and it went away as well.  It has been two years since that happened and I have not seen any warts reappear at all.  I still have a small amount of the gel left as well in case something does happen.  I still don't know if I'll ever be comfortable telling a woman that I have genital warts so I have to always use a condom, but for peace of mind they are gone.  I do reccomend trying this because it beats the alternative.	M	27	4  weeks0.5% 2X D	3/26/2011Email
1	genital warts	Really horrible stuff, worked great for first two days most warts were gone however come third day my foreskin on the inside was so swollen i couldnt pull it back i finally did with the most excrutiating pain ive ever felt and the sight was horrible it looked like a flesh eating bacteria had gotten ahold of my penis there was severe puss, lesions, skin falling off, discoloration, and blood pouring out like it was a freaking horror film and i mean worst pain ever. its the fourth day and only getting worse if i cant get an immediate doctor appt then im going to have to go to the emergency this stuff is seriously an acid of some sort	DONT DO IT!!!

5	Genital warts	This stuff is fantastic. Don't let all the negative comments on here deter you. Used properly it's practically painless.	I had three small warts on the shaft of my penis. Used Condy 2XD for three days. Very carefully applied to get it only on the warts. No pain at all!! Two dried up and fell off on the fourth and fifth days during the rest period. The third wart required a second week of application. It fell off during the second week rest period. Excellant results!! Relief !!! Highly recommend! Just be careful to apply to the wart ONLY !!!!

5	gential warts	Itching, Burning	Once i put it on i had doubts because i didnt feel anything. The first day i didnt feel anything but the warts turned white. Second day they started to fall off one by one. Third day was the worst day because the medicine was getting the end of the wart.I am now on my resting period and i feel so much better all i have now is itching. I had alot of warts all over my vagina so the medicine spread even on healthy skin. Make sure u try to not get it on healthy skin thats the part that makes  this experince the worst.But now i really just feel itching so i highly recomend this medicine its so worth it in the end. I was starting to give up on curing these warts till this medicine nuthing else seemed to help. This medicine helps i now only have 1 left and i feel like a whole new person.

4	genital warts	burning, sores, no bleeding...yet, scabs, pain	seems to work very, very, well. it ate up the warts on day 3...problem is now i have these large scabs. i used a q tip to apply, but im guessing i might have got some on healthy skin cause it ate up my skin too. i would recommend it to anybody having warts. it was hard to follow directions because the majority of the infected are was around my pubic hair above the penis. didnt want to shave either for fear of cutting a wart although i imagine it would have made a hell of a difference in applying only to warts only. i am debating using neo or some other over the counter cream to help the scabs heal faster but i dont want to irritate it. will it help? thanks and dont fear people with warts! they will go away with this drug. JUST BE CAREFUL when applying and follow the advice of others here and keep your head up. the worst part of this is the absence of sex lol!	M	25	3  daysdrop 2X D	12/13/2010

4	few small genital warts	Burning, redness, slight bleeding, pain.	My doctor told me on monday "yeah there looks like there are a few small warts there" and thats it. nothing else. I started Condylox on monday first two applications were fine. I couldnt really see my warts, just put it in the area i felt a few lumps. Big mistake - listen when they say only to the affected area. I couldnt tell how much i needed or where to put it so i put it on the small area i had the lumps. Day two and Day three there was pain when applying. just deep breaths and you will get through. The night after i had put on my last application was the worst, kept waking up. It was my first rest day today and it is sore, skins white and bleeding, but it looks like its eaten through all the skin, so at least the affected area has been eaten away. Im dying for it to heal though, and using paraderm an first aid cream to help the healing process. Fingers crossed its a quick heal.  Good luck all.	F	22	3  days 2X D	12/2/2010
4	genital warts	Be careful about not getting it on normal skin. The first week i put on the infected area and did not notice any results. On my 4 days off the warts shinked and scaped up and came off in the shower.  the problem is that i have burning on the normal skin around my penis.	dont use near normal skin	M	27	14  days 2X D	8/28/2010
5	Genital warts	Mild discomfort, little bit of odor	Omg, when the doctors first told me the warts were not going to be burned off I started panicking. So he gave me condylox in a little bottle and all I could think of was... Acid down there. Awesome. But after week one of treatment and rest I've never been happier. The warts aren't all gone, but all of them have begun to dry up and will be gone by the end of week 2. There's only slight pain where the warts used to be because they leave some pretty nasty wounds when they fall, but neosporin is definitely helping. Like so many people have said READ the box. If you apply the cream only to the warts and are really careful not to touch healthy skin, you don't even feel the acid doing it's thing. My warts were external, with a massive cluster between my anus and vagina. Safe to say those were the first to clear. Definitely a recomended product, again just be careful. It's your body you are dealing with at the end of the day.	F	21	4  days3.5ml 2X D	7/22/2010
4	Genital warts:(	GENITAL WARTS	OMG i am so upset that i caught genital warts. i was usually careful to have protected sex. but just when i don't use a rubber i catch this. i'm only 18!!!!!! I noticed little bumps down there, they were tiny kinda like a rash. i thought it was my eczema so i didn't pay it no mind. but then it started irritating me down there. so i went to the teen clinic because i don't have a family doctor yet. and she tells me i have genital warts. my spirit crashed. I wanted to break down. I have just finished puthing it on for 3 days. today is the fourth day(break day). I don't get any sleep at all. last night i didn't get to sleep until 4:30 but i had to get up for school at 5:30. It is very irritating to have this STD. I hate the person that gave it to me. but most of all i hate myself the most. I pray everyday to god that he will cure my body. I'm a strong person, but right now i've been going through alot of stuff, and for this STD to pop up its too much. I promise if these warts go away i will try my hardest not to have sex until marriage. I just want these warts to go away. they irritate me, its hard to walk sometimes because its painful sometime. i can't sleep at all. i'm so sad and wants to cry sooooo bad. but i don't want to let myself down and cry. I just really hope this medicine works and will cure me. please work. plllllllease work.	F	18	3  weeks.5 2X D	5/17/2010
3	Hpv	Burning, itching, rotting flesh smell	I was diagnosed with HPV a few months ago, found out when I noticed some fleshy like mounds poping up in places they shouldnt be. Went to one doctor tried Aldara, that was horrible and unbearable that medicine affected EVERYTHING!!! Condylox on the other hand, does burn the effected area but doesnt get everywhere if you apply it with caution. By the end of day two, I noticed a difference in my warts. They were turning white and comming off, which was scary at first like a zombie film. But over all I see results in this product, as long as you dont smoke. That was my mistake in the healing process, I still had some bad habits, that was slowing down the healing process.	F	24	3  days 2X D	5/11/2010
4	hpv, warts	hardcore burning, odor, rotting flesh, redness, soreness, can't walk	I have just made it through my first cycle and didn't feel any kind of itching or burning until my first day of rest. I had been advised by my doctor to ONLY apply it to the warts. Well i wanted them gone quickly so i applied it everywhere. Dumb ass mistake for any of you reading this before application. All you need is a little dot of it on the wart itself, otherwise it will eat through healthy skin and burn like a mother. BE CAREFUL. I am now on my second run through and it still burns but after experiencing this am definately taking it with a grain of salt.	M	20	3  days 2X D	4/29/2010
3	anal warts	burning, burning, burning, bleeding, skin turned white	I noticed I had two small bumps around my anus. I am a male. I went to the doctor and had the awkward conversation which resulted with me lying on my side wearing a hospital gown. She... yes she... told me it was most likely anal warts from HPV. I already assumed that so no real surprise there. She prescribed me Condylox Gel 0.5. I was ecstatic because my warts would be gone in up to 3 days. I finally was able to relax until day 3 of applying the cream. My warts were gone. Cool! But now my anus was dusted white and chapped and bleeding. The pain was pretty unbearable so I was glad to be starting the rest phase, assuming the pain could only subside from that point on. PLUS MY WARTS WERE GONE! Day one rest was OK but definitely not better. Then rest day 2 came and it seemed worse. The white started to fade and the warts were most definitely gone... still blood still pain. Day 3 of rest (today) and I was SUUURE the pain would be less. Nope. The front most anal fold (the one closet to my balls) is so inflamed and red and irritated it is hard to sit down and I wince sometimes just moving around--not to mention going to the bathroom. The thought of wiping makes me want to cry, I just dab and dab and use wet toilet paper and pray I don't brush it wrong. Oh, and I've been so afraid of fecal bacteria-- I've been applying copious amounts of Bacetracin to keep it clean. I hope tomorrow is better. I hope the pain and swelling go away soon.

2	Genital Wart	Burning, discoloration, and burning flesh smell.	Due to the region of my warts, having them surgically removed is not an option.  Therefore, the only means of their removal is through Condylox, which I absolutely HATE!  I've had to use it so much, that I learned all of the tricks.  You have to be really careful that you apply it only to the warts; if you get it on normal skin, it will literally erode your skin.  Also, you really have to let the gel dry on the warts, for about 5 minutes, before you move around or put underwear on.  If you don't, the gel will transfer onto healthy skin, and cause serious pain.  Also, put Vaseline on the area after it has completely dried to avoid irritation.  Using Condylox is painful, even if you apply it carefully to the affected area; stay away from thongs!  Personally, I feel the worst side affect is the smell from the dying flesh, so gross!

4	HPV totally embarrassing anal warts	Minor blistering.	Here we go. You are on this site because you have Genital Warts!? Oh no. Back up how did you get them? Most of us think we are invincible to stds. I know I did. And worse, I got it from my BF. In July of last year (8 months ago) I noticed little bumps down there. Ignored them. Never ONCE considered them to be an STD. Over time they got slightly itchy,would bleed every now and then. In early January I sucked it up, put my dignity aside and went to the Dr. Left crying, cried for days and started to resent my BF. Which I learned did nothing. Leaving him would only lead me to coping with a break up while dealing with this! I had a few in office treatments done (TCA) effective. Although very expensive. I was prescribed Condylox in a liquid form, paid a lot for it, $100, used it for 3 days/2x a day. Not so bad. Yes I had small blistering. Yes my skin looked white and as if it could fall off but... it worked. And honestly it wasn't that painful. Left my skin dry and itchy but the warts were gone. About a week later... a few came back. Repeated the treatment, used Aquaphore (by Eucerin.. like 4 bucks) to put on the skin whenever it hurt. A week later they were gone. So for all of  you who are crying, upset, scared... I was all of that. Hang in there. It could happene to ANYONE. I promise it will end.	F	25	 not sure 3X D	3/4/2010History

4	Genital warts	A little discomfort and itching during the day but nothing that was unbearable. I haven't finished my first 3 day cycle yet.	So far if I'm not crazy the bumps seem to be getting smaller. I read these reviews before applying the medication and damn I'm happy I did. Everyone talked about this horrible burning if you got the gel on your healthy skin so I have been extremellyyyy careful putting this on and so far I have no experienced this terrible pain that everyone talks about. I used aldara before and I applied it everywhere, around the bump and anywhere I thought something was coming up. It never burned my skin and was a little uncomfortable at times but it took forever to see results and the finally one day boom! They were gone and I did experience the burning when you wipe after urinating but that's jay because of the open sore.. I mean part of what used to be flesh is gone. You could only expect that. I wish someone had told me about the neosporin because I just dealt with it, it wasn't the mos horrible pain I've ever been in. Almost like getting a tattoo. Not the worst pain your gonna feel. As far as I can tell with the condylox it's working really well. The night I got my prescription I went home and used it and in the morning as well. I forgot to take my night dose so I applied this morning. And now it's evening and I just finished the application. Nobody says drying times an I'm afraid to get this gel on healthy skin becuase of the reviews so I wait 10 minutes after I apply to my last bump and I've never experienced the burning.

4	HPV	Burning, itching, and swelling where affected area touched normal skin.  As everyone else on here has said, DO NOT GET THIS STUFF ON NORMAL SKIN.	This stuff worked wonders on the one wart that I had.  Only took one round!  By the 2nd day of treatment, it was mostly gone and by the third day all that was left was a little tiny patch of "scorched earth", if you know what I mean.  However, on the 2nd day, I made the mistake of freaking out and putting this stuff where I thought a wart MIGHT BE coming up and HOLY CRAP did it burn the bejesus out of my skin.  Only put this stuff on something that you KNOW is a wart and DO NOT put it anywhere near mucous membranes unless you want to have to stifle screams any time you have to pee.  It literally eats your flesh which is why it works so well on those nasty warts.	F	22	3  days0.05% 2X D	2/13/2010
3	HPV	burn, general soreness, itching.	well, I first had mollescum, now HPV. Its hard to say if this stuff works because I have so many little one's. The problem I have is seeing them cuz my pubes grow so fast and you're not supposed to razor shave. Well if I dont shave, I cant see them!! So annoying! I bought a small beard trimmer but still have trouble seeing them. I've done cryo (wish they sold cryo-kits to the public) but not even a week later more sow up. I'm at my breaking point. Condylox, please work!! update soon. I know they never go away but has anyone had success with them dissipating for long periods of time?		26	6  days 2X D	2/10/2010
4	Genital Warts	Same side effects most people feel.  Severe burning immediately after putting on.  Then the rest of the first day goes normal after the burn wears off.  It's the second day that everything gets very raw and irritated.  I have never been able to use this product for 3 days in a row because of the pain.  But it does make a significant difference in the warts.  I am going this week to the urologist to get them either lasered or frozen or whatever it is that they do the warts.  He just wanted me to use this stuff to shrink the warts as much as possible before he got to them.		M	33	2  days	12/5/2009
4	HPV-AW	Jesus Christ it burns when you apply it, so do that when you are home alone.  Pretty sore and tender in the area that I used it.  BUT.....I am at the end of the first 3 days of use and by touch alone I can tell a different in the size of the warts.  I don't know that they will necessarily come off after this one cycle since I had them for a while, but so far there seems to be improvement.  I'll take the pain anyday to get rid of these things.	I was diagnosed with HPV 4 years ago and have had two clean test results since then, so I wasn't anticipating having issues, but over the last couple months I noticed when i was wiping in the bathroom that bumps had started to appear in the region of my anus....I'm not into the anal sex idea, person choice, so I was perplexed when my GYN said that they were AW esp after two years of clean pap smears....whatever, lucky me.  SO far I think its working but it will most likely take two treatment weeks for me.  Yes, it DOES hurt like hell....but I can still walk to school everyday, and I float in a hot bath at nite before my roommate comes home and hogs the hot water, before I do the nite application.  Will be trying the Neo-pain relief for the 4 days off.	F	29	3  days	12/3/2009
5	HPV	Soreness, itching, burning, pain, open wounds	My warts were relatively small, I had a dozen or so and had them frozen off. Some remained/reappeared so bought the cream online for about $240. Instead of using this twice a day I used it once a day for 5 days. I applied it with the blunt end of a needle, and used very very little each time, with the help of a mirror and flashlight. Also applied Vaseline to general area and waited at least 30 minutes before putting on clothes or moving around.Day 1. Did not feel discomfort at all. Wondered if it's working.Day 2. Some mild itching/burning.Day 3. Burning/Pain more intense. Some started to crust/scab up.Day 4. Warts turned into hard whitish scabs. Experienced pain when touched.Day 5. Some turned into open wounds. Applied Neosporin with Pain Relief.Day 6. Stop using Condylox. Keep applying Neosporin once a day.After that I just waited a couple of days for them to completely heal. It is about 2 weeks later now and they are gone and the spots are healed. I'm anticipating that they might return. At first I thought this was way too painful and annoying, I should have just gotten them frozen off again. However, this proved to work in the privacy of my own home. I still have a lot left so if they do flare up I can use again and save money by not going to the dermatologist. I think it's worth it if you do it correctly and don't mind a couple of days of discomfort. 	F	27	5  days	12/2/2009

5	Genital Warts	Stinging and Burning	My Doc froze my warts several times, but they never totally went away. So she gave me Condylox, told me to put it on my warts 3 consecutive days a week twice a day. okay. well, the first go round was not pretty. She didn't really stres how careful you should be to NOT GET THIS ON YOUR NORMAL SKIN. I had a bunch in the area between my vagina and my rectum, and I got some on skin down there, I was in pain for a week. You can't sit, walk, do ANYTHING. But, they did go away after the first week. They came back a couple weeks later and a few are in some tricky spots. But this time it isn't half as bad. I take my time and make sure to get it directly on the wart and make SURE it dries first as well. That would be my main advice, take your time, be accurate and make sure they dry and you'll have no problems. This gel is awesome at curing warts if you do it right.	F	21	1  months	11/9/2009
5	Anal Wart	Intense burning and itching after Day 3, on first day off treatment. Exacerbated by movement. Lasted for four days, on the fifth day off the treatment normal activities could be resumed. It would wake me up during the night, that's how intense it was.	Give yourself time to do nothing but sit on the first day of rest, time it so it falls on a free weekend. Neosporin cream with pain relief with be your best friend, apply with a q-tip. For me sitting helped, even in sleep. I took to sleeping in a chair for a few nights. Extremely effective, just be aware of the side effects. Using petroleum jelly in unaffected areas to keep from getting it on your skin is highly advised.	M	21	3  days	11/8/2009
1	GW on anus	Burnt healthy skin, rawness, oozing, light bleeding. malodor.  misery.	Ebola virus in a tube. Doc didnt advise me well on this stuff.  I put a dot on the wart on my crack, which rubbed against the other cheek, burning on both sides of the equator.  Painful to walk, sit, do just about anything.  Prescribed to take for 10 days, if I did ten days of this stuff, it would probably eat straight through to my colon.  Doc sliced the wart off, then prescribed this to keep it from coming back.  now i just hope the rest of my skin down there grows back.    BE SUPER CAREFUL WITH THIS STUFF!	M	24	3  days	10/16/2009
5	GW	I had one big wart and some smaller ones and after the first day of using Condylox I only had the big one and one small one left. After the third day they are way smaller and are almost all gone. Judging from the rate of success from the first week, by the end of the second week I expect them all to be completely gone. I'm glad I read this posting before I started using Condylox. I made sure to not get it on any healthy skin and I used a hair dryer on cool to let it dry. I experienced extreme itching and pain one of the nights and the day after it kind of hurt to walk but then the pain went away the next day. It wasn't anything unbearable and it was definitely worth it!  I might try neosporin the next week which might help with the itching.	I only dealt with itching and slight pain on one of the nights. I would definitely recommend this product. I used Aldara the week before and saw no results. After the first day of using Condylox I only had two warts left and they are almost gone after the third application. I have also been taking 2,000mg of vitamin C everyday, eating healthy, not smoking cigarettes and getting lots of sleep which is probably helping my immune system.	F	18	3  days	9/25/2009

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS.

We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds.

Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".

The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email

Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present.

I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

3	Bipolar I	Increase in appetite (gained 2 lbs in 2 weeks), GI upset initially, migraines so bad had to discontinue it	I'm bipolar with mixed states. After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated. Who knows if it "helped my depression" because it made me an absolute basket case!	F	21	14  days2.5 mg 1X D	9/27/2010

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).	F	42	16  months30 mg 1X D	9/7/2010
3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
