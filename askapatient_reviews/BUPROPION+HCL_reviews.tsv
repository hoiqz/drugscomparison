3	stop smoking	This medicine makes me sick...literally...loss of appetite...nausea...vomiting..dizziness...lightheaded almost feel high....the only thing about it is...It makes me too sick to smoke!		F	36	2  weeks	1/18/2013
2	depression	EXTREME sweating, paranoia, weight gain (22lbs!!!!)		F	29	4  months150mg	12/1/2012
2	Depression	The first three days I had a slight headache and increased energy.. By day four, I was hungry, hungry, hungry! I've been the same weight --122 lbs for five years and usually limit sweets.  Now, I have gained five lbs. after a month of bupropion and am constantly drawn to carbohydrates! Plus,  i have zero sex drive.  Typically, I'm pretty interested in sex,  but since starting this drug, i have trouble even reaching the big "o".  Reduced sensitivity or something, I'm going off this drug ASAP! The only pro has been a slightly increased energy level, but not enough to justify the cons.		F	41	30  days100 1X D	7/12/2012
3	ADHD/mood stabilizer	Extreme shakiness over my entire body. It messed with my throat and caused me to stutter my speech. Occasional headaches. Nausea.	It really helped with my concentration and anxiety. The shaky thing (which is actually happening as I am typing this) was extreme. I feel like Dr. Katz.	M	28	3  months 2X D	5/16/2012Email
2	Stress	Less problematic than Lexapro......	Other than greatly diminished road rage, I can't really tell if its doing anything.	M	64	1  years 2X D	5/11/2012
1	depression	The generic worked ok for my mood. However, I did go down 1 pill (normally 3), and I lost all treatment affects. I went back up a week later, and my mood improved. However, I gained 20 lbs while I was taking the generic, and I had HORRIBLE food and refined carbohydrate cravings the entire time I took this. The generic also made my chest breakout in tons of whiteheads. I've been off the generic for 3 weeks now. The cravings subsided about 72 hours after I stopped it, and my skin is finally getting back to normal. The cravings were really surprising because I've never had that problem on Glaxo Wellbutrin. I do not know what lab made the generic I took.	Terrible drug. AWFUL! If you have any trouble with your weight, beware.	F	35	2  months450 1X D	5/4/2011Email
1	depression	DOES NOT WORK!!!!!	I tried the generic twice on 2 different occassions... XL then 100 mg twice a day.   IT DID NOT WORK!!!  I know several people who have this same complaint.The generic should be taken off the market until its corrected and stop misleading the FDA into believing its the same drug.. IT IS NOT!!!!!!!

1	Yes	HORRIBLE sweating, weight loss, slight improvement in outlook on life	I WAS on Bupropion CHL XL, 150mg, 1x per day made by Watson Pharma for about three or four months.  The weight loss/slight lack of appetite was nice but the sweating was unbearable. Before this drug, I RARELY sweated, even in hot weather or when working out hard. Now, walking around in 40 degree weather leaves my sweaty. I'm not heavy, so weight is not the reason for the sweating. Here's the thing - Ive been 100% OFF this horrible medication for about 10 months and the sweating seems to be permanent, which is awful! HAS ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THIS?!?  HeLp!!!

4	Depression	I have had a strange metallic taste in my mouth while taking Wellbutrin as well as its generic form, Bupropion-- which I recently learned can be a side effect. I experience this gross metal taste off and on, at random moments, maybe once or twice a month. Other than that, please refer to my other comment.	***I am the same person who complained of muscle soreness in my legs while taking Bupropion. I wanted to add that that symptom has gone away, and my psychiatrist tells me that Bupropion is linked to muscle soreness/tightness in small muscle groups, such as the jaw/neck, but not in the larger muscle groups in the legs. So the muscle soreness may not be caused by Bupropion, and I have consequently changed my rating of this medication from a 3 to a 4.	F	27	2  months	10/29/2009
5	Depression	anxiety out of roof, confused a little, stomach felt funny	distributed by EON bupropion hcl SR 150mg and tried wellbutrin xl 150mg. EON is round blue bupropion pill thats sooooo well worth it if you get a chance to buy it, take it over bupropion xl. it is great. feel so much better with both brands but EON bupropion SR is sooo well	M	23	3  months	10/14/2009Email
3	Depression	I just left a rating on the Wellbutrin XL site and gave it a rating of 4. The great effects far outweighed any slight, rare side effects I experienced. After 2 years of taking Wellbutrin, I was put on Bupropion about a month ago (the generic version, same dosage of 150mg), and I've experienced jaw tension 1 time, increased anxiety, some heart palpitations, and weird muscle pain in my legs and buttocks for the last five days. (It may have helped me lose a little weight, and it may have decreased my libido.) I'm not sure how Wellbutrin and Bupropion are different or if my recent problems resulted from the switch to this generic form. I do know that the non-generic form was perfect for me, and I'd still be on it if my insurance would permit it. Bupropion has helped with my depression the way Wellbutrin did, but this muscle soreness has freaked me out. I feel like I ran a marathon, and I've gone from being a super-flexible person to straining to touch my toes and walking around like an eld	I am going to have to reconsider how I will handle my depression. I might stop taking Bupropion, but I'm a little afraid to.	F	27	1  months	10/13/2009
1	Anxiety, Depression	Anxiety replaced by irritability and anger.  Greater depression because of major weight gain.  Increased appetite, binge eating.	ARGH ... I just left my comments in the Wellbutrin list because I thought I selected the generic!   I've been feeling so crappy ALLTHETIME.  I want to smack everyone upside the head, road rage, binge eating of sweets then salt has resulted in an 8 pound weight gain in 2 months.  I got online to look up what withdrawals I could expect by stopping cold turkey.  Then I found a few sites where many people have noticed a difference between Wellbutrin and Bupropion.   My doc kept insisting it wasn't the Wellbutrin, and guess what?  I'm taking Bupropion!		47	2  months	9/26/2009
1	Depression/Fatigue	Anxiety, despair	The pharmacy gave me Bupropion SR instead of Wellbutrin because insurance won't pay as much for Wellbutrin.  I had taken Wellbutrin in the past and knew how it should affect me.  Finally went to my doctor who said that she and her collegues had been hearing the same complaints about the generic.  New users may not understand and it will probably make their depression symptoms worse.   BEWARE!	F	52	14  days	8/25/2009
1	fatigue, depression	jittery, hyperactive, shaking, cold sweat, rage, thoughts of violence, paranoia, insomnia, loss of appetite, low blood sugar, headache	By day 2 the side effects were completely intolerable and I felt worse than I had before taking it.  Bupropion XL made by Teva, small white round pill with A101 printed on it. 150 mg (once a day, in the morning with food).  This was a very bad drug for me. I will never take it again.	F	42	2  days	6/13/2009
2	stress/depression/quit smoking	Nausia, loss of appetite, dizziness, trouble sleeping, increased sex drive, aggitaion, anxiety, headache, increased depression, some sort of vaginal irritation/swelling	I haven't been on this very long.  It is very expensive, 130.00 for 30days of 150mg once a day, and I have insurance.  I went up to 300mg a day(as recommended if I didn't notice effectiveness after 4-5 days) and side effects seemed to worsen.  I'm having "bad" days where I just want to cry all day, don't want to go anywhere, be social at all, and am more depressed.  I'm having anxiety issues along with some paranoia.  I'm not getting angry as easily but more little things are seem to aggitate me more than before.  I'm having an increased sex drive, but the last time I had sex it was uncomfortable and unsatisfying.  I don't know that it is worth the side effects to continue taking this medication.  I feel like I was more stable before.	F	31	2  weeks	4/8/2009
1	depression	stiff neck, constipation, extreme shaking, horrible memory, huge weight gain without being hungry, vivid dreams, pms symptoms.	This medicine is horrible.  I noticed a slight difference with my mood but all the negative side effects far out weighed one little good thing.  I'm huge now which has made the depression issues even worse.  I started weening off four weeks ago and it's been two weeks since my last pill.  Still experiencing withdrawal.  Wondering if anyone has information as to what happens next.  Will the weight come off,  how long the weening takes, etc... Any help would be great.	F	41	6  months	2/11/2009Email
1	depression	WEIGHT GAIN around stomach. Constipation. Irritability.	This is crap. I don't care what they say about it being the same as Wellbutrin. Just do a google search and you will see how many people have had problems with this drug. I tried zoloft and quit using it because of lack of sex drive and energy. This isn't helping anything. I am more depressed because of the weight gain. And I am as irritable as I was when I wasn't on medication. I can't afford $100 a month for the real Wellbutrin, and I have insurance!!! If you feel as depressed as you did before taking this, YOU ARE NOT CRAZY. This doesn't work. The FDA needs to do a little more research on this.	F	28	2  months	12/23/2008
4	mild depression	headache every day, since I started taking almost 2 months ago ,  that could be hormonal too.	I have taken on and off for about 10 years.  No side effects other than headache.	F	50	2  months	12/17/2008
3	Depression	Initial dizziness, only lasted first three days	It is a stimulant	F	20	1  years	3/12/2003
