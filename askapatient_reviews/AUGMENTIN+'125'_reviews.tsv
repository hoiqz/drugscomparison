1	Sinus Infection	extreme fatigue, indigestion, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fogginess, depression	Started taking this to get rid of a persistent sinus infection that had failed to respond to another anti-biotic and persisted for months. I've never had a negative reaction to any anti-biotic or any other drug for that matter. It knocked the infection out in a few days, but by the 6th day I started experiencing all the above effects. Probably should have stopped taking it then, but it took me a while to trace what I was feeling to the drug. Took last dose 48 hours ago, and still feel terrible. Finally puked for the first time since I've had nausea for days and feel a little better. I lost 5 pounds in less than a week. Probably should have gone to the emergency room or hospital at several points. Don't know how I worked 3 days this week. The "cure" in this case was much worse than the ailment.

1	sinus infection	headache, dizziness, diarrhea	I started taking this for a week and I was fine and had no symptoms until a few days ago when I started feeling dizzy and I had a headache. I called the dr and she said to stop the  medication. I've never had any problem before with any other antibiotic. This is the first. Would not recommend.	F	31	7  days125 2X D	3/22/2011
2	Auxillary Gland Infection/Abscess	Diarrhea, nausea and red, itchy rash	Doctor prescribed this to me to prevent the spread of an infection in my arm. For that reason, it worked wonderfully. After the abscess was drained my doctor said the wound looked great and the redness from the infection ceased in my arm. But I had diarrhea halfway through the second day and it lasted through the end of the treatment period despite trying to take probiotics to help it. Then on the eighth day I broke out into a rash, very similar to hives, all over my body. My doctor suggested benadryl to alleviate the itching. This medicine did what it was supposed to do; it just came with side effects that made me feel worse than I already did.	F	20	10  days125 3X D	3/7/2011
1	Mild infection in cyst on ear	Intense nausea followed by hours of vomiting/dry heaving with nausea for almost 24 hours.	I was given this antibiotic for a small cyst that popped up on my ear that looked like it could be slightly infected.  I took one pill with a large meal and two hours later I was INTENSELY nauseous.  Then I proceeded to vomit on and off for hours and eventually it was just dry heaving.  I was nauseous for about 24 hours.  Won't be taking this again.  I had not needed to take an antibiotic in about 10 years, but I have never had a reaction like this to one.  My doctor told me to stop taking it and just apply an antibiotic ointment.

1	ear infection	diarrhea, headache, depression, itching, sever pain post urination, feelings of impending doom	my daughter screamed in for 40 minutes after she urinated, saying "mommy its wet make it stop, it makes me nervous, i can't take it any more" etc, doc said this was all from this medication.  diarrhea was explosive, often she did not make it to the bathroom.  I would never give this to another child.	F	4	6  days	12/31/2009
