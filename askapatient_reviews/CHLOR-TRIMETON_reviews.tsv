4	Seasonal allergies	Sometimes causes drowsiness; sometimes not.	This is the best over the counter simple tried and true med out there!  It's affordable and I appreciate that it only lasts for 4 hours!Love it!  May it never, ever go away.	F	53	1  years 1X D	2/1/2013
2	itchiness	dry mouth, severe irritability, twitching in neck muscles, blank thoughts, trouble speaking properly	I wanted this to work without side effects based on other reviews here.  No such luck, at least for me.  I do think the medication helped slightly with my itchiness, but was very short acting.  What has not been short acting are the side effects.  My mouth is much drier than it ever gets with Benadryl over 12 hours after taking 1/2 the recommended dosage as a test before bedtime.  I'm glad I didn't take the whole pill.  I couldn't keep a thought in my head for hours after I woke up, and when I tried to speak I kept stumbling over words, leaving words out or saying the wrong words.  Not good. Also I'm way more irritable than normal.	M	50	1  times2 mg 1X O	10/8/2012

2	Allergy and asthma	I took this medication hoping to get some help from asthma due to allergies. The other posts seemed like it might work. This medication did not help me and made me feel worse. It causes a rapid heart beat, bad dreams and no relief from trouble breathing. Now I have a full package minus one pill.	Will not take again.	F	55	1  days30mg 1X D	6/5/2011
5	seasonal allergies	drowsiness and dopey feeling if I take it with a decongestant (like Sudafed); otherwise nothing bothersome.	I used Chlor-Trimeton to manage my hay fever from age 15 through maybe age 30, when i moved to an area where my allergies were milder and didn't need medicine.  When i returned to the pollen-rich land of my childhood five years later, I tried Claritin (which didn't work well) and Zyrtec (which made me feel depressed and hopeless).  Now I am back to good old Chlor-Trimeton, which works well without awful side effects.	F	40	25  years4 mg 2X D	5/20/2011Email
4	post-nasal drip, indoor allergies	none	Would prefer a 10 or 12 hour version to be available	F	25	1  months	1/12/2010
4	allergies	I began taking chlor-trimeton after I was diagnosed with hypertention. Before that I took sudafed, which is useless. Zyrtec and all other allergy meds cause me to have an irregularheartbeat. I think it does help me to sleep better at night, but I am not sleepy during the day.	It helps a cough, runny nose, and itchy eyes. I think it is very good.	F	72	6  weeks	7/5/2009
4	Seasonal allergy	With the 4-hour tablet I get drowsiness, though not as much as with other products. The 12-hour tablet makes me less drowsy, but is sometimes hard to find.	In more than 58 years of dealing with allergy, this is so far the best of the bunch.	M	60	15  years	4/7/2008
4	bronchial allergy cough	It stopped the cough completely, but also made me sleep better at night - I'm normally a very light sleeper and wake up tired.   Chlortrimeton did not sedate me during the day, but I did sleep longer and better at night consistently....	I switched to zyrtec when it went over the counter, which works well enough for allergy and cough related asthma (which I have) but my anxiety seems increased - not terribly so, maybe it's just that I stopped the chlortrimeton.   I may switch back.  Not sure	F	48	1  years	2/13/2008
