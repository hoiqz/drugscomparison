				F M	 	 	    
1	nerve pain	Weight gain, about 6 pounds in a month. No brain fog, though.	Didn't do much, if anything, for nerve pain but certainly did make me gain weight. I was at a relatively low dosage (200 mg twice per day); it may have worked better at a higher dose but didn't want to keep gaining weight.	F	60	30  days100 mg 4X D	4/1/2013
5	Small Fiber Peripheral Neuropathy	Drowsiness, blurred vision, "zoning out".	Gabapentin was a life saver for me.  It completely numbs my symptoms almost all of the time. The side effects are there, but mild compared to my symptoms without the drug.	F	39	2  years900-3600mg 1X D	3/12/2013
2	Fibromyalgia	It reduced the pain initially,but quickly wore off.Was extremely tired,over sleeping and gaining weight were nusant side effects. The biggests problems is that the pain relief quit working after about a week. Was not satisfied with this medicine.		F	56	1  days	2/18/2013Email
3	Nerve pain	None known for sure. Probable that increased consipation, weight gain and dry mouth are related to this drug. Have had bloody stools probably from ruptured hemmorhoids but this is a known side effect of this drug as well.	Not sure if this drug actually works. Have to take Percocet to get any real relief.

4	Sciatic Pain	My friend Titus described it best when he called me at 3:00 a.m. while he was at work to say, "Dude, I can't feel my brain!"	This was prescribed for Sciatic Nerve pain. I take it as needed, which is rarely. It's quite effective. In my case, even if I still feel the pain, it makes me not care. 1 pill and I'm giddy, 2 pills and I'm flying high (no pain can touch me), and 3 pills I'm out cold.

2	Numb, tingling, shooting toe pain	None.	Trying at the recommendation of podiatrist, and neurologist he referred me to.  Was taking AM and PM.  Couldn't tell if it was doing anything in AM, but helped me get to sleep, a little, so it helps with the shooting toe pains as I'm trying to get to sleep, but that's about all.

3	chromic headaches	Since starting gabapentin I frequently can't find the words I'm trying to say. I may have increased forgetfulness... but that is natural for me sometimes and a side effect of a different drug I'm taking.  Loss of libido I could deal with, but loss of ability to orgasm is a side effect of the gabapentin that I wish I did not have to deal with.	I took it for about 5 months, then quit about 1 year ago because the headaches came back. Started taking it again 3 weeks ago. Both times the headaches decreased substantially, but not completely. Its a trade off between the side effects of Gabapentin with reduced headache all day and no headache when I wake or OXYCODONE AND ACETAMINOPHEN with temporary but complete headache relief and good back pain relief, but the effectiveness reduces with prolonged use of the oxy.

2	Peripheral Neuropathy	Disconnected, tired, strange disturbing violent dreams	Was prescribed this for idiopathic peripheral neuropathy. I only took it 3 days because I couldn't tolerate the side effects. My sleep, even with taking clonopin, was disturbed, like I was "aware" all night and my dreams were strange and violent. Woke up exhausted and it didn't help at all with the nerve pain in my feet. Could be it would have worked if I had been able to tolerate it better and take it for longer. The side effects outweighed any eventual benefits and I was on an extremely lose dose so as to avoid any bad side effects. I had high hopes for this medication and am disappointed.

1	Fibromyalgia	Was suffering with PND when prescribed this drug and it worsened the depression to the point where I was suicidal. I can honestly not remember if there were any other side effects as the drug affected me so badly and I have little memory of the month I was on it apart from a desire to die.I would not recommend this drug if you have pre-existing depression and if you do take it make sure a loved one is checking on you for the first few months to make sure you are ok.

4	anxiety, aches and pains	drowsy and listless	Gabapentin can be effective if you pay close attention. This is not a pain-killer or feel-good potion. It basically rounds out the rough edges on things, making them more tolerable. Yes, it can leave you drowsy and listless, feeling like crap. But "feeling like crap" might be a better place than where you're currently at. Provigil might help to counter-act the side effects.	M	59	2  months300 MG 2X D	8/26/2011
3	fibromyalgia and anxiety	The worst side effect I had has been that when it wears off I feel depressed. Other than that I would say that constipation is the other problem I had with it.		F	52	4  months 4X D	6/28/2011
4	have neurofibromatosis	tired all the time, slight burred vision, weight gain, this is a very high dose of it, total 4800 mg per day, this drug has a half life in the body of 5-7 hours	I take this for very sharp shooting pains in my fingers	M	53	5  years1200 4X D	6/6/2011Email
2	back pain	Weight  gain, sleepiness, can't form words and you sound like a moron its a great drug. Did nothing for pain in my back. Also effected my sight and hearing. It basically shut down everything except pain.		F	36	3  months900mg 3X D	6/1/2011Email
5	restless leg and pain	None	Stops my restless leg problem almost right away. Help with pain but not as well as withe the leg problem.	M	66	1  years300MG 3X D	5/31/2011
4		sleepy		F	55	 300mg 1X D	2/21/2011
2	back pain scoliosis	Initially, dizziness, fatigue. This was gone by the 3rd dose. When I quit taking it I had two weeks of fatigue, anxiety, insomnia and nausea. It took me a long time to figure out why I felt so awful and then I didn't want to take any more to taper because I hoped I was over the worst and didn't want to draw it out.		F	39	30  days200 mg 1X D	9/11/2010Email
2	sciatic pain	speech difficulty, "woozy-headed"	After taking the medication for several weeks I began to notice that I was having difficulty speaking. It was like my brain would think the words but I couldn't get my mouth to coordinate. Did it help the pain? Yes, it did. However, I don't think the brain mush is worth it. I have to talk alot in my work and sounding like I'm in a stupor doesn't cut it. I took myself off the medication. The pain has returned but I'm trying to appease it with tylenol or motrin.I don't know how people who take this medication for seizures are able to function on a day to day basis.

1	Nerve pain in right foot	Nauseous, dizziness, motion sickness, headaches, & drunken feeling.	Do not like the side effects of this drug.  Only been taking it for 4 days & I want off.  Think I'd rather deal w/the intermentent nerve pain.  I've left a message for my doctor to ween me off.  He originally put me on Cymbalta (see Cymbalta comments on 5/5/10) but between the side effects of that & the high co-pay he switched me to Gabapentin.  I think I'm through w/all meds.
