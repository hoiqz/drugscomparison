4	tmj/ear pain and discomfort	heartburn afterwards...take with breakfast or lunch...otherwise ocassionally a little more easily irritated but that's about it.	seemed to help with my tmj pain and myofacial pains.	M	39	7  days30mg 3X D	7/12/2011
4	persistent cough, rib fracture/pain	almost none. maybe some dry mouth and leg cramps, but hardly noticeable!	i was terrified of taking prednisone. you hear so many horror stories about even the smallest of doses and the shortest of treatments. i am SO HAPPY i took a chance and did it--it helped my cough and somewhat lessened the pain from fracturing my ribs while coughing. i still need a big dose of ibuprofen for my rib pain, but the prednisone, after 4 days, seems to have settled my cough and opened my airway. there were almost NO side effects, and i really mean NONE. i have serious health probs and am amazed that someone like me had no problems with this drug.

4	Sudden hearing loss	weight gain, acne, moon face, joint pain, insomnia, frequent erections at first, followed by a impotence and complete loss of libido.	I loved it and hated it. I had sudden sensory hearing loss and received a very high dose of 80mg per day for a month before tapering down in 10mg increments each week after that. It worked within weels but with side effects like amazing weight gain from a trim 165 lbs to a soft 185lbs in a few weeks. I had terrible acne on my face and upper back, my face was red and swollen and, yes round like the moon. I had the beginnings of the 'buffalo hump" just as I tapered off. The first week, I got erections all the time, like a high schooler. By the next week, that was a thing of the past. I had no sex drive and couldn't do anything about it if I did. I also had trouble sleeping. I'd get on the computer, read or watch TV all through the night. After I finally tapered back and off the drug I slowly returned to normal. The weight took a year to lose. This is powerful stuff. I'd use it again to save my hearing.	M	30	3  months80mg 1X D	6/2/2010
1	allergic reaction	fast heart rate, shortness of breath, paranoia, insomnia.	The drug worked at getting rid of my allergic reaction, but it really wigged me out.  I was supposed to take it 7 days but i only made it until day 6.  My symptoms grew progressively worse as the days went on.  By day 6 i was too scared to continue. All of my reactions were listed on the side effects section except one.  Ive looked online and asked around but i cant find anyone else who had this experience.  I play music as a hobby and was doing a charity show at a college.  I was really wigged out that night and i swear i remember watching myself play that show! I dont use illegal drugs or anything so it had to be the prescription. I stopped taking it after that night. It did kill the allergic reaction though.	M	27	7  days 1X D	6/1/2010
1	Colitis	Couldn't sleep the whole seven months I took it. Got high blood pressure and never had any problems with that before.	Constant hunger and even though I am a slim guy I gained a lot of weight. Never had a problem with my weight before. Not even around holidays. Got acne and my face got real large and swollen. Was losing my hair. I looked very sick. My wife was embarrassed to go places with me, she stopped asking. Can say for certain we wouldn't be married if she were just meeting me today. You learn things about people on this drug.	M	39	7  months	1/27/2010
1	UC	Hair loss, cystic acne, 75lb weight gain, severe depression, a suicide attempt, racing thoughts, impulsiveness, stretch marks, heart palpitations, thinned skin, dry skin, dry eyes, blurry vision, severe insomnia, sweating, body stopped healing the way it used to.		F	26	6  months	1/18/2010
1	UC	Extremely blurry vision. Extremely dry eyes. Vision went from -3.25 to -8.50, eyes became dry so can no longer wear contacts. This means huge glasses even when I pay extra for thin lenses. Prednisone basically prematurely ages your entire body. The reason why old people have so many health problems is because when you age you naturally experience the things prednisone does to a person. Hair loss. Thinned skin. Dry skin. Dry scalp. Dry mouth. Stretch marks.	Knowing what I know about UC now, I would never take prednisone. I also would not put blind faith in my gastroenterologist. It's painful to think back at how inept he was. He even would give me rectal exams without a glove and then when I looked at him (because that is a weird thing to do) he would say, Oops, I must've forgot. It's like: if you were giving someone a rectal exam, wouldn't that be the FIRST thing you think of? Personally I would use several. I really think the typical person who becomes a gastroenterologist is either a pervert or someone who's very greedy but could not manage to become a specialist in another field. Usually when you hear about doctors who rape, sexually assault, or commit sex crimes and abuse against their patients, they're gastroenterologists, and more often than not, the ones from third world countries.	F	19	 	12/18/2009
1	UC (misdiagnosed)	Depression, rage, thoughts of suicide, cystic acne, acne scars, blotchy skin on face, red eyes, SEVERE dry eye (my eyes barely have any moisture at all now; my eyelids actually stick to my eyes), dry mouth, sweating, high blood pressure, thyroid problem, moon face. Before, when I heard about side effects of drugs, I thought about things like headache, GI symptoms maybe--not these sorts of things can cause--and prednisone can do much more this! What is outrageous is that I've had doctors go out of their way to tell me minor symptoms for safe drugs--but in this case my doctor simply lied to me (to get me to comply) and told me this very dangerous drug was actually safe....	Anyone who tells you pred is safe is nuts, lazy, or simply doesn't care about you. This might not be a bad drug to take if you're 80 years old, but if you're young, prednisone could really, really mess up your life. I wish I had known that...it really, really messed up mine. I was told it was safe (by my doctor at the University of Iowa, Anne Sullivan); at that time I thought you could trust doctors. I was wrong. She proved that to me. I had perfect skin, now I have blotchy, scarred skin--which is a great thing to have when you're 18, right? (I was also put on Imuran, had a neoplasm develop on my face, so also have large surgical scar on a very prominent portion of my face.) I used to actually get compliments on my complexion, now people just wonder what happened to me. Turns out I didn't even have UC--had nothing seriously wrong with me. (Advice: If you're diagnosed with UC or CD, definitely, definitely get a second opinion, particularly if you're diagnosed at the University of Iowa)	M	18	7  months	11/27/2009
1	ms	moon face, cystic acne, buffalo hump		F	34	2  weeks	11/19/2009
3	Over active immune system	Nervousness, Weight-gain, bloating	My immune system was having some kind of hyperreactivity response and it wouldn't stop so I was given prednisone to calm it down.  It supressed my immune system and the hyperreactivity response stopped, but in the meantime I was a nervous wreck, I gained weight and I got bloated in the face.  It was awful.  Unless a doctor told me that I really needed it, I wouldn't take it again.	F	37	3  months	11/8/2009

1						 	6/22/2009
1	UC	At first mania, impulsiveness, and insomnia. Then rage, mood swings, acne, weight gain, stretch marks, dry mouth, and eye pain.	This drug is crap, plain and simple.	F	28	3  months	6/13/2009
5	Giant Cell Temporal Arthritis	Moon face, fatigue, bruise easily, hair loss, memory problems, restlessness, sleelessnes (while on 60mg (2mo), glucose count increased.	Because I had been misdiagnosed, had to be on high dosage for 2 months; it was the only medication they could give me to prevent blindness or possible stroke. I do not like the side effects, but there is no choice. Have been on for 10 mos, weaned down to 13 1/2mg from the 60; possibility will be on for rest of my life. I am a silicone reconstruction survivor, my inflammation rate has been high for several years- very hard to get it reduced.	M	78	10  months	3/19/2009
1	UC	The side effects have been debilitating and have ruined my life.	I'd rather take poison and die than take this again.	M		 	2/8/2009
1	Crohn's	Clinical depression, thoughts of suicide, anxiety, cystic acne, scars, skin atrophy, hair loss, yellow skin, thyroid disease	I had no idea any drug--legal or illegal--could be so dangerous. My doctor, Bushra Sulieman, gave this to me, smiling, and said I'd take it for a few weeks and be back to normal. It didn't work. And its side effects have been devastating. Some are permanent. Skin on my face thinned and atrophied. I also have scars on my face. They'll never go away. Facial scars are devastating to a person's body image. I don't even want to leave the house.	F	17	7  months	12/7/2008
1	Severe SLE (Lupus)	Where do I start ? This drug has completely ruined my life. Had mega amounts of steroids over 3 years. Still suffering from the terrible effects as the body tries to adjust back to normal. Severe weakness, severe anxiety, severe tremors, complete loss of sexual function, rage aggressiveness, extreme sweating, unable to think, severe weight gain and the list goes on.	Was prescribed steroids along with other drugs because of life threatening organ complications. All steroids do, is suppress the bodies natural inflammatory process/response. They don't cure or heal anything. Dr's need to make sure, that when prescribing these drugs, patients are fully aware of the side effects. I was never fully informed. Now once the hormonal effect goes, my organs will fail. I would rather die from severe sle rather than ever take steroids again.	M	32	3  years	10/15/2008
1	CD	Hair loss, acne, major depression, suicidal, memory problems, weight gain, sexual side effects, red eyes, heart palpitations, yellow skin... Go here to read what the Mayo Clinic has to say about the psychiatric effects of corticosteroids: http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/inside.asp?AID=4187&UID= Here are some excerpts: "It is important that clinicians in all specialties become aware of the potential psychiatric adverse effects associated with corticosteroids and explain these effects to their patients.""The corticosteroid dosage is the most important risk factor for the development of psychiatric symptoms." "Psychiatric disturbances can occur at any point during corticosteroid treatment, including almost immediately after initiation and even after cessation of treatment." "Patients should be evaluated for any suggestion of suicidality." "Corticosteroid-induced psychiatric disturbances are common and include mania, depression, psychot	"Educating patients about potential adverse effects and asking about such effects at each patient encounter can enhance early intervention for adverse corticosteroid-induced psychiatric reactions." "Although a powerful therapeutic option, corticosteroids are associated with serious adverse effects, both physiologic and psychiatric." "In our literature review, we found that the potential psychiatric adverse effects of corticosteroids span a symptom spectrum from subtle mood changes to full-blown affective syndromes and frank psychosis.""Cognitive deficits, particularly declarative or verbal memory deficits, have been well documented during both long- and short-term corticosteroid therapy." "More severe cognitive impairment consistent with delirium or dementia has also been described."	F		 	9/27/2008
1	multiple sclerosis	euphoria, rage, crying for no reason, emotional ups and downs, depression, acne, dry skin, dry mouth, dry eyes, red eyes, pain in bones, weight gain, stretch marks, higher blood pressure, rapid heart beat, profuse sweating	Taking this drug is like taking poison. The doctors I go to now don't even prescribe it, they think it's evil too and aren't so cold hearted to give it to their patients. Only bad doctors prescribe this drug to young people.	F	20	 	9/26/2008
1	Crohn's Disease	Prednisone gave me Cushing's Syndrome - which for guys means a lot of bad things, like Erectile Dysfunction, weight gain, high blood pressure, hypertension, depression and anxiety, thin, fragile skin that bruises and scars easily; facial flushing; rounding of face; pink and purple stretch marks; slowed healing of cuts; infections and even insect bites; muscle weakness; and acne.	This stuff is worse than drinking battery acid. Good doctors use it only as a last resort because it is so terrible.	M	32	5  months	9/7/2008
1	Crohn's Colitis	Premature aging, sexual side effects, hair loss, corticosteroid induced psychosis, seizures, irregular heart beat, shortness of breath, vomiting, thinning of skin, skin atrophy, acne, buffalo hump, weight gain, moon face, muscle turned to fat, dry eyes, stretch marks, joint pain, sore throat, nervousness, mood swings, euphoria, rage, sadness, violent nightmares, bruises all over body, night sweats, redness in eyes, itching all over, couldn't sleep, oh and worsening of my symptoms.	I was just at a doctor about the side effects prednisone gave me.  He said that prednisone's effects are long-lasting and you can't undo the damage. Even for the people who think they didn't have side effects, they most likely did and still do. For example, prednisone reduces your ability to heal for the rest of your life.	F	26	4  months	8/20/2008
1	UC	Severe depression. Suicidal. Attempted suicide. Mania. Panic attacks. Anxiety. Impaired thinking. Impulsiveness. Acne from hell - large red acne cysts. Acne scars. Ruined skin. Hair loss. Dry skin. Red blotchy skin. Dry eyes. Red eyes. Thyroid disease. Yellow skin (possible liver damage). Extreme insomnia. Increased appetite. Weight gain. Stretch marks. Mood swings. Rage. Feelings of hopelessness. Tremors (couldn't shave or I'd kill myself). Joint pain. Heart palpitations. Infections. Suppressed immune system. Bruising. Couldn't heal. Nausea. Vomiting. Headaches.	Before I took prednisone, I had perfect skin, and, besides an occasional pimple, never really had much acne. Prednisone changed that; it ruined my skin, and, as a result, destroyed my self-esteem. People I haven't seen since taking prednisone don't even recognize me. My eyes, from prednisone and all the other drugs, barely produce tears at all anymore. My eyes are so dry, I can't wear contacts. The whites of my eyes are almost entirely red. My skin is still yellow. People stare and ask about it; pretty embarrassing. I have lost faith in doctors completely. I've only been to one doctor about my yellow skin. He mentioned the possibility of it being drug-induced hepatitis. I loved my life, but, because of this drug, I hate my life. It didn't even help my disease. I wish my doctors had told me about the side effects and other treatment options--I found a strict diet and probiotics to be more effective than prednisone and all the other drugs combined.

1	Hives, allergic reaction	Terrible joint pain, total numbness in left hand after two days of taking it so bad is felt like burning, feeling like I am 100 years old when getting up from bed like terrible arthritis, can't sleep, heart racing, cold spells, shacking, generally feeling like I was going to die	I took this because of bad outbreak of hives for which we haven't found a couse. http://www.medications.com/effect/view/26103  Doctor never admitted that taking prednisone caused these side effects.  Would not recommend this to anyone unless this is the only drug that will keep you alive.  I felt like I couldn't walk or function at all, slept 1-2 hours a day and I only took it for 5 days at 80mg.	M	29	6  days	3/13/2008Email
1	renal transplant	DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO.  It causes hypertension and extreme depression and irritability.  Exreme insomina.  I finally had to be taken off this drug by transplant clinic because I was becoming psychotic.  I have suffered bone damage and retinal damage because of high dosages in the hospital.  Prednisone is definitely not a life style.	This is a drug from hell.	F	54	3  weeks	6/16/2007
1	lupus	My son took it and committed suicide---guess the initial euphoria turned to severe depression or psychosis. He was 23 years old	If only I had checked it out	M	23	11  days	10/15/2006Email
1	asthma flare-up	intial euphoria first couple of days, then sleeplessness, followed by severe emotional instability.	When most Docs tell you it is the worst drug on the market you should believe them.  I know it helps so many people but for me the come off is horrible.  I don't sleep and spend several days in bed crying afterward..so much so my friends had to come get me out of bed cuz I had been there nearly 2 days crying non-stop. I have had to go thru this a couple of times.	F	35	5  days	10/2/2006
2	poison ivy	Went to Fast Track (er version for not really emergencies) for poison ivy. Doc gave me 60 mgs of Prednisone for three days and then tapper down after that.After three days, I experienced, disconnectiness, confussion, moodiness, weapyness, heart palpatations, panic/anxiety.	Called family physican and she said I should have never have had that much.	F	32	2  weeks	9/29/2005

Severe anxiety, Insomnia.  Increase/Decreased Appetite.  Very easy bruising.  INSANITY.	This med has changed my life forever.  Without it I would not have my intestines.  It is horrid to take, but It has become to me as insulin is to a diabetic.  It gives me life again.  Is worth using.			15  years	7/6/2005
