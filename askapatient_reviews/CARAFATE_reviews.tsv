3	esophagitis	I felt exceptionally nauseous but it did soothe my stomach pains.. this drug is worth trying if you are experiencing stomach pains related to acid.		F	15	10  days1 g 4x	10/4/2012Email
5	Gastritis and GERD	none	I took this medication only once and it worked well. It made the nausea go away and enabled me to eat.	F	28	1  days 1X D	8/4/2012
3	Gastritis	Crushing headache, dizzy/lightheaded, brain fog, inner tremors, constipation and insomnia. Not sure which is worse...the side effects or the gastritis pain.  This worked for relieving the gastritis but I'm going to try something else. This stuff is expensive too		M	49	7  days10mg	7/30/2012
4	Indegestion , pains in stomach	None	Has worked great for my stomach pains that I guess are caused from Gastritus which the doctor seems to think I have..Hard to take 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals..other than that it works great...	M	51	7  days1 GM 3X D	3/15/2012
2	gastritis	Doc said take it, so I took it.  I never felt the gastritis.  He found it during a routine endoscopy.	Now I have stomach polyps and doc says "Oh yeah, it can do that"  Great!  Now I risk a cancer that I would not have had I not taken a drug that I didn't feel I needed.  I am off it and taking plain old baking soda before meals.  Stops acid, right?

4	Duodenal & Stomach Ulcer	Diminished mental capacity and memory.	This medication works well and allows the ulcer to heal.  BUT I just found out that it contains a HIGH CONCENTRATION OF ALUMINUM!  The only reason I started researching into this medication was because after taking this medication for 1 1/2 months, 4 times a day, my dad is now complaining of a diminished capacity in brain function and memory.  He's saying that he's becoming more "slow" and he's becoming more "forgetful".  If anyone else is considering taking this drug, please take that into consideration...the link between aluminum and alzheimer. But, in terms of the effectiveness of the medicine itself, it works really well!  It does what it's supposed to do.  But it's probably not a good idea to take this long term.  Definitely consult with your doctor regarding the potential side effects.	F	64	1  months10 ml 4X D	9/3/2011
3	ulcer	headache, neck pain, severe leg/foot cramps	doc say none of these are side effects, he should look it up.  I can't take nexium, prilosec, any of the other drugs for my ulcer & now can't take this one, either.  I'm off to trying herbs.	F	53	2  months10 mg 2X D	7/26/2011
5	C Diff, IBS	No side effects which is odd for  me!	I got C Diff somehow, was on Flagyl for on week deathly deathly sick, switched to Generic Cipro still making me sick.  Gastro Pa prescribed this for me to help keep my stomach calm to take the antiobiotics. This drug is amazing and has helped me so much. If you have never tried it I would ask for it.  Its done wonders also for my IBS.  Most ever medication I take does not like me but this one is A++	F	44	5  days1mg 4X D	7/16/2011Email
4	Gastritis Peptic ulcers	Upset stomach nausea	I have only started this drug along with pepcid (famotidine) I had a upper ENDO done and have gastritis and peptic ulcers and they first put me on prilosec and it did not work so after a ER visit cause i thought i was dying they tried this and it worked! I still have stomach pain a bit but it might be due to something else or just a side affect but its not as bad as it was!	F	28	3  days1GM 4X D	3/8/2011
5	GERD AND REFLUX	AFTER 3 MONTHS CONSTIPATION STARTED	BEEN ON 3 DIFFERENT PILLS NEXIUM, PRILOSEC, PROTONICS----CARAFATE IS WORKING MUCH BETTER	M	70	3  months10 MG 4X D	8/26/2010
5	gasritis, acid reflux	none	Feel like weeping with relief. I was in the ER with scary burning in chest and back, couldn't eat a thing, distended abdomen. They did a CAT scan ruled out any serious problems. Less than 24 hours on Carafate and Protonic I started feeling real relief that otninues now, on day 2.	F	55	2  days	10/2/2009
4	stomach ulcer	None	Unlike prilosec or zantac, this drug has had no side effects. It is gradually reducing stomach pain. I think it works well.	M	53	30  days	9/23/2009
5	Bile Reflux	None	Taking the liquid suspension is easy, not tasty, but easy. Burning pain was quelled immediately and that is all I ask for.	F	42	6  days	4/3/2009
3	esophogus	rash around the bottom lip		M	29	4  days	3/23/2009
5	esophagus ulcer from doxycycline	none	I had pain in my chest and upper back and felt an uncomfortable fullness in my upper body. I was instructed by my doctor to take OT C Priolosec for 1 week with Carafate. The symptoms were gone in a day but my doctor would like me to take the Carafate for 2 weeks	F	58	1  weeks	2/3/2009
1	ulcers	Ihad burning sensations in my stomach. This medication made my stomach pain much worse. The pain was exactly in the places where my ulcers are located. I had the chills and finally threw up. Thank God! I don't take any other medications, however I do have non Hodgkins lymphoma. My regular chemo (Rituxan) doesn't cause me this kind of problem.	Some research should be done to explore the effects of Carafate on patients with low stomach acid.	F	62	1  days	1/5/2009Email
5	gastritis	Some brief heart burn from time to time	I have to say that this is a wonderful medicine.  I have taken it on & off for over 20 years.  Doctors don't think to prescribe it much because of the newer drugs, but, it works!  I take Carafate and Nexium every day.  Suffer from gastritis, IBS, & acid reflux.	F	43	25  years	12/25/2008
5	Excess Stomach Acid - reflux	None	Worked extremely well.	M	48	3  weeks	11/1/2008
5	Reflux at night	No side effects at all.	I experienced nighttime reflux for many months. I almost choked to death several times. I was so afraid of it that I would only sleep sitting up in a chair. You can imagine what that was like along with work and caring for my child. My husband tried sleeping sitting up in the living room with me for support, but why ruin his life and career too.The GI that I was seeing tried everything and I followed every tip and guideline out there. Endoscopy showed nothing. The GI finally precribed Carafate.IT WORKED IMMEDIATELY!!! I take a two teaspoonful dose (that's all!) prior to going to bed and I sleep with a fifteen degree wedge pillow and have not experienced a single episode since. It is truly a wonder drug. My quality of life has been restored.	F	34	4  months	10/11/2008
5	Reflux	None	I was prescribed the liquid by my GI to get my out of control reflux problem under control. It is very easy to take - almost pleasant. It worked wonders! It did the trick like no other medication(s)has.	M	55	3  weeks	10/4/2008
4	Gastritis	Some dry mouth, but not bad.	It started working after the second pill. I'm still using it. Works the very best when I take just as recommended of course! Sometimes I forget, then hurt some after a meal, but works best 1 hour before eating anything! I like the cost too, not as expensive as Protonix!! Have to remember to take 4X's a day, which is difficult for me, but I feel so much better already!	F	51	2  weeks	1/24/2008
5	Stomach Ulcers/Gastric Acid	Constipation when I first started taking them.	I was on Carafate 4 times a day plus Nexium 1 time a day for bleeding stomach ulcers and gastric acid.  These pills worked very well for me and I was able to stop taking them all together.	F	35	5  months	5/10/2007
2	Gastratis	I have been on for three days and never have felt worse. I have all side effects that are listed.		F	42	3  days	4/25/2007
5	Crohn's disease	nausea, headaches	I'm taking Carafate along with many other medicines for Crohn's disease and today I'm not feeling so hot.  I'm extremely fatigued, I have nausea, chills, and stomach cramps.  I don't know if this is from the Carafate or the AciPhex (since I started both at the same time).  I currently take three to four tablets a day depending on what's needed.  The only down side is that the pills dissolve INSTANTLY and you end up swallowing a bunch of horrible tasting dissolved mush.	F	18	3  days	4/17/2007Email
5	heartburn and IBS		Started taking Carafate for heartburn. Finally something that helped. Started noticing that it also helped with IBS symptoms. Started with 4 pills a day, and am down to 1 or 2 pills a day now.	F	50	2  years	3/24/2007
5	IBS	None	This medication has eliminated (except when I forget and don't take it for a few days) the intestinal pain I suffered for years. I am supposed to take 4 tablets a day, but I have gradually reduced this to two a day, before my major meals.	F	65	7  years	11/12/2006Email
