3	Wisdom Tooth Extraction	Extreme drowsiness, awful nausea, mental confusion		F	16	1  days5/500mg 3X AN	7/11/2012Email
5	Swollen lymph nodes in stomach	Itchiness, headaches.	After a long night in the emergency room with what seemed like appendicitis (it was actually swollen lymph nodes in my stomach), I was prescribed 15 Vicodin. It gave me the most solid sleep I have ever had in my life (causing me to sleep less than usual) and I had never felt more rested. When it would wear off I would get headaches almost worse than the swollen lymph nodes that lasted an hour or so, but that negative was outweighed by how much better I felt.

4		Nausea , irritability , itching , drowsy ,euphoric feeling when I take this I feel extremely happy about random stuff. The next day I feel like I have a hangover .	Can be very addictive luckily I don't have anymore .i was prescribed this medicine after having laparoscopic surgery it gets rid of the pain pretty fast. I took the rest of the medicine to relax And to help me sleep but using Benadryl is non habit forming and more effective for sleeping. Be carefully taking this if you have a history of addiction .

1	lumpectomy	only took one tablet-- was up and down all night,hardly slept, maybe 1or 2 hours,next day hyperactive	NEVER AGAIN	F	73	1  days5mg 4X D	1/20/2011
4	neck, back and TMJ pain	skin itches, a little buzzed at times, INSOMNIA. Cannot sleep when taking these!	helps kill the pain though!!	M	38	6  months600 1X D	12/13/2010
5	Helped me COPE with reality!	Euphoria! Feel great, social, active, energized.	I was taking the highest dose (cant remember the MG's). If you could only seperate the "good stuff" from the ecetominophen, you would be "all powerful"!! The world's greatest drug! Percodane and percocet dont do it. My Mom was elderly and on it for years and she didnt mind sharing. She is dead now, and I really miss my Vic's :( I suffer from social-paranoia, depression and panic attacks. This works better than ANY SSRI's or benzodiazipines to help me cope with social situations, but no Doc on earth will give them for that reason.	M	57	2  years 2X D	9/2/2010Email
5	wisdom tooth etraction	tons of energy, very happy, no bad side effects		F	26	4  days 4X D	6/8/2010
4	Neck and back pain	I cannot take this at night due to insomnia but that's about the only side effect I've ever had.  I do not get drowsy with this medication nor do I have an nausea or vomiting.  It's a "lighter than air" feeling in my head.	I can see how people could get addicted to this drug.  It makes me very "happy" but when I took it 10 years ago for back pain, it didn't do anything at all.  No effects whatsoever. I only take it about 2 times a week at the most and will not be refilling my script for it.	F	35	5  weeks5-500 2X W	5/21/2010
5	for cramps and muscle pain	helped me sleep when i needed to sleep so just drowsy when laying down otherwise was able to function at work on it	I was put on 10-325mg first after i went through a still birth...I had very bad cramping and although it did not take the pain away completly it did help enough that was was able to sleep when i wanted and was able to work when i had to...the last time i had it was for back and stomach pain from the depo shot...it was just the 5-325mg so not as strong but still helped enough again to sleep when needed and work when needed...way beter then what i was given next (Toradol). First time i was on it for about 4 or 5 weeks the second i was on it for only 3 days	F	24	3  days	1/3/2010Email
5	Foot surgery	whole body became itchy, sleepy, relieved pain.	Made me feel woozy, high sometimes even. Best feeling! The doctor gave me 45 pills, but I only used 4 for the pain ;)	F	15	2  days	8/9/2009
4	hydrolectomy	The best hydrocodone pain reliever if it satisfies the pain for me it did at the begining but wore of fast. Simply the best	Don't have a hydrolectomy!!!	M	15	2  weeks	3/20/2009
5	yes	every side effect was awesome, after awhile you look forward to the itchies cause it means your high on vics! pk's are sick	so cool	F	18	30  days	1/8/2009
4	Cracked Wisdom Tooth	I didn't experience any negative side effects. I felt euphoric, hard to concentrate, finding pointless things to be amusing, and a slight stomach ache that went away with a piece of bread, crackers, and some water.	It did the trick. I had been suffering horrible sharp shooting pains attributed to a cracked and exposed wisdom tooth. The pains were so bad that I would sweat and almost pass out. The vicodin did the trick, and other than what I listed as the couple small side effects, the pain went from horrible to nothing.	M	26	10  days	12/15/2008
4	BACK PAIN AFTER ACCIDENT	A LITTLE CONFUSED, VISION BLURRY, AND MILD EUPHORIA, INSOMNIA	THIS MEDICINE IS PRETTY GOOD, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MEDICINE OVER PERCOSET. HELPED THE BACK SPASMS I HAD IN MY BACK!	F	31	1  days	10/16/2008
5	for pleasure	A few times were bad, but soon enough my body became very tolorent to it. DO NOT take this medicine on an empty stomache(obviously) and do not snort if not absolutely needed. taking this medicine too much for pleasure (expecially snorting) may cuz the bones in the back of your neck to warp. yee not fun!. be careful everyone!!		F	14	 	7/11/2008
1	Chronic back pain	Sleepy, dry mouth, headaches.	Made me hyper and very, very sad. I felt like I was having a breakdown. I would cry for an hour straight for the smallest reasons. It didn't help with my pain at all.	F	50	2  months	6/10/2008
5	Pulmonary embolism	None.  It was a terrific pain killer with no down sides for me	I took the 10/500 tablets.  I needed two to kill the pain enough to sleep in the hospital and for the first three weeks or so after I got out.  Also took one occasionally during the day the first couple of weeks to deal with pain.  As the clot has started to dissolve, I have now gone two weeks without taking any in the day, and five nights in a row without any to sleep.  My spouse gets insomnia if she takes it at night, but I have not had that effect.  I don't get any euphoria from it, so I'm not worried about addiction.  It's the best pain reliever I've ever had; since I'm on coumadin, I can't take aspirin or ibuprofen, so this is great.	M	62	30  days	5/30/2008Email
5	gallblader surgery	itchy hands and feet		F	35	9  days	4/22/2008Email
5	ruptured and bulging disc's	In the very beginning I experienced insomnia probably a couple times.Other than that felt great three kids not much sleep and I can cope.I have been on and off them for 4 years.With every pregancy my pain got worse and worse.So after my last son it was the worst.So now faithfully for 2 years I have been on them.	I am tryimg to come off them now I was up to five a day at the worst pain of my life.Now I really want off its been along time I've been on them.I had surgery 8 months ago for the problem.I still have pain but I feel I can cope with out this.I find strength with the lord that I can get through this with him by my side.I am down to 2 a day with 1/2 a bottle left and no intentions to refill the other script.Please let me know of any side effects I with be faced with.Also pray for me Thanks	F	30	4  days	2/14/2008Email
4	Wisdom extraction - all 4 impacted	Nothing too bad, if I were relaxing and lying down, it would knock me out, but I also took it while I was at work, and it didn't make me drowsy.	Really helped with the pain; almost too well, as I could feel the pain coming back the second it started to wear off. I also decided to take one when I got a migraine and it actually helped.. it didn't get rid of it, but it felt better. Keep in mind almost NOTHING helps my headaches.. so the fact that this did help somewhat, was great.	F	23	7  days	2/12/2008
2	Tooth pain	Anxiety, panic attacks, hives, flushing (rash?)	I have pre-existing anxiety, but Vicodin puts me over the edge and sends me into a panic attack a few minutes after taking it.  So I would advise others with anxiety/depression issues to look into other options.After taking it a few times I began developing a few stray hives on arms, hands, legs, face.  It only helped with the pain for a very short period of time, about 30 minutes (and doctor directed to take once every 6 hours!).  I switched to Percocet instead, problem solved.	F	22	5  days	12/29/2007
4	Endometriosis	Extreme itchiness, but no hives or anything.	Didn't work all that great for my pain, but it did offer some relief. I haven't felt "high" or anything like that.	F	41	2  days	12/6/2007Email
4	root canal, gum surgery	mild nausea, talkativeness, euphoria, constipation, hemmorhoids	Vicodin is very good for pain after root canal. I've had two prescriptions and the dentist both time overprescribed; all I really needed was 6 or so and both times they gave me 30. Both times I went through the scripts, sometimes for legitimate reason ( occassional mouth pain) but usually to get euphoria. The first time I got constipated at end of run & came down with hemmorhoids. So the second time I was more careful and took them ocassionally.When the script ran out, I had no desire to obtain more (or look for some scag, which is pretty similar!) because I'm very aware of addiction potential.You know the second time I said, "all I need is several" to get through two days after surgery, but he gave me 30 anyhow!	M	55	30  days	8/31/2007
1	Ear infection	Nausea, didn't take any pain away.	I think it made my infection worse.  Stopped taking it after 2 days.	F	27	2  days	7/31/2007
4	fractured wrist	I felt somewhat drowsy, very constipated (rare for me), relaxed.	minimized the pain.  I  suggest you drink water and stay away from alcohol (can really damage your liver).  I didn't feel addicted, maybe because I only took it for 3 days.	F	33	3  days	4/30/2007

4						 	9/28/2006
3	Herniated discs in back	I have thrown up a few times and experienced nausea from this drug but I LOVE vicodin... a lot... too much.. my dosage continues to increase	It really helps with my pain.  It is kind of scary though because I have noticed myself freaking out if I am getting low on my meds.  very very very addictive.	F	22	6  months	5/11/2006
2	dental (tooth extraction)	nasua, dry mouth, dizziness	Nasua is NOT a good side effect after dental surgery. I had to stop taking it.	F	59	1  days	3/11/2006
4	back surgery and related pain	sense of well being , talkative,  headaches, probably contributes to increased inability to sleep well.	currently reducing amount of vicodin, hope to eliminate altogether.	F	64	18  months	8/10/2005
1	Broken Shoulder	I felt angry and agitated.  Could not sleep.	This drug did nothing for my shoulder pain and made me want to grind my teeth.  I have no idea how anyone could get addicted to feeling angry and to the sleeplessness.  There are many better pain killers than this.	F	32	12  days	6/22/2005
1	it was a test	itching, itching, itching  NOTHING ELSE!!!	i dont know why it didnt affect me at all besides giving me a bad case of the itches.  i took two in about 2 hrs...  i felt no euphoria, tiredness, dizziness, nausea, nothing but itching horrendously.  i seem to need a lot more pain medication before im affected though i have a high pain tolerance and i am not usually affected by any drugs but alcohol.  i get no high off of anything else and dont understand why i dont.
