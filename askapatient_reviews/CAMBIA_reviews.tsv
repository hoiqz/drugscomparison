2	Migraine	Tastes gross -- heavy mint flavor. Felt like it was burning my esophagus all the way down, then dry heaves once it hit my stomach. But it didn't make me actually vomit, and the burning sensation went away quickly.	Was prescribed Cambia as a backup to Maxalt, since triptans can be taken only 2 days/week. Unfortunately, it didn't work at all on my migraines, so I'll continue to look for something else as a backup.	F	47	 50 mg 1X AN	11/14/2012
5	migraines	Once I had bad nausea due to taking it on an empty stomach. Also causes bleeding problems.	Stops migraine immediately when taken early on when all others didn't. If I wait I have to take two doses. Easy to take - a powder in a small amount of water. It is an anti-inflammatory, not a hypnotic. My insurance only pays for 4 doses a month, less than I need, and paying for it without insurance is too expensive.	F	62	1  years50 mg 1X AN	5/24/2012
