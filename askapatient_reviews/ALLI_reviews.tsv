1	Weight loss	Orange oily discharge when you use the restroom that smells horrible. Gas and bloating. Cannot eat any fat or discharge is worse.	Took 2 month supply and lost no weight. Complete waste of money.	F	23	2  months	8/27/2009
5	Weight loss	Occasional oily discharge, you need to clean your toilet everyday, wear a maxipad in case of leakage, stay away from white shorts or pants just in case..	Lost about 20 lbs in 9 months. It works slowly..I just recently added exercise because the weight loss seemed to plateau. I really have not made any dietary changes other than being a little more careful with the fat content in my meals. You will learn how to adjust your schedule and eating habits somewhat. Going out to eat can be tuff, stay close to home..I just wish the pills were cheaper, but I will continue to use because I like the results..		43	9  months	4/20/2009
4	to loose 15-20 lbs	I have not really experienced ANY side effects, except that one day when I had a couple bites of cheesecake!  If you eat right on this, then you are not going to have ANY problems and it will do it's job.  You need to follow the directions and take at least 3 pills a day (not 2).  Eat right and excercise...it works!  I have been on this for only 2 weeks, but I can feel my clothes getting loose.  I am not going to weigh myself until I am on this for ONE MONTH.  I KNOW I will be excited on that day!	Follow the directions!  If you eat fat foods, you will experience side affects...if you eat well, like you should...you will be fine. The gold of this program is to start you eating and excercising right for LIFE.  Thanks for reading.	F	43	2  weeks	1/5/2009
5	to lose weight	this medication will give you diarrhea.  but unlike the others on this site, i only take when i eat a high fat meal.  to me, there is no point wasting the expensive alli when i havent eaten any fat.  so i know what the side effect will be and prepare for it.	alli absorbs 20% of the fat you eat.  to me, if i eat a meal with almost no fat it in, it is not worth wasting the pill, for 20-30 calories.  i take it when i eat a salad (fat in the dressing) or a steak (fat in the meat) or give in and eat a cookie.  then i know about an hour later, i will have to go to the bathroom, and i will see 20% of the fat i just ate in the toilet as oil. it doesnt help me lose weight, so much as preventing me from gaining.

4	MILD Weight Loss	I have not experienced ANY side effects.  The point of this product is to eat healthly while on it.  If you eat high fat (i.e. macdonalds, Wendys), then there is no doubt that you will experience side effects.  I have only been taking this for one week.  I only want to loose about 15 pounds, and I am not overweight BUT I needed a jump start because I have hit a plateau...and can't loose...so, because I am not "technically" overweight...I only take two caplets during the day instead of the recommend three.  My weigh in is tomorrow, and I know that I have lost something...I can feel it in my clothes!	Please remember to eat well on this medication...or you will experience side effects.  On the otherhand, DON'T be afraid to take this medication BECAUSE you are worried about the side effects.  Eat well, follow the directions...and you'll very likely be just fine on this!  Thanks for reading.		42	1  weeks	6/13/2008
4	WEIGHTLOSS	MILD GAS, SOME OILY STOOLS	I've not taken this for very long but so far I only notice side effects when I eat a high fat meal.	F	33	7  days	2/21/2008
4	Weight Loss Help	The only side effects I have experienced with Alli is gas. I have not experienced any 'treatment effects" (loose stools or oily discharge) since I keep my fat grams under 15 per meal. It sure does make you eat right!  No cheating here.	It helps me lose about 2 pounds per week and so far I have lost 16 pounds in about 7 weeks.	F	51	7  weeks	1/17/2008
