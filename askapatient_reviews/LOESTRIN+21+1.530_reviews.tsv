5	Birth Control; Hormone Replacement	Skin stays clear; No mood swings; No periods; Slows regrowth of uterine fibroids; Quality of life improved with amenorrhea due to the absence of ugly abdominal/lower back cramping & heavy periods.	Great med!  The worst time of my life was when I was off LoEstrin during fertility treatment: I gained weight; the fibroids grew back after 1 year instead of after 3+ years; my menstrual periods were heavy to the point of being debilitating; and I was close to insane due to the mood swings.  I'll stay on LoEstrin as long as my GYN & Endocrinologist allow me to do so.	F	49	33  years1.5/30 1X D	2/20/2012Email

2	fibrocystic breast disease	Experienced increased breast tenderness and reoccuring yeast infections. I frequently urinate and feel bloated. However, I do have more energy being on a "very low estrogen" BC.	I am not satisfied with this medicine. I am tired of having yeast infections.	F	32	2  months	7/8/2006
