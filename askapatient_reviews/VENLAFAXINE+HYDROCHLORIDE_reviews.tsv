4	Depressive anxiety	I've been taking the generic (Venlafaxine EG) and it has helped allright to overcome my anxiety disorder. To be noted that the withdrawal effects are quite severe: I once forgot to take it with me for a week away and I had constant nightmares and strong dizziness during the day. Even with a long and careful phasing out (from 150 to 75 mg, and then to 37,5 mg), after I finally stopped taking it  I had occasional nightmares for ten days.

2	Anxiety & Panic Attacks	Daily headaches and severe stomach pains	I switched to the generic to save some $$$ but quickly found out after almost 2 weeks that I have been having daily headaches and severe stomach pains.  I can only conclude that it is from switching to generic.  I will go back to the brand name when this script runs out and see if that cures my problem.	M	30	2  weeks75 1X D	8/30/2010
