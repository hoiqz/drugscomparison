4	Psoriatic and Rheumatoid Arthritis	After being on this drug for many years I developed a mysterious and severe staph infection in my cervical spine, threatening paralysis.   Doctors couldn't figure out what was going on and did emergency surgery and biopsy.  Several disc fusions and months on antibiotic fusions, doctors took me off Enbrel, thinking lowered immunity led to staph infection.    Was off for two years and tried methotrexate.  That was horrible and eventually went back to Enbrel.  Seem to get every cold, virus, and sinus infection possible.  Resistant to antibiotics.	Began this drug many years ago off label before approved.  Even with serious complications, being on Enbrel has allowed me to live relatively pain free and function almost normally.  Didn't really control the psoriasis though.	F	58	15  years50mg 1X W	3/19/2013Email

3	RA	I was nearly a cripple, prednisone alone not working, then I took one shot of Enbrel and it started working.  Now the 2nd week I got a headache, but maybe it's from the pneumoccal vaccine I had to take.   Will see what happens at next shot.	Enbrel took away the swollen hands, wrists, ankles, knees.  I still have pain under my left foot however.  Most of the fatigue is gone.	F	62	2  weeks50 mg 1X W	1/8/2013Email
5	Rheumatoid Arthritis	None now, in the beginning I was fatigued the day after the injection.	This medicine really helped me. I went from barely being able to walk (knee inflammation) or use my left arm (shoulder inflammation) for weeks at a time to riding my bike over 3,500 miles this year. I am able to exercise regularly including and live a normal life. After 18 months on the medicine I am thrilled with it. However, I am concerned about potential long-term side effects and continue to monitor other people's experiences with the drug.	M	54	1.5  years50MG 1X W	12/15/2012Email
5	Psoratic Arthritis/Psoriasis	No side effects, except tired sometimes	It has been great, could not open my hands in morning until hot shower. Nails were all pitted. Feel great now and can grab and hold things with my hands. It has been wonderful.	M	52	3  years50 MG 2X W	12/12/2012Email
5	Psoriatic Arthris	Occasional injection site reaction.  Fatigue the day after.  One episode of cellulitis.	This drug has been a miracle, when first diagnosed with P.A. I had just turned thirty and within three months of my first symptoms I had lost all my nails (hands and feet) and was so sore I could barely leave my bed. Without enbrel I truly don't know where I would be.	M	35	5  years 1X W	12/4/2012
2	mild Psoriasis	my mild psoriasis has worsen and become plaque psoriasis with red patches and itching. I only have psp in my legs	Nedd help...should I stop its usage? will these symptoms go away?	F	52	5  weeks50 mg 2X W	11/16/2012Email
4	psoriatic arthritis	feel pretty good, still concerned about some side effects. Especially heart problems, haven't had any yet.I do have tingling in feet on waking in morning. Lots of sinus congestion problems, but I do also have allergies which goes along with this problem. Also was recently tested for vit. D and was low 26, but I had been taking 3000 ius a day. Don't know whyit's so low Iv'e been prescrobbed 50,000 ius for 8 weeks. Drs say it's not from the enbrel. Also been having wrist pain. Do get flu symptoms alot and headaches.	If anyone knows of the vit. D problem	F	62	8  years25mg 2X W	11/2/2012
5	Behcets Syndrome	Have experienced some headaches which I wasn't getting before but other than that, nothing.	I had a lot of symptoms with BS. Extremely swollen knee, elbow and wrist. Painful pustules on thighs and chest and very spotty generally. Uveitis (eye disorder) every few months. Severe lethargy when having an episode. After taking Enbrel, I noticed a significant improvement within 3 days. 1 year on I'm in perfect health and able to resume a normal life.	M	42	1  years50 MG 1X W	8/28/2012
5	Pusular Psoriasis	I have suffered from Pusular Psoriasis from I was 5 years old & the injection has really helped me, no side effects apart from brusing & redness sometimes at injection site. I am also on the methotrexate for 7 years & that would make me sick but now I have clear skin!!		F	15	4  years50MG	8/24/2012Email
4	Psoriatic Arthritis	Bruising and puffiness at injection site, headaches, moodiness, fatigue. On the positive side I can actually move around and be active for the first time in years. I can go out dancing again, camping and keep up with my five year old. Enbrel has definitely changed my life for the better.		F	30	2  months50	8/22/2012Email
5	Psoriasis	Slight bruising around injection sight.It has been an awesome med for me I had been fighting psoriasis since I was 7 years old. 2 injections a week well worth it. 		M	44	3  years2 x 30mg	8/14/2012
3	RA	Except for an occasional red area at the injection site I had no side effects until a yr ago.  They found I had a reduced ejection fraction, 35%,  (cardiac myopathy).  There is a possibility that this was caused by the Enbrel.  I have now stopped this medication.	I also take methotrexate which is my drug of choice, it works wonderful. Enbrel afforded some help but I can't do without methotrexate.	F	65	6  years30mg 1X W	6/6/2012
5	RA	No side effects. I take one dose of enbrel once a week, every six weeks. I try to take as little as possible. Usually, I begin to feel my RA during the end of my fifth week. Also, I stopped eating foods that contain arachidonic acid, which is a precursor to inflammation. This acid  usually found in red meats and egg yolk.  When not taking Enbrel, most of my joints are inflamed beyond belief. I absolutely love Enbrel!		F	41	3  years25mg	6/3/2012Email
5	Psoriatic Arthritis	stomach Abscess, infected injection points, weight gain, extremely high LFT	Enbrel saved my life psororitic arthritis wise.  I yo-yo on and off meds. due to health issues from drug- Liver function results high, so hosp take me off meds. With Enbrel I work a normal day but within two weeks of coming off I am in a wheelchair and unable to work. Frightened loosing my job will mean loss of my independance.  I want to work so if staying on Embrel means I can, I fight to stay on it.   On the other hand, staying on it is not good for my body, I'm scarred of long term effects.  Feel I walk a very thin line. Don't lead the exciting life of a 24 year old because of my illness even with the drug.  Go through my day waiting to get home from work and go to bed.  Would I recommend it, yes I had immediate results, but as an old school rhemy consultant told me, its not a cure, it just masks the symptoms, so you still have to be careful what you do or you could cause damage to your joints. I however would any day take a few years of good pain free mobility rather than the alternative.  Drug wise I am at the end of the line as all the other alternatives do not work for me.	M	24	3  years50mg 1X W	6/1/2012
5	JRA	None	Worked amazingly fast.  Grandson went from nearly crippled to running full out in a matter of days.  He has JRA in both knees, one wrist, started when he was 3.  Had already been through cortisone shots and steroids, steroids had nasty side effects (primarily no growth and dental issues).  Enbrel is great compared to that.  He got used to the shot in no time.	M	6	6  months 1X W	5/9/2012Email
4	RA	BRUISING AROUND INJECTION AREA	ENBREL HAS HELPED ME A LOT I WENT FROM A WHEELCHAIR TO BEING ABLE TO WALK ON MY OWN WITHOUT ANY HELP OF ANYONE OR EVEN A CANE. I DO RECOMMEND THIS MEDICATION TO EVERYONE THAT GOES THROUGH THE PAIN OF ARTHRITIS. ONE THING I DO HATE IS THE STING IT GIVES BUT THEN AGAIN WHAT IS 15 SECOND VS BEING IN PAIN 24/7	F	24	3  months50 MG 1X W	5/7/2012Email
5	psoriatic arthritis	unbalanced , very intense pain in back, very intense neck pain, always tired, deppression, hard to get around	ENBREL WORKS 100% , but dont have enough to pay for it.	M	52	 50 1X W	4/15/2012Email
5	RA	Slight bruising if I hit a vein, lasts 4-5 days. Very slight lightening of skin at injection site, lasted 4-5 days.	I had RA symptoms as early as October 2011, I was diagnosed Feb 2012. My symptoms aren't severe but I have noticed since the Enbrel I have more energy and my wrist is more functional but that could be because of the prednisone. Sometimes the shot hurt, sometimes it doesn't as much. I'm good with pain but it is impossible not to scream "OWWWWW" for the duration of the shot but it gets easier to take as you already know what you're in for! I recommend this drug!	F	27	4  weeks50mg 1X W	4/4/2012
3	JRA	Bleeding, bruising, swollen lymph nodes, very weakened immune system, redness, swelling and fatigue		F	17	4  years50 MG	3/31/2012Email
4	AS	So far  I have no side effects	I felt improvement from first week I had taken enbrel , now I feel almost 80% of my pain is gone	M	66	7  months50 mg 1X W	3/20/2012Email
4	PA, possible fibromialgia	sore, red raised injection sites. injected cold, warm, room temp. no diff. some times severe colds, upper chest,pneumnia conjuction with other med shots, flu or h1n1 shots. worse when others around me are sick pick up different stains of bugs, not severe.	i have been off enbrel one time for over a year due to it stopped working. first injection i felt great after 3 days, for 3 years. stopped  it, felt like i was run over, went back on and a few weeks later felt ok. agian joints upper and lower and muscles flare up and i am just exhuasted some days.still am after 5 years, benidrel was stated to me of 20ml before injection to help with inflammation of injections..	M	49	5  years50ml 1X W	2/19/2012Email
4	Ankylosing Spondylitis	Big Red Bump, Bruising, The meds. Burn when being injected	I was diagnosed with AS and Chondrolysis about a year ago I was so stiff in my hip I could barely Walk. I missed a lot of school and I was miserable. Now enbrel has worked wonders. I am actually running a 5k in June!	F	14	1  years50 MG 1X W	2/8/2012Email
5	Psoriasis and Psoriatic arthritis	Virtually no side effects since starting Enbrel	PA has improved dramatically.  I cannot imagine going back to the way I felt prior to Enbrel.  I was taking Arava and had some success but my Rheumatologist thought I could do better with Enbrel and he was certainly right.  However, it has not helped my psorasis at all. I have experienced none of the side effects others have mentioned. This has been a life changing drug	F	63	7  years25 mg 2X W	2/1/2012Email
4	Severe Psoriasis	Occasional burning during injection, fatigue the day after (although this went away after I took it for a while).	I was about 75% covered with Psoriasis and Enbrel cleared it to about 5%. Effectiveness started to wane after about a year, but still kept psoriasis at bay. Try only to inject it into your thighs. I tried injecting it into my lower abdomen as demonstrated on the diagram and I found it wasn't as effective. Also, make sure you get the bloodwork done to check your liver because Enbrel can damage it. Mine is fine thus far, but I'm keeping an eye on it. Otherwise, great drug! After my skin was cleared I felt like a new person and my confidence went way up. :)	F	23	1  years50mg 2X W	1/29/2012
5	rheumatoid arthritis	none	this is a wonderful drug after 1 injection I was able to close my hands almost fully without pain, my feet were not as swollen, I could also almost bend my toes and my ankles didn't feel as though there was bone on bone rubbing together, this is an amazing drug and highly reommend it drug and recommend it to anyone who thinks that there is no hope	F	54	2  times50 mg 1X W	1/17/2012
4	reactive Arthritis	I have an injection site reaction, very large area of redness, firmness, warmth and itching. tried heat and ice without much relief, Also more frequent headaches and nausea	all my pain went away 2 days after the first shot!!!	F	34	3  weeks50 mg 1X W	12/22/2011Email
4	ankylosing spondylitis	Occasional numbness in leg (whichever one I inject it into). Had injection site reaction until switched from auto-injector to pre-filled syringes.	I'm still young 20s, and this drug has helped me regain much mobility and energy. Though, I am worried about the long term health issues with this being a newer medication.

5	Ankylosing Spondylitis			M	35	 50mg 1X D	12/12/2011EmailHistory
5	Psoratic Arthritis and psorisis	From time to time a get a fever the day after my dosage for 1 day.	I have been taking enbrel for 6 years and I am not showing anysigns of PA. My psorisis cleared up almost immediately, however after 6 years some has come back, however, not the levels I had before.	M	45	6  years50mg 1X W	12/10/2011Email
5	Psoratic Arthritis	Auto-Injector=injection side reaction BUT did not have with pre-filled syringe. Found injection less burning feeling if not quite room temp. Leave out for only 4-5 minutes then inject.	Has really really helped me. However, dr said most his patients only have 50mg one time week. But on the 4th day, I start feeling pain again, in hands and feet and fatigue. So he increased it to 50 mg twice a week.	F	28	1  years50 mg 2X W	12/7/2011Email
5	RA	Occasional injection site redness and pain. Intermittent hives. Maybe coincidental but 7 surgeries in the last 12 months for basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer. Intermittent dry skin.	I will take all of the side effects rather than change from Enbrel. It has been a life changing drug allowing me to live a full and active life. RA had started to attack my lungs and this drug stopped it dead in its tracks.	M	65	18  months50mg 1X W	11/29/2011
5	RA	None	I am a performing violinist and almost went on disability 10 years ago. Enbrel has literally saved my career allowing me to perform several hundred concerts and record a number of CD's. It has been a total life saver for me!	M	64	9  years25 MG 2X W	11/14/2011Email
5	Moderate psoriasis	Not really a side effect but I noticed its better to do the injection at night, instead of the morning, or I'd feel a little drowsy during the day. Injecting at night has taken care of that.	I was scared to death to get on this medication because of the reported risks and side effects. I finally got to the point that I couldn't take it anymore and saw my dermatologist. I couldn't be happier that I did! I cleared almost 100% within 2-3 weeks of starting this medication. It has literally been a miracle for me! The sure-click auto injectors are really easy to use. The medicine burns while it is going in, for 10-15 seconds, then it's done & the pain goes away. I highly recommend this medication if you're fed up with your psoriasis.	F	28	5  months50mg 1X W	11/4/2011
3	AS	None	I'm a young mum with two kids aged 3 and 16 month, I'm in alot of pain with AS and cannot take anything else due to long term liver and kidney problems so my doc has suggested this. I'm not sure what to do as I'm absolutely terrified of the side effects but also want to live my life and enjoy my kids! Anyone with any advice would be much appreciated	F	32	0  days30 1X D	10/31/2011EmailHistory
5	RMA and severe psoriasis	None	I use the 50 miligram sureclick. I leave it out for 10 to 15 minutes to get too room temp and alternate injections in my thighs. I agree with one of the previous posters about taking supplements and exercising while on  this medication. I worry about long term side affects but it's cleared psoriasis that covered about 40% of my body. I had plaque psoriasis on the soles of my feet and it was at times painful and itchy. I take milk thistle to help support liver function. You need to keep a close eye on your bloodwork. I seriously think the doctors get incentives for prescribing this but it's made a big difference in my life and I dread the thought of how bad it will be if I discontinue the Enbrel. Some patients do not need to take it weekly so you might want to review that with your doctor. I seem to be best off taking it weekly.	M	54	2  years 1X W	10/25/2011
5	Ankylosing Spondylitis	NO side effects	I was in an extreme amount of pain from the inflammation in my joints as well as aches throughout my body. After Enbrel, it just about all went quickly. Recently, i've had a constant stiff neck and shoulders which is from my condition. Still, I'll take that after what I had previously been through.  I've rcently had an insurance screwup and haven't been able to refill for the past 3 weeks. Strangely enough I havent had any relapse since going temporarily off it. I'm wondering if anyone else has had the same experience	M	50	4  months50mg 1X W	10/24/2011Email
4	RA	Horrible itchy rash for 1 year, 'white matter on the brain, lost periods of time, vision abnormalities.  I am going through test to determine if I have MS.  Enbrel was great until it side effects hit me like a bomb.		F	59	10  years50mg 1X W	10/12/2011Email
3		I take Enbrel for Psoriasis, which is about 80% clear.  I was able to somewhat enjoy my summer for once since my skin was clearer than it had been in 30 years.  but....my body hurts all over.  Arms, hands, legs and feet keep "falling asleep" (pins and needles feeling).  This has been going on for over 2 weeks.  I have an all over uncomfortable feeling in my body that keeps me awake at night.  I am very nervous about this drug.  One doctor pushes the drug and another said I am poisoning my body.	I am trying to weigh the benefits vs the risks and I'm not sure clear skin is going to win over having my life and my health.  Has anyone stopped the drug for a while and then continued it again?  Or has anyone spaced the injections out over more time vs. once weekly?	F	44	5  months50 MG 1X W	9/29/2011Email
3	RA	1st and 2nd weeks had no side effects, 3rd time hot red knot appeared at injection site. 4 week the spot was twice the size of the first time. so thats why I am reading and checkin this out.	I starting taking Embril 4 weeks ago, after manys years of different meds from plaquenil, methotexate, leuflumide, and alot of predisone. All of which worked for a while or I was allergic to. I do feel much better in the last four weeks and have alot of hope my pain will continue to lessen and side effects will get less. I am a L&D nurse and need my body to be at its best. I have not been able to exercise, have gained alot of weight from using prednisone. I want my life back. I have read all the comments and will try some things to ease the injection site problems, but I have to say if the medication works as well for me as for most of the people I have read, I CAN DEAL WITH THAT PAIN at the injection site.   will post as I go.	F	52	4  weeks50 1X W	9/25/2011Email
5	palindromic rheumatoid arthritis	None	It has made the difference between walking and not walking	M	52	5  years50mg 1X W	9/18/2011Email
5	Psoriatic Arthritis and Psoriasis	Since starting on Enbrel, I have had two bouts of cellulitis, one of which hospitalized me for a week on IV antibiotics. May have been Enbrel related.  Colds seem to last a bit longer but are not more frequent and I have frequent nasal irritation and occasional congestion.	The medication changed my life. Before Enbrel I was in constant pain and was partly disabled. Since taking Enbrel I have become fully active, very athletic for my age and my skin problems have almost resolved. Arthritis pain comes and goes but is really a minor burden, So for me the drug is effective. Safe? Meh. Bottom line is that this drug has some rare but horrific potential side effects. It's as scary as a war. But what are the alternatives? Something is going to kill you one day and if you're already middle aged or older I think the risk reward formula favors Enbrel as long as it works.	M	51	5  years25mg 2X W	9/16/2011
4	Psoriatic Arthritis	No real side effects to note other than hardess, rash, or bruising at injection site.	So far the Enbrel has helped the only noticeable relief is in my kness (still can't run yet) and in my spine.	M	25	7  weeks50 MG 1X W	9/8/2011Email
1	Psoriasis & PA	Reasonable abatement of P & PA symptoms for first 2 yrs. Then increasing number of low-grade infections, and return of P & PA symptoms. By year 4, permanently compromised immune system; pre-MS brain lesions; antibiotic-resistant infection that resulted in 6 organ failures & subsequent resections.	TNFs are dangerous. P & PA already weaken your auto-immune response. TNFs exacerbate this. Enbrel nearly killed me, and I was hyper-vigilant in monitoring my use/suspended use at the 1st sign of cold, flu, etc. With no warning and having suspended use at onset of simple cold, I was in ER within 12 hrs undergoing multiple surgeries to stave off a lethal staph-caused peritonitis. I lost SIX organs! Team of surgeons/doctors from 2 nationally prominent hospital systems all concurred that infection would have been easily managed, BUT Enbrel had weakened my immune response to such a devastating extent that the infection could run rampant. I stopped taking Enbrel in 2008; by 2009 MRIs showed pre-MS brain lesions; by last year, labs shows pre-lymphoma. Docs still say Enbrel to blame. I WAS BIONICALLY AND GENETICALLY HEALTHY until I took this medication. Advice: get full blood workups 2-4 times/year (including TB, CBC, CRP) at very minimum and be fully aware of long-term risks. Most asymptomatic patients do not have longitudinal data beyond 1-2 years of use.	F	50	4  years50mg 1X W	8/31/2011
5	RA	No side effects to speak of. Occasionally there is slight redness at injection site.	Enbrel changed my life 180 degrees! I love it. I was previously taking Methotrexate and Relafen with some Prednisone at times. I was tired, had pain and generally felt bad. I told my Dr. that I wanted to feel better and he put me on Enbrel. Within 2 months I could run, had no pain and had more energy than I could remember and finally had my life back! Enbrel saved my life. I wish that it was available when I was first diagnosed 20 years ago.	F	57	9  years25mg 2X W	8/24/2011
1	Psoriasis and Psoriatic athritis	Lung infection that almost killed me. Resistant to three different antibiotics. Caught every bug while on this "drug" lowers immune system and open you up to the world.	Your milage may vary but for me it did nothing for the psoriasis but it did help with the arthritis - until it almost killed me with infection. I still got a souvenir - scar tissue in lung. Thank you Enbrel!	M	40	6  months50 1X W	8/12/2011
4	Psoriatic arthritis	some insomnia, some fatigue, numbness and tingles, and painful injection	talked to my doc about the numbness and tingles, she said to give it another try.  Worked really well for the psoriasis and helping with arthritis pain.	F	31	2  weeks50mg 1X W	7/24/2011Email
4	Spondyloarthritis	I started using the Enbrel Autoinjectors 10 weeks ago per request on my rheomatologist. I was diagnosed with Spondyloarthritis at the age of 14, and the pain became so bad I was stuck in bed for weeks at a time. Within the first week after taking Enbrel, I was able to walk normally, and even start running again. Around my 3rd week, I began Redlighting for my skin, and I would instantly get a large almost welt-like reation around my injection site if I would redlight the day of or day after my injection. If I didn't redlight, I would only get a little itching around my injection site and the occasional warm, red spot, which could become the size of a baseball or larger. Mixing the injection site with heat isn't recommended, because that is what set off my reactions. Other than that, the product works extremely well for pain.	I missed a dose one week when my shipment was not recieved, and I noticed that my skin became increasingly oily and acne spots starting appearing. Two days after I got back on my normal schedule, it all went away. Skipping injections isn't recommended. Although your pain stays away, your skin will become very oily.	F	15	10  weeks50 MG 1X W	7/4/2011
4	RA	I have been taking enbrel for about a year and it had greatly improved my ra symptoms.  However, I have noticed my hair is thinning... which never concerned me until I started really noticing :(  I love my hair.  It REALLY is not a good trade off. especially for a woman.  Also, I have stopped taking it on occassion for a week or 2 for various reasons and notice I breakout in my face :(  Don't miss your doses if this happens to you.  Once I take it regularly again, my face clears up.		F	39	1  years 1X W	6/28/2011Email
2	RA	injection site reactions that got worse every time i took the shot. started as a small red hot and itchy spot. eventually got to be the size and shape of a flattened nerf ball, just stayed very hot itchy and painful. had to switch to humira	really did great with the RA. no side effects except the injection site reaction	F	52	2  monthsinjection 1X W	5/26/2011
5	RA	I was hurting all the time in my neck, back, knees, ankles, and legs.	I was hurting all the time and i could not dare go exercising. Now that i am taking enbrel, i am able to exercise and do a lot of other things that i could not do any more. I LOVE THIS DRUG!	F	40	4  months15 mg 1X W	5/24/2011Email
5	Psoriasis	I didn't have any side effects at first - 3 weeks into taking the drug I started getting injection site reactions. Those went away and now I have been getting nausea and diarrhea after every meal - this has been continuing for a week now.	I would like to say that although I have been getting some side effects, this drug has been a blessing. I was 70% covered with plaque, guttate, inverse, and scalp psoriasis and now I have may 5% coverage. I will take the nausea over the pain of psoriasis anyday.	F	26	9  weeks50 MG 2X W	5/23/2011Email
5	RA	I have been taking Enbrel for 6 years. No bad side effects at all. I have lots more energy and no pain since taking Enbrel. I was practically bed bound before taking it. I now work full time as a nurse and live a full and active life (jogging 3 times a week) I rarely get flareups and when i do it is nothing like the pain i experienced previous to taking Enbrel. I've had 3 flareups in 6 years and each episode lasted 3/4 days. The injection site has never caused me any discomfort or pain and is never irritated by the drug.	In my own personal experience Enbrel is a wonder drug. I feel very lucky!	F	32	 50mg 1X W	5/19/2011Email
4	RA	Had been on Enbrel for 4 months in 2001. Too many sinus infections, but I had plenty entergy and no pain. Started again in 2007. Got sick with a cough and sinus again. Now 2011 1st injection since 07 and my whole body is itching the heck out of me. Is this a new side affect? Never had it before. Have had RA for 11 years now.		F	59	1  days 1X W	4/29/2011Email

1	Psoriasis/Psoriatic Arthritis	I have used Enbrel 3 times in the last couple years and just stopped the third round of shots. The first time I cleared from 30% coverage in 6 weeks with no side effects or pain. I was off after I cleared for 6 months and started to bloom really bad and arthritis started back. Took it again for 12 weeks and although it took longer I cleared but not below the knees. Pain was relieved. I got covered by insurance again and 10 weeks ago I started back on it. This time It was as if I was injecting water! My Psoriasis slowed its spread some but I did not clear any. I have also gotten sick 3 times and had sore throats when usually I never get sick or can remember a sore throat before. I also noticed three 9mm spots and two 1 inch long hard areas that looked like Psoriasis but felt like warts do. My Dermatologist said they were harmless and were I believe she called them Keratosis. They are very hard and just like a plantars wart. The thing is, I never have had that before. Not 100% sure Enbre	Like I said, the third time I started Enbrel I got no benefit at all from it. When not on it I  was the only person in the house that NEVER got sick when all the rest did. While on Enbrel the 3rd time I was sick more than not. This time if anyone in the home had a cold or virus, I got it also. My young daughter was on it at the same times for the same reasons except for the last round. I will not let her take it again after reading the real possibility of M.S. and other diseases. Some doctors would not take it. This medication lowers your bodies ability to kill cancer cells also. I do not want my child to be the person to provide the long term research by letting her take this immuno-suppressive drug. Too many major risks. Everyone should have the choice as to whether they want to take the risk though. One more thing to insurance, Chronic Plaque Psoriasis is not a purely cosmetic issue as I have heard for 20 years.

5	rheumatoid arthritis	Initially I had a red, itchy rash around the site of the injection for a few days and after two months I do not experience that at all.  I always ice the area I am going to inject 1/2 hour before and 1/2 hour after.	I was experiencing deep "bone" pain in my left hip and had to ice my hip each and every night just to be able to sleep.  I also had swelling in my ankles and my hands, which were also very painful to open and close.  Since I have been on Enbrel I am 80% more mobile and the pain in my hip has lessened by 80%.  I am also on Methotrexate.  I am forever thankful and only hope that Enbrel continues to work.	F	59	8  months50 mg 1X W	3/29/2011
2	Psoriatic Arthritis	Headaches and Bad site injection reaction	The first time I took my injection, I had no reaction. The 2nd and 3rd injection, I had a small in size, itchy rash that eventually went away w/in 5 days. The 4th injection I had an itchy rash that started out small, but tripled in size, and is still present after 9 days (hasn't gone away). Now, my 5th injection is worse. It started off small in size and by morning it had tripled in size. It is warm to touch, swelling, hard, and very itchy. My doctor's office suggested taking a Benadryl before and after, and icing the site before and after. That did not work. I rather live with the pain in my knees than live with these symptoms every day for as long as I take the medication. Unless there is something I can take to offset the bad reaction that I'm experiencing, I will stop the injections. All of this in just a month. I can only imagine how much worse it will get if I continue.	F	37	1  months50mg/ml 1X W	3/27/2011Email

				F M	 	 	    
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
