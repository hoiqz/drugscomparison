4	Total Knee Replacement	Took 1/2 of a 650 mg. tablet (325 mg.) 4xday. Only noticeable side effect was feeling 'out of it' some.	Excellent pain reliever with few side effects. Able to take 1/2 dose (325 mg 4xday). I don't take pain meds. on a regular basis, so that is probably why the small dose worked for me.	F	63	70  days	7/24/2008
4	Ruptured Disc C5-C6	One had little effect.  One and a half to two makes you a little tired and "out of it".  This drug also left me feeling sick.	Good for moderate pain relief if taking 1.5 to 2.  One seldom does anything.	M	31	90  days	2/5/2008
