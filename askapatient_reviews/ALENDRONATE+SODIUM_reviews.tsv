1	osteoporosis of spine	I followed doctor's instructions closely.  Took first dose on Dec. 19TH, before breakfast.  On Dec. 20TH, very early in the morning about 3:00 am, I felt pain all over my body.  I could not turn on my sides.  The following morning, I was completely disabled.  I could not get out of bed without help. My husband helped me sit up by pushing my back up.  Walking was impossible without a cane.  Even with the aid of a cane, all I could managed was walking in a very small steps, in a very slow manner.  We knew that I did not suffer a stroke because my voice was not weak.  I could not sit down without help.  My whole body was in pain.  I would never touch FOSAMAX OR ITS GENERIC FORM ever again.My experience was such that I am even scared of trying any kind of osteoporosis medecines.  I will just take calcium with vitamin D everyday, exercise, drink plenty of milk, eat yogurt.	This ALENDRONATE from COBALT is a poison to my body.It is maybe a good thing that I suffered this serious side effect in just one dose.  Some people that I read from the internet mentioned that they had this bad side effect after taking the med for one month and some after one year.	F	65	1  days70 mg 1X W	12/24/2010
