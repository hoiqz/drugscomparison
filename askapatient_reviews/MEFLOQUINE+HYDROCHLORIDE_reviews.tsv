1	OIF Deployment 03-04	We were forced to take this drug weekly before, during, and affter the deployment. I experience nausea, chronic headaches, mood swings, nightmares among other things. The command would not accept my refusal to take this med. Almost 10 years later I have been diagnosed by VA for Larium toxicity. This drug can cause lifetime debilitating effects.

1	Pre-deployment to Afghanistan	I'd only taken 2 doses as prescribed with the last dose 3 days preceeding the incident at a command function where I blacked out meanwhile fighting several people and the police.  I was charged with Assault on a peace officer (3rd degree felony), Assault causing bodily injury, resisting arrest, and public intoxication (misdemenors).  It's been about 2 years and am still pending trial.  The only prodromal symptom were vivid dreams (like the Matrix) which was told to be common.  Since the incident no other disturbances in behavior but I was accused of not remembering short term things for a few weeks after.  Medically I think I've recovered but it's a legal nightmare now.

1	Trip to Kenya	I am on it now. I can't sleep. I can't stay warm, then I am cold. Every mood is exaggerated. I don't become annoyed, I go straight to a state of blinding fury. I don't get sad, I become horribly depressed. I was not told not to drive and three days after getting on this stuff, I got in a race and went over 80 on a winding road and was in horrible accident (no one has seen anyone walk away from one this bad, not even EMS). I thought my boyfriends mother was going to attack me (delusions), and I had a panic attack in the car after the crash. I can't think clearly. It's like thinking through wax paper. Everything is there, but I can't get it. I don't understand it unless I really concentrate on tasks and concepts I found simple a month ago. When I try to remember parts of the crash, it is like I am seeing it third person. It is as if I am watching a movie, not remembering it. I see the scene from an aerial view, not from the backboard. I am paranoid and when people try to touch me I scream and cringe. Although I suffered no serious head injuries, I can not remember most of the night of the crash. I blacked out.  It is the most awful thing I have ever experienced.		F	18	1  weeksUnknown	6/4/2012Email
1	malaria	major depression, anxiety disorder, sleep problems, teeth grinding (bruxism), chronic  fatigue, mood swings, personality changes,  aggression, suicidal ideation, brain fog, diminished capacity, impulse control problems, anger control problems,	MY ARMY UNIT at FORT BRAGG NC was ordered to take LARIAM (mefloquine) when we were on alert to try to rescue the US hostages in Iran in Nov. 1979. No one told us we were being used as guinea pigs for an experimental drug without our knowledge or consent. No one ever asked us if we had any side effects after  Within a few days, paranoia and anxiety started, and within a few weeks, I had full-blown cycling between major depression and violent mood swings, and I have NEVER been the same since.  But because I didn't know what happened to me, I went 20 years undiagnosed and untreated, and I have now been on max dose anti-depressants since 2000. Symptoms get worse with age, and I am no longer able to work.  When I finally knew from research it was Lariam, in 2008 I applied for VA disability, but after 4 YEARS the VA & BVA STILL will not give me an answer!!!	M	54	1  daysmegadose 1X D	4/28/2012Email

1	Peace Corps Service in West Africa	insomnia, depression, loss of appetite, extremely emotional, drug-induced hepatitis	I was medically evacuated from my country of service after developing (very rapid) liver complications. The doctors did not know what was causing my liver complications, and they switched me to Malarone early on in the event that the problem was Mefloquine. It, in fact, was directly related to the Mefloquine. I knew that I was not myself while taking it, but after being off of it for about 4 weeks, I woke up one morning with my personality back. My liver functions tested normally after 3 months of being off of Mefloquine. I am very fortunate in that. Long-term effects are still to be determined.	F	25	2  months250 1X W	2/25/2012Email

1	Malaria Prevention on trip to India	Insomnia, paranoia, graduating into hallucinations and extreme psychotic episode lasting approx 3 months	I CANT BELIEVE GPs ARE STILL PRESCRIBING THIS DRUG in 2011..After what happened to me over a decade ago on taking a course of this drug (and to many other people by all accounts - ask Paul Merton) I would say that it should be banned. Really scary that they still think it works. I was flown home on an emergency flight after risking my life on a trip with friends to India and Nepal due to a Lariam-induced psychosis, extremely frightening for my friends and dangerous for me. On the 'come down' back in a psychiatric ward in the UK (yes the effects were that deep, severe and prolonged..) I felt suicidally depressed for months and could still hear voices and thought that people were imposters out to kill me..all totally crazy stuff, I have never experienced such symptoms before, or, thankfully, since. What a damaging poison.	F	36	3  months30mg 1X D	12/3/2011Email

1	malaria Prevention	1994-1995 ....Following day after first dose I felt very I'll and stressed, not knowing what was wrong with me... I couldn't relax... and this feeling has sort of stayed with me. Virtually continuous use for 10 months. Continued suffering from fatigue, ANXIETY, disorientation, dizzyness, lack of concentration, headaches always the day after taking each pill ( I called it my Lariam Headache) , alternating between hot and cold within minutes, depression ( treated with seroxat causing more problems and Very Vivid dreams/nightmares) hospitalised in Abidjan for 3 days and all basic tests for illness proved negative.  I have never got back to the feelings of peace and relaxation that I used to take for granted before I took this devastating poison.	On subsequent much shorter visits to Africa, I used Malarone, which did not appear to have any significant side effects !!! DO NOT TAKE LARIAM !!!	M	58	10  months 1X W	7/23/2011Email

I thought it would be good only having one tablet per week as the other type give me stomach problems too but not as bad I've found	F	56	1  days 1X W	3/2/2011
1	Malaria	I experienced swelling of feet, nausea, deathly frightening nightmares, suicide, paranoia, vomiting, diarrhea (not sure if this was from water though), pain in stomach, blood was really hot, losing my mind, sadness, crying for no reason, recollection of past and possibly past life, one patch of hair loss, jittery nerves, numbing and shaking hands and feet, and difficulty of breathing.

1	prevention of malaria	nausea, vomiting, dizziness, low mood, heartburn, light headed	I took 1 tablet last night and the side effects kicked in right away. I'm already on anti depressants and have a history of anxiety and major depression. My doctor did NOT warn me about the risks associated with Lariam at all. You'd think that with my history, he would be very cautious about prescribing this drug for me. It's clear after reading this page that my doctor along with many others know NOTHING about the risks. All of today I feel like I am having brain shivers.. as if my brain is struggling to keep up with my body and it's just rattling inside my head. I only ever feel this when I suffer withdrawal symptoms from missing a dose of an anti depressant. I did NOT miss any dose so I know it's the Lariam. Since last night I feel as if something is caught in my throat. It hurts to swallow when I eat because it feels as if my throat passage is narrower. I have severe heartburn. Taking a zantac did not ease the discomfort at all. My head just hurts. I feel dizzy. I had to go home half an hour into work this morning because I couldn't cope. I vomited when I got home. Went back to my doctor and he gave me Stemetil to help with the nausea. Even that isn't helping!!!!! I still feel terrible. My head hurts so much and I've been crying all afternoon. I don't know what to do. I've been poisoned. I am so angry that this drug is on the market. How dare they do this to people.	F	22	1  days250mg 1X W	12/15/2010Email
1	Holiday to South Africa ( Safari)	Dizzy, fever, shaking, halucinations, flu like symptoms, extreme tiredness, stomach ache, headache, depression, crying unexpectedly, paranoia, panic attacks, high blood pressure reading, blurred vision, "foggy" head, loss of memory - hideous side effects.	I had taken anti maleria tablets before but not this one. Was given it by GP nurses on the basis that "once a week dose is more convenient than daily" - it's not worth the risk!  Take the daily one.  Malerone works just as well but without the psychological side effects.  Not saying there are no side effects with Malerone, but they are not as bad by a long way.  One month after taking, I still feel unwell and hope it will eventually remove itself from my body.  The GPs just try to give you Valium or similar to control the panic attacks (which I did not take as I am not keen to increase the chemical imbalance any further) but I am improving gradually. I went from a perfectly sane and controlled individual to a jibbering wreck and in my view, this drug should be taken off the market. The more people who publish their experiences the better so that others dont have their holiday ruined the way I did!	F	47	2  weeks 1X W	12/15/2010Email
1	6 month trip across Africa	nightmares, anxiety, paranoia,	took Larium in 1993, side effects immediate and I stopped taking it whilst away as couldnt stand it anymore. It has ruined my life, still continue to deal with cycles of depression and anxiety. Let me stress taking this drug changed me, I had absolutely no mental illness prior to my trip and was an outgoing personality. Returned to the UK from African trip to a media outburst from people who had reactions to this, however obviously nothing has changed as its still available.	F	39	2  months 1X D	12/1/2010

Doctor immediately changed anti-malaria tablet and started treatment for symptoms, 10 years on, am having to take daily doses of levothyroxine and have been on countless different types of medication to combat mefloquin contra indications. STILL undergoing tests and medical reviews to combat effects of this drug. Has had a devasting and long term effect on my life, and continues to do so. It really should be banned.

1	trip to Guatemala (anti-malarial)	hallucinations, difficulty sleeping, severe anxiety, paranoia, and depression.	I had no idea this drug would affect me this much.  I have a lot of stress in my life right now and the Lariam has amplified my problems to the point that I can't cope with anything.  I don't feel like myself at all.  The anxiety and depression brings\ me to the point of suicidal thoughts, because I can't find a way out of the darkness. (This is highly uncharacteristic of me and scares me because I don't know how to deal with such foreign feelings.) I had to stop taking the Lariam after the 7th week when it finally made me snap.  I'm now on anti depressants and anti anxiety medication to help hold me over until the Lariam is out of my system.  I hope I can return to normal.  I would highly recommend that people consider alternatives before using this drug.	F	23	2  months250 MG 1X W	9/21/2010

After stopping taking Lariam, it took 2 more months until the side effects slowly disappeared. And even after that, at certain moments the symptoms reappeared briefly. It was the worst period I have ever experienced. I am happy the side effects were not permanent, but I will never ever take this drug again, and I would advise everyone not to take it. And in addition to the side effects and the damage it does to your body; Taking preventive antimalarial causes the malaria to develop drug resistance. Malaria becomes harder to cure!After three months stopping the Lariam, I got Malaria. I recovered and I'm now on homeopathic pills. Until now very happy with it!	F	24	6  weeks 1X W	9/10/2010Email

Those who truly understand are those that have taken and reacted. My story is much like many others; no history of any psychological problems, feeling great and enjoying life. After the 4th tablet I "broke" in March 2009. Collapsed at work with a BPM of 180PM. Then came the long, long, long struggle with trying to regain my sanity, perspective and life. Severe debilitating anxiety consumed me for almost 6 months. After just 4 weeks off work I went back to work, everyday the same, shaking and sweating in the office trying to cope with running my own business, with my friends and colleagues watching in awe and horror. Had to deal with idiotic psychiatrist who put me on 2x different drugs (Pregabalin + Escitalopram) telling me I had an "anxiety disorder". Got myself off these drugs after 6 months and continue to improve with rest, supplements, ayurveda and *time*. Still suffer with thyroid issues (shaking, agitation, tremor), vestibular issues (brain fog) and fatigue, but I am continuing to improve. Lariam completely changed my personality and I have fought to change it back. This drug is Satan's accomplice. It is the worst form of torture and it is a suffering that one shoulders completely alone.

Then developed depression and spent hours lying in a dark room feeling like killing myself.  Was prescribed Prozac, but the doctor still didn't mention any connection to Larium.  It wasn't until I mentioned to a friend who told me about Larium that I checked on the web and started ticking off the side effects that I realised what had happened.  Larium nearly destroyed my marriage.  If I owned a gun I would be dead by now. The serious side effects lasted at leats six or seven years but I still get the odd hallucination and my short term memory is still affected. DON'T TAKE IT.  USE SOMETHING ELSE	M	44	  1X D	7/9/2010

I cannot believe that this drug is still on the market. Remember, this drug was produced to prevent malaria for the purposes of keeping soldiers in the field, so if they "lose a few" to side effects, it's better than a brigade out of action from malaria.

As a 30-year federal agent in the peak of physical and psychological condition, I took this drug as a prophylaxis. It is a chemical poison whose creators, the researchers at the Walter Reed Army Research Institute, fully admit that they have NO IDEA what the drug does inside the human brain. Those of us who have suffered its horrific toxicity know well that it causes permanent damage to multiple areas of the brain.

2	Two weeks in Uganda	Recurring Nightmares/Night terrors	My advice would be to avoid this medication unless there's no safer alternative. I took some for a few weeks for a fortnight trip to Uganda when I was 11 and I quicly began having terrible recurring nightmares nearly every day which lasted for at least 8 months to the point where I felt quite traumatised by them.Every night I would dream that I had fallen onto subway tracks as a train was arriving and was paralysed so I couldn't get up off the tracks, waking up as the train crushed me!

1	Goshen College SST	Catatonia, heard unreal voices saying morbid things, convulsions (head jerked spastically while the rest of my body could not move) eyelids fluttered nonstop uncontrollably...and more!	Lariam (mefloquine) is the only antimalarial that has been the direct cause of homicides, suicides and torture. As little as one dose can cause permanent brain damage. Take another antimalarial, not this one. For more information, visit www.lariaminfo.org and/or the Facebook page Mefloquine (Lariam) Stinks!	F	34	3  weeks	1/22/2010
1	Holiday to East Africa	Still ill more than 10 years on.  Balance disorder, brain stem damage, tinnitus, insomnia, anxiety, memory impairment, confusioon, suicide ideation, chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, vision problems, hypotension.	I received huge help and support from Lariam-Mefloquine Action.  They are a fantastic group and their website is:  www.lariaminfo.orgThey have a large amount of research and support material available online.  If you suspect you are having/had and adverse Lariam reaction, I would strongly recommend contacting them.	M	40	8  weeks	12/7/2009
1	malaria prophylaxis		I have not taken Larium myself but have collected reports from dozens of friends and acquaintances over the years, after a friend of mine had a month-long psychotic episode in India on Larium, thinking he was Jesus and that he had caused the great earthquake in Gujarat.  About 80 or 90% of people I've talked with have had nightmares, panic attacks, hallucinations or psychotic episodes on Larium.  Don't even consider taking it.  The fact this is still on the shelves is insane.	M	33	14  days	12/6/2009
1	Business Trip	Permanent adverse side-effects such as depression, anxiety, paranoia, aggression, nightmares, insomnia, brutal and daily headaches!!!!!!!  This has been ongoing since September 2000.	Lariam or Mefloquine is like playing Russian roulette.  No question it can help prevent malaria but it may also destroy your life. Roche Pharmacueticles updated the drug literature 4 times since I took this drug.  Little too late.....	M	41	7  weeks	11/4/2009
1	Prevent Maleria	Loss of appetite, Weird Dreams, Depression, Stomach Cramps, IBS, Anxiety	Took Lariam on the advice of my doctor to prevent Maleria. First dose I was fine, in the second dose I started having Low moods and weird dreams, by the thrid dose my stomach was terrible, and my mood was extremely low. Friends constantly asked me if i was depressed as they noticed i was not myself. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION... FIND AN ALTERNATIVE!	M	26	3  weeks	10/26/2009
5	Trip to Kenya	None	I suffered from severe vestibulodynia for two years, after going on this medication I noticed it was about 70% better, thought it was unrelated until I came back from my trip and went off it, and the horrible pain came back.  I am not going off this medication ever, I feel like it has saved my life.  Ladies, if you suffer from any kind of vulvodynia take this medication!	F	25	4  months	10/17/2009
1	Anti-Malarial	Diarrhea, weight loss, loss of appetite,stomach cramps,IBS, possible colitis, suicidal thoughts,night sweats,paranonia, terrible shakes/tremors,vision problems,mouth ulcers,weak and tired.	I took lariam for 1.5 months for a trip to West Africa and based on multiple visits to the hospital when I returned,CAT Scan, possible stomach surgery,tremors and a complete loss of appetite I will NEVER travel to a place that requires an anti-malarial again. I had to try both Malarone and Lariam and neither worked. I feel like I have been permanently damaged and pray that I get back to the active/healthy person I use to be. I am depressed and have awful thoughts. One night I wrote down things that just past through my mind and reading it later appeared psychotic. I do not regret Africa, I will always regret taking these drugs.	F	40	35  days	8/16/2009
1	Anti Maleria	After posting a number of years ago on here and having so many people contact me for help on combating the side effects of Lariam I decided to do something about how I won my battle with Larium. The side is aimed at all of you out there who are suffering from the horrid side effects this drug can have on you.	I hope I can continue helping others out there and spread my word that there is a way to return to normal after taking Lariam.http://www.lariam.org - Free Lariam Side Effects & Help	M	33	1  weeks	7/25/2009Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.	F	52	8  years20 MG 1X D	1/13/2012Email
2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
