1	Birth control	Headache, vision problems, depressed, less period	This pill makes you feel CRAZY! i started taking this about two years ago and i feel like a completly different person since ive been on it. I constantly get headaches and have extream vision problem. I decided to stop taking it starting today and see if anything changes. It has to be this drug because after reading other reviews i realized i was not alone with these problem. I hope to be back to normal. DO NOT TAKE THIS.	F	21	2  years 1X D	12/4/2012
3	Prevent Cysts that occur with ovula	The first 2-3 weeks of taking this pill were hell. I was irritable, angry, no sex drive, my breasts went up a cup size and were tender all the time, and other symptoms such as hemorroids and heartburn (which I'm not sure is related)	After one month of taking this pill, these symptoms went away completely. I got my libido back, my breasts are back to normal (boo) and i feel normal again. I guess you have to give this pill a month for your body to adjust. Any longer than a month I would've switched to another pill.	F	35	2  months 1X D	9/25/2012Email
