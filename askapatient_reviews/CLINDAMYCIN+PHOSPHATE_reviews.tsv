1		Horrible gas pains, bloating, cramps, anxiety, insomnia, and intense abdominal pain and distention.	DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG unless there is NOTHING else that will work.  I took it as an adjunct to Cipro for diverticulitis, and I have never had a more miserable 36 hours.  Spent a sleepless night with abdominal pain, gas, distention, and horrible bloating, and had to go to the emergency room the next day for treatment antibiotic-caused colitis, courtesy of Clindamycin.  I still feel fragile.  This is a terrible drug,	F	57	1  days300 3X D	7/8/2012Email
5	to get rid of the tiny bumps on my	slight numbness every so often of my face...not as bad as it sounds	LOVE IT! In 26 years I have NEVER had clear skin. It took me a month after being given the rx to actually fill and take it because everything else they gave me made my acne worse.  I don't like/trust my derm so i was lear ( have since stopped going). this lotion is the best thing I got out of going there so long!	F	26	6  months	7/8/2009
5	Acne	Every once in a while I thought my face felt a tiny bit numb...but other then that NO SIDE EFFECTS :)	I love this medicine. I was leary at first and didn't want to waste the money on filling this RX since every other RX that the doc gave me made my acne 100x worse! I was sick of having nodules on my face! I was going to try Accutain, but I didnt like the NEVER ENDING list of HORRID side effects.  Within two days I noticed a difference in my skin with Clindamycin.  Everything from no pimples to the little annoying bumps going away. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS MEDICINE! :)	F	26	15  days	11/5/2008Email
