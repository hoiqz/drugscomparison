1	Stress from abusive spouse	Could not speak, zombie brain, uncontrolled facial movements, inability to play guitar anymore, felt like I was on LSD.	I was prescribed Mellaril in the late 90's. I was going through a terrible divorce and the Xanax was not working well. I asked my family doctor for a tranquillizer a bit stronger than Xanax and he prescribed Mellaril (goes by the brand Thioridazine here in Canada). I had no idea that Mellaril was an anti-psychotic. The drug turned me into a complete zombie, unable to speak. I could only babble incoherently. I developed a condition called "Tardive Dyskinesia" from Mellaril that is a permanent, life altering condition. I have tried just about every drug, legal and illegal, and Mellaril was by far the worst drug I have ever taken. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG! It is also known as a "chemical lobotomy". I am suing the doctor who prescribed it to me as I was under the impression it was just a stronger version of Xanax. I now have permanent brain damage from this drug.

5	Bipolar 1	Groggy when I woke up.  Impossible to wake up once I went to sleep until 8 hours later. Nasal congestion when mixed with alcohol.  Felt measurably dumber.	This drug saved me.  It allowed me to sleep 8-10 hours per day. It eliminated my mania when prescribed Tegretol and Mellaril.  Switched to Zyprexa which leaves me not so groggy in the morning.  I would recommend it to any rapid-cycler but it takes some getting used to.  Take it all at once at bedtime for best result.	F	48	10  years50 mg 1X D	1/13/2011
1	misdiagnosed schizophrenia	Dizziness, blurred vision, restlessness, panic/terror, unable to control my limbs, violent headaches, vivid nightmares, slurred speech.	The two weeks I was on this drug were the most hellish experience of my life. Be absolutely sure it is schizophrenia before you allow anyone to convince you to take this medication; and even then only if you have tried everything else. Bipolar disorder with psychotic features (what I had) is often misdiagnosed as schizophrenia--there are far better drugs for that.	F	27	14  days	6/6/2009
2	Agitated Depression	Wound up with tongue-thrusting, stiff gait, akasthesia.  On one occasion, jaw went into painful spasms-lower right eyetooth was touching upper left eyetooth.	Did very little for the depression.  Just made me sleepy.Used it during first and second hospital stays.  Quit using it shortly after discharge because of above side effects.	F	31	 	5/13/2006
