4	rosacea	burning, initially face gets red but later fades	Used it for awhile.  I do notice that I get worse when I don't use it.  Right now I have my rosacea under control.  I use it along with aveeno altra calming lotion (apply around 10 min after I apply azelex).  I clean my face with aveeno ultra calming foaming cleanser mixed with some tea tree oil prior to each use. Seems to be working - knock on wood	F	36	6  months 2X D	12/19/2011Email
3	moderate acne	initial breakout	using it w/ doxycycline, it does seem to fade scars but hoping it will do more for acne.	F	21	4  weeks	2/27/2007
2	acne, acne scarring	burning/tingling, itchy feeling	After using this for several months I noticed absolutely no difference at all in my skin.  Still broke out, still red, still scarred.	F	25	6  months	10/7/2006
3	red acne scars, uneven skin tone	none really. I expected the burning/sensitive feeling the packaging warned about, but didn't feel it; possibly because I'd been using Neutrogena's "Healthy Defense" lotion, which *does* sting a bit.	After about 6 months or so, it really doesn't seem to have made much of a difference. It's hard to tell. I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, which causes ongoing acne and facial hair that needs to be plucked. Azelex has made my skin more sensitive (more easily damaged from plucking or acne scars) but the cream also *seems* to minimize the damage. Again, it's hard to tell. I have a medium complexion - somewhat dark, my complexion is what most people look like after a tan - and use it only on my chin and upper lip area.	F	31	120  days	5/27/2006
