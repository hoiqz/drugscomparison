1	hypogonadism	none	This stuff works well and smells horrible.  The smell does not wash off, and nobody will f*ck you smelling this bad.  Spend the extra $ and get the patch.	M	50	3  weeks50 mg 1X D	7/1/2013
2	low testosterone	None yet	Odor is very strong. Gets in clothes, sheets, pillows. Does not wash out in laundry. Smells like old ladies smelled in church back in the 1950s, icky sweet with sweat and cheap talcum powder beneath it. I may not be able to tolerate this drug. I used Androgen before. No smell. I had to switch as A-gel went off the formulary of my insurance plan, but I would sure love to ditch the stench!	M	64	1  weeks30 mg 1X D	12/5/2012
1	low t	High blood pressure, high hemoglobin, restless nights		M	57	12  months150GM 1X D	12/5/2012Email
4	Low T levels, no sex drive.	I'm getting acne on my upper back and acne and whiteheads on my face, specifically the chin and lips area. I'm always seeing whiteheads on the edges of my lips. What can be done?		M	56	3  months50 MG	6/13/2012
3	Low T	At first some heat flashes, then those went away very quickly.  No side effects for one year,but this year more frequent heart palpitations and my blood pressure began to rise.  The smell wasn't bad either and the med stays on your skin real well.  Did not experience any rashes or allergy to this med..	This drug did help me raise my T levels last year, but this year my levels have stayed low.  Below 230.  I don't know what my body is doing with the Testim, but not raising my T levels.  I know it's not converting the testosterone to Estradiol because my E levels were normal.  Going to try the Clomid route.....	M	42	2  years50MG/tube 1X D	8/25/2010
4	Low T	None except the musky smell. It's very sticky even after waiting few minutes to dry. My wife likes the smell, unfortunately, so do my other male coworkers.	Prescribed due to normal but low testosterone. I was at low 300s but my urologist wanted me to be above 500. I stopped using it after the birth of my daughter -- can't risk the chance of rubbing the med on her.	M	40	5  months1% 1X D	7/14/2010Email
5	hypogonadism ( low T)	After  several months on Testim I got some acne on my stomach and chest area.. not a big deal for what I get in the benefits of this drug.	Testim has made a big difference for me.. My libido has increased.. I feel more energetic and healthy and I am not fatigued any longer..I am happier and generally have a much better sense of well being. Yes, it does have a smell..but not a bad one ..my wife really gets turned on by it , actually. It is known to absorb better than androgel for many men and it works great for me.. it keeps my testosterone levels up where they need to be.

2	Hypogonadism	Actually wasn't on it long enough to experience side effects.  Posting because I wanted to let people know that this product smells.  Had to switch to Androgel as it is odorless.	This product smells.  It's not an offensive smell, but it lingers, even after showering, and gets stronger if you work out.  My wife thought it smelled sweet; not a manly smell.  From what I could find online, the smell comes from a chemical they add to help the product be absorbed more quickly.  Basically, with Testim, you can wash it off or go swimming 2 hours after application.  With Androgel, they recommend waiting for 5-6 hours.	M	38	2  days1% 1X D	2/11/2010Email
