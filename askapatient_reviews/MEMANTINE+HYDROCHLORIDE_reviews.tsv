1	alzeheimers disease	My mother was prescribed Namenda along with aricept.  after starting the Namenda she began to experience back pain and weakness in her legs.  She could barely stand and needed a walker to get around.  Even that wasn't enough and a wheelchair became necessary.  My mother's cardiologist told us that it was probably the Namenda ( his mother in law had similar symptoms after starting Namenda ) her symptoms ceased after the Namenda was stopped.  Also a physical therapist that was seeing my mother told me that his father had taken Namenda and had side effects of low back pain and leg weakness.  Has anyone else experienced side effects such as these mentioned after taking Namenda ?  I would appreciate any feedback.		F	79	1  months 1X D	3/1/2012
1	Dementia	Mother took namenda for memory problems. Hopeful that it would help her recall and foggy thinking. It gave her anxiety, uncontrollable rage and panic attacks that were extreme. She developed tremors of her entire body and long episodes of tachycardia (rapid heart rate). Her memory was further impaired after taking namenda. She also had bladder infections while taking namenda. In the opinion of our family namenda was taking her downhill fast. We did not taper down to take her off of the medicine. We quit immediately once we noticed her eyes were glassy and she was physically slowing down. Once off of namenda her panic attacks and tremors continued but began to subside over the course if the next three months. We had to give her Xanax for the tremors and panic attacks. Now she that she is off namenda she is bright, moving around again, the panic attacks and tremors are gone and she has an appetite again. I forgot to mention the almost ten pound weight loss in the short time she took this		F	53	2  months25 mg 1X D	9/28/2011
2	Bipolar II	Agititation, tachycardia	I am Bipolar II, diagnosed 3 yrs ago, and the condition has been fairly well managed with three medications (Namenda, Lamictal, and a low dose of Seroquel).  In late 2007 I took part in a clinical study that combined Namenda with Lamictal.  The premise was that the two act synergistically for BPD treatment.  I chose to continue with the Namenda after the clinical trial.Over the past couple of years I've had increasing difficulty with agitation and episodes of rapid heartbeat that come out of the blue. I didn't know the cause. Recently, due to other nasty side effects, I decided it is time to come off the Lamictal and try something else.  I began the process by titrating down the Namenda (since I am only taking it because of the Lamictal).  To my surprise, my episodes of agitation and tachycardia have reduced DRAMATICALLY since going off the Namenda (I haven't even started titrating down the Lamictal yet, so I know it is the Namenda).I've heard anecdotal evidence that Namenda causes agitation in the elderly, but because it is primarily used for dementia, it is likely hard to disentangle side effects from the symptoms of the disease.  From my exeperience, I think it is very likely that Namenda can cause agitation in the elderly!	F	43	3  years10mg 2X D	12/22/2010
4	autism	Unknown - user is non-verbal.	Prescribed for "off label" use for my 3.5 year old (now 6 year old) non-verbal son with autism to help with expressive and receptive language.  Did not help with expressive but receptive has skyrocketed.  Not sure if can attribute to solely namenda since he is also on depakote and has had therapy since he was 2.5 but he has made gains in the receptive areas that namenda was supposed to target.

3	Alzheimer		Husband took Namenda for several years, I do think is slowed the process and he had a few "good" years because of it. Now in advanced stages it does not work anymore.	M	83	5  years	2/1/2010Email
