5	menopausal symptoms - hot flashes	Patch fell off after shower - had to apply new patch- re-read the instructions and held pressure for 10 seconds to patch and have since not had this problem.	Menopause/Perimenopause!  Each woman responds very differently to the fluctuating hormone levels seen during perimenopause or to the waning levels of estrogen during menopause.  With the release of the 2002 Womans Health Initiative study (WHI), there was a panic amongst the medical community and every perimenopausal/menopausal woman on HT.  In 2010, the North American Menopause Society released their statement - which in essence says that a woman has to understand the risks and benefits of HT.  The ELITE (ELITE: Early Versus Late Intervention Trial With Estradiol) at USC Keck School of Medicine is still underway.  My understanding at this time, is that perimenopausal/menopausal women who have symptoms that interfere with quality of life should discuss the risks and benefits of HT with their provider.  I had this discussion with my doctor and I decided to go on estrogen therapy (ET) at the very lowest dosage that controls my symptoms (I have had a hysterectomy so I do not have to take progesterone to protect the uterus from exposure to estrogens).  I am on the lowest dose (0.0225) Climara patch (estradiol) which I started on about a month ago.  My doctor said it would take about 72 hours to know whether I was on a sufficient dose, but the very day I started using the patch, I had my first good night's sleep in a very long time.  I love the once a week estradiol patch! It works! Visit The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) at: www.NAMS.org	F	50	30  days0.025 mcg. 1X W	10/9/2010Email
5	hysterectomy	sometimes a little skin irritation at site of patch. Gooey residue.	Must change patch every 2 days. After 2 days, patch is totally dry. But while it is full, works GREAT! Much better than pills, without the liver involvement that I got with Premarin.	F	59	20  years	7/18/2009
