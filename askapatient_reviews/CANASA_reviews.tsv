4	collitis / proctitis	The combination of Canasa and Colazal have made a long term condition much better.	My only gripe is that this medicine is so darned expensive, and not available as a generic.	M	65	5  years1000mg 1X D	2/3/2012
1	Severe UC	Severe joint pain to the point I was not able to walk	My doctor claimed my joint pain was from UC, but I had no sign of joint pain until taking this medication. When I went off, it took several days for the pain to go down. I went on it again for a few days because of a flare up and the joint pain came right back. After a few weeks the pain hasn't totally gone away. The first time I took it it helped my rectal pain dramatically within 2 days. The second time it didn't do a thing. Side effects aren't worth it nor the high price tag! I've seen significant improvement from a cooked veggie diet, ultrainflamx, probiotics, roberts formula, psyllium, turmeric, boswellia, fish oil, glutamine, sodium butyrate enemas. Highly recommend a naturopath!	F	25	13  days1000 1X D	10/7/2010Email
1	cuffitis	Anal Pain, Diarreah, Increased Gas, Body aches in legs, Low grade fever, Insomnia, Dizziness, and Low Energy level	Currently have a J-pouch and was prescribed canasa to relive the severe inflamation I have due to UC affecting the stump of rectum that was left after surgery.  Seemed like it helped after I stoped the medication by making my stool go from watery to spongy.  However the side effects were too much for my body.	M	34	10  days1000mg 1X D	8/3/2010
