1	migraines	I developed an inability to hold urine, also severe bruising even with simple pressure to the skin. I have permanently damaged my bladder.	I misunderstood the doctor's instructions, which were to take it twice a day. I did not know I was only supposed to take one, not two at a time. Also that twice a day meant every 12 hours instead of a 4 hour span.  I felt it could have easily killed me from internal bleeding. I lost the protective lining in my bladder and after 15 years I still have blood in my urine. I can no longer take aspirin, ibuprofin or anything acidic that can irritate the bladder or thin the blood.	F	62	2  weeks 1X D	5/24/2012
