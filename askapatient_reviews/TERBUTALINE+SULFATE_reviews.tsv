5	pre-term labor	Yes, it causes the shakes, but it also calmed the contractions and slowed dialation...my baby held on til 34 weeks. This med is a real God send!	My first son is now 25 years old and he has no developmental problems from the long term use while I was pregnant. I took it every 2 hours around the clock.I now take it for severe asthma and it just cannot be matched for me....it saved my sons' lives, yes two sons, and has also saved my life.

3	pre-tern labor	Very jittery and shakey, I could tell the baby was similarly effected by this drug.  The brethine did stop contractions, but I feel the risks may outway the benefits.	I am very concerned that my son, now 5, may be adhd...and this may be linked to my use of this drug (as directed by my OB/GYN)..I am not happy that I did not have all the information that I needed before making an intelligent choice to take this for pre-term labor...

1	preterm contractions	Jittery, anxious, and wanting to grind teeth.  Feels like a panic attack that lasts for hours.  Worst side effects I've ever had from any medicine.  I hate to think how baby feels	HATE IT!  They should use this for torture/interrogation... it's THAT bad	F	30	7  days	5/10/2009

3	To stop contractions/pre-term labor	Extreme jitters and shakiness.  I can't hold a book or magazine to read because I shake so much, affects my typing accuracy/ability at times, very restless, etc.	I am on several other prescription drugs including Valtrex (500 mgs daily) and Lamictal for seizure disorder (currently on 50 mgs..just started this one a little over 2 weeks ago).  Currently 31 weeks pregnant with second child.	F	27	7  days	11/18/2007
