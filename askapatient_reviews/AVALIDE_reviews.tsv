Tried to tell my physician that I thought it might be my meds.  5 yrs later put on Atenolol....too late.		F	59	5  years150/12.5 1X D	8/31/2011
3	High Blood Pressure	Primarily lower back pain.	This medication was excellent at reducing my blood pressure; however, after the recall, Bristol Myers increased the strength.  My pharmacist brought to my attention the new smaller pill when I picked up my new prescription about a week ago.  Since taking the new Avalide pill, I immediately began to feel lethargic, depressed and have increased hair loss.  I did some research on the web and found this website.  I started to read the side effects suffered by people taking Avalide and realized that for months before the recall I've had lower back muscle weakness.  I put 2 and 2 together and came to the conclusion that this medication has been causing problems all along.  It only took Bristol Myers increasing the strength for all of the symptoms to become magnified.  I immediately called my cardiologist.  Hopefully, there is an alternative.

2	hypertension	fatigue+++ muscle and joint pain, body aches generally, heart palpitations, numbness and tingling to hands and feet and new sudden feelings of depression because of my inability to function day to day because of my symptioms.	My doctor sent me to specialists (neurologist and internal medicine ) I was tested and seen for fibra myalgia, autoimmune disorders and other disease processes that result in similar symptoms, every lab work and test came back perfect.  She prescribed me antidepressants and I was insulted...  I am a Reg. Nurse and mother of 3, I stuggled to keep up most days.  My doctor finally gave up on me.  After researching Avalide, I realized that I have felt crappy for the same amount of time I've been on the drug. My blood pressure isn't even that much better.  I've stopped taking it for a little over one week now and my body aches are 80% better and I'm not near as tired...Is this coincidental or what!!!	F	37	2.5  years300/25 1X D	3/17/2011
4	High Blood Pressure	This was working fairly well on my BP. Yes, it did make me very tired a first. Fatigue somewhat went away. Hard to lose weight when taking this too. I just went to try to get a refill and found out that they are not making Avalide right now from the manufacturer??  So now they are going to put me on Avapro with the Hydrochoro diuretic as an extra pill. Why is this? makes me wonder was the Avalide safe for me?	Also, why is the doctor handing out samples of a drug that they are not making?	F	52	5  months12.5mg 1X D	3/2/2011
1	hypertension	loss of sexual desire is CERTAIN !! Beware! And more importantly, if you have IBS/IBD, such as crohn, ulcers or colitis, stop taking this medicine, it makes you bleed. Other than these, it drops your BP.		M	42	30  days 1X D	2/26/2011
4	Hypertension	I was taking Diovan HCT 160/12.5.  Worked well for awhile but my BP started creeping up.  Doctor then put me on Avalide 300/12.5, one tab in the morning.  Great results and results are still good.  However, I do notice a common complaint by others also taking Avalide and that's muscle pain.  After 1 year on Avalide, I started noticing terrible muscle cramps of the extremities (hands and feet mostly).  After reading all this, I am more and more suspicious Avalide is causing the cramps.  So, other than some other medication that works for me as well as Avalide, what are my present options? Well, I can put up with the muscle cramps OR run the risk of a stroke due to uncontrolled hypertension.  As a side note, in my personal experience, most doctors seem to be quite hesitant to point an accusing finger at any medication.		M	70	2  years300-12.5 1X D	2/20/2011
1	high blood pressure	tired and fatigued all the time.  Joint and muscle pains from hips, thighs, knees and feet.  Sometimes shortness of breath.  muscle pains getting so bad almost unable to walk.	my symptoms started after being on avalide but have gotten progressively worse.	F	58	8  years150-12.5 m 1X D	1/27/2011
3	High Blood Pressure	Frequent urination, restless legs, reduced ability to TASTE.  Avalide does control my blood pressure.	Prior to reading several websites, I never attributed any of the side effects I was having to Avalide.  Now I know that frequent urination is a definite side effect.  No one has mentioned a reduction in TASTE, which I am experiencing the more I am on this drug.  Though Avalide controls my blood pressure, I am wondering if there isn't something else out there that doesn't cause these side effects.	F	50	2  years300-12.5 1X D	1/14/2011Email
2	Blood Pressure	I have had weight gain, dizziness, achy legs, intermittent noise in my right ear that sounds like rapid popping noises I never had this problem before taking Avalide ,frequent almost did not make it to the bathroom urinations,  blurred vision,itchy rash, memory loss at times, my blood presure has not dropped below 160 consistently, however the two lower numbers are always between 73-92. Delayed reaction to life situations.	I spoke with my Doctor and was told the noise in my  right ear should subside once my blood pressure is under control, however this side effect along with the blurred vision, delayed reactions to life situations and memory loss at times I can not live with.

1	hight blood pressure	weight gain...loss of libido...redness on face..insomnia...hair loss !!	I am sure glad I read these comments...in the over 5 years I have been taking Avalide..I never realized it was what might be causing my problems !	F	65	5  days12.5 1X D	12/17/2010Email
1	Blood Pressure	I had been taking Labetalol HCL 200 MG twice daily for some time and my blood pressure started to get higher. My current doctor added Avallide to help with this and I soon began too have severe joint pain and stomach upset. He than added a narcotic pain reliever to help. I have now quit taking Avalide and feel better. I have also quit taking the pain meds. So far I seem to feel alot better. I will be going to a different doctor.	Beware of Doctors on the take. They will hurt you. Medicine companies are paying them to precribe they're poison.	M	42	90  days150/12.5 2X D	12/4/2010Email

1	High BP	I have no idea how it effected my BP but after 2 days of talking this medication I was feeling horrible. I couldnt figure out why I had dizziness, confusion, extreme fatigue, leg cramps and stomach aches. My usual ringing in my ears increased dramatically. I continued it for 5 more days before I have decided that it has to be the Avalide and the side effects are unbearable. I have gone back to my old medication and I am calling my doctor in the AM.		M	60	6  days25 1X D	8/7/2010
3	High Blood Pressure	Avalide controlled my BP very well after many tries with other medications. Until the last 6 months of taking the drug, the only side effects I had experienced were a fast pulse rate and leg and foot cramps.  However, I began having severe angio-edema, which is facial swelling, extreme redness and itching with no rash.  I looked horrible.  After eliminating everything and trying them 1 at a time - it was the AValide.  This is listed as one of the major allergic reactions to all Angiotension Receptor booster drugs. I am currently trying to find a new drug that lowers my BP without swelling up and itching!	Avalide is the only drug I have taken for my BP that held my pressure steady throughout the day.  I am 5'6" tall and weight 120 lbs so weight is not an issue.  I can have normal BP and an hour later it is in 150 range.  Avalide maintained me between 115/70 to 125/70.  But I did find the high pulse rate caused shortness of breath when I was rushing about. Off the Avalide I have none of these symptoms, but I can't find a new medication that works.

1	Hypertension/HBP	After about 2 weeks of taking Avalide i have felt dizzy (vertigo), light-headed, heart palpitations, tingling in extremeties, and occasional stomach pain. I even went to an Ear,Nose and Throat Specialist thinking i had an inner ear infection causing my balance problems.	For me Avalide is not worth taking because of all the side effects.  I stopped taking it 24 hours ago. Hopefully in a few days the symptoms will go completely away. I have a doctors appointment next week and hopefully he will put me on a different medication.	M	44	6  months150/12.5mg 1X D	2/3/2010
2	hypertension	I have been taking a number of different pills for BP for about 10 years and Idon't think they work that good. Dr. has never said it's down to normal.I have lots of side effects but didn'tthink was pills always thought was old age . All symptoms slowly crept up over the years.	Don't know if it's the avalide because I took HDC before it but my side effects are : body aches ,dry cough, upset stomach with lots of gas,hair loss,headache when sleeping, then dr. added norvasc and bottom of feet itched like crazy.	F	65	2  years	1/28/2010
2	HBP	severe abdomen pain (like ulcer) - loss of bladder control		F	48	30  days	1/25/2010
4	Hypertension	Initially had muscle aches and felt edgy with some mild headaches.Now after the fourth weekly body is getting used to it.	I have a back injury that had been giving me daily pain which seems to have almost gone away.The increased circulation I guess.That alone is worth it. My Bp is now in the normal range after being 150/100-160/100.	M	53	4  weeks	1/14/2010
5	Hypertension	None! This medication controls my BP without additional meds. I know some folks who are on 6 or more BP drugs.	I am delighted on how well Avalide has been controlling my BP. I started out with Avapro 5 years ago, yet was placed on Avalide 300/12.5 3 years ago. Work related stress and age was increasing my blood pressure. I am also on generic lopressor, but that's due to my recent MI and not BP control. Avapro and Avalide gave no side effects. My Dr stated he used it often for patients not controlled by generics. He's a great physician. I'm fortunate he's easy to talk with and explains my problemsin a way I can understand.	M	58	5  years	12/27/2009
2	Blood Pressure	Nervousness, fatigue did not feel like doing anything (I've always been a very active person) because I was feeling like this I would get depressed.  Blurred vision sometimes, lower back pain and leg cramps, diarrhea, rapid pulse.	When I told my Dr. these symptoms he said he didn't think it was the Avalide, he said he takes twice a day and he does not get any symptoms. Well I hate to break it to him but I do. I've been given 2 other medicines since i went to him, first one i had a bad reaction, huge rash my face would turn so red and hot I had to put ice on it, legs got swollen also and red, so I was taken off off that and now I'm on another one...not doing so great on this one either is similar to Avalide...sooo....I guess is back to the office.  Sorry doctor C. Can't these be a little easyer...	F	55	7  years	12/22/2009
3	HBP	This drug has me feeling shaky and the sharp darting pains I get all over make me think I need a different drug.I thought lowering my pressure would make me feel normal instead i have the opposite feeling.....nervous....and muscle ache.Maybe I need more time to have it work properly.....maybe not.		M	53	4  days	12/18/2009
1	HTN	I have been taking Avalide for several years now and symptoms have been getting progressivly worse.  I didn't think it was from Avalide initially, but after reading these comments, I find it is most likely the Avalide that has been causing these side effects, which are:  extreme fatigue, chronic insomnia, muscle cramping of legs and upper back, numbness and tingling in both hands, headache with extreme dizziness, some depression due to lack of energy.  I also have extreme tinnitis (ringing in the ears).  I have had ongoing digestive problems...I feel like a wreck!!!  I need to get back to my old self again.	As of today and after reading these comments from others, I am taking myself off Avalide to see if these symptoms subside. I will consult my doctor.	F	65	3  days	12/17/2009Email
3	hypertension	I experienced severe abdominal and upper back cramping, lethargic by the afternoon but unable to sleep at night.  The worse was the leg and hip cramps and vision problems.	I have migraines and suffer from mild radiculopathy (a fusion of the spine in the lower back), I thought that my symptoms indicated a worsening of my conditions.  Sometimes the pain would get so bad that I could hardly walk or drive.  My life has almost come to a standstill.  I'm glad I found this site because I thought I was going crazy.  It was okay in the beginning, but my condition has worsened over the 2 years I've been taking it.	F	48	2  years	11/30/2009Email
2	Hig Blood Pressure	Was tired but thought it had to do with my life style. Was hospitalized for chest pains, numbness in body. Was taking 300/25 for approx 1 1/2 months. Lowered pressure drasticly over night 90's/60's.	Does anyone no how long it takes to get rid of the side effects once you have stopped taking this medication?	F	45	2  months	11/6/2009
4	hypertension	I did not have any side effects	This drug is also called as generic for co aprovel. You need to be careful on the type of medications that you take along avalide. there are medications that interact with it and increase the intensity of the side effects. You can find the list that interact at http://www.internationaldrugmart.com/avalide.html	M	55	2  months	11/5/2009Email
2	5 years	Severe back and leg pain, afternoon fatigue and ED.	Lowered my blood pressure but with too many side effects.  I was going to the chiropractor for about a year thinking I had spinal problems and only found out that stopping the medication for a week the back and leg pains went away.  I am taking Benicar now.	M	59	5  years	10/31/2009
4	blood pressure	More tired and sleepy faster. Has helped my blood pressure. Now in normal range.		F	58	4  days	10/22/2009
4	HPB	None - urinated a lot, but it's a diuretic, that's the point of it, not a side effect.  :)	I took this pill for two days and my pressure went from 170/102 to 110/63.  I'm going to call and see if I can take it every other day.	F	41	2  days	7/10/2009
3	High Blood Pressure	Headache, muscle cramping in my shoulders and back, fatigue, moody	I started taking avalide several years ago dosage 150mg./12.5mg. Last week my BP was 145 over 92 so Doc presribed higher dosage 300mg/12.5mg. Within one day felt very depressed felt like crap no energy etc.. Went back to Doctor told him of these side effects and he said it was all in my head. I had to  book sick for 2 night shifts, couldn't function. Started taking 150mg/12.5mg in the morning again, started with headache and muscle cramping.  Anyone suggested a better BP medication with less side effects. I am a active 49 year old, walk ,golf, squash etc. cannot stand the side effects.	M	49	2  years	7/9/2009Email

1	hypertension	pain in the muscles of my front thighs, aches and pains in arms and legs, back pain, difficulty walking, joints hurt, pain worsens daily	I think that the muscle/skelatal pain side effect should be more prominently featured in the warnings of the medicine.	F	57	2  years	4/17/2009
4	HBP	Low potassium - need supplement; hair loss; shortness of breath	With the exception of the hair loss, I can live with the side effects -- previous HBP meds caused asthma-like symptoms and deep cough	F	56	5  years	4/10/2009
2	high blood pressure	overall feeling of weakness and fatigue, very tired and even simple activity like walking was a strain. Could not focus and would not drive a car while taking this medication.  Blood pressure improved only very slightly.  Not worth taking.		M	76	3  weeks	4/9/2009

3	Hypertension	Dizzines and nausea within one hour of taking 150 mg of this medication that lasts for a few hours. The feeling of despair and nervousness as well as chest pains and tingling and numbness in fingers.In addition difficulty falling a sleep and difficulty in sleeping more than 4-5 hours at a time. Has somewhat helped in reducing BP from the 160/110 range to 130/85 but I starting to wonder if it is worth with the side affects.	For some reason the side affects did not start until after a month after starting this medication.		55	8  months	12/19/2008Email

1	Hpertension	I take it in the am and by early afternoon I feel exhausted and feel like I need to take a nap. I don't trust myself to drive while on this medication. Also muscle pains particularly in my hands and shoulders. There is also shortness of breath to the point that even something as simple as loading the dishwasher exhausts me. Some episodes of feeling nauseous with it also  It does control my blood pressure which ranged 120/70 - 130/80. My dosage was 150/12.5	I don't recommend it at all.	F	39	4  weeks	11/23/2008
1	High Blood Pressure	I have taken Avalide for 4 years.  It has controlled my BP down from 140/95 down to 130/80 constant with periodic dips to 120/75.  The side effects appeared within days of starting the medication and have become progressively severe. The side effects include dizziness (slight), uncontrollable need for a nap in the afternoon to a point where it is dangerous for me to drive, joint pain in my knees, hip and feet, palpitations, abdominal pain, loss of sexual urge, muscle pain in the limbs, difficulty falling asleep, unexplained urinary tract infection, frequent urinating and lately tingling in the extremities.  BUT by far the most alarming side effect is SHORTNESS OF BREATH EVEN WHILE DOING A SIMPLE ACTIVITY SUCH AS WALKING.  This side effect usually kicks in 30-40 minutes after taking Avalide.  Furthermore, this side effect was the first noticeable one and appeared almost as soon as I went on Avalide.  Typically, if I get up from my table and walk, I feel out of breath for the first 5 - 1		M	66	 	11/15/2008

I am not sure if the medicine is causing the side effects.   I am going to have a sleep apnea test done.	F	42	2  months	9/10/2008

1	Blood Pressure	Just light headed a few times, then ok.  8 months later a dehydration event started palpations briefly and I have had shaking, weakness, mostly in upper body, nausea,gas, belching, feeling of doom, restlessness, chills, sweats, can't get to sleep some nights. Drs didn't mention the side effects of the med, said take it easy and just stay hydrated.	I found this site and breifly talked with others and read the fine print and I have stopped this med immediately. Just wondering how long before side effects wear off if ever?	M	33	8  months	7/3/2008Email
4	High Blood Pressure & Diabetes	Fatigue and I have to pee a lot for a few hours after taking it. Blurry vision sometimes. Fuzzy headed feeling too.	I have been taking Avalide for about 2 years. A couple of months ago when I moved, I talked a new doctor into letting me go off it for a week, but only if I checked my BP every day. OMG! After a couple of days, I had so much energy I couldn't believe it! But, my blood pressure did go up quite a bit. So, I was put back on it because of that and also said I need it to protect my heart because I also have type 2 Diabetes.	F	42	2  years	6/10/2008
5	HBP	Slight dizziness after periods of inactivity.	Most side effects that I've had in the past were largly due to the other products that I was on.  I've was on Avapro then moved to Avalide 6 months ago.  It works great and my BP is now 123/82 (down from 165/95).  I love the once a day too!	M	40	6  months	5/30/2008
2	CAD? HOCM/LVH?	I was given samples of this med 1 month ago.  I think I know why I was given samples now after reading the comments here. I hate taking drugs so I cut these in half and took one in the AM and one in the PN just in case I had side effects.  Well, the chest tightness is something else.  So, is the feeling of doom and the upper muscle weakness and some shortness of breath.  I recently had a heart cath so I kbnow this is not my heart doing this. My upper abdomen hurts also and franly, I feel terrible on this med.  I would rather chance not being on anything than suffer these type effects.  Good Bye-Avalide...		F	63	5  weeks	5/24/2008

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS.

His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.
