5	Actinic Keratoses	I'm in week three (two of fluorouracil, now Prutect to moisten and heal). It's as everyone described, but not as bad. It's slightly itchy and I can't wait until I can wash my face again without pain, but totally bearable. I've been in numerous social situations (work, dinner out, board meetings, shopping, new Pilates class) without problem. I was afraid children would scream and run at a glimpse of my face. Never happened. So don't let the minor downsides keep you from doing this, if you need it.		M	64	14  days5% 2X D	1/21/2012
5	Solar keratoses on my face.	No side effects.	It took about six days until I experienced the effects of the drug that I had read about--redness,blotchiness,tingling,itchiness,taut,sensitive skin. Then,I was in "full bloom". It was uncomfortable, especially in the shower. It was also rather unsightly, so as another patient said, I wouldn't plan any important social engagements. After 14 days,it began to peel a lot and formed a few scabs in the worst areas. The worst part for me was having to wash my face twice a day before each application and the cost--$241.00 for a 40 gram tube (with discount, but no prescription insurance). But I'm sure that's a lot less than dealing with cancer! Per doctor's instructions, I applied it to my face and forehead, the tops of my ears and the back of my neck. I'm extremely pleased with the results. It removed all the sandpapery and red spots from all affected areas. I hope not to, but I'd use it again in a minute.	M	61	14  days5% 2X D	4/17/2010Email
4	Genital warts	The first week I noticed no side effects. Then the doc said watch for "red & angry", and a cpl days later "red and angry" indeed. Lobster red and painful in the scrotum/penis area. Cured the warts and they haven't grown back, so it works.		M	39	21  days1% 2X D	3/3/2010
4	Aetinic (solar) keratoses	I used the 5%.  It turned my face red and crusty, but, of course, it was supposed to.  There was no pain, just a slight itching.	I am glad my dermatologist prescribed this medicine.  It is labled as a "chemotherapy" because it only attacked pre-cancerous cells.  Don't take it if you have any important social engagements in the next 28 days.	M	58	14  days	6/7/2009Email
5	Inoperable Stomach Cancer	Lost skin off soles of feet and palms of hands, very painful initially but now the soles of my feet are numb.Finger and toenails growth disrupted - discontinuity, ridging.Lost most of my hairSome Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting initiallySore eyesMouth ulcersGot very tired and lethargic	The side effects were pretty horrific and twice I had to stop taking the 5FU partway through a six week session (continuous infusion from a battery operated pump worn around the waist).  However, the blood markers progressively decreased and are now normal, so I am in remission.  After 6 weeks off the chemotherapy I have mostly recovered (except for my feet) and don't get so tired - I have resumed my normal lifestyle.	M	71	5  months	6/27/2007Email
5	Pre-Cancerous Spot on Lip	First of all, my experience with this is similar to one a co-worker had.  It's NASTY stuff!  BE SURE YOU ONLY USE IT WHERE YOU NEED IT! FLUOROPLEX (fluorouracil) 1% Topical Cream is indicated for the topical treatment of multiple actinic (solar) keratoses.For the first three days, I didn't notice any reaction. Then, on the fourth day, my lip started to redden.  Within a day, it became terribly inflamed similar to a fever blister (cold sore).  From there, it got worse by progressing to an ulcerated state.  It was horrible to look at and it hurt like you would not believe!  My dermatologist stopped the cream on Day 10.  From there, it progressed for several days before I was aware that my lip had begun to heal, although the healing was from the inside out.  I kept Aquaphor on the "wound" to keep it from drying and cracking.  It took a total of 22 days from the onset of treatment to completely healed.	I guess it's worth it, but I hope I never have to go through that again!	F	39	10  days	10/4/2005
