				F M	 	 	    
4	High Blood Pressure	none observed	Take a 240 mg capsule twice daily	M	58	3  years	4/29/2009
3	extra heart beats	impairs my thinking and reactions, depression, sense of smell reduced	120 mg/day.  This drug does stop those extra beats; BUT my thinking is not as clear as it used to be, i'm dried out and my sense of smell is reduced so that there's less taste to food, tired more than usual and somewhat depressed, psoriasis is exacerbated.  I tried a beta blocker (Metroprolol Succinate) but psoriasis symptoms were much much worse.	M	62	3  years	2/17/2009Email

3	Hypertension	Trouble with thoughts-- impairs my thinking and reactions.	My insurance company switched me to the generic version (Cartia XT) and that is when my side effects started.  The normal version of the drug (DILT-CO) seemed to work fine.  Will speak w/my doctor on my next visit.  Just a heads up for those of you like me that are having problems with thinking and organization of thoughts.	M	43	6  months	6/27/2008
