5	transitional cell cancer kidney	The usual from chemotherapy but most side-effects, except for hair loss, were curbed by Neulasta, Aranesp, Decadron, etc.	It was combined with taxol and carboplatin and knocked my cancer out in 2 months.  And I had been diagosed as stage-4 with 6-9 months to live.	M	54	4  months	2/26/2007Email
