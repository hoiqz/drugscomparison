4	hysterectomy	I have noticed no side effects -other than the obligatory weight gain I would love to blame on Enjuvia rather than self-gratification!	When I missed a pill, I did not have the immediate headache by morning that I used to have on Premarin. Enjuvia seems to do a better job of replacing my hormones as I noticed increased energy and enthusiasm for life within a week or two of starting it.	F	54	1  years1.25 1X D	8/24/2010
4	surgical menopause	None at this dose. Breast pain with higher dose, but that's to be expected.	Not as potent or long lasting as Premarin, but no side effects. The manufacturer needs to offer higher doses than the 1.25 mg. I have to take a .9mg plus a .625mg daily to feel right and it's expensive.	F	52	6  months1.525 mg 1X D	5/3/2010
