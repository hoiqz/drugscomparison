5	Status Asthmaticus - had it IV	Very vivid 'dreams' even when I just closed my eyes when I was awake and not pleasant 'dreams' very violent and horror movie (think Stephen king) like. Also when I was being visited by a relative I had to ask him to leave because he had a cartoon T shirt on and everytime I closed my eyes and reopened them he had the face of a different cartoon character and I remember constantly having to tell myself that it was ok, I knew who he was and he was safe.It's totally beyond me why people would want to abuse this drug.	I had it as a continuos infusion on a reducing dose over abot five days (twice in 4weeks) it certainly worked and I would be willing to put up with the side effects again as it played a strong role in saving my life.

1	DDS snuck it into my dental anesthi	I had a full mouth rebuild under general anesthesia, and before I was medicated, I told the Dr to NOT give me ketamine- he  pushed the IV into me.	This crap is supposed to help people re emerge from full sedation-It turned an otherwise pleasant experience into a nightmare- As soon as I woke up from the dental work,- I was agitated and horrified for many hours afterwards- I even contemplated suicide- take this at your own dire risk.

4	neuropathic pain	I didn't have any major side effects - my vision went blurry - but this cleared after a couple of months - otherwise it was very useful in managing the pain from RSD/ CRPS.		F	21	15  months	1/26/2007
