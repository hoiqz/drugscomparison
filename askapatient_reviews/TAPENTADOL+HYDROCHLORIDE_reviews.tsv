3	Chronic & Acute Pain: Ehlers Danlos	Ha! Who knows.. Everything? I take Nucynta 100 ER and 75 IR (2x) in addition to Voltaren 75 (2x), Vyvanse 70, Propranolol, Valium, Bentyl, Nexium, Zofran, there's an entire list..	Basically, Nucynta initially provided a wonderful respite from my widespread chronic pain, and still does in large doses, but it's not worth the side effects/withdrawals.. I have a connective tissue disorder that causes organ issues, joint pain and  dislocations, along with other comorbid conditions like MVP/Dysautonomia, heart arrhythmia, Spinal Arthritis, Costrocondritis, etc., which can all be very difficult to manage, especially at my age. However, after several months of relief, I feel the Nucynta has caused a MAJOR recurrence in partial seizures and has also (in conjunction with the NSAIDS) caused painful Gastroparesis. For the past month, at least, I've also become quite temperamental and depressed, at times w/ suicidal ideation- NOT normal for me and an obvious chemical imbalance in the brain. I also wake up in near excruciating pain EVERY SINGLE MORNING until I've had about 3 hours for the meds to kick all the way back in. The sharp increase in baseline pain/immediate withdrawal is unbelievable and includes full body aches/'bone' feeling pains, severe weakness and sweating, extreme nausea, pallor, etc. I'm hoping to wean back off of this ASAP but on such a high dose I cannot do this on my own. Even under a pain management doctor's discretion, this drug should be used EXCEEDINGLY carefully in conjunction with other heavy medications and multiple coexisting conditions, and, in my opinion, simply should not be given to anyone with a history of seizures.

3	Chronic neck pain/arthritis	After taking 2 50mg  6 hours earlier waking up in the middle of the night tossing and turning with pins and needles sensation and unable to go back to sleep. Took a Xanax to try to releave the anxious feeling but, it did nothing. Took a piece of hydroxyzine and finally went to sleep but, woke up with pins and needles again. AWFUL! Had to miss work.	It does help with the pain but, still can feel it slightly.	F	46	4  days50 mg 4X D	5/21/2013Email
1	pain from TFCC sprain in wrist	I took my first dose about 6am on 5/9/13 for pain that was keeping me awake. I felt a warming calm and thought that maybe this was going to work. Within an hour I felt violently sick with nausea (kinda like drinking way too much). I tried to eat some crackers, but it didn't help. Although it didn't make it any worse. About 45 min later I passed out. I woke up about 6 hours later wondering feeling lost and confused. I decided that this was not the drug for me. I was out of it a bit, but had to go to work. BTW I did not get any relief from the pain in my hand. I went home and was back in bed by 8pm. I took an 800mg Motrin and I slept off and on and had a headache and felt stuffy and restless. I woke up off and on from about 2am to 6am from pain in hand, headache, constipation and stuffiness. I slept from about 6am to 9am 5/10/13 and got up to get ready for work. I felt a bit groggy, but thought it was due to lack of sleep. I had a few errands on my way to work and noticed that I was shak	I told my Dr that tramodol causes me to itch. She prescribed norco which also caused me to itch. The Nucynta also caused itching.	F	43	1  days50 1X D	5/13/2013Email
1	Severe back pain	I took ONE pill of 150mg ER and I am on day 4 of being so violently sick, weak and unable to stay awake that I've ever been in my life!!  I even ended up at the hospital with no doctor able to tell me anything at all about this pill or what to do to even help me. My PM doc gave this to me to take along with perc 10s for pain and even he didn't warn me of the side effects. I can't go back to work cause I can't even drive. I am worried this pill is going to kill me.		M	38	1  days150	4/20/2013Email

2	Back and leg pain	Nausea, stomach gurgling, dizziness, feeling like I was developing a chest cold and terrible mood swings.	Switched to this med after Percocet only provided two hours of relief.  Started at 50 mg, increased to 100 mg about two days later.  Eleven days into treatment, pain relief is maybe four hours at best.  Considering pain relief is marginal, the side effects are not worth it.  Discontinuing.	M	40	11  days100 mg 2X D	2/18/2013
4	Degenerative Bone	Took Nucynta ER @ 8 PM.  went to bed.  Got up next morning and had not feelt this good in a long time. ( (Doctor had reduced me to 1 pill a day).  I drank a lot of coffee that morning and had some enroute to work 40 miles away.  Little over half way As I was driving I must have been in a trance as I did not remember anything for last 10 miles when I was stopped by Deputies and charged with DUI.  (I do not drink what-so-ever).  Found ater toxicology report finished 9 months later by the state that I was twice over legal limit to be in a vehicle, especially driving.  Advice to all who take this MEDICATION.  Dont take this medication and drive or drink coffee.  Side effects are massive.  This could have killed me instantly.		M	54	9  days100	2/11/2013Email
1	lower back pain; degenerative disk	Dr. prescribed one Nucynta 75 mg every 4-6 hours.  Immediatley started having upset stomach.  First three days, could not wake up or get out of bed for hours.  At work, felt zoned-out, dizzy, tired. Had persistent headaches; felt bloated, nauseous. Pain continued to be dull, persistent.  Felt depressed;began having respiratory problems. A major side effect is respiratory illness/disease.  Had trouble sleeping b/c of persistent pain; trouble concentrating. Cramps, night sweats ensued. Had the squirts, but  never had a good bowel movement. Could not take my amitriptyline, so was difficult to sleep; watched movies until dawn the first few days. No hallucinations, euphoria. Had short term memory loss; could not remember things: why I was returning some customers phone calls or remembering who I was speaking to. (Very bad for business!)  Was confused and frustrated, and had consistent, dull pain. Had tremors when typing/writing. Since complaining, prescription nurse thinks I am crazy and do	My RPh. advised me that Nucynta works differently than other pain narcotics.  Did not quite understand but I got the impression that it tricks your brain into blocking/receiving pain from your nerves. I tried to research "How Does Nucynta Work?" on-line. I discovered that experts do not know why/how it actually works. I told about the new medication  and that I was feeling weird.  She told me about the "Ask a Patient" website, and I was appalled at what I discovered.  Apparently, my pain specialist does not know about the side effects either because when I called to advise him of what was going on, his prescription nurse called me back and told me that my doctor thought I had a stomach virus and that I needed to make an appointment with my primary care physician.  Now, my pain specialist has done wonders for me in the past so I am not trying to knock him, but I really think that the pharmaceutical companies get their representatives out there and sell doctors all over the country that this med or that is the "best thing since sliced bread."  My pharmacist has been my family pharmacist since I was a teenager.  And he keeps up with the times.  He has an app on his smart phone that can notify him of any possible interactions with other meds I am taking.  In this case, I was advised that I could not take amitriptyline (an anti-depressant also used in low doses to treat sleep disorders) which this same physician had prescribed to help me get to sleep	M	53	8  days75 6X D	2/10/2013

1	Chronic pain - IC and Endometriosis	WOW! Have had to try lots of narcotics, etc. and this one takes the cake. Started off first night with hallucinations in bed and grabbed onto my husband. Woke up extremely depressed out of no where in morning and hung over. Took another morning dose and suicidal ideation came on. Zombie, zoning out, no motivation, blood pressure dropped to not being able to get up. Icing on the cake? A psychotic break from reality that I only have a history of happening ONCE after PTSD from long hospital stay in combination with one other drug. I hate posting, in part because if this drug helps others I don't want to scare or sway you from trying it. Just be cautious and be with a loved one the first time to see how it effects you. Seems split down the middle 50/50. Love it or hate it. Just wanted to tell my story so if same happens to you, you know you aren't "crazy".		F	29	3  days25-50	9/28/2012

1	Severe muscle cramps	Within 30 minutes it took effect. I had severe dizziness and it increased the muscle cramps that would come in jolts of excruciating stabbing pains. It soon gave me severe hallucinations of bugs crawling everywhere and creatures on floor grabbing at me and shadowy figures watching me. Whenever the pain would subside and my breathing would calm  down I'd see something that wasn't there and I'd get so scared I'd have a panic attack and I couldn't close my eyes because then the room would spin.

4	Degenerative disc disease	Nausea/ VomitingFlushed skinOverheating	Despite the side effects this medication has helped a lot. I take it every 6 hours as needed. I noticed it only lasts me 4 hours but I was able to come off Oxycontin and OXYCODONE to this and I believe its better for my pain. I will be switching to the ER soon.

4	Very bad back	Night Sweats (Bearable), LOTS of vivid dreams at night, sleepy/dizzy first few days, Feeling a bit off sometimes	Overall, I have several problems in my back (Herniated Discs, Degenerative disc disease, Arthrosis, etc.). I found that the medecine doesn't help with the back pain, though it does tone down the other pains related to my condition (pain in legs and hip.) It helps a LOT to sleep at night, I sleep like a bbay even though I have VERY vivid dreams in the morning... Also some night sweats, but hey... At least, I get more than the 2 hours of sleep on an eight hours period I used to get!	F	22	3  months100 2X D	7/21/2012Email

4	Chronic pain	Started takin 75 mg 5 weeks ago 2x a day, first couple days it upset my stomach and i was a lil spacey.after that i could tell that my pain had lessoned some but after  8 to 10 hrs of waitressing i was still in pain.  Seen dr. last week, he prescribed 100 mg 4x a day, then i had to wait until yesterday for my pharmacy to get it in, due to the fact that its new. so this is day two of the higher dosage, and i..feel wonderful. I have never been treated for my chronic pain, and Ive hurt for yrs. dont like meds, remember my grandmother taking so many, and i have avoided drs for yrs.  so after yrs of not having a family dr. i finally broke down due to high blood pressure and go see dr. He has promised to make me a new woman..other then the availability of it at my local pharmacy (which is now taken care of) and the 5 days that i had to go without it (cause my pain seemed twice as bad)..i have no complaints. its working for me		F	42	60  days100 mg 4X D	6/14/2012Email

4	Pain Management for Back/Feet	Slight dizziness and euphoria; otherwise, no side effects for me.	I love this medication. It didn't take the pain away 100%, but it did a much better job than Norco or Percocet. I take this every 4 hours throughout the day with 5 mg Percocet as needed for any severe breakthrough pain. It's fantastic. I waited a day before driving on it, but now I can function fully on it with no problems. I would recommend this in place of Norco or Vicodin for long term relief.

1	Hip and leg pain	I took one tablet at night & my heart was racing & I was dizzy. After @2 hours I felt better. I took another tablet the next night and I started vomiting then when I stood up I got very dizzy. My heart started racing so hard it felt like knocking & all I could think is this stuff is going to kill me. I had to wake up my husband and have him sit with me in case I needed to go to the hospital. After about 3 hours of cold sweats, dizzy, blurred vision and my limbs felt so heavy, I finally fell asleep. I will never take this again! I understand we all react in different ways to medication, but I prefer percocet over this.		F	30	2  days100mgx1	5/6/2012
5	Interarticularis Pars Defect (LBP)	Occasional Constipation. Sometimes euphoria (But I think that is more from being happy that I can actually function without pain for a while)	Works great for me.  I'm actually taking a 100mg ER in the morning and then 2 75mg for breakthrough pain.  Some days I don't take the full dosage if not needed so they are not very addictive in my book.  I've been prescribed Talwin and Tramadol in the past.  Nucynta has worked the best for me.	M	39	1.5  years75 MG 3X D	4/30/2012Email

5	Chronic Pain, Deep Muscle Tissue	A speedy effect is noticed. Every time I took it in the beginning I noticed my heart rate increased. Sometimes I slight headache if I hadn't already taken my NSAID. Great pain relief. For myofascial pain it is better than methadone, vicoden, tramadol or dilaudid.	I took this on top of methadone 25mg/day. I like it so much that this week I plan to start switching from methadone to Nucynta ER.	M	19	1  years75 MG 3X D	1/29/2012

1	lower back pain	I just started taking Nucynta two days ago and I hate it. I hate the anxious feeling I have, the zombified feeling, and just want to cry for the past two days. It makes me so irritable I cant stand to be around myself for the past two days. I will not take this again. I dont see how anyone can get addicted to this, its awlful, who would want to feel like that all the time, well not me.		F	37	2  days100 mg 1X D	11/17/2011
4	neuropathic pain	Depth perception a bit off, hard to describe, but almost seems to put you in a 2D world vice 3D world....very odd.  No sedation or constipation.	Figured since no info on the ER version, I'd post on Nucynta ER.  Just started a couple of days ago for neuropathic-type pain.  One 100mg/day, so I only get 12 hours of relief.  I have short acting opioid to augment.  No opioid "carefree" feelings at all, but seems to work on the pain a bit.  Not perfect, but given the side effect profile is almost non-existant as opposed to other types of opioids, it provides some relief, knocking my pain down from a 5 to about a 2-3, I'd say.  If you are looking for a LA medication that allows you to be functional at work, this is a good choice.	M	40	3  days100mg 1X D	11/4/2011
5	RSD/CRPS; DDD;Spinal Stenosis	Only constipation like all pain meds cause, easily solved with Miralax.	Definitely try it for yourself, people either love it or hate it. For me, I'd take it over Dilaudid, Fentanyl or similar class meds in a heartbeat. I get no drugged feeling from this. I can stay alert and active but without the pain. I love it!

1	Pain	Heart pounding, mind racing a mile a minute	Ear surgeon prescribed 75 mg after ear surgery.  About 30 minutes after taking one tablet, my heart began pounding, my mind started racing - felt like I was having a heart attack!  Ended up in ER with high b.p. and an elevated heart rate.  ER doc said it is a bad medicine.  Reported this to FDA.  Do not recommend this!!	F	44	1  days75 MG 1X D	8/13/2011
5	s1 radiculopathy/labral tear in hip	Sinus congestion, hangover (possibly due to Lyrica mixed with it)	I take .25mg of Xanax every 4 hours and 75mg of Lyrica 3 x daily.  The doc put me on Nucynta a week ago.  I wasn't too happy once i got home and read that it's similar to Ultram.  I couldn't understand how it's a Schedule II and still don't.  I take it about an hour before bed and before I know it I'm nodding off.  I'm sure it's also because of the Xanax and Lyrica.  I've been sleeping great and feeling no pain at night.  Nucynta is nothing like Oxy, Lortab/Vicodin or Morphine.  It's not heavenly as I like to call them.  It's more like Ultram but instead of keeping me wired it actually puts me down.  It's very relaxing.  I'm shocked that it's a CII.  That is too funny. It shouldn't even be a controlled drug.  You might try Lyrica and Nucynta if you're in great pain but only at night.  It'll put you down quick, which is good!	M	31	7  days50 1X D	7/23/2011
5	Back and knee pain	I found there to be little side effects.   This drug only relieved pain,  there was little to none of the side effects recreational drug users like.   If you are looking for a buzz this is not the drug for you.    If you just want pain relief this is the best drug I have been prescribed.

4	RLS/PLM	Extreme and consistant nausea with vomiting to the point of being unable to keep food and other medications down.  Lost 10 pounds in 3 weeks.  Feelings of difficulty breathing even though oxygenation levels remained within norms.	I started at 50mg 2x daily for severe Restless Legs Sydrome when Mirapex ceased being effective.  At that level I got absolutely NO relief.  When dosage was increased to 100mg 2x daily in addition to 2mg of Mirapex daily I did get significant relief.  When taking the same dose without the mirapex I got some relief for shorter periods of time with leg and arm pain being extremely bad as soon as the Nucynta wore off and for a few hours until I was able to take my next dose of Nucynta.  With the pain getting out of control between doses the Nucynta was less effective even during maximum effective times.  The breathing issues did seem to lessen after about a month but the nausea and vomiting remain constant.	F	51	2  months100mg 2X D	11/22/2010Email
2	Lower back pain	Already experiencing symptoms exactly as described by various individuals in discussion forums.  While my pain was dulled some, it came at a heavy price.  Experienced serious "twiching" shortly after exposure to the drug. Involutary muscle spasms &/or the twitching.  On twiching for example:  my entire neck twiched and came back so fast could see the blur from the movement.  General loss of focus.  Took 1.5  10mg diazepam (valium), and has not kicked in almost 2 hours later. Seems to be an issue with increased insommnia (AS if I needed anymore of that) Could almost feel slight panic attacks and anxiety surfacing.	I've noticed a mixed bag of comments from users, and most are on the negative side.  Some of the positive reviews are so cookie-cutterish , it appears an agent from the pharmacuetical company wrote them to try and balance the ratio from bad to good.  May try it one more time tomorrow, but if this twitching continues, it is just too much for me to bear.  (BTW injuries: pelvic fracture from many yrs ago, tried Vicodin, Opana (boo), the hydro codone family has the least amount of side effects which makes what lies ahead of me kinda scary.  Good luck all	M	30	1  days50-100 3X D	10/20/2010
3	Lower Back Pain	Dizzy, Euphoria, Tired, Relaxed.	I was prescribed Nucynta 75mg about a wee ago. The med is ok so far in relieving pain, short term. Takes some of the withdrawl symptomes away that I recently encountered with Oxycodone 5-325 and Hydrocodone 10-500. I have 3 buldging discs and 1 herniated..L-5 S-1. I have been doing some resarch and the reviews so far are 50/50 good and bad. People react different to certain medications. Hope you guys find some relief with this medication. My doctor says it has less of an addicting nature to it..which I hope is true!..Take Care guys!	M	27	5  days 2X D	9/15/2010
4	hysterectomy	Euphoria.  Headache.  Slight upset stomach.  Lessened pain.	I felt Nucynta worked well.  It gave me headaches if I didn't drink enough water, but it took most of the pain away.  It is touted as not being addictive, but I found it slightly addictive.  It gives a sense of euphoria and I had some withdrawal symptoms when I stopped it.	F	37	14  days50 mg 3X D	9/14/2010
1	Chronic migraine pain	Experienced symptoms of withdrawal after taking this med for one week. Nausea. Very similar pain relief and weird feeling as tramadol.	This med made me feel crazy, but could have interacted with preventatives I am on.  Did nothing for me for pain relief and made me feel like an addict. I quit taking it and resumed after a week, and after one day had withdrawal symptoms again. Not for me!	F	40	30  days50-75 1X D	9/5/2010

3	back injury	Irritable for no reason, bad memory, not happy as usual.	Update from previous entry. It worked for pain, but side effects not worth the relief. Other meds have less undesirable side effects. Took myself off nucynta (3 week ordeal). Memory and thinking improved.	M	58	6  months100mg 3X D	7/12/2010
3	Chronic pain, Insomnia	Sleepiness, full body twitching, shaky hands when it first hits you, mild euphoria, mild itching, urinary difficulty, severe short term memory loss that leads to inability to maintain conversations, Catatonia-like freezing in place (like a statue) especially when first prescribed.	Taken at higher doses (ex. 400 mgs in one dose) this med feels a lot like Demerol. Starts with a slight euphoria that feels very calming and chill, but as it increases in the bloodstream there is MAJOR confusion and memory loss in mid-sentence. "Out of it" feeling. Forget to swallow food in my mouth. It's like someone hit the pause button on the remote. On the upshot, pain control is great and sleep is not as disturbed as oxycodone or hydrocodone.

2	Pain Management	fuzzy 'out of touch' feeling; slight dizziness and feeling of sadness. Some abdominal discomfort.	Drug was touted as pain mgmt/anti-depressant. Didn't do much for my pain and I developed a feeling of hopelessness and cried alot.	F	55	14  days50 mg 3X D	6/17/2010Email
5	neck and back injury, bursitis	Dizzy/floaty "high" feeling first day (very much like the nitrous at the dentist). Some sweating/feeling warm.	First day, dizzy and felt a bit spacey, but not in a bad way. It was kind of like, "Weeeeee!" if that makes sense. That part has gradually lessened each day; today just felt slightly euphoric but no dizziness. Doesn't keep me awake at night like oxycodone does (WOOT!), no itching, no nausea when taken with food, no headaches. Hips/bursitis feeling great, almost zero pain when sitting for extended periods. Overall, very happy with this med so far!.	F	40	5  days100 2X D	5/7/2010
4	Back pain, degenerative.	After using percocet for 8 years, not effective enough. Nucynta helps with pain as well as percocet. Taking both now. Problems are: constipation, slight upset stomach unless taken with food. A little irritation at times. Mood- can't put finger on it but know something is different, not as normally happy. Insomnia.	Nucynta 100 mg has same effect on pain as Percocet 10/325 mg.	M	58	2  months100 mg 2X D	2/6/2010
1	foot surgery	depressed, agitated, very emotional, crying a lot, couldn't eat (not good for healing),just felt sickly and gross(never experienced this feeling before), night sweats, heart racing, extra sleepy or wired (couldn't win), panic attack, constipation, etc.	Had switched to Nucynta after a week on Oxycontin and Vicodon.  I had to stop using this stuff.  I am normally a very positive happy person.  It didn't help my pain enough for the hopelessness it caused.  Quit cold turkey after two weeks on pain meds.  Had two sessions of colon hydrotherapy sessions to help get toxins out and constipation flowing.  Dealt with withdrawals (3 days) and pain from surgery, but was worth feeling like myself mentally.
