5	chronic constipation	none	Doctor told me to start at 30 ml. and gradually increase dosage by 5 ml. every three days until "your bowel movement becomes so powerful that you cannot under any circumstances ignore or avoid a daily bowel movement."  He added, "You really can't overdose on lactulose because any excess amount is just expelled.  Take with breakfast."At first, all it produced was a gurgling effect in my stomach about noon.  As the dosage increased, my constipation decreased and my bowel movements become easier. But, at the same time, I developed pungent and voluminous flatulence that I had to control to avoid social embarrassment.  At the above dosage, there is a feeling of a hot bowel movement pushed out by gas and bloating.  You can ignore it for a while if you want to, but eventually the urge becomes such that you can think of little else.  Finally, panic sets in and you must find a bathroom quickly because there really is no alternative.	M	66	 150 ml 1X D	6/23/2010
