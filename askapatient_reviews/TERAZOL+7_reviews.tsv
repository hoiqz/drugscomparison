3	Yeast Infection (C. Glabrata)	Sore throat, labial pain and swelling	I was prescribed this med for a yeast infection but not due to candida. The type is called C. Glabrata which can be immune to the AZOLE family, but it's known to have about a 40% cure rate in this particular species. It's FAR better than monistat. I would use this for seven days over monistat any one day for sure. I have noticed some small improvement but not as much as I had hoped. We didn't expect much, though, given cure rate for this type of yeast. I did however experience a sore throat and extra swelling and pain since using this medication. The sore throat is not accompanied by any kind of drainage or other symptoms, my tongue is slightly tender and swollen as well, so I'm thinking I may have a slight allergy to this medication. Overall, if you can tolerate 7 days of feeling slimy and mushy, it's not so bad.	F	33	7  days0.4 1X D	10/4/2012Email
1	vaginal yeast infection	This drug does not work. I felt somewhat better after 2 days, but after that all the symptoms came back again. I doubled the length of time prescribed, but still the symptoms were there. I had to use Canesten, and that cleared everything up just fine. Will not use this drug again. The only benefit is that it is prescription, and therefore covered by drug plans.		M	57	14  days20 mg. 1X D	4/29/2010
5	yeast infection	none	I have used terazol 7 twice now, and each time it worked like a charm. Messy during the day, but so relieving and sooo preferable to suffering with burning and itching. I love this medicine. Each time it cleared up a very bad infection. Starts to burn on day 7 for me, maybe from the treatment, then it clears up. Also good on the surrounding skin as well as inside.
