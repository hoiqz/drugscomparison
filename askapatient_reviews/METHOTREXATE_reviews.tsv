5	Psoriasis	Nausea on the day of medication. I don't mind loosing one day to live the rest of the week. Started as 2.5mg X 3 per week for 2 months.	Methotrexate changed my life. Psoriasis covered my entire body including my scalp and face. I took occational breaks from work to deal with this situation. Last year my doctor finally decided to start Methotrexate. It has changed my life ever since. Now, after 10 years I have a normal life once again. Thanks to Methotrexate!!!	F	27	10  months2.5mg 2X W	6/24/2010Email
3	RA	when dose increased from 15 to 20 mg and after injection results were fine and pain reduced considerably. however persistant drycough developed supposedly attributed to lung infection....course of antibiotics did not work and stopped taking mtx for two or three weeks, still have dry cough and only improving very slightly and slowly.....don't know what to think about continuing with mtx in future.....	was intrigued when I was CHEST x-rayed before taking first mtx ??after all my pain was in hands and feet! It would seem lung inflammation is a side effect of mtx and I am sure that this is the cause of this dreadful cough... have stopped taking mtx till further notice...watch this space	M	73	5  months20mg 1X W	6/6/2010
