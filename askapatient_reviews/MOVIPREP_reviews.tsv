5	Colonoscopy prep	None.	I took this for my fourth colonoscopy, and it's the easiest prep I've used yet. Less to drink, works within an hour, and does what it's meant to do. I took a split dose--a quart the night before and a quart early the morning of the procedure. Look, they all taste awful, but get it ice cold, gulp it through straws, and suck on lollipops between gulps (clears the taste from your mouth best). And realize that you're going to have one day of discomfort to know you don't have colon cancer or, if you do, hopefully it'll be caught early. It's an ugly way to go, folks.

5	Colonoscopy	None.	This was my 4th colonoscopy and the best prep I've used.  In fact, it's the only one I was able to drink without gagging.  Yes, it tastes pretty bad, but I chilled it and used a straw and I was surprised that I could get it down without gagging or nausea.  Also, I wasn't as dehydrated as usual when I finished the process.  I took sips of apple juice after every few slugs, and kept a lemon drop handy to get rid of the taste.  I also drank about 2 liters of water/apple juice after each liter (with my doc's permission).I have scopes every 5 years now because of my family histor, and although I don't look forward to the prep, it's always great to get the procedure behind me.  Better than cancer.	F	61	1  days1 liter 2X D	8/16/2012
4	colonoscopy prep		Taste is horrible! Make sure it is icy cold and use apple juice or ginger ale as a chaser!		67	1  days 1X D	4/18/2012
3	colonoscopy	Burning sensation around my butthole, diaper rash? Chills. None stop going to the bathroom for 2 days. Taste.		F	17	1  days2 liyres	12/30/2011
5	Colonoscopy	None	In three colonoscopies this is the best prep I've used.  Why?  First, there was less drinking to be done.  Second, the bowel action comes fast ... 10 minutes or so after downing the solution.  You finish quickly too, about 20 minutes or so after the bowel movements start.	M	55	1  days 1X D	6/6/2011
1	Colonoscopy	Disgusting taste, deeper hole in wallet	Moviprep tastes disgusting!!  I could not even finish the first 8oz. I did a little research on the internet and turns out Moviprep is the same thing as Miralax and then some added electrolyts.  I went to the store bought the equivilent amount of miralax and some grape flavored propel.  Worked like a charm and was soooo much cheaper than the Moviprep.	F	25	  1X D	9/28/2010
