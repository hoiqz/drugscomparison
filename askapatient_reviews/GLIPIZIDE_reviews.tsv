4	Diabetes type II	No side effects noted, except that it did not bring my blood sugar down below 130-140.  I could not tolerate GLucophage so the doctor switched me to glipizide.	Heck of a lot better than the side effects I had with Glucophage.  Just wish it brought my blood sugar level lower.  Actos was added to me regimen and now I have side effects again.  May have to go on insulin.	F	56	21  months	11/3/2008
3	diabetis	WEIGHT GAIN, 20 pounds in 1 year, unable to get off.  Lack of desire to exercise as before.	I had been on Metformin 1000mg x 2 and Actos 30mg x 1 per day for one year with no results in lowering my blood sugar levels.  Added 5 mg Glipizide.  After being on Glipizide for 2 days all my counts went from 175+ in mornings to normal range around 125- mornings.  Impressive, but I have no energy or interest in walking, which I did 4 miles x 5 or more per week for 7 years prior. Now after a year results are no longer there. Lack of walking?? Don't know.  Did atkins diet, modified with fruit and healthful diet for 3 months, lost 1 pound.  Last time on it I lost 30 pounds in 4 months.  The weight gain is depressing.   Now at 5mg no longer working.  How much weight will I gain with higher levels?	F	49	15  months	4/15/2007
