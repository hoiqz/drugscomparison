1	Herpes	This generic drug didn't do one thing for me.  I had to buy the brand name, which my insurance doesn't cover.	My pharmacist told me that generic drugs don't work for everybody and to take 2 at a time to see if that works.  It doesn't.  The pharmacist says that the generic has the same active ingredient but if that is so, why doesn't it work?  Is anybody else having this problem with this generic drug?

3		Stomach discomfort. Yeah, my tummmy is not happy.	Is Ranbaxy valacyclovir working as well as other generics? So far I've pretty much had the same side effects with this generic as I did with the brand Valtrex.	F	32	4  months 1X D	3/9/2012
