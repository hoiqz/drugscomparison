4	Colonoscopy prep	Nothing	From experience I knew to eat soft foods two days before prep. Then all liquids the day before. Started the Colyte at 530am. After 1/2 bottle (2L) I was already clean. As usual I will tell everyone at the hospital I drank the whole bottle but I "ain't gonna drink no more" (excuse the bad English)	M	69	1  days4 L 1X D	8/8/2012
3	Colonoscopy Prep	Laxative	Fortunately it did not cause cramping.  I did mix Crystal Light lemonade mix in it so it made it more palatable, but after drinking so many liters, it got to be way too much.  I drank the first 2 liters in about 1-1/2 hours, and the laxative started working after about 1 hour 20 minutes.  I drank the last 2 liters in about 2 hours.  It continued to work throughout the night, so I got very little sleep.  I found out that I should have drunk a LOT of water after the 2nd liter, to clear out the Colyte.  This was supposed to be prep that caused the least damage to kidneys.	M	52	1  days4 liters 1X AN	3/16/2010
1	Colonoscopy prep	Horrible migrane type headache, nausea.  Worked fast, 1 hour.  Found it impossible to drink whole 4 liters.  I am a small woman, 5", 105lbs.  No way to ingest that much liquid.  I almost feel toxic from having ingested it.  Horrible stuff!!!!!	I would not recommend this to my worst enemy.  I have had the phospho-soda before and that was much less to drink and had better effect.	F	46	1  days	7/22/2006
4	prep	took 3 hours to take effect.  It was the unflavored Colyte.  First 1/3 of the jug was ok, then started gag reflex each gulp.  A straw helped with that.  but 3/4 done and no results.  After laying down a bit things started.  The last 4 cups were ok.	seemed to work.  I used some sort of powder in a lot less water last time, worked as well without that whole gallon of fluid.
