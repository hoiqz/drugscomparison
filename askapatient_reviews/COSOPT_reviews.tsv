1	glaucoma	such severe stinging & burning, it nearly put me off eye drops for good	dr switched me to another similar drop called azarga. much much more comfortable.	M	58	4  weeks	2/1/2010
5	Open-angle glaucoma	Slight stinging/irritabilty in eyes shortly after administering.	I was taking Timoptic 1x/day and was switched to Cosopt 2x/day to try to get eye pressures lower than with the Timoptic.  I am doing MUCH better on the Cosopt than I was on the Timoptic, as the beta-blocker ingredient seems to be less potent.  I am a runner, and switching to Cosopt has helped me to be able to run faster and more effortlessly than when I was on the Timoptic. And so far my pressures are closer to where my eye doctor wants them to be.	F	47	9  months	3/24/2008
1	open angle glaucoma	Stinging upon administration of drops, red, itchy eyes, slight headache, allergic eyes	I took timoptic, one of the ingredients in cosopt, for 20 years without problems.  But my pressure was creeping up around 25-27, so dr. tried adding the eye diuretic.  It was uncomfortable for me and didn't lower the pressure at all.  I do have sensitive eyes, though, apparently.  Timoptic alone (or generic timolol) never bothered me.	F	58	1  months	11/17/2007
2	glaucoma	faint-feeling,chest pain,palpitations,dyspnea etc(mostly cardiac/respiratory symptoms)	not a good experience with this drug..prescribed two times a day but only tolerable once a day and I skip a day if symptomatic. ...awful but doc would not change it. i wondered if preservatives were at fault but doc shot that down.

1	glaucoma	I developed corneal decompensation.  I was unable to read, watch TV, drive or do any of the things I usually do. This lasted for several months.		F	75	4  weeks	2/18/2007Email
