1	flu	Immediately after taking the drug, my son would cry and scream uncontrollably for an hour.  It was horrible!  The doctor never warned me anything like this could happen.	I would take care when giving this to a little one.	M	1	2  days	2/10/2009Email
5	Parkinson's	At first I had the fatigue and brain fog, but that went away after awhile.	My doctor prescribed 100mg 3x per day, but she had me titrate up to this dosage. For the longest time I was doing well with with 2x, but as time went on I upped to 3x. After 9 months, however, I no longer feel the increased energy levels and my tremor has increased in my right hand and jaw. There's a possibility that I will need to go on a drug holiday to induce the dopamagenic effects that this antiviral has.	M	46	9  months	11/30/2007Email
4	flu	extreme cramping and constipation, a little hallucination on first day only, had to skip a dose every couple days, but it worked very well	It worked like magic to reduce horrible flu symptoms to almost nothing in a short time.	M	54	5  days	12/29/2005
1	flu	My 4 year old son took for two days and became psychotic, violent, horrendously out of control, biting and hitting to harm and then clinging to me feeling frightened and confused.  This was DANGEROUS and horrid and I recommend care if your child is sensitive to things like sugar or other medication.  Very scary drug.	Why no warnings about this possible effect?  Was possibly amplified by oral steroid (begins with a D) usually given for croup.	M	4	2  days	6/1/2005
