5	Migraines	feeling of heavy forehead, slightly puffy forehead, limited movement of brows.	has stopped the migraines.  can still feel the warning of the migraine, aura, pressure around the eye.  but it doesn't grow into a migraine.  had to pay out of pocket as my insurance wouldn't cover it but it's changed my life!  I went to a facial plastic surg. who has alot of Botox experience.	F	51	5  days100+ 1X O	3/19/2013Email
1	Migraines	Intolerable face and head pain - migraines much worse after getting injections , Bedridden because of the pain and nausea, also had trouble swallowing food, had to wear soft neck collar a while to keep head upright ( hospitalized for 3 weeks) and hair loss	I felt somewhat bullied into trying Botox, my neuro at the time gave many people Botox , I had been to urgent care several times for pain - a pain shot would usually give me relief , make me sleep , and I often would have weeks of No or manageable head pain  . Before Botox I had bad migraines, but with interventions I was able to take care of my 2 special needs children, take them to ot pt and speech therapies, homeschool- etc I also began taking care of my father after he had a stroke and could not stay at his home . Since the Botox shots my unrelenting and excruciating pain made it impossible to get out of bed most days, kids had to be placed in public school, have only been able to drive a handful of days in four years.  I am still having excruciating pain, My gut reaction was not to get the Botox . I let others sway my decision.That's my experience. ( Botox injections were about 23 injections head and forehead- in 2008)	F	45	1  times2 vials ? 1X D	9/14/2012
1	Chronic headaches	Headaches for about three weeks, bruising around my eyes, then massive, continuing hair loss.	I love the look of my smooth forehead, unwrinkled eyes, and no more headaches, but my hair has lost fifty percent of the volume, and I'm still losing it. I'm terrified and worried that it won't stop. I've been tested for lupus, thyroid, and many others, and they all came back normal. I've not lost a large amount of weight, changed my eating, started taking any new prescriptions, over the counter medicines, supplements, or had any stressful events happen in the last year that could have caused it, except for my getting the botox injections around and between my eyes, and in my forehead. It's been a miracle for headache relief, but a nightmare because of the hair loss. I'll probably never know if it was the Botox that caused it, but I'll never have it again to find out.

5	Migraine Headache	None	After YEARS of daily headaches, this has provided relief.  I have had no side effects.  I have tried numerous other medicines both preventative and reactive, and this is the only thing that has provided sustained relief.  It is  a miracle drug.	F	45	1  years30+ inject 1X O	11/29/2011
1	forehead lines and wrinkles	I received one Botox injection in forehead from an experienced dermatologist/M.D. The next day I had weakness in my legs and felt terrible. This weakness lasted for 2 months I was lethargic and had to sleep a lot. Also  had trouble concentrating on anything and due to the weakness in my arms, I couldn't lift anything heavy.. Dr. said that it couldn't possibly be from the Botox. I know otherwise!! I will never ever get this injection again. There are many alternatives to try.		F	53	1  days 1X D	11/28/2011
5	frequent migraines	pain at injection site, forehead mostly paralysed (no wrinkles!)	Miracle drug.  Gave me my life back.  Didn't work at all the first time, slightly effective the 2nd time,  the 3rd time was the charm.  I started off getting Botox every 3 months, eventually got to every 4 1/2 months.  My migraines are always behind the eyes so I mostly got injected in my forehead which hurt a lot but the results are more than worth the pain.  Also, it's expensive but fortunately a large part is covered by my plan, and again, worth it at any cost.  My migraines went to weeks, a month, up to 2 months apart instead of 3 days out of every week.  And when I got them, they required less pain reliever to get rid of them and they didn't return.  Botox has been my lifesaver and I've recommended it to everyone I know.  Unfortunately now, after 3 years, I've apparently built up antibodies to the drug and it no longer works well for me and I have to come off it.  Am so depressed. I now need to find another drug.

1	Treatment resistant migraines	Headache, neck pain, flu symptoms, sinus pain, congestion, nausea, difficulty breathing and swallowing	Six weeks ago received 100 units of Botox for treatment resistant migraines. The injections were administered in my forehead, temple, neck and the back of my head. This was done by a well known, experienced and trusted doctor who specializes in pain mgmt. My reaction to this medication has been horrible. I have had sinus pain, pressure, bronchitis, headache and flu symptoms for six weeks now. My vision has become blurry. My mind is in a fog and I can't concentrate. I'm experiencing depression and anxiety. My ears are completely stopped up and I have been having difficulty breathing. I am dizzy and nauseas. This has been going in for 6 weeks. I lost my job because of it! My suggestion to anyone considering putting this medication in your body is do your research. I failed to do so and now I must pay the consequences. The irony is, I still have migraines. If you're considering Botox for cosmetic use, I urge you to onsider. The side effects I'm experiencing do not occur in everyone, but it could happen to you!	F	28	6  weeks100 units 1X O	4/16/2011Email
5	Migraine prevention	Soreness at injection site for a few days.	I have nearly daily migraines and had injections 9 days ago. Have not had a migraine since. My neurologist will discontinue the several other preventive meds that I am on and I will be drug free except for periodic botox injections. I suppose I will take something if and when I do experience a migraine.	M	49	 ? 1X O	4/6/2011Email
4	chronic neck, shoulder and tmj pain	i have chronic pain in my neck, shoulders and tmj joints as well as some mild low back pain and muscle tightness all over so it's really hard for me to tell what is normal pains,etc..and what may be a side effect. i don't think i have had any significant side effects. a mild to moderate stinging when it's injected depending on the area. i have about 4 rounds of injections in the past year. at 1st i didn't think it worked much at all until after the 2nd and 3rd round started to wear off and the pain increased so i realized it did work afterall. hasn't been a miracle drug but has helped me.	usually get around 30-40 injections in my neck, left shoulder, upper left arm and both tmj joints. I honestly think my doctor who uses this medicine alot hasn't quite figured out all the right spots yet to inject for the best effect.if you have chronic pain, its worth giving a try! and most insurances cover the cost (minus your co-pays and deductibles).

5	Migraines	Occasional slight bruising, tenderness at injection site for a few days	This is a miracle drug!  I have tried multiple prophilactics, and they all worked for awhile, then the effect wore off.  I no longer have to take other meds for migraines.  I only use botox.  It takes about 1 week for the botox to work after it has been injected.  I get about 30 injections each time, and the shots really don't hurt bad.  I receive injections in the forehead, temples, and neck.  With all the injections I have had, I was only bruised from two of them, and the bruise was very tiny.  I have never experienced droopy or swollen eyes like some people complain about.  I think that is probably caused by receiving injections from people that do not know how to properly inject the drug (I get it from my neurologist).  The injections sites are tender for 2 to 3 days after the injections.	F	25	1  years 1X AN	6/28/2010
3	weekly migraines	By day two, had pain at every injection site (about 20) over forehead, and back of neck.  By day four whiplash-like pain, with an inability to hold head in any position except upright without severe pain.  Eyelids are continuing to droop more each day creating a swollen appearance with slits for eyes.	Some relief from migraine pain at first, but by day 8 feeling flu-like symptoms and great pressure behind eyes.  Overall aches with ongoing symptoms of whiplash in the neck area.  Have had to take 50 mg of Imitrex on two separate days to relieve migraine brought on by pain in the neck radiating behind eyes. Was told the benefits would reach a peak at 4 weeks.  Hoping these side bad effects diminish.	F	50	8  days200 cc 1X D	5/29/2010
5	To get rid of frown lines btw. eyes	soreness from injection site	This is about the 4th time I've received BOTOX, it has worked wonders to diminish the frown lines (elevens) between my eyes. It was $240 for 20 units, but it wears off eventually. If it were free I'd go back every three months! Instead I've been going about every 9 months.	F	39	1  days20 units 1X D	4/26/2010
3		Breakouts (fluid filled bumps)on forehead and cheeks lasting (last time anyway) up until the botox was almost worn off.	Didn't have this problem until maybe the 5th or 6th time botox was injested. This last go around has been the worst. Still, I'm dreading when the botox wears off because I know I'll be too afraid to have it injected again.	F	54	3  years	9/6/2009
1	elimination of frown lines	Started evening of Day 6, insomnia, feeling wired, strange twitching sensation all over body.  Started disepating week 6 and was gone by Wk10 Didn't feel completely normal until Wk 16	I understand it's allure..the results looked great, but this is a neurotoxin with very frightening results for many people	F	50	4  months	8/30/2009
4	Medicinal purposes	Headache, pain in the injection site, flu-like symptoms, usually the first week after the injections.	I've been getting injections of non-cosmetic Botox for 4 yrs andI really don't have anything bad to say about it. When I first started to get the injections they didn't work as well. My doctor told me I had to get several rounds of Botox, before I would feel and/or see any kind of difference. Finally after two years, I felt a difference in my neck. I need the Botox b/c I have Cervical Dystonia, and it is the treatment for this horrible disorder, which can be compared to Parkinson's Disease.Yes, I may need Botox for the rest of my life, but it's better than living with pain and agony in my neck. Good luck to anyone who takes Botox for medicinal purposes, as that's why it was invented in the first place! The only thing I have to worry about is developing an immunity to it, and not being able to getany pain relief.	F	45	4  years	8/17/2009
1	cosmetic purposes	Severly hooded brow and eyelids to the point I look like like a caveman, frozen forehead,jitters, headache, rash, memory problems, dilated pupils, exacerbated my rosacea and period cramps and bleeding.	Each day another bad side effect appears.  And I went to a renowned top doctor in Westport, CT who took part in the Allergan testing and has been doing it for years. I would never subject myself to this poison again.  The side effects are awful and I have to wear glasses everywhere I go to disguise my hooded eyes.  I'm having nightmares and am stressed out beyond belief.	F	42	6  days	2/24/2009
