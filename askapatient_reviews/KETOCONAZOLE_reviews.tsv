5	Hyperadrenal/cushingoid/exhaustion	Headache, nausea, if bad enough leads to vomitting	This drug WILL give you headache, artery aches (like in the neck) and nausea. Its better to deal with it if you can lie down, but that menas you have to be in bed all day for as long as you take it. I tried a better way of working with the side effects, which was to take Ibuprofen for the headaches and that does stop them! Also, I take a very small dose of (less-drowsy formula) dramamine a few minutes before taking the dose, and I also can avoid the nausea. I would rather continue with this drug because it is the only thing I can do to tame my overactive adrenals. That condition bothers me more than this drug does, so I dont mind having to take a few steps to fix my adrenal overactivity.I have only been on this a few days I will come back to post if anything else shows up.

1	fungal infection (skin)	Horrible stomach pain and nausea	I stopped this after 3 days because the side effects were getting worse. I will never take this again.	F	30	3  days	11/27/2004
