5	birth control	I had a horrible first month on it. After that no issues. Love it		F	28	1  years	10/4/2012
3	Birth Control & Migranes	Pros: Helped migraines. Loved not having a periodCons: major hair loss over time. Use to have very thick hair, so I wasn't concerned at first, until 2/3 of it was gone. Hair everywhere all the time. Loss of libido.	I was very excited when this came out and went on it the first month it was on the market. It has been a double edged sword for me - I have a love hate relationship with it. Trying some other birth controls to see if my hair will come back. May be keeping me from losing weight (body build, run, HITT + good diet). But not sure.	F	39	5  years 1X D	3/7/2012
