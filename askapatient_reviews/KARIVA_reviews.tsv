5		Kariva cleared up my face better than any other birth control I have ever tried. Never before have I consistently had zero zits!		F	25	4  years 1X D	3/7/2013
4	Horomone Regulation	Weight gain(20 pounds), loss of sex drive	I started taking Kariva to regulate my horomones. Im not on Kariva now, but I was. It did exactly what I needed it to, without making me very moody. I did gain a decent amount of weight, but I could deal with that. The only sucky thing about this birth control is I had no interest in sex, and when I had sex I didnt feel much of anything. Its okay though, they make pills for that.

3	Birth Control	horrible acne, mood swings	Kariva did help lighten my periods and I rarely experienced cramps or breast tenderness, but my ance became horrible.  The sides of my face have broken out with terrible cystic acne and it has also shown up on my chest and back.  This is not worth it to me and I started Ortho Tri-cyclen this morning.  Hoping it works a lot better to clear up this acne.	F	24	3  months 1X D	6/22/2012Email
3	Birth Control	The only side effect that i have really noticed, like others have said is absolutely no interest in sex at all.		F	22	2.5  years 1X D	4/29/2012Email
3	birth control	Lowered sex drive.... But my period comes regularly for about 5 days. Less cramping, and this brand doesn't cost much.	Very low sex drive.	F	25	4  months 1X D	10/30/2011Email
1	birth control	Moodiness, tearfullness, yeast infections, decreased sex drive		F	32	1.5  years 1X D	9/12/2010
3	Contraceptive	Extremely low libido ..which is continuing to get worse, headaches, mild cramps and bad cystic-like acne in the beginning.	Excellent for my menstrual cycle; it lowered my periods down to approx. 3 days, very little cramping, no heavy bleeding. I also didn't experience any weight gain or loss. No moodiness that I'm aware of. Plan to get off this pill ASAP because I have absolutely no interest in sex and it's making my relationship suffer.	F	21	2  years 1X D	8/31/2010
