4	Esophageal spasms	No bad side-effects to mention.	My newly diagnosed GERD showed its initial obvious symptoms as breathlessness which turned out to be spasms in my lower esophagus. After an endoscopy to do biopsies and stretch my esophagus, I needed a stronger medicine and Librium ( as well as a simple diet) has worked beautifully!  My spasms have decreased 80%. I only take 1 pill before dinner...also use Gaviscon after smaller meals.	F	42	60  days5 mg 1X D	11/16/2012Email
4	Detox off Klonopin	Unholy vertigo/dizzyness if taken on empty stomach, otherwise nothing else really.  No sedation at all	I was on Klonopin for over a year and a half at 4 0.5mg tabs/day.  My new psychiatrist wanted to get me off Klonopin to see how I functioned without it for awhile.  So to minimize the excruciating withdrawal effects, he prescribed a 10-day diminishing regimen of Librium (4/day x2 days, 3/day x2 days, etc).  After two days of SEVERE Klonopin withdrawal, within an hour of taking the first Librium dose (with two bowls of soup) I felt amazing because the withdrawal vanished and I felt human again.  The next few days were hell because I have NEVER experienced vertigo/dizzyness/nausea on such a massive scale that would last literally all day, and I couldnt leave the house bc I wasnt comfortable driving.  I'd turn my head and the entire room went with it I was so dizzy.  In order to just walk around my apartment, if I didn't have both hands firmly on something and taking baby steps VERY slowly, I'd fall over and lose my balance.  So I quickly learned to eat something bland like some crackers or just one piece of bread 5 minutes before taking it, and strangely when I did this I was completely fine.  Never had anything make me so sick in my entire life.  It did fortunately take the edge off the coming-off of Klonopin, and severely eased the withdrawal symptoms; it didn't fully erase them, but instead of being catastrophic (I literally couldn't leave the house before this) the Librium really eased the process to the point where I could still mildly feel withdrawal symptoms but they wer	M	29	10  daysDiminishng 3X D	11/8/2012
1	Anxiety	Emotional blunting, lack of libido, apathy, sensitivity to light, cognitive issues	This medication, along with all other Benzodiazepines are absolute Hell to withdraw from, if i knew half of what i know about these so-called "medicines" i would never have gone near it, my GP said this was mild, now i know better, i am taking 18 months to discontinue this drug, withdrawal symptoms are horrific  and cause anxiety that is far worse. Avoid these drugs, they are not worth it.	M	41	 30 1X D	3/11/2012Email
4	Anxiety	Sedation and diziness	I have been in my local hospital for detox 3 times in the last 3 years for a somewhat unique issue.  I suffer cycles of severe anxiety/depression and when I do, I use a bit too much of oxycodone to try and quell it.  It never works and causes me more anxiety.  So I go to detox so I can go off it and get rest and relaxtion.  This time, the doctor used librium for me at night.  This is what he gives to the alcoholics and it seems to help them so much.  I have to say, it is the only drug that finally worked and knocked my anxiety right out and allowed me to sleep.  I suffer from chronic insomnia and this cycle caused me complete terror to go to bed.  I finally slept like a baby and had no middle of the night waking up in a panic with confusion and depersonaliztion.  It is way to sedating for me to take regularly as I feel it all day the next day.  But it may be something I can use for emergency usage when I do not have to do anything the next day.  Cant tell you how glad I am to not suffer from nonstop anxiiety for 10 hours a day that I let go for 80 days straight,	M	42	7  days25mgs 1X D	1/5/2012Email
4	Acute anxiety/chronic anxiety	At first dry mouth (still get that occasionally) and excessive daytime drowsiness,  confusion, clumsiness , and lightheadedness (went away also with time).	Have had minimal issues with this medication except when I first started taking it. It has relieved my chronic anxiety very well, I feel like a different person for the better.

5	anxiety	Calm/well-being feeling	Works very well in maintaining a calm feeling all day long without the terrible drop off effects that Xanax did for me. Xanax made me have more anxiety just knowing when I go out to events/daily duties that take hours, I knew it may wear off during those times. Xanax has done that. Libruim never does this because of its half life. I can trust I can go out and social situations without it leveling off into a possible panic attack. It is cheap in generic and lasts all day. That is comforting. Also, no side effects when stopping for a few months. Highly recommended for chronic, social anxiety and should prevent panic attacks all day. Slight feeling of drowsiness, however, better than feeling a racing, panicked mind daily.	F	27	4  months25mg 3X D	3/14/2011Email

3	anxiety	I just wanted to mention that there are withdrawal symptoms you will experience when you get off this stuff. I took 1 or 2 a day for a couple months. It's been about a week since I took one and I'm still feeling weird, really tense and easily irritated with heart racing a bit.		M	28	2  months 1X D	5/3/2010Email
3	major anxiety/panic disorder	some drowsiness	I take 150mg/day and I haven't really found it to help as much as I need it to.  It definitely helps enough to get through the day but I can still feel some anxiety trying to push it's way through. The first day I took it I felt very out of it and almost drunk.  That was only the first day.  Since then, it seems to be working better and better each day but it's still not quite strong enough.  I am no longer having anxiety or panic attacks but the general anxiety symptoms are still slightly there.  It may take awhile for this med to work properly and it's possible I just need to give it more time.	F	31	11  days	5/29/2009
5	Anxiety	Some drowsiness at first and still occasionaly.  Other times it will actually increase my energy in a methodical way.	I agree some what with what the previous poster said.  If you have crippling anxiety Librium alone long term is not the answer.  I augment my 20mg of Prozac with it and have done so for 8 years and that works.  Prozac helps it work better and vice versa.  I like it better than the more potent benzos and it has a long half life just like Valium.  Look it up.	M	37	9  years	4/1/2009
5	GAD	slight increase in hunger, nothing else to speak of	As an individual, Librium works very well for what I take it for. For severe, crippling panic, I would not recommend this drug. It's effects are very subtle and are perfectly suited to treat low level chronic anxiety. As with most anxiolytics, dependency is an issue, and should not be overlooked. That said, please avoid those people/sites that say their lives were 'ruined' by a pill, have severe and permanent damage and that these drugs should be banned. Be responsible for your actions, follow your doctors directions and live healthily. Hope my opinion helps.	M	30	5  years	10/10/2008Email
5	Anxiety/Stomach problems/EEG abnorm	I really never notice anything.  This drug has been a life saver.	It helps and does not impair me. Valium made me too drowsy and Xanax was too strong.  So was ativan.  Sometimes Librium is energizing and it has a long 1/2 life.  It has helped with my muscle tension and anxiety for years.  I have never had to increase the dose.  It's been great.	M	36	8  years	9/14/2008
4	Anxiety, Tremors, Hypothalmic Disor	No real side effects. Helps GREATLY with tremors, anxiety and sleeping. I developed a central nervous system disorder after being diagnosed with Addison's Disease (failing adrenal glands)and a hypothalmic dysfunction. I was taking 2-3 Librax a day for 3 years then tapered off for about 3 months and quit. I'm considering going back on it because the original symptoms have returned with a vengence. I've been completely off it for 2 months. However, in the meantime I'm having a good combo doctor (M.D. and homeopath) run some more tests to try and determine root causes of symptoms, as well as balance all my hormones (female, thyroid and adrenal)and check for deficiencies in vitamins and minerals.

5	Irritability	Some occassional dizziness/slurred speech, minor though.	Always seems to be at the same level.	M	35	7  years	5/25/2007
5	Anxiety	None but low dose of 10mg 3x per day.	Big difference from Ativan or Xanax.  Not as strong but seems to always be at the same level.  I really like this drug because I have never had to increase the dosage and it's cheap.	M		12  years	4/30/2007
5	Augment Anticonvulsant	I take this with depakote er and it works great.  It allows me to take less depakote and it does not slow me down like valium or knock me out like xanax.  Of all the benzo's I have tried this is the best.	10mg 3x a day does the trick	M	34	7  years	3/26/2007
1	anxiety, spasms from CNS damage	reduces anxiety, increase spasm, arthritis-like pain, muscle weakenss	it initially calmed me down 30-40 mins after first dose on first day (10 mg). after day 2 i experienced intense weakness and joint pain, much worse than what i originally had. i stopped and immediately improved physical symptoms by day 3 of being off it. had withdrawl symptoms with increased anxiety while going off of it. horrible for me!
