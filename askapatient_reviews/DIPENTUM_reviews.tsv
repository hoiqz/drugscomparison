5	crohn's	Can cause minor stomach ache sometimes but nothing that doesn't go away pretty quickly. No bad side effects.	Have had wonderful luck with this drug. Even after flares and a round of Entocort, it keeps me in check.  Would recommend it highly before all the drugs with horrible side effects!	F	59	4  years2x250mg 2X D	4/29/2012
4	UC	Acne	Have taken pentasa, asacol, mezavant& salofalk over the years but dipentum seems to have worked best, Imuran will be next on the list if I flare again	M	32	4  months	12/15/2009
