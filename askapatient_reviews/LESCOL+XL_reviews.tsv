1	High Cholesterol	I was healthy and active before Lescol. I am healthy and active again, but at age 44 I will probably be on hormone replacement for the rest of my life.Started and stopped LescolXL several times ... I would stop due to stomach-flu like symptoms which on a couple of occasions progressed to pancreatitis and the passing of black, gritty pigment gallstones (hemolytic effect). I also felt "heavy" and would catch my toe on the next step when climbing stairs. I was also depressed and mentally foggy. Finally, I was so groggy on the stuff that I slipped while pushing our trash bin and wound up with 25 staples in my head. After several months off the stuff, I was still experiencing problems and was diagnosed with extremely low testosterone.	After doing a lot of research, I concluded that my problems with Lescol were due to the grapefruit juice effect causing a chronic mild overdose that occasionally became a mega-overdose. I was not drinking grapefruit juice, however I was habitually drinking a lot of citrus-flavored sparkling water containing half the chemical cocktail that is in grapefruit juice. On occasion, consumption of orange juice or clarithromycin provided the other half of the cocktail and kicked the effect into overdrive. Users of statins should understand the chemical pathways by which they are eliminated, and what can block those pathways.	M	44	1.5  years	1/10/2007
1	High Cholesterol	Almost immediately after taking Lescol XL Felt chest discomfort. On the 3rd day the pressure was so severe that it felt like someone was pressing down on chest and the feeling extended into left arm and into neck area. Had to go to emergency room and was hospitalized for 2 additional days. Many tests were run with no positive results. Felt better on 3rd day after emergency room as was not on Lescol XL for 3 days and was released. Went back on medication and guess what. On 3rd day had to go to emergency room again and was re-hospitalized. Many additional tests were run with no positive results. After 3 days on not being on Lescol XL felt better. Was released and now it has been 1 week since not taking Lescol XL and feeling great again.		F	49	2  days	8/1/2005
