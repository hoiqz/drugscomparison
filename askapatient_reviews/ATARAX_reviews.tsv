3	Unable to sleep	Helped me sleep but felt groggy in the mornings & couldn't stop eating - put on 10 pounds over 2 months!! Stopped taking them & my appetite has returned to normal.		F		2  months10 1X D	2/14/2013
1	to help my insomnia	Best nights sleep I ever had but felt tired and depressed all the next day.  I lost my desire to exercise and experienced a significantly increased appetite.	Without medication I normally have terrible interrupted sleep, so i tried Atarax.  With 50mg one hour before bed I slept for 10 hours but didn't want to get up.  I felt tired and depressed all day and ate 50% more than I usually do.  I discontinued the Atarax after 2 days so I can't say if the bad side effects would have reduced.

3	Anxiety	Worked well for a couple of months then started to get reflux within 30mins of taking it which made my anxiety worse!	I initially started on 10mg and had to up the dose every 8 weeks as it would become less effective. Eventually decided to stop as I didn't want to keep going up.	F	23	6  months37.5mg 1X D	12/12/2012
4	Stress and anxiety	Just make me tired, for the first time but now, am fine		M	51	2  days25mg	11/30/2012
4	Autoimmune Urticaria	None	When I read your comments I felt like I should stop taking this medicine. But looking back, I see that Atarax helped me a lot with the skin rash and pruritis, although these symptomes appear only when I am awake and don't disturb my sleeping behavior as well as Atarax. Do I recommend it? of course yes, but just for a short period and not in an exessive way. Try to find out why you can't sleep in stead of handing the problem to Atarax. Good luck to all!!

1	I was taking Atarax for anxiety.	I am going to try and explain in my own words what this new "pill" that I was going to be taking was supposed to help me with. Ok I guess when I committed my self to the hospital they started me on Atarax. I wasn't ever even told I was put on a nrw medication. When I found that out I was kind of upset. I thought to myself what did they put me on? But at that time it was working. So I said to my doctor well I guess,its working. Because when I first started the new pill it was working. Ok so then I was feeling good with Atarax. Then after I got out of being watched while I was taking it. Got out of the hospital I felt fine. Then it started that whatever that this med. Was the I just started taking was different. This new med was not the same. It made me laugh that new pill Atarax it made me sit there from the first I took it to my friends that were nice people I thought and that pill was not that right medication for me.  I would take it and then I would loose it. I would sit there a laugh about nothing. If this happen to anyone else please let me know		F	26	4  weeks25mg 3x da	8/15/2012
5	Severe Itching	Drowsiness (which was the point), difficulty waking up in the morning	I love Atarax. I am taking it for a severe itch that no doctor has been able to figure out. I've been itching for 6 months now, and wasn't able to sleep at night because the itch was so extreme, I'd wake up in tears after less than an hour of sleep. With the help of atarax, I'm able to get a full night's sleep. Waking up is difficult, but I'd rather have that problem than the itchiness and lack of sleep. Unfortunately, until they figure out why I'm itching and find a way to fix it for sure, I'm going to be taking these on a nightly basis.	F	24	2  months25 1X D	8/12/2012Email
1	severe anxiety	groggy, sleepy, trouble concentrating, headaches, increase in appetite, 25 MG did nothing but 50MG knocked me out and left it hard to wake up	did not relieve anxiety	F	31	10  days25-50MG 3X D	8/10/2012Email
5	Allergies	None	Have suffered with horrible seasonal allergies. I made an appointment with an allergist for testing. I'm off the charts for seasonal allergies and indoor dust mites. She prescribed Nasonex along with irrigating my sinuses once a day in the morning. I also covered my mattress and pillows with protective covers to prevent dust mites. She also prescribed Atarax for bedtime. It works fantastic. I've never had a better night's sleep and I feel great in the morning. Wonderful drug!	M	64	14  days25 MG 1X D	8/5/2012Email
3	Hives		Hoping to dispel misinformation. 7 days ago I had a bad food allergic rxn. Bottom of my feet to the top of my head, worst on torso.  Was prescribed Atarax + 40mg Prednisone/day.  First 24 hrs: no change. After reading on sites like this about people having hives disappear in 24 hrs on Atarax, I started to worry. Even doubled up on the Atarax dose once.  48 hrs: went back to the doctor because my experience wasn't matching what I saw on the internet (this is why health care costs are rising).  The (2nd) doctor explained two important things: First, ATARAX DOES NOT MAKE HIVES GO AWAY FASTER. It only helps with the itchiness, and if I didn't need it for that, I should stop taking it. I confirmed this with the pharmacist.  Second, the only things that DO make hives disappear is a) Prednisone and b) time.  I stopped taking the Atarax at that point. End of the third day: started seeing real, substantial fading, especially on my extremities. Days 4-5: people wouldn't notice the marks unless I pointed them out. Day 6-7: pinkness barely noticeable everywhere except my chest (because of the sheer quantity that had been there). I liken the recovery time to that for acne. Hope this helps someone! Vowed I'd come back and follow up, unlike people posting "just started, hope this works" and never reporting back. Take your Prednisone, be patient, and don't take extra Atarax unless you need it for the itching. Good luck to all!	M		2  days50 MG 4X D	5/27/2012Email
4	eczema	Great sleeps - longer than usual; 7 - 8 hours.  Wild, good, dreams - consistently.  Groggy in the morning, but not for very long.	I can't see anything wrong with this drug! But I wonder if it's addictive and fear having to stop using it.  It was prescribed for nighttime itching and eczema. But when I told doc that I also suffered from insomnia, she thought this was a good choice for me. I am happy with it, but don't want to get addicted!	M	50	5  months10 1X D	4/24/2012
5	autoimmune urticaria	drowsinessvery recently splitting headache and nausea (3 days after withdrawal)	i started with 25 mg tab 1/day 7 years ago for autoimmune urticaria. after 2 months, the hives were managed and the itch was less. over the years, i started to taper the dose from 1 tab to 1/2 tab, until 1/4 tab as prescribed by the doctor. and ive been on the 1/4 tab dose for 3 years and the hives almost never appeared. 3 days ago i stopped taking it to check whether hives would appear, now on the 3rd day im not sure whether this splitting headache and nausea are withdrawal symptoms. anyone experienced the same?	F	27	7  years5 1X D	4/22/2012Email
4	angioedema	Mostly drowsiness. Occasionally dizziness, vivid dreams, a little hyper for 1-2 hours after taking a dose.  Once my body became used to the medicine (about a week) I didn't notice side effects much, anymore.	I'm not sure it's helping the angioedema (which doesn't come and go; it's been pretty constant) - the side effects are MUCH easier for me to handle than claritin and it makes me less drowsy than benadryl.  I'm pretty sensitive to medications, but my experience with atarax has been a good one so far.  It's also helped with underlying anxiety even though I'm on a fairly low dosage.  If my anxiety gets worse, I would be willing to take a higher dose of atarax to treat it because this does not cause dependency like some other anxiety meds I've tried in the past.

5	hives, mild anxiety	Made me drowsy (but I took it at nite) but  I slept well and longer than usual, around 9-10 hrs). I did have a nightmare that nite, maybe a coincidence.	After a first time bout of hives lasting on and off for about 7 weeks, and finding only minimal relief from Benadryl, oatmeal baths, calamine etc.,  I got a prescription for 10 mg of Atarax. I took it once and slept through the night without staying awake from intense itching. The next morning I felt a touch groggy but so grateful to not have any itching. I did not take another dose because there was no renewed itching and the size of the existing hives on my body was starting to shrink.  I did not get any new hives after this first dose.  Am keeping my fingers crossed, it has been almost 72 hrs since that dose and I have not needed to take it again.	F	55	1  days10 mg 1X D	1/10/2012Email
3	Itching	Nothing for over 40 years (other than drowsiness) then post menopause, its drying effect was bad on my complexion.  So I stopped cold turkey OMG!	For a few months after stopping abruptly (an idiot move in retrospect) last April, the insomina was horrid for a few months.  That resolved.  But what's followed has been a nightmare.  The ringing in my years is so noteworthy, I have to attempt to talk over it.   I never had anxiety before (a mental brick) now I feel close to panic for no reason. I'll wake up with dread. My resting pulse rate has gone from around 65 to 120 (that's upon waking!).   My heart will pound, my pulse will roar through my extremities, throbbing unmercifully. I can go on, but you get the idea.  It was so bad, I had all my hormone levels checked.   I had a thyroidectomy in the early '60s so I watch that regularly and take dessicated natural hormone replacement.   Over 9 moths later,  blood levels are all normal, and clearly I am not. I have no other underlying health issues.  How long will this last?! (the rhetorical cry of the damned)  I'm wondering whether to start back on a very low dose (like splitting the pills to 2 or 5 mg) but I'd rather not.    I'll watch this site for any signs of encouragement (OK, that may be wishful thinking-- even documented discouragement will do.)  I can't find anything to replicate my experience online. Thanks.

2	Interstitial cyctitus	Severe Tiredness sleeping up to 12 hours a night and still tired during the day. Weight gain of 6 pounds. Dizziness and rash. Heaviness in chest.		F	40	1  months10mg 1X D	1/4/2012
3	Severe Eczema	I do not think this drug should be used by any kids under 5 as it seems to  reduce the brain wave patterns which could effect learning in kids who are not suffering from anxiety. Does it slow development in normal kids taken it for itch.	This drug in my opinion "Should be categorized as a chemical mind alter drug and not a antihistamine" something that might actually reduce normal kids ability to make the grades in grade school. Ex. Have your child off it for 3 weeks toss them simple puzzles to put together watch and time. Now put them back on and do the same thing and puzzles and be shocked for yourself.

5	Allergies/ Anxiety/ tension	i have had no side affects whilst taking this, i think it is brilliant. Although i am supposed to take 50mg in the morning and the same at night but i go straight to sleep within half an hour so i can only take them of the night.	i fall asleep half an hour after taking the tablets so i tend to just take 2 tablets (50mg total)of a night. if i forget to take them i spend the whole day very agitated and tense, i had never suffered with Anxiety prior to taking these. however they are brilliant with my allergies so i cant complain.

5	chronic hive, dermatographic skin	I"ve been taking this medication since I was 13 years old.  Initially I experienced weight gain and grogginess.  Now the only side effect is a small amount of grogginess so I take it at night.	Atarax has changed my life. I have dermatographic/dermagraphic skin, which mean your body constantly produces too much histamine.  It is hereditary in my family.  I have other family members on it as well, including my 21 year old son.  This drug has definitely been a life saver.	F	51	38  years10mg 1X D	8/24/2011Email
3	Severe Eczema	None yet	Dermatologist prescribed Atarax for my son who suffers from severe eczema to help ease the intense itching. He would wake up in the middle of the night and itch so bad there would be blood on his sheets, nails, clothes, etc. So far it has made him able to sleep without itching which in return is making the open wounds from itching ALOT clearer. Hopefully it keeps working along with the prescribed creams and his eczema can be a thing of the past :)	M	1.5	7  days10 2X D	2/8/2011
4	severe allergies	Drowsiness; nightmares on the first 2 nights. Lots of muscular pain. Feels like my fibromyalgia is back in full swing. Bad copper taste in mouth.	This drug has proven helpful in reducing the symptoms of the hives and itching. Its early days yet so I am hoping the side effects would wear off. Today not as bad as yesterday, so am looking on the positive side.	F	48	3  days25 3X D	1/17/2011

1	intertitial cystitis	Took for 2 yrs with increasing tiredness and groggy feeling, but helped with ic symptoms.  Then began having tremors, muscle twitching,dropping things, numb fingers.	Was referred to neurosurgeon who was considering neck surgery, but turns out to be caused by atarax. Stopped taking 5 months ago with no improvement.  Arms so weak, can't do daily tasks.		45	2  years15mg 1X D	6/21/2010
2	vestibulitis	It does make you a bit sleepy.  But the worst side effect was the gastritis that resulted.  That's inflammation of the lining of the stomach and means at least 6 weeks of Nexium type drugs.  It is very painful.	I looked up the side effects of Atarax and sure enough, there was gastrointestinal distress...and that's what I have now.  I will not take this drug again even though it helped with the vestibulitis.  I found that the herb Valerian root capsules works just as well with no side effects, take at bedtime and sleep like a baby. I did not take Atarax for a straight 200 and some days...I actually only took it when the auto-immune problem flared up, so it was off and on for almost a year.

4	nerves, and allery	I stopped taking  atarax, and I notice that all my arthritis type symptons are gone. I would take at night before bed, and wake up each day with seems like so many joints aching. It owuld take half the day to begin to feel better. Now Two nights without it and no joint aches. Is this a true sympton of this drug, because emotionally it has helped me so much and also with my allergies..thank you	Would like very much to continue to take but..tha joint pain does seem to be related to this 10 Mg pill	F	69	25  days10 mg 1X D	5/24/2010Email
1	Chronic Hives	While taking it: Dry mouth, severely chronically exhausted, nightmares, insomnia, muscle cramps, joint pain, severe depression, moodiness, memory loss, rapid heart beat. Even years after getting off of it: Always extremely tired even after getting plenty of sleep, joint pain so bad as to make me limp at times, memory loss, moodiness, muscle cramps so bad as to make it hard to sleep, lack of concentration, anxiety, my son was born with half a heart.	After my son was born with Right Atrial Isomerism (half a heart) I started looking into this drug that I had been on for about nine year of my own child hood and had not taken it for about 5 years before I got pregnant (I had even done a very extensive purification program after getting off of it) and found another person who was also on it long term also had several kids born with birth defects, one of her's even died from it.  My exhaustion/tiredness is so severe that even after 8-10 hours sleep I feel like all I can confront doing is going back to sleep. If any of you anticipate using this drug DONT!!!! And if you are on it now get off now before you get the long term effects!!!	F	33	9  years25 MG 4X D	5/6/2010Email
2	Anxiety & insomnia	Increase in appetite	I take other medication in addition to this, one of them being  oxycodone 15 mg. Atarax does not make me tired, sleepy, dazed, calm my anxiety or anything. I think my body has a high tolerance for sedating medication. I even took 100 mg at night time and I was still up for hours.	F	39	9  days50 mg 4X D	5/5/2010
5	Interstitial Cystitis	Sleepiness	I take this medicine at night so that the side effect is actually a little helpful.  I take this medicine as part of a three drug cocktail for Interstitial Cystitis (Amitriptyline, Hydroxyzine and Pentosan Polysulfate).  Other than the sleepiness, I have had no other side effect.	M	39	4  years25mg 1X D	5/1/2010Email
2	Sleep Initiation+Staying Asleep	hangover,grogginess,unclear thinking	Initially worked well to improve the quality of my sleep; after a while, however, I noticed that I'm always groggy, tired, and listless while taking this medicine-even after a full nights sleep. I normally sleep 8 hours-with this drug I sleep 10 hours and still don't feel energetic.	M	25	2  years50 mg 1X D	4/29/2010Email
5	Anxiety/Sweating & Asthma	Slightly drowsy for the first few days. I seem to not be able to sleep through the night very well although when I do sleep, I sleep well and feel like I am fully refreshed upon wakeing.	I always had a problem with extreme sweating in situations that made me feel slightly anxious. I've also had to use a fast acting inhaler for weezing all the time. I workout often and workout hard. I am very healthy. My doc prescribed me Atarax 10mg and so far, this has almost been a miracle drug for me. I now rarely weeze for no reason, allergies are not bothering me, My sweating has been reduced to basically nothing (unless physically induced), and I am waaay more comfortable in most situations as the Anxiety is almost disapeared. As I've said above, I workout often and watch my weight, along with other aspects of my body closley. The weight gain some are contributing to Atarax, I have personally not experienced. Considering I smoke weed as well, the hunger people claim this induces, has been nothing I have noticed either. I have noticed I pee more and I am thirsty a little more when taking Atarax though. Maybe it's my higher protein diet, or a combination, but I have also noticed being slightly more gassy as well. It made me worry when I read people contributed weight gain to this medicine and possibly it's different for everyone but I am a firm believer that the weight gain is more so due to personal lack of motivation/will power or another drug.	M	24	 10 2X D	4/16/2010
1	Eczema	At first made me very sleepy and I slept good on it, but last time I took it, I stayed awake all night long and all night the next day, today I'm hoping it will wear off.  Also, there was muscle spasms, jerks, and twitches combined with general restlessness that night.	I hate it so much.  Don't take this stuff, just scratch yourself or use topical medicines.	M	27	3  days25 MG 1X D	4/6/2010
4	Hives/Angiodema	Weight Gain(~4 lbs every month), extremely increased appetite(was eating 3000+ calories when only 1500 is required), racing heart, sleeo the first two days after starting the medication	Although I love atarax for what it does to my hives, I cannot stand its side effects. Every year, after my seasonal allergies end and I get off atarax, I have to start exercising twice as much to take the extra fat off my body. I am a very skinny person by default and eat very healthy normally but when I'm on atarax, its like my body has a mind of its own. I get extremely hungry every two hours and eat crazy amounts of food. I don't think gaining 12-15 pounds every year and losing it in the next few months can be healthy for my body. And I'm talking about 15% gain in weight...its nothing to sneeze at.Aside from all the crazy side effects, this drug does work wonders on my hives unlike any other anti-histamines like benadryl or claritin. One curious thing after getting off atarax this year was I lost my appetite. It's been going for a few days now....let's see how long it lasts.	F	27	4  months20 mg 4X D	2/24/2010Email
4	UNKNOWN BREAKOUT OF SKIN	sleepyness, dizzy, weight gain - 8 lbs in 4 months	After taking it, the itching stopped for several hours. one pill was often enough. when the itching was real bad, I took two of them, day or night. I was able to work but had to have coffee in the afternoon so that I wouldn't fall asleep. I stopped taking it because of the weight gain.	F	40	4  months10 4X D	2/19/2010
5	Bipolar/Anxiety	Dry mouth the first few nights, some daze	Very good cure for insomnia and nervous excitability. It is very safe has little side effects. It's cheap and efficient recommend to all who have probelmy sleep or anxiety. Working 30 minutes after dosing for approximately 8 hours.I took him even as a child when I had periods of depression in their bipolar illness.In poland costs $ 5 per pack 30 tablets 10mg but the best is in syrup because you can individually choose whether or not the dose to the child.

2	Contact dermititis	This medication upon first use stays in your system for quite a while.  Effects are extreme sleepiness, had a difficult time getting up the next morning, arms and legs completely lifeless.  Can you say real bad nightmares when taking this stuff?  That may go away after continued usage.  I was in a fog the next day after taking this the night before.	For individuals with moderate pain not requiring opiate based pain killers I think atarax would be a great sleep aid.  No way you would combine this medicine with vicoden at night, may not wake up the next day.	M	44	2  days	10/13/2009
3	Various allergies & anxiety	Extreme drowsiness, some periods of insomnia, extremely vivid nightmares, auditory hallucinations, paranoia, emotiona apathy, lack of energy, lack of motivation	This is the only anti-histimine that has been effective for me - I *cannot* take Benedryl in any form.	F	30	3  years	9/18/2009
5	severe skin allergy- unknown source	Drowsiness and that becomes more tolerable with exposure.Resting hand tremor in very high doses (125mg/day)	Atarax changed my life. I had a disfiguring skin allergy and the most intense itching, even in sleep. I'd been to many dermatologists and tried everything to no avail. Atarax relived the itching to the point I could completely recover. At my highest pt I was on 125mg daily. Now I take it for maintaince only when symptoms develop and I've not had a recurrance of anything that level in two years. An added benefit for an insomiac like myself is that it can be counted on as a sleeping pill as well. I don't know what I would have done if I'd never found it.	F	37	2  years	7/29/2009
2	interstitial cystitis mast cell deg	increased heart rate, sensitivity to sound, lack of motivation, sensory hallucinations (scary), easily startalled, presence of people not there, sore throat that passed with time, dry mouth and bad breath, increased body temperature after taking, muscle twitches, agitation, memory problems (bigtime), urinary retention, dysphoria, my eyes pop open at night and can't sleep but my mind is going strong along with my feet and picking at my fingers	i'm not lying when i say i had all those side effects, i was on elavil too and thought it was the elavil, the 'tripping on acid' feeling didn't go away after the elavil stopped and i figured it was from the atarax, turns out both are anticholinergics and as you can see, i must have a problem with anticholinergics, yay me, frustrated.  started at 50 mg at bedtime (asked dr. for lowest dose--turns out they make 10 mg--thx doc!), took 25mg last night and still feel trippy and up all night, wonderful...sigh.  this was a substitute for klonopin by my psych at one time and i said 'no'.  i should have listened to myself.  i almost went to the hospital last night b/c of this! i didn't go b/c i thought there was nothing they could do...turns out there is a drug to counter the anticholinergic effects...thank goodness for the internet...no wonder drs. hate the internet...people are more informed now!!!!

1	itching, bad allergy to dust mites	Made me very sleepy, my body at least, not so much my mind, I went to sleep but woke up about half an hr later with whole-body tremors originating in my chest about once a second, my mind was awake but my body was too fatigued to do anything like tell someone symptoms.  It also made me very nauseaus.  It's about 20 hrs after taking the one pill, but I'm still very nauseaus and barely have the energy or motivation to not just sit here, stare, and drool.  I'm feeling very out of it, and any amount of movement makes me feel short of breath. I'm about to call the doctor to see if I should be concerned this isn't going away.	this cure is far worse than the symptoms it was prescribed for	F	30	1  days	5/12/2009
5	Contact Dermititis	Dry mouth the first two nights, deceased snoring.	my wife got a happy bouns when I started in on this drug.  my snoring decreased so much she doesn't have to wait for me to fall asleep to come to bed.  the itching went away in the first week and has not returned.  we were not sure if it was the drug that stopped the snoring so i quit taking it but have returned to it since.	M	35	30  days	12/30/2008
4	Hives	drowsiness	Had my first ever onset of hives 5 days and ago & bendrayl and clartin did not help it got worse to the point I was scratching myself raw. Doctor put me on Atarax yesterday (10-20 mg every 4-hours, 30 mg total yesterday). I woke up this morning after a restful sleep and noticed a dramatic decrease in the size, bumpiness and itchiness of the hives. Still a bit itchy but infinitely better.  I took a 10 mg pill at the start and near end of work today and felt slightly fuzzy in the head, but not sleepy. Don't think I would do well at work if I took more, but 20mg helped me not itch and scratch all day. Started on a 7 day taper today of prednisone to help with the hives, which I HATE b/c pred gives me insomnia but the doctor said taking 20mg of Atarax before bed should conteract it, so I'm optimistic my hives will be gone soon and my sleep won't be ruined by prednisone as it usually is.

3	Interstitial cystitis, insomnia	Fatigue, 'dead' feeling emotionally, low energy, PAINS IN HIP JOINTS AND CALF MUSCLES	I started taking Atarax because I read that it helps bladder pain due to interstitial cystitis. I noticed that it helped insomnia and it works very well for this. Because of MCS (multiple chemical sensitivities), especially to wood smoke, I have allergic brain reactions that trigger out-of-control crying jags and rage, as well as profound depressions that can border on suicidal. I spent thousands of dollars on psychotherapy before discovering that all I had to do was take an antihistamine and I'd be fine. For this, Atarax as well as Benadryl work wonderfully well. However, the price I pay is the side effects I listed.  I thought I had arthritis until I figured out that the pains come and go according to whether I have taken Atarax or not. The more Atarax I've taken, the worse the pain, sometimes almost crippling. I have the same reactions to Benadryl and have entered these comments on the Benadryl page as well.

4	Anxiety	Dry mouth, indigestion, tingles, brain zaps.	Sometimes it works great other times, not so much. The more I dose daily, the more "out of it" I feel - but sometimes I need that. I like that it can be taken as needed as well as daily to help keep me calm. Not sure if I need a higher dosage or change of medication all together.I would recommend trying this before jumping into highly addictive Benzo's.	M	30	4  months	10/7/2008Email
3	anxiety and instead of taking	sleepiness,tired,prickly feeling like electric shocks,dizziness,lightheadedness,a little emotional on 25 mgs 3 times a day. I am taking the generic brand.	Instead of taking klonopin which gets abused easily and my brother was after my klonopins when i was on it. I was told to get off it and see if the electric shocks like prickly feeling goes away but today is hard on me because not taking any medicine for my anxiety.  I feel off it that i don't know if i can survive off it and going off 25 mgs is hard on me. Should i ask to be put back on it or what? What should i do? I am on day 1 of not taking the medication.	F	23	7  days	9/16/2008Email
5	Extreme food reaction - HIVES	The only side effect I have experienced is the look of disbelief from a nurse who insists I can't be allergic to benedryl and that she/he has never heard of Atarax.	What a shame that more hospitals aren't aware of the intolerance that some of us have for benedryl. Benedryl does nothing for me. It increases the allergic reaction I am experiencing and puts my body into a state as if I was hooked-up to a full strength caffeine IV drip! Atarax, however, saves the day.. at least if I can convince the health professional that some people are allergic to benedryl and all histamine blockers are not the same.	M	50	5  years	9/3/2008
4	My toddler takes it for allergies	If I give her less then the prescribed amount of 10mg 3 times per day, it helps with the drowsiness. I usually give her half of that.	It has helped my daughter a great deal. She still has extreme eczema but it has worked well for her hives. It has cut down on the amount of scratching and she no longer scratches to the point of bleeding all over her sheets at night. Her quality of life has greatly improved.	F	1.5	1  years	8/21/2008
4	Anxiety	At first I noticed it was hard to swallow.  But that side effect disappeared. Maybe a little sleepy.	I was prescribed 25 mg of Atarax when I went cold turkey off of valium which I had been taking for years.  This pill seems to help with anxiety issues.  I am only taking 10 mg at a time because of the sleepy issues.  I am doing fine. Nothing bad to say.	F	55	4  months	7/9/2008
5	Anxiety, PTSD	Drowsiness	I honestly cannot much difference between this drug and Valium, Klonopin or Xanax. I have to take a lot of it (up to 100 mgs 4x a day) but it works well. I am not that bothered by the drowsiness and I welcome it over climbing the walls.I took benzodiazepines off and on for 25 years. After my 5th withdrawal experience, I have vowed never to go on them again. God willing, I will not. Atarax saved me. I have read that it is not meant for long-term (more than 4 months) use and it may lose effectiveness after that time, but I have taken it off and on for 4 years and it still works. A word about the weight gain claims- I really think it is impossible for an antihistamine to make you fat. There is absolutely no literature to support this.	F	40	4  years	7/5/2008
5	Chronic hives/uticaria & hay fever	When I first started taking it I was very groggy and had dry mouth for a couple weeks.  It does take a while for your body to adjust.  Now I occassionally experience grogginess only if I take a higher dose than usual for a few hours the next morning.	I couldn't get by without this medication.  It took over a year for doctors to figure out what would work for me.  Now I only need to take one 25mg dose before bed and that's it.  If I forget by late afternoon the next day I start getting the itching and hayfever symptoms.  I have to take it every day and use generic.  I'm glad to hear no one is experiencing any long term effects.	F	46	23  years	6/27/2008
3	anxiety, panic attacks	I didn't even think it was the atarax until I started reading other feedback, but I have gained about 6 lbs in three months.  Also, I experienced the dry mouth and heart flutters the first week, but that went away.	I haven't had a panic attack in over a month now and that is a big deal since I used to have at least 3 or 4 a week.  It is working, but I am not thrilled about the weight gain.  Maybe I will see how I do without it for a while and if the panic attacks return I will restart.  I am also on Zoloft and Trazodone for OCD, Depression, and Insomnia.	F	28	3  months	6/3/2008

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.

2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out!

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.
