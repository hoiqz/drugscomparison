2	allergies	fasciculations (quivering) of posterior neck muscles, and irregular heartbeat	Clarinex is fantastic for hay fever, asthma, and hives; better than any antihistamine I have ever taken. I never had to take it 2 days in a row because the effects last at least 48hrs. In seasons when I had to take it fairly often, I began to wake up because of quivering posterior neck muscles and heart palpitations. I finally went to my GP, who did an EKG which was normal; but of course the palpitations weren't happening at the time.Recently I had not taken it in 6 weeks, then had to take it once because of a food allergy. That night, for the first time in 6 wks the muscle fasciculations and heart palpitations happened again. I was amazed to read here that someone had had exactly the same thing happen! I am on a beta-blocker, amlodipine, and a diurectic for high blood pressure. I will certainly take Clarinex again if I need it badly, but I'm a little reluctant now. I will update this entry in the future if my conclusions here seem wrong.	F	63	18  months5 mg 1X AN	3/11/2012Email
5	Seasonal allergies	None	Worked for my son's seasonal allergies - Claritin did nothing, Zyrtec caused too many personality changes.	M	12	2  years5 mg 1X D	1/31/2012
4	Allergies	Slight increase in appetite and a little tightness in my rear neck muscles, but this didn't last long.  This antihistamine worked better for me (with less side effects) than Zyrtec (which caused asthma) or Allegra.	Clarinex is my favorite antihistamine and is non-drowsy.  I prefer it over any other, although it is slower acting than something like Benadryl.  I do recommend it, however.	M	49	6  years5 MG 1X D	10/25/2011
2	allergies asthma	heart palpitations, tachycardia	Have taken clarinex for several years and all of a sudden a few months ago noticed having rapid heart rate after taking it.  Don't know if something changed in the make up or what?  Was even going to check with my pharmacists to see if I had the correct pill.  Not sure why this just started.	F	45	4  years 1X D	4/24/2010
