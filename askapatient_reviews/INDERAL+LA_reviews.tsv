3	Migraines	Excessive weight gain, fatigue, dizziness, feeling feint, pins and needles in hands	In the two years I have taken Inderal I have gained 3 stone.  I have tried every diet and I excercise a lot.  The weight gain has really got me down because I was always skinny before this even after having a child.  I was diagnosed with acute migraines by a neurologist and put on the tablets and I have not had an aura migraine since, however, I have had a lot of migraines where I am sick and see wavy lines regularly.  No doctor seemed to want to admit that inderal was the cause for the weight gain but finally I saw one last week who is going to prescribe me an alternative. The fatigue is also a nightmare if you lead a busy life.  I would advise anyone who is thinking about taking these tablets to take the side effects into account as they really have made my life miserable and it has taken me nearly a year to get a doctor to listen to me!

4	Migraine prevention	none really	helped reduce the frequency of my migraines. also helped with physical symptoms of anxiety.	F	25	3  months120 mg 1X D	9/29/2012
3	Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia	I did not notice it initially, but looking back, this drug has made it impossible to lose weight.	I used to take this for migraine headaches from the age of 5 to 17 when they calmed down.  Then in my late 20's I was diagnosed with Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia.  I started the drug to slow my heart down so it wasn't always racing.  I learned that it is a non-selective beta blocker and inhibits the ability for you to burn fat.  I gained 30 pounds and I can't even lose 10 on this drug. I tried every diet and I have NEVER been overweight.  I asked my cardiologist to take me off it.  I am now weaning off at half the dosage.  Hopefully the heart rate issue is gone, because I have tried everything to lose weight.  I eat healthy, work out 6 days a week for an hour and the weight should be coming off. I'm only 30 years old!	F	30	3  years80 1X D	9/13/2012Email
4	Hyperhidrosis	Have to say this drug saved me, my condition was literally ruining me life, I merely existed if you get me. Side effects are complete lack of energy which I'm hoping will pass in time and bowels a bit ropey as in on a vacation and need to get back to work!!! The key with this drug is taken it on an empty stomach I was taken it for 2wks before I coped this. I take 160mg about 7am back to bed for 40 winks and then get up 8.30 shower and brekkie and off for the day, I hope everyone with the condition finds a solution that works for them it's a hideous life crippling thing that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy		F	27	6  weeks160mg	5/31/2012Email
3	Hypertension, tachacardia	SEVERE windedness. Couldn't get off the couch without breathing heavy. Complete lack of appetite. Vision "weirdness". Nervousness in the mornings. Feelings of chest "congestion" "pressure" resulting in claustrophobia. Discouragement. Diarrhea. Skin on trunk became scaly and flaky, elbows cracked and peeled. Some dizziness/lightheadedness.	DID control my pulse/ BP nicely. Side-effects not conducive to raising 4 little boys.	F	33	1  weeks20mg 2X D	1/26/2012Email
5	Migraines and Daily Headaches	A little tired and trouble staying asleep at night.	This drug changed my life. It took about two weeks to work, but then it greatly reduced my migraines. I  was having headaches about 5 days a week and now every once in awhile.	F	39	3  weeks60mg 1X D	12/6/2011
4	Migraine	For the first 6 weeks, I was extremely tired, had very little energy and felt faint but was able to combat this by eating little and oftern in order to prevent my blood sugar levels from dropping and by taking the tablets at bedtime.  After the 6 weeks, this has gone but since then I have found excercising more difficult (I can still do high impact aerobics but just find it more difficult-almost as if I am doing it with weights strapped to me) and find that I pump more, paticularly just after taking my tablets.  The migraines are now under control and I am hoping that I can start to reduce my dose and come off inderal in the near future.	Before taking inderal, I suffered mild migraines which lasted on average 5 days at a time. Since taking inderal and giving my body 6 weeks to get used to it, I have had a hadful of migraines lasting 1-3 days and they are very mild to the extent that I can get away with just taking ibuprofen and I am fine. I also came off the pill and think any woman suffering from migraines should look at non-hormal contraception (I got the coil which while it was sore getting fitted, I feel so much better since coming off the pill and think that this was the cause of my migraines). I would definately recommond inderal to migrain sufferers but would advise taking it easy for the first 6 weeks to allow your body time to get used to it.	F	26	6  months80mg 1X D	2/4/2011
3	Severe Hyperthyroidism	No problems with weight gain, which is good, but the cold legs (like frozen sides of beef up to mid-thigh) and hands - I felt I had to half the dose to get rid of those symptoms, but I STILL have cold hands and cold feet, just not cold LEGS.  Lethargy, "kind of" depression - I am just...  indifferent to EVERYTHING - I don't care...  about anything...  Painful to walk due to frozen feet - they feel swollen when I wake up...  No additional sleep problems, but I was already on temazepam for my long term insomnia...  I haven't had a dream in EONS, fantastic, scary, intense or otherwise...  :(	It definitely helped my heart palps and flutters, and the craziness of severe hyperthyroidism, but the icy hands and legs has become intolerable (walking is painful and awkward...)  and so is my indifference to everything...  and I HATE not dreaming..  oh, and it never did get rid of the mild daily headaches I get, either... altho' I didn't have a problem with that as far as I'm concerned. But: I AM NOT ME, ANYMORE.  I'm seeing the endocrinologist tomorrow to discuss this mess...	F	42	6  weeks120 mg 1X D	1/29/2011
5	Migraine	Vivid Dreams	Ever had a drug that changed your life? Well this certainly was a game changer for me! I wonder why I suffered for years before any Dr. thought to prescribe this for me..such a shame they hadn't done it sooner! Initially the drug made me VERY VERY tired (at probably the time in my life when I needed the most not to be any more severely exhausted than I was as a mother who works full-time and had an 8 month old and a 4 year old!) My Doctor told me to stick it out for six whole weeks and that I wouldn't be dissapointed...Those 6 weeks were really rough (and it was the full 6 weeks, I tell ya!) and I so wanted to give up, but I am sooooo glad I stuck it out! All of you people who give up on it after a short time...I'm here to tell you, don't. The Dr.'s goal was to eliminate my migraines completely. While I can't say it has eliminated them, it has hands down reduced the severity of my migraines and eliminated the naseau that I had along with it and for that alone I am greatful. I no longer live my life fearing the next migraine or cutting short a vacation in the middle of the night to go home because of a dibilitating migraine attack. So, please give it a chance. Stick it out for a whole six weeks, if at the end of six weeks you still don't like it, then stop. But I'll bet you'll probably be thanking me, instead. :)	F	38	5  years160 MG 1X D	7/26/2010Email
5	outward signs of anxiety	none. maybe low energy but that is not unusual for me anyway.	worked perfectly at immediately stopping the physical symptoms of performance anxiety.	F	34	3  years 1X D	7/25/2010
3	generalised panic disorder	upset stomach, nausea, fatigue and shortness of breath, sleeping disturbances including crazy crazy dreams! Slight confusion like your brains gone on a short holiday and left you behind, this was particularly bad when i accidentally took two one day.	Mixed feelings, i was having mild panic attacks daily which were getting steadily worse and desperate for somehting to help, at first the medication was a relief but the side effects, especially nausea and sleep disturbances are driving me mental. Also although my rapid heartrate and other psysiological symptoms are gone i still get anxious for no reason, so i dont think il continue with it.	F	20	6  weeks80mg 1X D	7/25/2010
5	Chronic Migraine	Feeling more calm, slightly harder to do cardio workout, vivid funny dreams - overall negligible!	I have not had a headache for 1 week straight. This is a miracle as I am used to 2 or 3 per week. I even enjoyed a glass of RED wine and was fine. WOW that is like a another miracle. Sleep has been fine as long as I stay on my regular schedule, which is what I find to be key to anybody's good night's sleep. As per the weight gain, I have not had any. As a fitness nutritionist and fitness instructor I believe that if you eat calories according to your BMR and work out regularly including cardio 3-4 times a week you should not have too many problems with weight gain, no matter what drug your on. If you are still gaining weight drop the calories! We will see how the long term effects are of Inderal LD 80mg (generic), but so far it has given me a better quality of life.	F	30	21  days80mg/LA 1X D	7/13/2010
2	Migraine preevention	Excessive and extreme flatulence - so bad that I had a total GI investigation and was being treated as if I had IBS )Which I don't have), SOB on exersion, weight gain, bloating. I was supposed to be taking a higher dose (140mg per day) but I felt too tired on a low dose and thought I couldn't function to go to work etc on a higher dose. The flatulence became socially crippling and I stopped the Inderal cold turkey about three weeks ago. Although I have had the flu, I have also had shocking, bursting headaches at night and have to sleep upright, intense fatigue during the day, emotionally labile and nauseous.  The gas has stopped (hurrah!!)  but the aftermath is making me feel totally despondent!	While on the Inderal, I did not notice a reduction in frequency of my migraine but there was lessening of their intensity. The one other plus was that I did not have stage fright!	F	57	2  years30 2X D	5/6/2010Email
3	migraine prevention	Initially very tired, weird dreams, weight gain and tough time exercising.  Overtime was able to combat most symptoms, although still fighting to not gain weight.	Took to prevent migraines with aura.  Have had some minor headaches but not one migraine with aura since I began taking it.  Also had borderline high BP, has brought it into normal range.	F	32	4  months60 mg 1X D	4/15/2010
3	chronic migrane prevention	I have been having a lots of allergies lately to the point that I become allergic to any shampoo that contains amonia.  Dundruff become extrem to the point that I was using tar shampoo then I decided to slowly take my self off I been ok.  I am scared about my migranes because I am in school, but I can not keep all these other problems.  Hives, cold all time, tired, no energy, weight gain, hair loss, allergies, sore throat 90% of the time, palpitations.  But the migranes were gone.		F	28	7  years120 1X D	3/16/2010
2	Anxiety/Panic Attacks	Feel tired all the time, no energy at all, can't concentrate. Dizziness and often feel like I'm about to faint. Have been eating a lot more sugary foods than usual - cravings possibly due to lack of energy caused by drug?	Suffered from panic attacks for a few months, the physical symptoms of which were shaking, throat swelling causing inablitity to breathe, sweating and headaches. I have been on the drug for eight days 80mg dose per day, It does stop the physical symptoms of panic attacks but I have no energy whatsoever, feel very depressed and can't concentrate. I need to find an alternative as I can barely get through the day in college. Would not recommend this for anyone who is slightly depressed or has a tendency to get depressed, as not having energy or the will to do anything could worsen depression.	F	21	8  days80mg 1X D	2/26/2010
2	PVC	Inderal lowered my heartrate down to 40 times per minute and I had NO energy at all. I had to come off of it.	It did help control my PVC problem but I had no energy to function.Now I avoid all caffeine and even decaf tea and coffee and my heart functions a lot better without a drug. I am very sensitive to medications and cannot take much of anything.	F	55	1  years40 1X D	2/11/2010
3	Panic Attacks	Significant weight gain	Has stopped the panic feelings which is great, but have gained just over one stone in a year.  Going back to the Drs to ask to come off it and change to something else.	F	37	1  years	2/2/2010
3	PVC's and hypertension	numbness and hypersentivity to outside of arms intermittently, weakness, tiredness,	calms arrthymias and lower BP well	F	26	10  days	1/27/2010
2	Inconsist HBP/Headaches	No anxiety, Vivid Dreams, nightmares, insomnia, sudden waking, horrible headaches, body aches, weight gain. lightness of head during cardio, tightness of chest and throat.	80 mg.  I'm a kidney transplant so needed to control high blood pressure.  Loved the anxiety being gone, did lower hbp, hated the side effects.  first time with a beta blocker.	F	35	30  days	1/9/2010
1	Migraines/MAV/High Blood Pressure	Didn't lower heart-rate as much as other beta blockers have; light headed upon standing; shortness of breath with any amount of exertion (more pronounced than with other beta blockers I've tried); extreme moodiess/sadness/depression/anxiety.	I wrote a similar review for Inderal...I also tried the LA version (since my headaches returned 3-4 hours after a dose of regular Inderal...apparently it has a very short half life).  Background: I've suffered from migraines and high BP for years.  Migraines & BP were previously under control with 50 mg of Atenolol once per day (took this for a year).  6 months ago, had sudden dizziness and worsening migraines.  Numerous tests have concluded it's MAV (migraine associated vertigo), and I have been working from home for the past 6 months because I can't drive due to the dizziness. I tried Inderal LA after having some initial success with regular Inderal for a few weeks.  I took it for 2 days, and was honestly afraid that I would hurt myself - I became so sad and depressed...like I would be cooking dinner or cleaning the house, and I would suddenly burst into random tears for NO REASON WHATSOEVER.  Granted, I'm a little down due to the MAV and headaches, but I've never felt so hopeless and depressed in my life...ever.  It scared the hell out of me, and I quit taking this drug immediately...I went back to Atenolol (it doesn't control the headaches as well and makes me a bit light-headed) until I find something better, and I haven't had this happen since.  Many people swear by this drug, but for me, it was definitely a bad fit...just goes to show you that drugs affect everyone differently!	F	25	2  days	1/2/2010Email
4	tachycardia	Well..I am not sure but I do have dry eyes and mouth and fatigue. Not sure if this all related to Inderal. When I was in the hospital in Sept. 09 they said my BP was too low and they lowered my dose from 120 mg to 80 mg	I have only had one episode since on it that landed me in the hospital and I attribute that to the FLU and being dehydrated. Now I am more worried about other health issues and wonder about fatigue from it and other symptoms.	F	38	8  years	12/6/2009Email
5	Migraine headaches	Small weight gain, some loss of energy	Really helped to prevent migraines. I have not had a true full blown migraine since beginning this medication. I still get the aura and very mild pain, but that is certainly tolerable!	F	46	23  years	11/19/2009
5	PTSD	none	helped anxiety a great deal for my son.  He used to freak out going anywhere unplanned	M	10	1.5  years	10/17/2009
1	vestibular migraines	OMG! I only took it for 3 days. 80 MGS. pills. I had shortness of breath, and I got very dizzy. I do suffer from vertigo, but it was just as bad. It took 4 days to get out of my system..My heart also raced and was so uncomfortable.		F	55	3  days	10/2/2009Email
4	Anxiety (Public Speaking)	At first none really, but now after a few years, I am worried about mild depression and a "fuzzy" head. I have also recently had strange headaches that may or may not be attributed to the Inderal	This is a great drug for me and virtually eliminated the physical (outward) signs of nervousness I used to get before presenting to large groups. No more shaking, sweating etc just leaving me to concentrate on delivery. I started on 80mg about 1 hour before needed, but quickly moved up to 2x80mg (taken slightly apart). Perhaps this was unnecessary, but I originally felt one was not enough. Anyway, the "build up" dread about a meeting has now gone (this was sometimes 2 weeks BEFORE the presentation!!), and I may only get slightly nervous 10mins before speaking. Once I get going I generally can deliver (what seems to other people) to be a confident, self assured speech. I do worry about the long term side effects though and aim to reduce my dose soon. Not sure what can take Inderals place though...	M	34	5  years	8/12/2009
5						 	7/15/2009
3	anxiety	tried, weight gain, lack of energy	i have been on 80mg once a day for 2 years after suffering a long time with panic attacks they have helped alot but i am really tired all the time and my weight just keeps increasing thinking of coming of them.	F	29	2  years	7/9/2009Email
5	BP/Migraines	None after first 2 months.	Commented back in March regarding the product and was having issues. Once they adjusted the meds not only has my blood pressure been lowered, but I have been migraine free. I've also managed to lose 15 pounds....not sure if it's related, but I have the energy now that I didn't have before.  If you on it, hang in there as it may take awhile to get the right dosage, but once you do, you'll feel great.	F	40	4  months	6/25/2009
4	migraine prevention	head rush when standing quickly	Has worked very well for me for migraine prevention	F	48	5  years	5/29/2009
3	migraine preventative	Tired; below normal blood pressure; less exercise tolerance; possibly related to heat intolerance for me	At first, reduced number of migraines; this was temporary.  But it has reduced the severity of most of my migraines.  It also helps with panic attacks that I suffer from -- have less racing heat, eetc.	F	61	15  years	3/28/2009
3	Migraines/BP	Insomnia, slight pressure in my chest and tired walking distances.	Due to the drug company no longer making Metoprolol SUCC ER (to treat my migraines) after 19 yrs. & having a bad reaction to Toprol XL & Metoprolol Tartate (rushed to the ER 2x in 1 weekend due to my BP in the "danger zone"), I was switched to the Inderal LA to deal w/both migraines & the new BP issue. The 1st day I was increased from the 80mg to 160mg and within 2 days my BP dropped. I have had an ongoing pressure in my chest, but have been told it's my body adjusting to the new medicine after all these years & the trama of the reaction to the other 2 meds. I am extremely tired and wake up faithfully @ 2am unable to go back to sleep. I was out of work this week due to my BP readings, but hope to return next week, if I can stay awake. After reading the comments, I'm nervous about the weight gain as I also have PCOS and it's induced by insulin levels. Hopefully I can start decreasing the meds once my stress test is done.	F	40	7  days	2/28/2009
1	Migraines	Drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, stomach pains/nausea, depression, difficulty concentrating, aggression, vivid dreams, loss of personality.	I began taking this because I was having migraines everyday. It didn't help my migraines any, but I didn't really give it a chance to. After 5 days of the side effects I decided they weren't worth it.	F	17	5  days	2/13/2009
1	portal vein thrombosis	confusion, can not concentrate, short term memory loss, depression, insomnia, strange dreams that make me wake up in a cold sweat, trouble falling to sleep and staying to sleep.	I took Inderal first for about 8 months, the side effects of this was about the same.  Doc changed prescriptionn to Inderal LA thinking that it might be better. NO WAY! Last night I had a very strange dream, woke up in a cold sweat, not knowing where I was.  Had to lay there for a few minutes to realize that I was in my own bedroom. My short term memory loss really scares me to, I sometimes I forget the name of very simple things.  I am supposed to try Inderal LA for two weeks, that's up on Monday and I'm telling the Doc that I am not taking it anymore.	M	54	2  weeks	1/30/2009Email
4	migraines	None	I take 120 mg Propranolol a day.  It has helped with my migraines. When I beginto get one, I take a Maxalt and it always works.  Whereas before using Propranolol, Maxalt  didn't always work for me.	F	61	7  years	1/17/2009Email
5	anxiety		great for anxiety when public speaking, use only when facing stressful situation	M	30	4  years	8/16/2008
1	migraines	Shortness of breath, have to sleep sitting up, tiredness, constant cough w/vague taste of blood, noticable bruising of skin....and to think that my physician told me to continue for a little longer.  I asked him if he remembered that this medication was primarily for ones with high blood pressure and that I have extremely low blood pressure and he said...yes, but I've given you an "infant dose"...the lowest possible.  I took myself off it....slowly, but completely.  I feel much better and would rather tolerate the migraines if that's all that's out there for prevention.	Way too many uncomfortable side effects listed here.  Be very careful.	F	58	30  days	7/5/2008Email
4	migraine prevention	upset stomach, nausea, insomnia, tired	Haven't had a headache for the past 7 days.  Hoping the side effects will subside and I can take this long term.  I have tried all other migraine prevention medicines without any luck and this one is my last hope.	F	37	7  days	4/29/2008
4	Migraines	Extremely vivid dreams-waking up talking and seeing my dreams occur in the room after I've woken up. Listlessness and lethargy.	Worried about long term effects of taking medication that effects your heart! don't want to be on medication for the rest of my life, but super happy that I haven't had a migraine in 4 months!!	F	25	4  months	4/15/2008
5	Migraine	Extreme exhaustion which subsided after reducing mg	I started taking 80mg and was so tired that I could not get out of bed after sleeping 10-12 hrs per night, but did notice an extreme reduction in my severe migraines. So, under the care of my neurologist, we lowered the dosage over a month's time and ended up taking 20mg. I have had no side effects and it completely eliminated my migraines for approximately 3 years. I get some now, but infrequently and the severity is much less than it used to be.	F	30	6  years	3/17/2008
5	Essential tremor and HPB	Sometime a lack of energy. And long time to ejaculate too.	My doctor was an old man with old medecine:). I've started to have essential tremor at age of 20 after years of cocaine abuse. When i've stop to take drugs , my hands was like a hearthquake and mu bllod pressure was around 170 on 100. My doctor put me on Inderal LA 160mg. This medication probably saved my life. My shaking hands has stopped after 1 week. My blood pressure is normal. The only problems with Inderal is that you can't ever stop it. I've tried 1 time and it was like a nightmare. I went back on Inderal after 3 day. It cause me problem in my sexual life by a anormal long time to ejaculate.New beta blocker are probably better now but for me, Inderal LA was the right drug.	M	30	10  years	3/3/2008
3	Chronic Migraine Prevention	Got rid of my everyday migraine but am having side effects of itching all over my hands, feet, and legs, and extreme insomnia. No more than 4 hours a night and I take it at night, anyone know if taken during the day helps?	I have been having migraines everyday for the past year and have been on Maxalt but since I take so many insurance quit paying to refill anymore than 7 a month. I just switched to Inderal LA two weeks ago and immediately my headaches were gone, I have had to take only 2 Maxalt since then. I just started having strange and severe itching on my legs, feet, and hands that is really starting to bother me and I havent been able to sleep more than 4 hours a night. I take 80mg every night before bed, does anyone have any suggestions on another time I could take it to lessen the insomnia? Please let me know!!!!	F	20	2  weeks	2/26/2008Email
2	anxiety	WEIGHT GAIN!! tiredness, lack of concentration	being a student it is essential to be able to concentrate and be alert. This has made my studies get worse. Don't recommend to students.	F	18	6  months	2/26/2008
5	pvc's, headaches	none		F	44	4  years	2/16/2008
3	migraine prevention	At 60mg, experienced insomnia/trouble falling asleep, and weight gain.  At 80mg, experienced insomnia, weight gain, trouble getting out of bed in the morning, and extreme depression even though I've never been depressed before this.	Helped with migraines somewhat but had to get off the medication because of the side effects.  Migraines returned four days after stopping the medicine.	F	37	2  years	1/31/2008
3	panic attacks, migraines	weight gain (10-15kgs)tiredness, not thinking clearly		F	44	1  days	1/17/2008
3	Rapid Heart Rate	I feel extreamly tired even after a good nights sleep, I wake up feeling tired and lightheaded, almost feel like I am going to pass out, when feeling this way I check my BP and heart rate and they are fine. Confused at times over simple things , NO sexual desire at all, awaken by panic attacks, Trouble falling asleep, I feel very sleepy and tired and then cannot go to sleep. I have gained about 30 pounds since starting this medication in 2001. Some shortness of breath.	Inderal LA 120 definately took care of the rapid heart rate. At resting rate I was around 120-130 BPM, I felt like I was having a heart attack my heart would pound so hard. My chest just felt very weird and heavy feeling. I now stay around 80 BMP. I had frequent headaches before starting med and now very seldom have one. After reading all the comments and side effects others have descibed like mine, I will discuss with my doctor.	F	31	7  years	1/12/2008
4	tremors and high BP	Weight gain.  Took 40 mg once daily for 15+ years for tremors, no problems.  3 months ago high BP, Dr switched to 160mg once daily.  Can't seem to control weight, gained another 10 pounds or so.	Controlled tremors somewhat but when I went to 160mg, tremors are a lot better and I can write.  Haven't checked BP to see if it is down yet.	M	50	3  months	12/30/2007
5	tachycardia (from hyperthyroid)	slowed down feeling; weight gain	I think anyone with serious tachycardia ought to ask doc about hyperhyroid issue, too; I started with the inderal and it did ease the heart symptoms, but we still needed to treat the underlying disease, not just the rapid heart. Inderal worked great to slow down the heart and I think also my general metabolism. I was weaned off it once the hyperthyroid condition was also treated and began to improve.	F	48	6  months	12/28/2007
2	propranolol for essential tremor	Wheezing.	No more beta-blockers for me.	F		5  days	10/1/2007
4	miagraines/mitral prolapse valve	some weight gain the first couple of years, about 15lbs,tired,headache, a bit confused on higher dose. This medicine does workif done slowly	I started with propranolol 3 times a day for about 6months, thentook 120mg of Inderal LA once per day(to make life easier) That was about 9 years ago.I always felt drugged and confused on that high dose so I decide to try and wean off the drug. You need to do it very slow as it can cause stress on your heart. I tried to get to 60mg and was unable, the miagraines wouldn't stop. I did however get to 80 mg which made me feel better and my miagraines were better. The last year my headaches have returned and sometimes miagraines that I have put my dose up to 120mg. I'm use to it now but still having headaches. I'm now searching for another drug to add to the inderal. If any one is on Inderal LA for a number of years be carefull trying to come off of it. I now know I will take it for life as I can't get off of it.	F	48	10  years	9/7/2007Email
5	tachycardia	severe fatigue and memory loss	My tachycardia was so severe that I will deal with the fatigue.  My resting heart rate was, on average, 120.  I couldn't sleep or do daily activities.  Now, I feel normal and my resting heart rate is 80-100. I take 80mg bid.  I'm 5'8 and weigh 125.	F	31	7  days	8/13/2007
1	Essential Tremor	Controlled the tremor effectively. I took this drug for 20 years.80 mg per day.	This drug causes Pulmonary Fibrosis after long term use. I now have the disease. Was not explained to me at the time or they did not know then.Google Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and look under causes.I don't recommend you take this long term.	M	57	20  days	8/9/2007Email
3	PVC - (abonormal heart beat)	weight gain, lethargy, vivid dreams	I was prescribed propranolol for abnormal heart beats (60mg/day).  I have migraines, and it doesn't affect their duration or severity.  I had not changed my diet or exercise pattern, but about 3 years ago I started gaining a lot of weight (probably at least 20 pounds).  Lately I have vivid waking dreams almost every night.  If I miss a dose, I will experience the abnormal heart beat, so I know that either I need to take less, or try another type of med.	F	49	5  years	7/3/2007
5	Hypertension / anxiety	Minimal dizziness and tiredness the first day	I have had high BP for many years, about 160/100.  I have been a bit prone to stress and anxiety too. I tried reducing my BP w/ diet and exercise with no success. I was reluctant to take meds because of side effects. I finally gave in and my doc prescribed Inderal LA 120mg. I feel great, my BP and heart rate are normal now and the anxiety is gone. I wish I had tried this med years ago.	M	36	5  days	6/16/2007
3	Migraines	weight gain, lethargy, shortness of breath while exercising, tired when waking up, low blood pressure	Inderal 80 (before bed) did work at reducing my migraines from about 5 per month to 1, but I have been on it for 6 months and have gained at least 15 pounds.  I am considering asking my doctor for other alternatives.  The weight gain is just not worth it.  There has to be something else.  Does anyone know if the weight will come off if the medication is stopped?	F	34	6  months	6/15/2007Email
4	Chronic Migrains	Very vivid dreams, fatigue, and dizziness from lower blood pressure.	Since I have been on this med I have only had 2 migrains.	F	25	5  months	6/11/2007
3	Tachycardia	Caused accessive fatigue, cant do work on computer or driving or any kind of work that involves mental activity	can not give up now, if I give up, they symptoms appear again.

4	Migraines	Slight weight gain (10 lbs) after 8 months	I take 60 mg at night.  I had chronic migraines that would last for days despite taking Tompama and Zomig. I have had 3 small migraines that required a dose each of Zomig in last 8 months.	M	45	8  months	5/27/2007
1	akathisia caused by Celexa	Raynaud's phenomenon, cold hands and feet, low blood pressure, fatigue, depression, feeling like I am about to faint, amnesia	For anyone who has not been informed, this drug is known to cause cardiac failure even in people who don't have pre-existing heart problems.  Also can cause bronchospasms.  It also has to be weaned off of, and can cause rebound anxiety.	F	31	8  months	5/15/2007

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011

Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
