4	Internal hemmorhoids	Slight burning after insertion of Anusol suppository - but this went away in a few minutes.	Seems to be shrinking hemmorhoids - more comfortable now - no itch.		41	3  days	10/22/2009
4	Anal Fissure	Pain upon insertion of suppository. It's much more comfortable if you coat it with a personal lubricant.	It worked fast to reduce inflammation and heal the fissure.	M		2  weeks	11/30/2008
