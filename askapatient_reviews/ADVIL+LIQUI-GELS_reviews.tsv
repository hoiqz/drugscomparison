5	headaches or menstrual cramps	none.	have been taking advil for headaches and menstrual cramps since 1980's. The tablets and pills took awhile to work, as they do, but since they came out with gelcaps, its the BEST pain reliever there is. Better than any script.	F	47	 200 2X AN	8/6/2012

5	To be able to sleep despite flu.	extreme drowsiness.	This drug lets you SLEEP. I'm 5'10.5", 180lbs, and on an empty stomach, it makes you very drowsy...sleep is possible within a half hour to an hour. Recently had flu symptoms and a fever. I took fluids, but could not sleep due to muscle aches all over my body, headaches and some pretty bizarre dreams/thoughts. Took 2 Advil Liqui-Gels as recommended - result was 12 hours of uninterrupted sleep - felt much better the second day.	M	34	2  daysas marked 1X D	11/17/2010

5	back pain	I take one capsule 400mg before going to bed at night for back pain, in the past I was waking up with severe back pain, but since I've start taking advil no pain, my only worry is can I continue taking this medicine continously.		M	69	2  weeks	12/5/2008Email
5	Menstrual Cramps	I get a metallic taste in my mouth - but the pain goes away -  thank GOD!	I take 4 advil every 4-6 hours for about 3 days per month. (It ends up being about 16 to 20 per day)  I drink a full glass of water with each dose and try to continue to drink a lot of water to keep my liver flushed.  I would suffer badly without 800MG advil or motrin every few hours, every month. I am SO grateful for it!	F	39	3  days	3/20/2008
