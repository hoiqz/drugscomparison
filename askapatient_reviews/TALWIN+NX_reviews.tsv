4	Degenerative Back Pain/Fibromyalgia	The only time that I experienced any side effects is when I miss my regular dose; which is 1-2 tablets every 6 hours PRN for pain. I usually only take one in the morning, and one before bedtime.	I was originally prescribed Talwin NX for degenerative back pain. Although it doesn't help my back pain very much, it sure does work well for Arthritic shoulders & joint pain. I seem to be tolerating the (generic) {Pentazocine-Naloxone} much better than any other pain medications. Since I can't tolerate Lortab, Percocet, or even the Fentanyl Patch; my options are very limited. When I first started taking this medication, I thought it wasn't working at all. I stayed on the medication and gave it a chance to see if it was going to take awhile to kick in. The only thing I know for sure is; if you have joint pains that ache and throb deep down in the socket, this med should kick the pain right out. It also helps me to sleep. I've never had horrible dreams like some have! When I miss a day or two without it, that's when I start having problems! My head will feel crazy and disoriented. I'll get chills and then I'll start sweating. I believe I'll have to wean off this medication, as with most pain medications. Since I need some sort of pain management, I'll have to stick with Talwin NX. My body fights against me all the time. It knows it's in pain, but it rejects all of the pain medications which are probably stronger and better. I'm in a rock and a hard spot! :-)	F	58	1  years	4/16/2009
4	PAIN CONTROL - SEVER ENDOMETRIOSIS	TERRIFYING VERY REAL DREAMS/NIGHTMARES, "ON-EDGE/MANIC" FEELING, A LITTLE GI UPSET BUT IF TAKEN WITH FOOD THIS IS LESS, INSOMNIA, SMELLED FUNNY ODORS THAT NO ONE ELSE SMELLED	I DIDN'T EXPERIENCE ANY SEDATION WITH TALWIN NX. TASTES TERRIBLE - DON'T LET IT SIT ON YOUR TONGUE AT ALL! WORKED OK FOR MY PAIN CONTROL AND I WAS ABLE TO GO TO WORK SINCE IT WASN'T SEDATING. HOWEVER, I REALLY REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THE VIVID NIGHTMARES IT GAVE ME. I WAS AFRAID TO GO TO SLEEP.	F	25	5  days	3/31/2009
5	chronic pain due to Crohn's	It is sedating, as any narcotic is, but doesn't seem to interfere with breathing.	I can't take NSAIDs, so this is the best pain medication I've used thus far.  It lasts longer than hydrocodone or codeine, so I take less and get more relief.	F	48	2  months	8/4/2007
5	neck, shoulder and arm pain	This makes me little shakey in the beginning but you will be fine if you eat enough food. It can give you euphoria and make you feel a little displaced but other than that it works well for my pain.	I like it... it helps me a lot better than two hydrocodone 7.5/325 and even two percocet 5/325.  It keeps me awake too late sometimes at night if I take it in the late afternoon or anytime in the evening or at night.  The most I've ever taken in one day is 3-1/2 pills, I think, and that is not often.  I usually only need 1 or 2 a day to control the pain the best and keep it in the 1-3 range rather than 8-10 range of the pain chart.	F	38	1.5  years	2/17/2007
5	tummy tuck	sleepliness	I switched from Percocet,which made me sick to my stomach.  This was a good pain controller and minimal side effects.	F	41	4  days	1/23/2007
2	Pain - Pancreatitis	This medication caused a very dizzy and disoriented feeling. Not the kind usually associated with Narcotic pain killers.	This medication is a rather weak pain killer and when taken in excess can cause nausea and mild hallucinations. Be carful exceeding reccomended dosage.	M	20	4  months	7/26/2005
