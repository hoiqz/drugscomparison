1	high blood pressure	This med has caused severe sleep problems.  REM sleep occurs at least 4 times a night, after which I am wide awake with problems going back to sleep.  Daytimes, I am zombie-like, falling asleep whenever I am still.  Dry mouth is a problem also.		F	83	30  days0.2 3X D	1/16/2011

4	high blood pressure	Reddness, at the site, then discoloration for a long time afterwards.I take so many others I don't know what medicine may have caused what, except the awlful patch marks.		F	41	4  days	3/19/2008Email
2	High BP	redness & itching under patch eventually progressed to generalized allergic reaction	My doc prescribed "Nasacort" spray to reduce the itching under the patch, which worked fairly well for about 1-1/2 years. Then the skin reaction got worse and the area stayed red even after patch was removed. Eventually I got a rash that spread from chest to back to arms & legs--entire body. It went away within 4 days after I stopped using the patch & switched to a different BP med.	F	50	2  years	2/17/2008

2	ADHD	None	Was an early step in trying to treat our son's ADHD symptoms.  This one was so mild it didn't do much of anything.  The positive was little risk of side effects and nothing too scary as far as side effects, but it just didn't do anything for ADHD.  Increased the dose to the max and still no results.  Have since moved on to the pure ADHD meds, rather than blood pressure meds with other uses.	M	4	6  months	7/3/2007
4	High blood pressure	Fatigue, loss of vitality, drive, ambition, and energy.	I have tried other medications for high blood pressure, but their side affects were completely intolerable. The Catapres does bring down my blood pressure down to where it should be... so it has given me that... but it has taken some quality of my life in return.	F	54	5  years	6/6/2007
5	blood pressure	none I never knew it was there	I want to continue wearing the patch but I cant afford another month and my husband is on so much medication just to keep breathing on a fixed income its hard	F	75	7  days	5/6/2007Email
