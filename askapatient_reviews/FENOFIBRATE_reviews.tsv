4	Low HDL, High Trigycerides	Some mild tiredness for a few hours after taking. Take before bed and its not an issue.	I'm surprisingly happy with this med.	M	44	1  years160mg? 1X D	2/10/2011
1	Not sure	Horrible respiratory distress.  Could not inhale oxygen into my lungs. Pain in shoulders and neck. Finally traced back to only change (by new doctor).  Quit taking immediately.  It has been 7 days off the stuff and I am so weak and exhausted I can barely walk thru the house.  Of course can't sleep well because of inability to inhale.  I hate this stuff and wouldn't recommend.  I just keep praying the symptoms will go away soon.		F	59	15  days160 mg 1X D	5/21/2010
