4	To regulate my cycle	No pimples; no pregnancy	At 15 my parents put me on this pill to regulate me - I took it for 3 years and then fell off their insurance. I started taking it again in my early twenties for about 2 years. I really had no terrible side effects to speak of - but after my second child I have been diagnosed with Hashimoto disease. This does not run in my family so it could be because of the pill so long ago. Researching to see if there is anyone else out there with this as I am thinking of putting my daughter on it but not with long term side effects.	F	35	5  yearsu/k 1X D	2/12/2013Email

3	Birth Control and low oestrogen lev	I've been on triphasil for a month now. Felt fine the first two weeks, now I've been bleeding for two weeks straight.  Skin has cleared up a bit, but I'm having suicidal thoughts, getting depressed, angry and I'm constantly tired.		M	34	1  months 1X D	8/11/2010
4	Birth control	No weight gain, breakthrough bleeding but nothing severe, I was happy using it!	I have been on Triphasil for 2 years now and I am changing over to Nordette since I experienced breakthrough bleeding. I had a decreased libido and moodiness but nothing severe. It has worked well and I cannot complain.	F	23	2  years 1X D	7/1/2010
1	I had a stroke at the age of 29	I had a stroke after taking the pills for 10 years.  I was under weight, did not smoke,did not due drugs, and did not drink.  I had none of the things that would make me a high risk.  I do now, thanks to Triphasil.		F	43	10  years 1X D	6/16/2010Email

2	to regulate period,raise estrogen	my gp diagnosed me with low estrogen levels and switched my birth control from yasmin to triphasil to sort it out.im due to start the triphasil in 2 weeks,but after reading all the side effects on this site..im pretty scared..weight gain,depression,hair loss,low sex drive..is there any other alternative?		F	24	 	7/7/2009
3	To regulate my menstral cycle	Well about two months ago I started taking the pill. There was no intial side effects. But now after two months I am experiencing the discharge and moods swings like no other.... I have been suffering of headaches/ migrains that lasts a full day...pew..and my breast is sentive and becoming larger like I really need that.There is also a low sex drive.. either than that it is doing what I wanted it to do.. to regulate me menstral cycle.	The only benefit is that I now get my menstral cycle every month instead of every second month.	F	28	2  months	3/5/2009
4	Yes	brief irritable mood prior to period starting, breast tenderness, discharge	I took triphasil and then switched to trivora when they stopped making it. The pill has been great to me. I have normal irritbality and breast tenderness prior to my period starting. I've been on the pill for 13 years now have experienced decreased libido, but I think that is "normal" for having taken a pill for so long. The only think I don't like is increased discharge as a PMS symptom, it sucks but other than that, no acne, no cramps, sleep great, no depression, no aggression, no nausea - I've heard so many other horror stories on other pills!	F	30	13  years	2/5/2009
3	Birth control and Menstrual Cramps	No side effects to begin with.  However, for the past 6-8 months I have had bouts of extreme nausea. Have also experienced severe headaches/migraines. Just before and during the placebo pills I basically experience every symptom of pregnancy. Sex drive has dropped dramatically in the past month.	Has helped immensely in alleviating severe menstrual cramps experienced in the past.	F	22	1  years	1/23/2009
1	triphasil-21 for BC and skin	Noticed cramps 2 weeks before my period and also I started having a brownish discharge which I didn't have with tri-cyclen(weight gain).Felt nauseated while taking the pills and my period wasn't even close.This was for the first 3 months. Been taking it for 3 years and the acne on my back cleared up and on my face it was reduced.After year 2 I started to get mad for no reason. I'd be happy one moment and then my boyfriend would do something small that usually I'd find annoying,with the pills I'd yell at him.I'd get so mad it would cause my heart to beat very rapidly and then I'd be unable to breath.It felt like an anxiety attack. Lost sex drive which could have been due to the vaginal dryness I felt, and it made condoms sting.Got a lot of bladder and yeast infections.Could time them once a month like my period.Still had the discharge 2 weeks before my period which was annoying.Period was shortened from 8 days to 3 or 4. Only benefit though.Breasts got a little bigger,so did everything	Stopped them Apr.2008 when I noticed that the 4 packs I had left had expired in February.Immediately felt happier,but then I noticed my hair was starting to fall out in the shower in clumps!This went on for 8 months!Now my hair, which was once thick, is now feeling very thin and I can see through to the scalp in the front along the hairline.It's about 2 inches back where my hair is very sparse.Periods also very irregular.They started being late about 2 weeks and then sometimes they were late up to a month.Constantly worried that I was pregnant though I never was and had no reason to think I was because I always used protection, but nothing is full proof.Skin also broke out very badly.Had a lot on my face and some on my back.It's Jan 09 and the acne is reduced, my period is some what regulated, but now lasts anywhere from 8-14 days.The last one I had was 14 days of light flow on and off.It would go for 2 days then stop for 2 days.I now feel paranoid every time my hair comes out.It's not	F	27	3  years	1/10/2009
4	birth control	First time about a year ago I took them with no side effects at all (for 9 months I was using the pil). now I have little bleeding since I started using it about 25 days ago everyday at some point i have a discharge.????	Whay no problems and then the one problem you just dont want...	F	23	25  days	1/4/2009
5	Mennhorhagia	Bloating		M	16	2  months	8/19/2008
5	first birth control prescribed	i started taking triphasil at 16, had initial water weight gain but lost it shortly afterward. other than that, it took my 2 week long periods down to 3 days flat. i loved it.	i took triphasil for almost 4 years until they discontinued it. after they stopped making it i took trivora and the side effects were horrifying. a little difference does go a long way. too long id say. i had bad bad cramps near my kidneys 2 hours on the dot after id take the pill and become nauseated with additional stomach pain and that would last about 6-8 hours where i could barely move. i felt like i was dying! i now take trinessa, generic for ortho tri-cyclen and i have no side effects from it, besides again, initial weight gain but my period is at least 7 days long up to 10 days once in awhile. i wish they would bring triphasil back. it was by far the best.	F	21	3  years	7/21/2008Email
5	Periods 2x monthly, bad PMS	Tri-levlen 28 was the ONLY birth control pill I would take that would control both my bad PMS and having two periods a month (really!). I took it for 15 years until the pharmacy all of a sudden gave me a generic version one day, which I could not tolerate and went into horrible depressions before and after my period. This has been the case for TWO YEARS. I've even lost my job twice due to the depression. My gyno put me on Lybrel to stop my periods. I went through hell on the third month, lost my job then (it was like going through a fast version of menopause). Now, I'm going having week-long pms-like symptoms every other week. It's hell. I'm calling Bayer and asking them to bring it back!	The medical industry does not fully understand or respect how hormones can affect women, even the smallest amounts! Clearly, if a generic has something minor different from the brand AND affects a woman so much, then it's time to take us more seriously!	F	40	15  years	5/24/2008
5	had been taking triphasil since 16	no side effects at all. had been on this BC pill for 15 years. did experience however about 6 months ago my period coming later. i'd finish the pack of 28 and wouldn't get my period until day 2 of new pack. found it strange that after so many years of being on triphasil that i'd experience such a change. dr prescribed yasmin which i did not like and now trying loestrin (on day 1 of pack 1 today).	overall i must say this BC pill was fantasic! did get a bit moody (angry, upset, crying) a week before my period would arrive but i knew when in the pill pack they'd be coming so i'd be careful. sex drive was great. no major complaints!!	F	32	15  years	5/4/2008Email
2	Birth control	ek was altyd naar gewees and my breasts were very tender. very painful	i always wanted to vomit and felt as though I was pregnant. My breasts grew but had to change to Nordette	F	25	19  days	4/7/2008
5	Tri Levlin	No Side Effects at all	I am soooo sad, I have been on Tri-Levlin for 7 years and everything was great, as soon as I took the generic I developed terrible side effects and have been on 3 different pills that I hate! I wish that they still produced Tri Levlin	F	26	7  years	1/28/2008
4	To regulate menstruation	Never experienced side effects for the past 20 months, but I have recently  experienced headaches during my periods.	It helped reduce my period pains which were very severe. I recommend it.	F	26	21  months	1/17/2008
5	birth control	none	I have tried almost every birth control on the market, and this one is by far the best! (I'm taking Trivora--the generic.) I have no side effects (maybe weight gain, but I can't confirm that). My period stops on time, no migraines, and no crazy moodswings! I would recommend this to anyone--however, I know from experience that not one b/c works for everyone. Find one that works, and stick with it! :)	F	24	1  months	1/15/2008Email
5		I have been taking Triphasil for about 8 years and I have never had any problems with it.  3 days before the end of the cycle I had just one day of mood swings.  I had to stop taking it a year ago because of possible complications with other medicines.  Being off of it was an extreme shock to my system for the last year (horrible cramps that I hadn't experienced ever before and massive mood swings for a week leading up to my period). Went back on it 2 months ago and everything was back to normal.  Then I go to get my refill today and heard it was really discontinued and that I need to see a doctor to get a recommendation for another pill.  Nice to know.  I know this will mess up my system again.  Please tell me this is just like what you guys said before about it being out of stock and not discontinued like they said.		F	25	8  years	1/14/2008Email
3	BC and to regulate menstruation	Made me vomit the first day and a few times during the year I took it.	No other side effects other than the vomiting.  Boo vomiting.	F	21	1  years	1/5/2008

1	To regulate menstruation	EXTREMELY HEAVY BLEEDING FOR 2 MONTHS WITH NO END IN SIGHT!!!	First of all, why the hell did my doctor prescribe this knowing it was off the market? Second, during my 4th month on Triphasil 28s, I began to have heavy vaginal bleeding. That was 7 and a 1/2 weeks ago and it is STILL ongoing. I soak through 4-5 pads PER HOUR. I have absolutely ZERO energy and I'm afraid.	F	31	5  months	11/14/2007
5	birth control	none really, little weight gain when I first started taking it - but that was years ago	I cant believe it - they are taking this and Tri-levlen off the market.  What good options for birth control exist in pills?  According to this website, most other ones have mostly bad ratings becuse of side effects. I've been on Triphasil and Trilevlen for years with no problems - now I dont know where to turn or take! Any advice?	F	31	5  years	10/4/2007
5	Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome	None it was the best BC pill ever!	Was on Triphasil-28 for close to 8 years and was devastated to learn it was going off market. Was lucky to have six month supply but ran out. Ordered it from Canada and it isn't the same formula. I am now on Yasmin and hope it works! My dr is saying it is great for women with PCOS. Any advice would be appreciated!	F	35	8  years	8/13/2007

5	birth control	none	I wasn't even aware that Tri-phasil wasn't available anymore until today. I went to the health dept. to get more pills and they gave me Ortho-Novum 777 instead. I'm nervous about switching pills. I loved Tri-phaisil-28. Never had any problems with it. Why is it gone? I really want it back!	F	25	6  years	4/11/2007

5	Birth control	None!  I do get one or two pimples a few days before I get my period but that's about it.	I've been on Alesse, Ortho-Tricyclen and Tricyclen and they all have had bad side effects on me.  Triphasil has been great so far!  With the shortage, I now switched to Triquillar (which is the same as Triphasial but it's made by a different manufacturer) and it's the same as Triphasil!	F	24	1.5  years	11/27/2006
5	Prevent pregnancy, regulate period	None at all.	I loved Triphasil and very upset about the fact that it's not available anywhere.  I have been on it for 6 yrs now and recently been switched to TRIQUILAR.  I'm worried that switching like this will alter the efficacy.  Apparently it does not, but I am  worried.  If you have tips or info please email me.	F	23	6  years	11/11/2006Email

1	Birth control & to regulate periods	I had a STROKE after taking this contraceptive for ONLY 2 1/2 months!!!!!!!!!!!  I had taken Lo-estrin FE for about 14 years and had no problems. Was switched to this to regulate periods & had a stroke at 38 years old...PLEASE READ ADDT'L COMMENTS!	I was not at risk for a stroke;no high blood pressure, no diabetes, don't smoke. I experienced a BAD pain in my left calf that lasted about 1 day.  Just a few days later, I had an ischemic stroke.My cardiologist thinks there is a STRONG link between my change in contraceptive to this and the blood clot that caused my stroke. I have a patent foramen ovale, which MANY people have & never have a problem! I did not know this until the stroke.The blood clot passed through this PFO & into my brain.Would I have had a clot if it weren't for these pills....We cannot be 100% sure, but it sure is a coincidence. Please be careful on these!My life has changed.I will be on Coumadin for the rest of my life!	F	38	2  months	11/2/2006
1	Increase sex drive	HAIR LOSS! No sex drive. Less moody than Ortho Tri Cyclen. Regular periods. No nausea, vomiting, or headaches. Acne was the same as on OTC.	I went on this pill to increase my sex drive and it didn't work. It did, however, make my hair fall out. My hairline has receded in certain places and my hair is much thinner. I thought it was normal shedding until it didn't stop and half my hairline receded farther back than the other half. I was on it for six months when i noticed the major shedding and hairline. I recently got off it and I pray my hair will grow back. If it hadn't been for this I would liked the pill. I had no other bad side effects. My sex drive is zero on every pill I've taken so this pill was not different. I was a little less moody on it than on Ortho Tri Cyclen. I had regular periods that weren't heavy but weren't really really light either.	F	26	7  months	10/31/2006

5	prevent pregnancy	None so far	Been taking triphasil for about a year or 2 after Marvelon gave me spotting.  It's great...clears up the skin, and no visible weight gain.  I have been having skin problems lately, but I'm not too sure if it is related to the birth control.  I am also having problems getting it through my pharmacist.  Pretty sure if you google it, you can find out what's going on.  But overall, it's great...and does the job well!	F	23	1.5  years	9/24/2006
5	Birth Control	I have not experienced many side effects.  My breasts get a little tender and look bigger (no complaints there!) mid pack but this happens whether I'm on the pill or not. I'm a bit crabby the week before my period but nothing worth being concerned about. I never really had acne but when I did go off thi spill I noticed that I got pimples and when I went back on they cleared up and my skin is pefect. No nausea and I've never gained or lost any weight while being on Triphasil.	This is a great pill. My GYN put me on this pill when I was 20 and other than coming off it to get pregnant I've never had any issues.  I did try Ortho 777 after haviong my second child and I had break through bleeding for 3 months. I switched back on Triphasil it all stopped.	F	35	15  years	9/22/2006

1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.	F	52	8  years20 MG 1X D	1/13/2012Email
2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
