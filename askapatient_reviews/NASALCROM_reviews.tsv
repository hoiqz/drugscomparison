2	Allergic Rhinitis	I cannot take antihistamines and thoughtNasalcrom would be my saving grace.  It did seem to help, but after 3 months of using it did cause racing heart beat.		F		3  months40 mg	9/8/2012Email
5	Allergic Rhinitis	It causes a scratchy throat if it drips down the throat. Must tilt head forward when using spray to prevent this from happening.	Have used for 3 months per year for past 4 years, during fall ragweed season. Works well, but I must use up to 5 times per day during peak pollen season. It has allowed me to discontinue nasal steroidal sprays. For some reason my eyes feel less dry and more comfortable than when I used Nasonex (and other similar prescriptions).

2	Year round allergies	Post-nasal drip, sore throat, swollen glands	With each use of Nasalcrom, I experienced an almost immediate post-nasal drip, mild sore throat, and swollen glands in my neck.  I didn't connect the symptoms with the Nasalcrom at first. The last time I used it, I experienced the same symptoms but to a much more severe (painful) degree, lost my voice for a several days, and had raspy breathing. It took about 5 days for everything to clear up. This may be an unusual reaction, but I won't be using Nasalcrom anymore.	F	56	7  days 2X D	9/28/2010
4	Allergies	Metallic "smell" sensation I experienced after dentist used a specialized surface cleaner has persisted for a month now. May not be related to Nasalcrom or may be specific issue, but the but the sensation has persisted after I discontinued use about 2 weeks later (having used 12 weeks overall as suggested by manuf.) Can't be sure of the relationship at this time, however I note that metallic sensations are stated with other nasal applicators and can't rule out the connection.	As an allergy medication this product is spectacular. After the second week of use I thought that there were no allergens this summer, but my friends were all suffering miserably. I highly recommend the product given my specific reservations.	M	45	3  months	9/5/2007
1	Allergic Rhinitis	Nightmares, acne, increased hunger/weight gain, increased thirst, dehydration, constipation, depression (crying no reason), increased agitation/irritability, sinus swelling, nasal congestion (just like when I used Singulair).	Okay - this stuff works.  And works well IF you use it 4x a day for greater than 2 weeks.  BUT at the 2 month point - I had to stop.   I KNOW this is not Singulair, but it is STILL a mast cell inhibitor and 7% of each squirt up your nose DOES get absorbed into the bloodstream.   I was shocked.  I didn't even know what was going on - and then it hit me.  THIS is a mast cell inibitor JUST LIKE singulair.   In fact, it is even a type of "something" sodium chemical, just like Singulair.   My side effects were IDENTICAL as when I took Singulair for 2 months.  Am I the only one?   I was even urinating all the time and had insomnia at night, racing heart - the whole deal!  Really nuts.  And I was so dissapointed too - because it DID work so well.  So use with caution and if you DO get side effects / don't believe its not the drug.  ALL DRUGS HAVE SIDE EFFECTS...and anything you take in orally or put on any mucus membrane WILL get absorbed and the longer you use it, well - you get th	F	41	2  months	4/19/2007Email
5	allergies; extreme nose irritation	Started getting nasal relief in a few days.  I take zyrtec all year, but sometimes need a boost when I get allergy attacks.	Takes a while to feel benefits, but helped a ton.  A few times a year I need a more medication than just my regular antihistamine, so I take benadryl and/or nasalcrom.	F	30	4  weeks	10/17/2006
3	allergies, sinus headaches	NONE	NasalCrom works fairly well.  I started it because all the antihistamines were giving me terrible side effects.  NasalCrom is OTC and is supposed to be one of the safest drugs available for allergies.  Downside is it has to be repeated every 4 hours.  I've read it works best after about 2 weeks, I'm not quite there yet.  If I were able to take it once or twice a day I would be pretty happy with it.  It's not as strong as other antihistamines I've taken, but I don't get drowsy or moody.	F	32	6  days	4/4/2005
