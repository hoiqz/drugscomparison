1	diabetes 2	pain in heart. Felt like a squeezing every 6 hours. It would slowly ease up. Weight gain	I took it on and off for over a year and at first there was little symthoms but then the pain in the heart started and I stopped it. The pain stopped immediatly and I lost the weight that was gained.	M	69	1  years5mg 1X D	10/18/2011
3	Diabetes type 2	Drug lowered my glucose level about 50 points on average. By lunch time, my level was around 55 which is too low. If I take a snack 3 hours after a meal, the glucose level stays good. Slight weight gain. Sunlight sensitive. Noise from nose when breathing sometimes.	It's working so far without too much discomfort.	M	65	4  months	2/14/2008
1	type 2 diabetes	While taking this along with metformin, and actos, blood surgars drops too low by lunchtime.  Rapid weight gain. Drowiness.  Extreme fatigue, night sweats, problems with feet, chest pains, pain down my right arm, tightness in my chest.  Always feeling like I was out of it.  Had no control over my life.

4		none except more energetic after dinner (taking glucotrol before dinner)	reduced glucose level by 30%	M		2  years	8/4/2006Email
3	type II diabetes	I've experienced cramps from increased ovulation,bloating, weight gain (despite proper diet and exercise) It is discouraging that I am gaining wieght and am tired all the time.	I've been taking glipizide for 1 month after taking glucophage for several months. Glipiide caused less stomach irritation than glucophage. It also helped bring my blood sugar levels from an average of 323 to 173. However I am going to request a different drug because of the side effects.	F	28	1  days	3/18/2006Email
3	type II diabetes	in addition to cramps, bloating, weight gain, I've also developped a rash on my face after 1 week of taking the drug my skin in the past has always been clear, i've never had acne nor any other skin disorder, I wonder if it's the drug		F	28	 	3/18/2006Email
4	Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes	Nothing so far.  At least, I have no physical maladies now that I didn't have when I wasn't taking Glucotrol.	The side effects concern me, and my doctor hopes to control my blood glucose through diet and exercise alone eventually.	M	28	6  months	7/26/2004
3	Diabetes II	Hypoglycemia when I took it briefly when first diagnosed.  Later when I took with high sugars, no side effects distinguished.	This definitely seems to help lower sugar levels no matter what average is.  Though don't expect it to bring down a high average right away to normal.  Took 5mg for a couple of weeks without noticeable improvement while average sugars were 250.  Drug is good at potential cost of pancreas burnout or more insulin resistance. (5mg daily, 24 BMI)	M	24	14  days	4/2/2004Email
5	glucose levels over 400 mg/dL		My mother, now 84 years old, was in Glucotrol XL for about 6 months which brought her glucose level around 170-180 mg/dL. The doctor decided to try a combination of Glucotrol XL 10mg twice a day and Avandia 2 mg twice a day. This combination brought the glucose levels to 90 to 120 mg/dL.	F	84	3  years	3/29/2004Email

3	To control Blood Sugar levels	I was taking with Avandia and felt so weak I could not funtion.  Dr. took me off Glucotrol XL and put me on Avandia 8mg.  Felt much better but Blood Sugar levels have climbed to 200.		M	68	1  years	8/10/2001
