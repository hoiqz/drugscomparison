5	UTI	It took 6 days to work, but I had no negative side effects	Positive side effect was that it cured me of an indigestion/gas problem I'd been having for about 6 months. Absolutely cured it.	F	50	6  days500mg 3X D	2/18/2013

5	infection following skin surgery	Heartburn enough to look it up and mild nausea. A constant feeling of needing to burp, but not burping. Trouble sleeping. It is working and the infection responded immediately. The stomach issues are uncomfortable, yet not yet intolerable.		F	54	6  days 4X D	12/10/2012
1	Prevent a Urinary Tract Infectio	I had indigestion (severe), loss of appetite, nausea, stomach cramps, stomach pain, tiredness.  I was prescribed it on 6/6/2012.  I took it for 3 days, but the symptoms never abated and seemed to get worse.	I tried Keflex twice, but had the same symptoms.	M	50	3  days500 MG 1X D	10/2/2012
2	infected cyst near my scrotum	worried about diarrhea side effect - i ate some yogart  as a precaution. have not had this problem but the infection is about the same.		M	75	4  days500mg 2X D	8/19/2012
2	folliculitis from laser resurfacing	Horrific nightmares (thought I was crazy), and a feeling like I have only had on a cruise ship.  Light headedness, dizziness, and close to fainting when standing.	I have takent this drug before, but not in such a huge dose.  Also, I take Metformin.  I have honestly thought I needed to see a psychiatrist....it was so bad.  I cried all day on the 3rd day.	F	56	4  days500 mg 4X D	7/13/2012Email

2	Prevent infection from a boil	I think is medicine gave me a horrible yeast infection. After about the 5 or 6 day i felt terrible burning and itching and it felt like insides were going to fall out. Lets not mention the diarrhea. I swear I went to the bathroom every five minutes. This medicine is terribly annoying and I wish i would have found this site sooner. I still have 9 pills to take but I am discontinuing this medicine. I can't function without staying in the bathroom all day long.		F	28	10  days500mg 3X D	5/31/2012Email
1	uti	really bad cramping in back,that radiated around to my stomach, then came the naseua and vomiting..	Had the same reaction to amoxicillin a couple years ago. I knew this drug was similar but I decided to give it a try because my urine culture showed the bacteria would work good with this medicine, and I didn't want to go on cipro after hearing all the bad things that can happen with that. Got a new prescription from the doc, hopefully that works better and gets rid of this damn uti.	F	24	1  days500mg 4X D	4/11/2012Email
4	Prevention of infection to cut	I would say that at first all I really noticed was the diarrhea which I usually have when I take antibiotics, about 3days ago I noticed that I was constipated that went away next symptom was spotting for about 2days I didn't think much of it until today that I was experiencing mild burning, itching and irritation to my vaginal area for about 2-3 days I had to go to the emergency room to make sure I wasn't coming down with a yeast infection or BV (bacterial vaginosis) I have extremely sensitive skin and my ph balance goes haywire quickly from any slight disturbance.		F	25	8  days500Mg	2/11/2012Email
2	Recovery from rhinoplasty	Gas, unexplainable GAS! Absolutely ridiculous! Insomnia- only slept a couple hours each night. Dry mouth not helpful when I already couldn't breath through my nose. Diarrhea. Headaches. Hot and cold flashes all day and night. High blood pressure which was attributed to my insomnia. Will never take this again!		F	32	10  days	2/10/2012
1	UTI	Horrible anxiety, heart racing. Loss of appetite. Panic attack. Fast pulse.	I stopped taking this drug.	F	61	2  days500 2X D	1/26/2012Email
2	throat	i experienced horrible symptoms of anxiety; my heart was pounding and i was up at night with terrifying hallucinations, the likes of which i didnt even think i could ever imagine. i wasnt sure if i was going to wake up if i did fall asleep. i had a feeling of absolute terror. i had psychosomatic disturbances and was convinced there was something in my house. i had seriously distrubing images in my head that i could not get rid of and i was totally panicked all night.	just because drugs have been around for awhile and are considered "safe" does not mean that doctors should be handing them out like candy because they dont want to think of anything else to do.	F	25	3  days500 mg 4X D	12/19/2011
1	sinus infection	Had to stop taking this poison! I felt terrible, tired, spacey, drugged, nauseated and after taking it for 8 days i stopped and started with the stomach pains and the runs..not good!! I think i was poisoned!		F	49	10  days25 3X D	12/19/2011Email
1	prevention of infection from cut	my husband flipped out, was about to punch our 7 year old daughter in the face, was just plain mean, like when he was on drugs and ran out,		M	38	4  days500mg 4X D	11/16/2011Email
3	cellulitis d/t insect bite	horrible muscle ache on day three, but tolerable.	Minimal sign of improvements of affected arm, but take into account of short duration of treatment.	F	24	3  days500 mg 4X D	10/21/2011
4	Strep	GROUCHY	I was definitely grouchy after about day 3 on this, but nothing I couldn't handle. I went from miserable with strep to feeling better in 2 days flat. Took the full measure to be safe. Side effects sucked, but it was wayyy better than the strep! No other bad side effects. Don't be too afraid to try this, it definitely helped me and is WAY milder than some alternatives.	F	22	  1X D	8/16/2011
1	for a bad tooth	Almost everything.  I finally called my doctor a couple of days ago.  I only had 2 pills left to take and she told me not to take them.  I have horrible body aches, very weak, slight diarrhea at first then constipation, foggy heavy feeling head, I am an anxious person to start with and this drug made it way worse, absolutely no appetite.	Plus side it did take away the tooth pain and jaw inflammation.  I have been off for almost 2 days still have horrible body aches and extreme weakness.  Will NEVER take this again.  I am hoping that the rest of these side effects disappear very shortly.	F	42	7  days500 3X D	7/29/2011
4	skin infection	Mild to moderate itching over 90% of my body.  Mild to moderate swelling and pain in my feet and ankles.	It smells terrible and the side effects are uncomfortable but not intolerable.  It seems to be working though.	F	34	10  days500 mg 4X D	6/18/2011Email
4	SEVERE SINUS AND EAR INFECTION	NONE THAT I HAVE NOTICED AND I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO MEDICATION, PARTICULARLY ANTIBIOTICS. I HAVE HAD NEAR FATAL REACTIONS TO THE CLASS OF POISONS CALLED LEVAQUIN AND CIPRO AND ALL THAT GARBAGE. THIS DRUG (TAKEN WITH A PRO BIOTIC AS ALWAYS) CLEARED THE INNER EAR PAIN AND INFECTION THE 2NE OR 3RD DAY OF TAKING IT.	WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE, ESP. THOSE ALLERGIC OR SENSITIVE TO THOSE NEW WEIRD MEDS AND ANTI B'S LIKE Z PACKS AND QUINOLONES	F	31	5  days500 MG 4X D	6/17/2011Email
4	Strep Throat/Strep Infection	Loss of appitite, mild body aches/headaches, chills (not often), fatigue	It worked very well to clear up the infection. The side effects were more of a nusience than anything.	M	16	10  days500 3X D	4/18/2011Email
5	bronchitis/strep	Gas, Diarrhea	Works wonders for infections. I fetl 95% better after first dose, Worth the farting and diarreha.	F	42	7  days500mg 2X D	3/31/2011Email
5	UTI	I always take pro-biotics (acidophilus, 1 billion CFU) when taking any antibiotic as my body tries really hard to react w/ a yeast infection.  So, far taking 4 days and okay, maybe a little gas.		F	48	7  days250 mg 4X D	3/14/2011
5	UTI	nothing really.  A little dizzyness.	This is my go-to drug for a UTI.  I had a really bad experience with Macrobid, and Keflex is much gentler on my system.  This works to clear my UTI in 3 days.  It's not as potent as Macrobid (which seriously cleared my UTI in one day, but also made me sick and gave me weird numbness).  I am happy with Keflex.

5	Sinus Infection	No bad side effects. This is my second time using it, I used it about a year ago. Works better then the other 6 ones I tried and is free at publix. Last time used 3x for two weeks and now 4x for 2 weeks	Smells and tastes bad. Will give you some stinky farts	M	31	9  days500 MG 3X D	7/12/2010Email
5	Bacterial Infection in Throat	Nausea, abdominal pain, heartburn, mild burping	Horrible smell & taste, but it works. Its worth every dime.	M	20	10  days500 4X D	4/29/2010Email
5	Strep Throat	None	Works very well and QUICKLY.  Went from terribly sore throat and fever with chills to 97.5 the next morning.  2 days after first pill brings ya back to 100%.  Smelly pills but who cares if it works.  Highly recommend for appropriate infections.	M	45	7  days250MG 4X D	4/27/2010
1	Surgery	I took it after my breast reduction and didn't know I was allergic to penicillin and I went into allergic shock and needed epinephrine (sp?), almost dided.	Don't take if you are allergic to Penicillin!	F	21	3  days	12/12/2009
5	Hand laceration	gas	second time i took this ab, my hand is healing remarkable well. Only complaint is mild gas. Most that are young and healthy do not have problems with this ab.	F	23	4  days	11/17/2009
3	Cellulitis	None so far after 2 days	The pills have a terrible smell and taste, so be sure to take them with a thick drink and hold your breath when opening the bottle! Yuck!!!	F	24	7  days	10/8/2009
4	UTI	Only a little diarrhea	This is one of the ONLY AB I can take that doesnt give me severe stomach cramping, muscle pains, and brain fogg. If this type of med is appropriate for your condition-go for it-way better than fluoroquinolones.	F	30	7  days	7/8/2009
1	Ear infection - staph	At first, none.  Very slight loose bowels.  I was in a better than normal mood because I've started having strange reactions to other meds lately.  However, this didn't even touch the infection.  So it was worthless.  Now, I have a burning pain on my shoulders and face like I have subburn.  I may have lupus so maybe this is why I'm having issues.  Very scared also because I have tons of little bumps on my skin that are slowly turning red and when rubbed, bleed.  I hope I don't die from this or any other antibiotic to try and cure a staph infection that won't go away.Now I have a ringing in my ear that won't go away.  YAY, thanks medical community for probably killing me.	Doctors should be ashamed. They really know very little about the human body but come off as if they have a clue.  Reality is, they are throwing us to the wolves with antibiotics.  The more we take them the more we are at risk for serious diseases like thyroid problems and other auto immune issues.  A healthy body can become very unhealthy from taking dose after dose of these poisions made to kill bacteria AND everything else in your body.  	M	37	10  days	4/24/2009
3	Wound infection	Oral Thrush and vaginal yeast infections	Has worked in the past but this is the first time I have experienced these side effects.	F	51	4  days	3/26/2009
2	preparation for root canal	Anxiety	Taking it as a precaution prior to root canal--hope it works since the anxiety is terrible	F	65	5  days	3/22/2009
5	sinus infection/bronchitis	none	I felt better the very next day! The only thing I disliked about it was the smell/aftertaste of swallowing the pill.. but I hate just about any pill taste.	F	24	10  days	3/13/2009
1	Abscess on upper ear cartilage	Absolutely nothing, no side effects.	In addition to no side effects, there were no effects at all whatsoever! After 4 days I was switched to another antibiotic, and my doc told me he tried me on the keflex at first because it was cheap! They made me fart, and well, open up the bottle and smell them. They smell like farts themselves.	F	21	4  days	2/23/2009
1	paronychia	loss of appetite, confusion, gas, tiredness, moody	Took 1500mg a day for 2 weeks and it did nothing for the infection in my finger. Proved to be worthless except to make me more uncomfortable.	F	30	2  weeks	1/19/2009
1	cut hand to bone	I got diarrhea and loose bowels for months and I'm not sure I needed the damn drug in the first place. I took Flagyl then, finally, to get rid of the loose bowels, which worked during the week's course but only for two days after the course was done at which time, suffering a bad cold, I again succumbed to this infuriating condition.	I don't know what this medicine is good for	M	40	7  days	11/9/2008Email
1	Sinus Infections.	NIGHTMARES.  I am anxious by nature, so I cannot concretely attribute anxiety to Keflex as well.  I just woke up from a nightmare that has thrown me into a panic attack and shot my blood pressure thru the roof.  I NEVER have nightmares, but have taken Keflex on 4 or 5 separate occasions and had nightmares each time.  I have 2 doses left but I am DONE.	I have trouble finding antibiotics that do not aggravate my colitis.  I thought Keflex was going to be my drug of choice for the sinus infections I keep getting because of allergy attacks I have been having.  I guess NOT.  My pharmacist has 'never heard of nightmares from Keflex' so if you have experienced this and would like to email me about it please feel free to do so.	F	40	9  days	9/29/2008Email
5	Cystitis	None	Worked very well. Second time I have taken it for cystitis and it cleared up sypmtoms very quickly	F	27	7  days	9/26/2008
3	Root canal & Boils	Severe Gas	My husband and I called these my "tootie pills."  Lots and lots of gas all day and all night.  These worked for my root canal - no infections or problems.  They did not work for my boils.	F	35	14  days	9/16/2008
1	infected tooth	Nightmares, hallucinations, lack of judgement, panic attacks, depression	I had taken the drug one time previously, also dentist prescribed and experienced thrush.  The second time led to a total mental breakdown. My therapist told me that many antibiotics can affect your mind.	F	55	5  days	7/18/2008
1	Sinus Infection	I took this several times over the years for sinus infections with no side effects and then my most recent infection I developed anxiety from the drug and had to stop taking it.	I lowered the dosage but still had the anxiety effect.  Stopping the drug caused it to subside.	M	45	2  days	6/21/2008
2	Post hand surgery	Dry mouth, nauseau, heart burn, soft stool matter, low energy levels, headache and a constant dry cough.	This med was taken for preventive post surgery infection. I guess it prevented, but the side effects were tough on my recovery.	M	41	7  days	3/28/2008Email
2	post-surgery prophylactic	diahrea lasting couple weeks; took awhile to connect the drug with this side effect.		F	39	8  days	2/23/2008
2	paronychia	No side effects, took it for 7 days.	Worthless, had no effect.	M	54	7  days	2/20/2008
4	perioral dermatitis			F	29	2  months	7/30/2007
4	Infected Toenail	Abdominal cramping, diarrhea	I took this drug sever times over 6 months for some ingrown toenails that became infected.  While it cleared up the infections, it always gave me diarrhea.  I never knew about the probiotics until a little bit ago.  if I have to take this again, i will use the probiotics with it.	M	38	10  days	7/7/2007
5	general malaise/body aches/fever	none	worked well; no notiecable side effects; felt better in short amt. of time	F	44	8  days	6/30/2007
3	Toe Wound	Severe gas when taken with ibuprofen, mild diarrhea, bloating, trouble sleeping, lethargy.	Sleeping problems may be non-related. Tiredness is common for me with any form of antibiotic. The gas was a surprise. I was taking the pills for a while before I had this reaction. It seems my anti-viral medication was acting as an antacid. Taken alone it causes some mild gas and bloating. Taken with ibuprofen the gas reaction is severe, especially on an empty stomach. Taken with the anti-viral medication and no ibuprofen the reaction is very mild, almost non-existent. The diarrhea is another mild side-effect.	F	37	7  days	6/27/2007
3	impetigo	my doctor told me that cephalosporin antibiotics (keflex, omnicef, etc.) frequently cause yeast infections and to take a probiotic supplement with it, so i did...and i still got a yeast infection!! ugh!! but it did to what it was supposed to do as far as clearing up my skin infection.		F	19	10  days	6/16/2007
2	Post-op infection;cellulitus	NONE	I took this on two separate occasions: first for a severe bacterial infection in a wound caused by a rose thorn and it did nothing (cellulitus); second incident was for a surgery site (appendicitus) infection post-op with the same non-result. The cellulitus was cured by intravenous antibiotics and the post-op by amoxicillin. For cellulitus dosing was only for 1 day as infection spread up full arm length and required emergency intervention; for post-op: 10 days.	F	52	10  days	5/11/2007
3	Infection in teeth (root canals)	Well, I can't really say if these "side effects" are really side effects, but I have been getting heartburn mostly everyday. I think my heartburn is Acid Reflux and not related to Keflex. Since this is not a pain medication-I don't think there is any side effects.	I would like to know if Keflex is okay to take with an antacid like Mylanta or Tums. Since I have been having horrible heartburn almost everyday- I HAD to take Mylanta today. I am on 250mg and I take 4 of them per day. I only have a week supply. I am sure the infection will NOT go away until I get the two root canals done.  (I am taking Vicodin for the pain and I only take that when I really need it-at night).  Other than that-I don't have any concerns about Keflex.	F	31	3  days	5/6/2007Email
5	cellulitis from spider bite	none	the rash from the spider bite, and the pink circle of infection around it, turned bluish and faded away.	F	27	7  days	5/2/2007
1	Sinus Infection and Bronchitis	Extremely itching throat, couldn't stop coughing. Extremely bad whooping cough all through night, losing bladder. Pulled muscles all over body from coughing after taking this medicine that was unrelated to the Bronchitis.	I told my doctor I was allergic to penicillin and don't know why she would give me this when it says people who are allergic to penicillin can have a reaction to this drug.	F	33	2  days	3/9/2007
1	infection from a PICC line	My toung & throat (& mouth) got swollen.  It wasn't until I kept bitting my toung a few days that I realized it was swollen & I was having problems swollowing which indicated my throat was also swollen.	I had taken keflex many years before & never had this reaction but it just happened this time I took it.  I had been hospitalized due to anemia & mal nutrition & the PICC line that they put in for the IV nutrition became infected so keflex was prescribed for it.	F	52	2  days	2/16/2007
1	flu	To be blunt...I had to buy adult diapers while using this.  Ugh!!!		M	60	5  days	1/18/2007

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email
1	depression/anxiety	severe muscle weakness, tremors that have yet to stop 2 months in, not sleeping, pacing		M	44	5  days5mg 1X D	9/19/2011
1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email
1	depression	i would studder sweat like crazy eye twitching hyperactive cry for no reason heart pounding out my chest really high blood pressure pass out from panic attacks insomia talk really fast umm flame up inside theres more thid pill sucks i thought i was going to die		M	31	 30mg 1X D	8/25/2011Email
5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!	M	37	21  days10 1X D	2/24/2011Email
5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
