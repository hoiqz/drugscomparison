5	Lupus, FM	none whatsoever	When my doctor prescribed this medication and I took it for the first time, I couldn't believe how I had survived without it for so long. The pain in my joints and connective tissue can be excruciating and would normally force me to stay in bed all day. I now take 3x50mg tablets at 6:00am every morning, and by 9:00am I am usually able to get up and get ready for work. Without Tramadol/Ultram I couldn't even lift my arms to take a shower. Wonder drug for me.	F	42	1  years150 1X D	7/13/2013
4	Lupus and Fibromyalgia pain	Hard to say exactly what symptoms are caused by Tramadol, as I am on numerous meds, but I do experience mild relief from sometimes MAJOR lupus pain. It does not make me confused, sleepy, or dizzy. Weight gain when I started this and 2 other meds, but it doesn't seem that is common with Tramadol, so I don't think it's the culprit. I sweat like a menopausal woman or chemo patient just by vacuuming. It may be the lupus, but my doctor feels that it is the Tramadol causing it. Yuck.	I like this medication. For most people with mild to moderate pain, this is a great choice. My lupus affects my joints and tendons, and it often feels like someone is injecting battery acid into my joints, so I'm on the high end of pain many days. It is not strong enough for all of my pain, so I have a breakthrough pain med, but it is a good daily medication, and when I miss it, I do not feel any side effects, i.e. it is not addictive for me. The only downside is the sweats. Keep a handkerchief handy just in case. Also be careful not to take too many. It slows your breathing, and can cause you to stop breathing in your sleep if you overdose.	F	38	1  years100 mg 4X D	7/2/2013Email
5	arthritis/fibromyalgia	None		F	54	10  years200mg/day	6/2/2013
4	Headache caused by chemotherapy	Itching, euphoric	I personally like this medication; it just dulls the pain, doesn't really take it away but it's better than nothing and I like that I don't have to have a hard copy of the prescription. It did cause a lot of itching at first so I took it with Benadryl and then I started to get over the itching. It doesn't put me to sleep like some other pain meds and I stopped taking it a couple days ago (as chemo is over) and I don't feel any discomfort, i.e. withdrawal. Maybe that will come later but for now, I'm satisfied with the results and would take it again.	F	48	2  months50 2X D	5/31/2013Email
1	shoulder pain	I took one dose at bedtime and woke up in the middle of the night itching, but it wasn't severe and I fell back asleep.  In the morning I was so dizzy and sleepy, I had a hard time getting kids ready for school.  I was too dizzy to drive so someone else had to drive them to school.  I went back to sleep for 3 hours.  I remained dizzy the rest of the day with a slight headache and even took another nap.	This drug did NOT help my pain at all.  I will not take this drug again.	F	35	1  days50 mg 1X D	5/23/2013Email
5	Fibromyalgia pain, chronic fatigue	Itching around my nose if I take a dose too close to bedtime. I use Lanacane to help relieve the itch.	Thank God for Tramadol! Without this med, I'm curled into a little ball in my bed due to my fibro pain. It also gives me a little energy, especially if I drink caffeinated tea during the day. Other than the itching, NO side effects.Even though I've been taking it for 4 years, it is still effective - so no tolerance build-up is happening so far. I ran out one time, and I didn't feel withdrawal symptoms like I've experienced with some antidepressants and other pain killers - I was just back to feeling my normal, unbearable pain. Remember that meds work differently for different people. I hope this med works for you like it did for me. -F.L.	F	56	4  years50 mg 8X D	3/25/2013Email

3	Recreational Uses for depression	While my body was getting used to it, when I took 5, i would sometimes vomit and my heart rate would get fast. I would also lose appetite and be fatigued.  Even after my body was used to it, I would still have a loss of appetite and I would be tired.	It isn't addictive	M	16	4  months450mg 1X D	3/17/2013Email
5	Sciatica/Mild Depression	Dry mouth, constipation, severe difficulty waking up, sexual dysfunction, slight dizziness.	I have been taking Tramadol for 4 years, and just recently attempted to wean myself off of the drug. HUGE mistake. While I did not have severe physical withdrawals (as my weaning process was lengthy) I still had mild fatigue, a little weight gain, and could feel myself falling deeper into depression everyday without the drug. This went on for a month. I finally went back to the doc, and am now back on 50mg 2x daily. My depression went away after 2 weeks, energy levels are back to normal, the 5 pounds I gained is gone and my pain is in check. However, the trade-off is dry mouth, some constipation, trouble experiencing orgasm, low libido, dizziness even when sitting, and difficulty waking up in the morning. The latter is probably the worstI will hit snooze for an hour or two in the morningor just sleep right through without even hitting snooze or turning it off. Once, my husband said he wanted to see how long I would let the alarm go; he clocked 42 minutes of the alarm blaring and me barely moving. I could only imagine how I'd be if I were to take the max dose of 400mg. To sum it up, Tramadol works well for my pain and depression, but now I wonder how in the world will I get through my next attempt at weaning off the drug.	F	35	4  years50mg 2X D	3/16/2013Email
2	Kidney Infection/Kidney Stones	Severe Muscle Twitches, Anxiety, Lack of Pain Control.	Didn't necessarily take pain away, but 'disconnected' me from it (and most everything else). Second day started noticing mild muscle twitches in my eyelid and base of my thumb in my hand. This quickly progressed with 24 hours into a constant spasm of the hand muscle. Also, found it very hard to urinate. Twitches eased off within 6 to 8 hours, of single dose, stopped taking for about 36 hours. Then took two for onset of severe kidney pain in the evening following day. Within two hours severe muscle twitches (all over) rapid heart rate, restlessness, shallow breathing, jaw clenching, unable to sleep, minimal pain control, nausea. I thought this must be a what a panic attack feels like. I have never had one, before though. Called nurse and she made me feel like a child, and didnt' have a clue as to why I would react like this way. Needless to say, I discontinued use. It's a month and a half later, and I am still noticing alot of random muscle twitches. Never again!.	F	33	4  days50mg 3X D	2/20/2013
5	Fibromyalgia	I have seen a lot of Ultram reviews about how addictive and difficult this med is, but it worked well for me. When I stopped taking it, it was no big deal. I didn't have any withdrawals, sickness, or anything else. As with any med, you could be allergic to it. It is very effective for me. It does cause dry mouth!		F	44	2  years300	2/19/2013
1	Fibromyalgia	I had seizers, horrible headaches that made my face tingle, severe sweating and so much more! I was hospitalized for a week in the ICU due to the seizures I was having as a side effect from this drug. And went through severe withdrawal when the hospital took me off of it. NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG! Horrible.		F	17	2  months50 MG	2/15/2013Email
4	Back pain	Loss of appetite, irritability, anxious & jumpy	The medicine seems to help with the pain but I have no appetite...probably not a bad thing for me though.  The worst immediate side effects were severe irritability & jumpiness.....like I feel like I want to fight & can't get still.....like I could run a marathon or something.  It's a very weird feeling....not sure how long I'll take this stuff.	F	27	1  days30 mg 1X D	2/8/2013Email
1	back pain	suicide	My son (age 30) cannot speak for himself and I wonder how many other people have experienced what he did. Within 4-5 hours of taking Ultram for the first time, he picked up a pistol and put a bullet through his brain. I am the caretaker of his memory, so I'm putting his age and gender.	M	30	1  times50 mg 4X D	2/8/2013Email
1	Kidney Infection	Some itching on the skin.  But more than anything: persistent & intensely severe headaches (felt like my entire skull was being hammered over and over).  Even the bones on my face ached with pain.  This drug pained my sinus cavities and caused me to have uncontrollably runny nose out of the blue.  Could barely open my eyes because I was too exhausted from the pain, but couldn't even fall asleep because the drug kept me awake.  So I just lie awake with the pain, or pace around like a lunatic until I became too weak to stand up.  Tramadrol drove me to the point of insanity.  I even resorted to banging my head against the wall to give minor relief to the unbearable headaches.  Couldn't focus on anything else because the headache was constant and extreme, unlike any other headaches I've ever had. In fact, I would rather much go through childbirth than have the headaches from Tramadol.	I quit after 3 days.  Yes, it concealed my kidney pain, but it caused me even more pain than that.  It was a nightmare I never want to go through again.  Felt like hell.  Funny thing was, I called the doctor's office and the nurse acted surprised and said that Tramadol does not cause headaches.  Look at the Rx warnings, moron!  It says to call my doctor ASAP if I get severe & persistent headaches!	F	32	3  days50 4X D	2/3/2013Email
1	Crohn's disease	Dizzy - so dizzy it horrified me and made me nauseated. Fell several times en rte to bathroom. kept getting strange "hiccups" in hearing. NEVER TAKING AGAIN. Barely controlled pain.		F	34	2  days50mg/4-6 h	1/24/2013
5	Significant Back Pain	After pill wore off (about six hours) experienced headache, slight nauseous, and very sleepy and tired - needed nap and I never nap. Thought this was perhaps co-incidence the first day. Symptoms repeated on the second day- Also became a bit sweaty and nauseous in the car - a sip of soda and some crackers seemed to help - not serious. I think it is withdrawal symptom when drug wears off.	If I can get adequate relief from heating pad and tylenols, I won't take it again. I can never take NSAIDS like Motrin or Advil - they might work - but I develop hemorrhagic coliis even after one dose of them. The Ultram, fortunately, did not cause this. My GI doctor said it was OK to take - although he thought the orthopod should have prescribed a muscle relaxer like Flexeril instead of this.	F	60	2  days50 mg 1X D	12/8/2012
2	Cervical disc hernation / fusion	Dizziness, tired, low libido, unable to achieve orgasm		M	46	3  weeks100 mg	12/7/2012
3	DeQuervains Tendonitis	Motion sickness and anxiety	I didn't experience any side effects when taking this at night, I guess I slept through them.  I took it during the day once and went for a car ride with my sister and she had to pull over twice so that I can throw up.  Once I was laying or sitting still I was fine.  I stopped taking it after that day.	F	35	2  days50 MG 1X D	10/26/2012Email
1	Ankle injury- pain	Throat swelling, tremors, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, sweats, nightmares. Addicting. Was not told by my foot specialist of side effects. When I said, was told to stop taking. Went cold turkey due to lack of knowledge. Worst withdraw like a cocaine addict. Worst weeks if my life and thanks to it, today I'm on meds trying to correct what's was f**ked due to cold turkey withdraw and side effects. Horrible medicine for me.		F	28	3  weeks50mg	10/7/2012
5	pain in butttocks left side	If taken after 5 pm it effects sleep at night If late for a dose I get a little jittery.Some times hot flashes and itchy feeling in my arms.Not anything I can't deal with.	I have tried many pain meds and ultram is the only one that addresses my pain.I take it first thing in the morning and then at 1pm.I would like to get off of ultram but on this board everyone says it's very hard. why? What happens to you? Can you cut the dose? I rely on two pills a day and use ice to help with pain if needed early evening.My pain is constant when not taking my meds.

4	Fibromyalagia	Relieves pain for 4-5 hrs but causes drowsiness. All day headaches;  I only take at night;  daytime nausea; loss of appetite; easy to become addicted to; wihdrawal symptoms are severe.		F	40	3  months30	10/2/2012
4	Fibromyalgia Pain Control	No side effect for me at all.	The only bad thing is that I am about to be moved up to a much stronger drug for pain management because it no longer does the job. But if you are in need of pain relief and haven't had Fibromyalgia for 20 years like I have when no one had ever head of this sydrome and those who had wasn't for sure it was for real. It will take the edge off but be aware.....nothing will take away all the pain ever in my experience and I have been on so many different medication over the years and up to 8 at one time. I have cut back on almost everything and try my best to live each day dealing with the pain but it does get very depressing but I elected not to stay on anti-depressant for long periods. WARNING: DO NOT allow any doctor to put you on any BENZOS (klonopin, ativan, xanax, valium, etc) these are diabolical drugs and I learned the hard way what they do to you and how dependent your brain become on them and how long it takes to recover. I feel like they stole 10 years of my life and didn't realize I had changed so much. Google Benzo withdrawal and  go to you tube and you will never do allow a doctor to put you own these. When I was given BENZOs was prior to the internet so the info was not available but the doctors knew back then how bad these drugs were because they have been around since the 1950's and 60's. They lie. Don't lose your life to the Benzos. If you need help with Benzo withdrawal you may email me and I will support you.	F	47	8  years100 mg 3X D	9/7/2012Email

5	Back injury	Euphoria, happy, calm, high and feeling light and good	Think of it, the doctor I visited actually who introduced me this drug actually wanted me to feel good, I remember him telling me,"let me prescribe you with a very good pain killer" and that's it, I am quite addicted to it now. It makes me high and calm, feel good and got the "fly" feeling... now I know how they derive the name "Dr Evil"	M	38	  1X D	5/23/2012Email
4	Shoulder and neck pain	Does help with pain, I tried Vicodin before this and feel this is more effective for pain. This does make me dizzy about 3 hours after taking,and I really can't sleep until it has worn off which is very frustrating, Vicodin does the same thing...wish Darvocet was still on the market.		F	45	7  days50 mg	5/16/2012
3	Moderate back pain	Increased energy, lower libido	I would only recommend this medicine for short term use.  I am addicted to this Ultram.  I have taken it on and off for at least ten years.  I quit taking this medicine about 3 years ago but started again last year for pain but mostly for the good feeling that I get when taking this.  I am stopping today and know the withdrawal period will be awful.  My whole body will feel heavy, and I will be extremely tired for at least a week. This drug changes your perception of things and should be more closely monitored.	F	43	10  years50 mg 2X D	5/6/2012Email

1	Test Subject	I cut a 50 mg pill in half to be on the safe side to try this drug.  In 15 minutes I felt like I was going to throw up and my stomach felt like it had a severe case of acid indigestion.  There was at least one hour were I was writhing in bad pain then another hour before I could get off the couch and report this.  It is 2 hrs & 9 minutes and I can't tell a thing other than being dead sick during the time mentioned.	Severely sick then nothing.  This stuff is good 4 NOTHING!	M	41	1  days25 MG 1X D	4/6/2012Email
4	severe pain from endometriosis	constipation, drowsiness/dreaminess, withdrawals (diarrhea and general crappy feeling) if taken continuously for more than 24 hours.	I only take this drug WHEN I ABSOLUTELY NEEDED IT, and IN ADDITION TO a non-narcotic anti-inflammatory. I recommend it for occasional severe pain, since it is habit forming and you can quickly build up a tolerance for it, and withdrawal symptoms are inevitable if you take more than a few doses in a row. When taken as I do, though, it is effective at making the worst pain of endometriosis more bearable. If I take it continuously, though, my body doesn't get a chance to re-regulate my digestive system and the constipation/diarrhea from withdrawal makes everything worse. Like most drugs it depends on the person, and it depends on how you use it.	F	26	3  months50 1X D	2/22/2012
2	Removed wisdom tooth & abscess.	Dizziness, Panic/Anxiety Attacks, Dilated Pupils, Shallow Breathing, Extreme Drowsiness, Inability to fall asleep, Trouble Urinating.	The first night I took this pill (8pm), it worked for a couple of hours and then the pain came back shortly after. I popped an extra one (12am or so) and I was unable to stay asleep. I'd wake up every hour on the hour, but I was able to fall right back asleep (unless I had to pee, which took forever to do). Finally, the next morning I popped another one (8am). By Noon, I was experiencing the signs of an overdose and ran back to the hospital.	M	22	2  days50 MG 1X D	2/22/2012Email
1	for pain	I also take Effexor so my doctor decreaed the effexor. I was good until the fourth week. The sweating was, terrible, my hair was wet in the afternoon, it didn't help my pain, and it made me really anxious at 200mg a day. I went back to 100mg a day, and a little less Effexor and I have been fine. The one benifit is the little bit of antidepressent in the med, so my mood improoved, so I don't want to stop it .

5	Fibromyalgia	The first dose or two made me tired so I only took it at night initially.  Now I am able to take it during the day. It relieves my pain and elevates my mood and increases my energy level. Some dry mouth, slight loss of appetite, and mild itching when I take it before bed.   No bad side effects at all and no sense of being addicted.	It is short acting so although it helps the pain when going to bed I do wake up with pain. Some days I may take just one or none at all.  No withdrawal of any kind.	F	55	2  months50 mg 2X D	2/17/2012Email

1	Pain relief after c-section	Dizziness, disorientation, nausea, anxiety, slow heartbeat, shortness of breath, muscle twitches, insomnia, sweating	Genius drug to prescribe to a new mother- NOT! I wish I'd found this site before I just took my last dose of Ultram/Tramadol half an hour ago. I was given Tramadol four times a day at 40mg starting the day after my caesarean section for routine pain relief. Initially I was happy that it worked to control the pain, and I was okay with the fact that I was also feeling extremely dizzy- I thought it might have been due to the operation that I couldn't walk ten steps without having to grab at a wall for support. After four days of increasing dizziness and nausea, I took a dose later than usual (after midnight), and for the first time I noticed that my pulse had dropped to around 50 beats per minute. I was trying to sleep while my new baby was sleeping, but I began to get the awful sense that my breaths were way too far apart as I was dozing off- like I was going to pass out rather than go to sleep. The breaths I could catch felt too shallow to do much. I lay there in an anxious sweat for a couple of hours before calling the nurse, who told me that panic/ anxiety attacks were a common side effect of Tramadol, an that's probably what I was feeling. Definitely true to an extent- my calf muscles were twitching in a really strange way, and in the end I was awake the entire night feeling paranoid about DVT. Anyway! At that point she told me to take only one tablet next time, but I didn't take any for a couple of days. My dizziness continued just as strongly the whole time, to the point	F	30	4  days20-40 4X D	2/13/2012

1	back pain	Panic Attack, Extreme Generalized Anxiety	If you are sensitive to medication i would not reccomend this drug. I took ONE pill and 20min later i felt extremely weak and tired so I laid down then started to feel nauseas which got worse by the minute. Then my heart started racing soi guess it was a panic attack. I did not feel real, i couldnt see straight, had very loose foul stools about 5x a day. This medication totally messed with my brain it was CRAZY and the the most scariest thing i had ever experiened in my life. The symptoms continued for weeks. I literally could not eat solid food for almost 3 weeks, i lost 35lbs, had racing thoughts, insomnia, sick twisted nightmares and the list just goes on...It is now almost 5months after that experience and i am not the same person i was before taking this drug. I suffer from extreme Anxiety and occasional panic 24/7 with many many physical symptoms like chest pain, difficulty breathing, heart palpatations, etc.  I am seeing a Theralist and taking Xanax for the extreme Anxiety (as needed)  as a   result of this. How the heck one pill of this Ultram could do this, i dont know! But it is true and it has ruined my life for right now. I did google this drug and i think it said that it affects the brain in a similar way that Anti-depressants do so I honestly believe it f@#ked my brain chemistry up. I am also sensitive to Meds so if you are, think twice, this is a powerful drug! If anyone had a similar experience to mine from this drug, PLEASE Email me	F	24	1  days 1X D	1/26/2012Email
4	Chronic pain	Speedy, High Energy type drug.  Withdrawal is terrible. Don't quit cold turkey.	Ultram is a great drug since it's not controlled.  I needed something stronger so my doc put me on the Butrans patch and told me to quit the ultram cold turkey after 7 years.  DON'T EVER QUIT THIS DRUG COLD TURKEY. Besides the opioid qualities, ultram is also like an antidepressant.  I've been feeling like crap for a month.  The 10mcg Butrans patch didn't even help me get over the ultram.  So I took an ultram today along with the patch i have on.  I feel great now!  Pain is about a 2 and my mood is perfect. Ultram with Butrans is the way to go.	M	31	7  years50 4X D	1/21/2012
3	lower back and leg pain	None.	I am quite convinced that I have developed a tolerance to this drug. The prescribed dose does not sufficiently cover the pain anymore. My doctor tell me that I'm at the max dosage. (400mg), which I know is not necessarily true. Reading about this online has led me to feel that increasing the dosage to deal with the pain will only lead to more dependence. I am hoping to find something to add to or replace this drug. The muscle cramps associated with withdrawl are most significant problems. Though I am not off the drug, I believe I'm experiencing these symptoms because I'm not taking the full dose.

4	Chronic upper back pain	Felt great. No pain. Good mood. Focused--really helped a bit of ADHD. Got much more done. Sleep great as it does relax muscles. Feel fine the next morning.	I only take a tramadol as needed.  About 60 of them lasted a year. I don't really want to get hooked on anything so I'm wary of constant use. And some of the effects on here almost gave me a panic attack. I do not understand. My mother-in-law who is 85 takes 50 mg tramadol twice a day w/o incident? I haven't had any at all. I'm finding that it really does help calm me from effects of ADHD enough to focus and write as I am a writer. It helps me accomplish things much more methodically/organized than usual, and then sleep well at night. Otherwise, I start too many projects, get wound up, don't accomplish as much, and then can't sleep. I love tramadol.	F	59	 50 1X D	12/30/2011Email
4	peripheral neuropathy	Brief bouts of dizziness, forgetfulness, transient anxiety, vivid dreams, transient wonkiness, low grade headache at times	12-21-11:  Only medication that has curbed the burning, tingling, wooden numbness feeling in my legs and feet. I have been on Elavil (Amitriptyline), Neurontin( Gabapentin) and Cymbalta which did not help enough to outweigh the bad side effects. It's early days on Tramadol, but so far, it's fabulous. I do feel a bit dizzy from time to time, I am a little fuzzy headed, memory is definitely affected. I would not drive after I have taken my 25mg because I can tell it does affect me and my ability to stay focused. The pain before Tramadol was a solid 7 on a scale of 1-10, now it is a 2. I can sleep without pain. I still wake up with pain but it is muted now, not an "on fire" kind of pain that was waking me up every 2 hrs.  I can stay on my feet and walk without the hot burning tingling pain, the use of the ice therapy booties is only 1x a day now instead of off and on throughout the whole day.  I haven't had to take any Advil or Aleve, Capsaicin spray, freezing water foot soaks to prevent breakthrough pain. My appetite is below normal, I have noticed a low grade headache and it is more difficult to achieve an orgasm, but not impossible.  I will continue to update.	F	47	3  days25mg 3X D	12/21/2011Email

1	Pains with gallbladder, cramps	Your body will go through withdrawels no matter how long you have taken it.  It even says it on the warning, that you must be weened off it.  I stopped use Cold Turkey and wasn't addicted, just didn't need it anymore as the organ causing my pain wasn't there anymore, and I had no more pains.  Restless Leg Syndrome, Anxiety, Depression, ect. ect. ect.	I was first perscribed this medicine for aweful menstral cramps, then was told to take it for the pains I was having in my stomach with my gallbladder.  Once I had my gallbladder out, I didn't need to take this medicine anymore as I was having no more pains.  It says that coming off this medicine no matter how long, you must ween off of it, I didn't.  I stopped taking as soon as I got over the pain from my surgery.  At day 3, I had the Restless Leg Syndrome.  The only thing that would help, was getting in the bathtub and falling asleep in the hot water.  I took 3 hot baths that night, and looked like the girl from the exorcist, back arched and writhing in agony.  I went from hot to cold in mere seconds.  Depression kicked in the next day.  Only a slight depression, but it did end up going away the next day.  Now I am having side effects from taking Prilosec OTC and it depleating my vitamen B12, so I have tingling/numbness in hands and feet (only slight, but enough to be uncomfortable), and anxiety.  I will discontinue use of that too.  Be careful about this.  I will never use Prilosec or Ultram ever again!  I thought it was a wonder drug too.  WRONG!	F	27	4  months200mg 4X D	11/11/2011Email
1	back pain.	Ended up in the hospital from this drug. Severe vomiting, shaking, mental confusion.	I took tramadol for chronic pain, within 30 minutes of taking the dose I felt dizzy, anxious, lightheaded  and had to sit down.  I started to feel like I was going to vomit  within 45 min. of taking it. I started vomiting and felt deathly ill within 1 hr of taking the tramadol. I vomited for 18 hrs straight and  started vomiting blood !  I  was ice-cold and my limbs started shaking uncontrollably . I became mentally  confused . My family  took me to the ER . I could not even stand.  I was given IV  for dehydration, an anti nausea medication in my IV  and a lidocaine "drink" to help with the raw burning in my throat from all the vomiting.  It took several hrs before I started to feel better.  Everyone is different and has different reactions but please be VERY careful with this drug!	F	57	1  dayslow dose 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	fibromyalgia pain		No pain relief.  I might as well not even take this drug.  I know it works for some people, but it just doesn't touch my pain.	F	44	 100 mg 2X D	10/10/2011
1	Neck Pain	Dizziness, confusion, blurred vision, headaches, flu like symptoms and anxiety	i was not aware that this drug also acts like an SSRI. Wish I would have known as I have extreme reactions to them. I have taken this for 3 days at only a 1/3 of the dosage prescribed. I feel fine for a few hours, but then I start feeling the anxiety and weird headaches, etc... I'm now stopping.	F	31	3  days100 4X D	9/27/2011

1	Neck, Shoulder, Arm pain	I was taking percocet for severe pain and Pain Dr. decided to put me on Ultram...I should of beat the hell out of this Dr. I am in severe pain and he gives me this crap. I need as most people with chronic pain an opiod type medication, period. I don't know why people practically apologize for taking narcotic pain medication when they have a legit reason to do so. Nobody has to suffer in pain and you take WHATEVER you need to so you don't suffer. Do what ever you need to so you can take what helps. Don't let people tell you otherwise they don't have the slightest clue on how you feel and neither do these Dr's. I couldn't take it anymore so I drove 300miles and went to a pill mill and got a 6 month supply of what helps me. That's right I DO NOT HAVE TO SUFFER and neither do you..do what you have to.

3	Pain from broken tailbone	Nausea, drowsiness, lack of appetite.	I can't take more than 50 MG at a time if I want to be able to function! Tramadol isn't incredibly effective in treating severe pain, but it propbably won't leave you feeling as "doped up" as Vicodin does if you take it in scattered doses.

1	Pain associated with severe UTI	Nausea, Severe Headache	I was given this medication for the pain associated with an acute urinary tract infection.  The nausea/vomiting and severe headache that followed were not worth any pain relief it may have given me.  I went from being at a 3-4 on the pain scale from the UTI to a 10+ from the headache/nausea associated with this medication.  I will never take tUltram/Tramadol again.

4	Chronic Pain Syndrome	Insomnia	Dizzy ONLY the very first time taking it. Not one single side effect since that day, except insomnia if taken after 3 pm. It's weird...I get sleepy at night but can't "fall" past that point from sleepy to asleep...just can't get over that edge. Hard to explain. No constipation, sweating, nothing. But it takes one HUGE dose to work at all. This is a very weird medicine that does stop working after a while (my father had to quit taking it after one year because it just quit working). It ONLY works on my hip pain (bursitis) and ONLY if I take the full day's dose all at once. Does not touch my neck and spine pain. Does not work on headaches. ONLY works on hips. I have tried taking 200 - 250 mgs, 300 mgs, nothing less than 400 mgs works, and that has been my dosage since the first day I took it. I eat in the morning to avoid upset stomach with it, then I take 8 pills - 50 mgs each - and I am great the rest of the day, when normally I am experiencing severe hip pain within 30 minutes of sitting upright.

1	abdominal and chest pain	Ultram did a barely adequate job of treating my pain.	I hate this drug. I was habituated to oxycodone after years of taking it for pain relief, and I quit months ago. That was unpleasant, but getting off this garbage--after only 10 days, not even every day, using much less than prescribed--is just an insult. At least oxy works. Not that I recommend any of these drugs for anything other than very short-term use. And even then, you need to taper your dose to wean off. And if you've got ANY propensity for addiction, DON'T DO IT!!!	F	43	10  days50-100 mg 1X D	7/19/2011Email

4	Bipolar 2	Restlessness and Insomnia.	Restlessness makes me feel uncomfortable in my own skin. The insomnia leaves me exhausted, but the Abilify itself gives me more energy (awake at 04H30 daily) Also take 50mg Sertaline and 200mg lamotrigne. Was previously on Seroquel 200mg for 18 months which helped me sleep but left me feeling listless during the day.	F	50	3  months2.5mg 1X D	2/14/2012Email
2	Bipolar 2	Restlessness, waking as early as 3am, anxiety, high blood sugar.	I was not on this medication for very long. I'll admit it improved my mood somewhat, but I was waking as early as 3am and feeling very restless (at first the medication made me drowsy but the longer I was on it the earlier I would wake up). It increased my anxiety to the point that I couldn't work on my uni assignments without freaking out. I had high blood sugar while I was taking it (blood sugar is normal now).	F	25	3  weeks5mg 1X D	2/11/2012
3	Bipolar 2	I was hypomanic after the death of my father in November. Began taking Depakote in early December for anger/rage/mood problems.  Psych suggested Abilify might help Depakote work better.  While my mood is better and my anger issues are nearly non-existent now, I'm finding I'm still a bit hypomanic and the Abilify creates extreme restlessness in me.  While my house has never looked better and I'm getting lots of project done, I find I can't sit still for longer than 10 minutes and by the end of the day my feet ache for being on them so long running around in the house and doing all my projects.	Together with Depakote.  Doc now prescribing propranolol for agitation/restlessness/irritability - would rather prescribe additional med for side effect than change primary meds...and I agree with his decision.  Doc now bumping me up to 10mg 1xday and propranolol 10mg 1xday.	F	36	7  weeks5mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email
1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium.

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS.

His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.

I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email

2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight.

3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor.

It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated. Who knows if it "helped my depression" because it made me an absolute basket case!	F	21	14  days2.5 mg 1X D	9/27/2010

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).	F	42	16  months30 mg 1X D	9/7/2010
3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email

4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010

3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped. Abilify worked immediately and I haven't been depressed since.	F	24	3  weeks5mg 1X D	5/9/2010Email

Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal.

1	Bipolar spectrum disorder	Restlessness, anxiety, drowsiness, face rash	I went on Abilify at the start of an up period, so I don't know how effective it would have been in treating depressive spells. However, it did counteract some of the effectiveness of my lithium, and I was falling asleep during the day more frequently than usual. Had to go off it because of a rash on my chin/cheeks/ears.

I got depressed due to weight gain, but after several months I feel medication ceased to be effective. This time  was very reluctant (2 yrs later & different Dr. & different anti-depressant medication-Prozack-2 yrs ago) but I am trying it w/ a different antidepressant than previously-Taking now w/ Wellbutrin.

4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue. Negative - I find myself much more emotional - memories, key phrases, smells, songs, pictures, etc.can bring me to tears.	M	50	9  months50 MG 1X D	4/11/2010
2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now. I have woken up from a 12 year-long medication-induced nightmare.	M	57	 15 MG 1X D	4/7/2010Email

2	depression	Nausea the first few days, some constipation, cloudy thinking, increased appetite	Combined with Wellbutrin XL which suddenly stopped working for me after 3 years. After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

5	Major Depression, Anxiety	Have had some problems concentrating.  Although I love to read, it has been a struggle to focus for a sustained amount of time.  Mild weight gain.  Insomnia (but the Seroquel has completely cured that.)	Abilify has helped me like no other drug.  I am on it along with cymbalta, deplin, seroquel and ativan.  Within just a few days I was feeling better and am now able to exercise, clean my house and just moved across the country-something I could never have done during my depression.

I feel kind of leveled out, but I hate the tiredness all the time.  I can sleep for 10 hours, take my son to school, come home and go back to sleep for another couple of hours.  Then still have little to no energy for the rest of the day.  I was previously, taking 60 mg. of Cymbalta for almost 2 years, but my dr. switched me to this when I started to feel like dying again.  I also take Valium (5 mg.) when I feel anxious and panic coming on.	F	35	14  days5 mg. 1X D	2/12/2010Email

3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!

2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010
1	depression, of all excuses	This is to the PARENTS out there who believe that if their child looks passive on the drug it is a godsend:  Beating someone over the head with a baseball bat can also make them sit still.  Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.  No more for me. Abilify- Forgetaboutit!!!!!!!	F	57	3  days	1/30/2010Email

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.
