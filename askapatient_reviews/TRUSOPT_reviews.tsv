3	Glaucoma	Works good except for occasional bad batches.	I have been using Trusopt for a number of years and it does a good job in keeping the eye pressure down.  But, I have just had what I call a bad batch.  Eye pain when changing focus to near objects.  Renewed prescription and everything back to normal.  First time this happened about a year ago I wrote to Merck.  They replied that their lab would investigate and a month later another letter from them said that they found nothing wrong with the drops.	M	55	5  years	3/2/2009

3	Open Angle Glaucoma	Stinging shortly after putting the drops in.	After initial stinging I have no other side effects and my eyes feel morre comfortable than with any other eye drops I have used.  However I have not tried any of the beta blockers.  Unfortunately the pressure is still too high and my consultant is suggesting ALT laser procedure.	F	63	6  months	6/8/2004
