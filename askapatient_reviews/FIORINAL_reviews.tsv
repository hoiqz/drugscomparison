5	Brain herniation/tension headaches	This has saved my life!!! I didn't realize how bad I was till feeling Head normal, besides my regular pain, till I tried these. I can't thank my doctor enough! I litterally owe him my life!!!		F	26	3  days50mg	9/1/2012

5	Migraine	None. [Ignore dosage per day with this...It's taken every 4-6 hrs as needed]	This works for me.. It's been around forever so I am not afraid to use it.  Some days it does not work until I take the second dose.  That is not very often, though.  You need to take it as soon as you know you are starting with a migraine.  I can only get it from my neurologist. Family doctors are nervous about it. It's been a life saver for me.	F		20  years 2X D	5/21/2012
5	migraines	no significant bad effects, some hangover issues.	It works, not much else to say. The only other drug combo that has ever worked for me in over 40 years is inderal 60mg and valium 20mg together. The doc got nervous about prescribing valium even though it was most effective and put me on this instead.	M	55	4  years2 caps 8X D	3/17/2012
5	Migraines/Tension Headaches	It works wonderfully. When i feel a headache coming i take 2 and within an hour it is either completely gone or almost gone. Love it. Can do normal everyday things while taking them.		F	24	6  months	3/17/2012Email
5	migraines	None-I only take this for migraines so I might go several months without it, or maybe I need it several times during one month.	I battled migraines for a long time and this medication was the key for me. It is a combination of aspirin, butalbital (a barbituate) and caffeine, so you should not drink alcohol if you are using this medication.  It does not make me sleepy but it will stop the headache if I take it early enough.  I usually take two if I'm taking it.	F	50	10  years325/50/40 1X D	1/17/2011
5	chronic insomnia, phobia, depressio	Gained a tolerance- increasing dose only increases side FX	Good for moderate pain/insomnia, as needed-Careful- dont get dependent on these things-They have a dual whammy of codine and a small dose of barbital, which is esp. viscious stuff to actually have to kick.Kicks like a mule	M	63	2  years#3 3X D	10/6/2010Email

2	Chronic pain anxiety addiction	constipation, increase in self esteem, anxiety, sometimes stomach pains	i have taken this medication on and off for about seven years im at my point where i can no longer tolerate it. It causes severe memory loss and an intensity of feelings whether they be anger sorrow or whatever you are feeling.  When I'm on it i do feel less anxious yet its only during the rush of the pill. If I could have stayed away from this one when I was younger, I would have definitely given the education about the medication ahead of time.  I feel trapped almost like I need to take it now.  It sucks.	M	30	7  days	12/11/2009Email
5	migraines	addiction	definitely a life saver. But I do have to be extremely careful with dosage and frequency.  If I take it too often for a long time then it takes more and more to work and then will cause migraines.  When I start to realize my body is getting addicted then I slowly back off and use imitrex for a while.  I don't like imitrex because the side effects suck but if I take it for a month or so then I can go back on Fiorinal and it helps again.  Maybe I'm crazy but this is how it works for me.	F	28	7  years	11/29/2009
5	Migraines, Fibromyalgia	Constipation, and sometimes stomach pains	I have had severe migraines since the age of 11. I also suffer from Fibromyalgia. Without this medication, I do not think I could function. It relieves my headaches, which I get about 3x a week and gives me energy. I have tried so many other alternatives, I can't count. This medication is a God Send for me.	M	53	18  years	8/25/2009Email
5	tension headache	none	100% effective within 15 mins. duration of relief was 6-8 hours	F	58	2  days	8/25/2009
5	tension headaches	tired, dry mouth	Nothing works on headaches better than this medicine.  I have a stressful life, and cannot imagine not having this to help ease the tension.	F	41	16  years	5/7/2009
5	migraine	none	Not only relieves migraines, but relieves anxiety and depression as well. Doesn't have too much caffeine like the over the counter meds which make me nervy/jittery. Have never been addicted, just take as needed, which differs how many times per month based on seasons/triggers.	F	58	26  years	2/17/2009
5	stress/migraine headaches	Better able to concentrate; helps also with anxiety. I take one at a time, every 4 hours.  Still works for me after all these years. Does anyone know how it affects blood pressure?	I have bad reactions to most medicines.  This one works well for me.	M	61	15  years	1/15/2009
5	Migraine Headaches / Headaches	Tiredness and feeling drunk	I take 2 Fiorinal as soon as a migraine begins and it seems to a abort the majority of them.  I suffer from severe migraines and have tried just about everything.  They make me sleep which is a benefit when having a migraine.  I do not drive while taking Fiorinal, because of the side effects.  Aspirin products work best for me.	F	52	10  years	11/13/2008
5	Migraine and cluster headaches	If I take two, I feel fatigue. Am avoiding the codeine so I can stay on this.	I've had at least 5 headaches a week since I was 8 yrs old. Actually met the doc who invented Fiorinal in Ft. Lauderdale in the 80s. Quit taking it then because of the tired-spacey feeling but that contained codeine so I quit. Too bad. I only take 1-2 as needed w/o codeine. No headache for 9 days now--unbelievable! I've even had migraines with the "aura"-- a shimmering half moon just appears on the wall--Weird!!	M	57	9  days	10/6/2008Email
5	migraines	headache when taken unneccesarily. Wooziness, not tired or dizzy but mind and pain are on different plains.	This is the only medicine I can rely on for my migraines. Others don't always work. I use generic brand. I get 3-5 migraines/month. And take 2/time usually need once for each onset of migraine. Oddly, I find I can concentrate so much better than normal when I take it even while trying to fight off the migraine. It gives me a very euphoric/positive feeling which helps me with social anxiety. (I've never been to a dr. for)I can definately see how it can become addictive but I stay within the limits of less than 14/month as my dr. prescribed.  My husband has tried, it works but he doesn't like the wooziness.	F	42	3  years	3/15/2008
5	migraines	None	If I take two fiorinal at the start of my headache, it will usually stop it completely.  If I wait too long, then it doesn't seem to be as effective.  I probably use it once a month and have never had side effects from this medication.  I would definitely recommend it.  I tried Imitrex and several others without success, but fiorinal works great for me.	F	49	5  years	2/13/2008
5	migraine/tension headaches	none	I've been taking fiorinal for 40 of my 48 years. Without it I have no life. I am unable to function in society. I am very careful with my dosage. I have to take it every day of my life.	F	48	40  years	1/24/2008Email
4	Migraines	None	The only med in 17 yrs that has helped the pain of severe migraines	F	58	15  years	9/15/2007
5	Tension headaches	None	If taken at the start of a headache, 2 tablets stop it from getting worse and usually stops it altogether.	F	55	10  years	8/13/2007
5	Migraines, other body pain	None	This medicine allowed me to function long  before Imitrex became available for migraines. However, I have been on it for probably 30 years and the neurologist I am seeing tells me I;  have "rebound" headaches and should wean myself off. I take it with Excedrin (I think it's because I need the extra caffine and I only take 1 pill per dose).Don't drink coffee. I really don't want to quit taking it because it works for me and helps me get through the day. But I am waking up almost every morning with a headache but if I take the medication right away I can  keep it from getting worse...it's a vicious cycle.	F	57	30  years	7/28/2007
5	Tension Headaches/migraines	No side effects if taken as directed	It's the only pain med that lets me continue to function daily without missing work due to headaches.  I work on a computer and by end of day the tension is unbearable	F	60	6  years	6/29/2007
3	Migraine	Sleepiness (the next day).  Increased appetite.	It is the only thing I've taken that has an effect on certain types of headaches.  However, it merely reduces the pain for a few hours--it doesn't get rid of the headache completely.  As others have mentioned, it loses it's effectiveness and causes rebound headaches if taken too often.	M	41	12  years	6/29/2006
1	post-surgery pain	Rapid heart beat.	Don't take it!	F	21	1  days	5/25/2006
4	migraine and tension HX	euphoria, relief	Works very well in the short term but if you using it daily like I was you will be in rebound territory.  I needed intervention to get off this medicine at a headache clinic. Daily Fiorinal/Fioricet use means detox is down the line.  Do not use this med for anything more than short term use and no more than 2 or 3 times a week.  You WILL suffer from the cycle of rebound headache and be worse off than before.	M	49	8  years	5/4/2006Email
2	Headache	None	Seems to work at first, then stops working. It's simply a little bit of asprin, a little bit of caffine, and a little barbituate. It's not rocket science.	M	41	 	8/14/2005
5	sinus headaches	I wake up with a headache pretty much everyday. I used to take one or two in the morning and that worked. Over about a seven year period, I now need four in morning. Sometimes even the four will not do and I end up taking about 3-4 more just to function at work and all other responsibilities. Sometimes my chest hurts and my breathing slows due to this. I have made a decision to cut back on fiorinal. I will just have to endure the pain. Doctors ack as though they don't know what is wrong with me. I will just have to kick the habbit...

5	Migraines and Fibromyalgia	For some reason, the generic forms of this drug give me a rash and do not seem to work as efficiently.I do not experience any side effects with Fiorinal.	This is the only effective treatment I can tolerate for my migraines. It is however important that I take it at the earliest hint of oncoming migraine. Once you start vomiting from the pain, the capsule is difficult to swallow. Wish it came in a suppository or injectable format for those times.	F	55	32  years	1/18/2005
4	Migraine/tension/post head injury	Occasional stomach pain, bit of loopiness, other times a bit of a buzz	I had tried every triptan & narcotic before I tried Fiorinal.  The 1st time I took it I burst into tears because it gave me more complete relief than morphine!  But like the rest of you, I have found its efficacy has greatly decreased over time & I am sure I am addicted, taking them almost daily for daily headaches.  I've read it causes terrible rebounds & I feel as though I am just trying to chase away the pain but never getting rid of it.  It works so well but with a chronic headache problem, I'm wondering if it has caused more problems than it is currently solving.  I have gone off it twice & had such intense rebounds, lasting weeks that I went back on it.  Even my Doc wanted me to.  I want tot ry quitting again but am TERRIFIED of the pain.  I can take a few days white knuckling it, but weeks, or even months?  I run a forum for headache sufferers who are trying to get off Fiorinal & find other ways to cope.  Two members have gone from 8-10 a day to 2-5 a week...max.  If anyone is interested in joining our	F	44	8  years	11/17/2004Email
3	headaches	It worked well for my headache, but it made me feel drowsy and sluggish- it slowed me down mentally so i only take it if im home. made me sleepy	its affective at first but you need to take more the more you use it which is very bad.	F	32	2  years	10/12/2004
3	migraines		It worked somewhat, when I first started taking it. Pretty soon though, I was taking it by the handful and it still wasn't touching my headache pain.	F	27	2  months	5/25/2004
4	Tension headaches	Dry mouth		F	48	 	9/24/2003
5	headache	None, if taken as prescribed.	I'm from a long line of headache/migraine sufferers, and over the years I have found Fiorinal an extremely efficacious medicine for relief of headache.  When a migraine kicks in, however, only Imitrex or possibly Zomig have been effective.  I try to avoid taking Fiorinal with codeine, however, as I do not like the side-effects of codeine.  If a headache gets bad enough to take that, an Imitrex will bring more lasting relief anyway.	F	64	40  years	7/6/2003Email
4	Muscle tension headaches/migraines	Diarrhea/stomach pain next day, sometimes rebound headaches after a couple of days.	Worked fairly well in concurrence with Flexeril (muscle relaxant) but efficacy decreases over time.	F	27	6  years	4/30/2003
