5	Atrial Fibrillation	None.	I had uncontrolled A Fib for 15 years while trying countless medications, all of which were worthless.  Some of those medications left me with side-effects which I am still battling.	F	76	6  years0.25 1X D	10/26/2011Email
2	arrhythmia, v-tach	nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, sensitivity to light, fatigue/exhaustion, exercise intolerance, hair loss, chest pain and just a general fogginess - everything takes longer to do - and I have to think about every thing before I do it.		F	34	2  years500mcg 2X D	8/12/2011

3	Atrial fibrilation	Diagnosed with atrial fibrilation in May 2010.  Was on Meprolol, and then Sotolol, before being placed on Tiksyn.  Spent 3 boring days in the hospital while they monitored my heart and blood pressure (highest pressure/BP was 149/110 with a pulse of 108), and my creatine levels in my kidneys.  3 VERY boring days.  Have intermittent defibrilation so much that they have tried twice to do cardioversion (stopping your heart with an electric shock and then restarting it - kind of a manual "reset" of the old ticker), but couldn't because I was NOT in defib.  Experience defib every now and then, but just started to pick a really nasty case of hives:  hands start to itch, and then random parts of the body would begin to itch too.  The worse case was when my upper shoulders, thighs, buttocks, calves, and lower back was covered in hives.  Took Benydril, which slowly killed the itch over 2 hours but if you wanted my credit card numbers - I would have given them to you to stop the itch.	Since it is a special order medicine, it is somewhat costly.  I have Blue Cross, which nicely lowers the price, but RECOMMEND to anybody with a health savings account plan with your employer to PARTICIPATE, so that way you can get your money back on the cost of the drug, and get a nice deduction from your taxes at the end of the year.

3	A-fib, A-futter, SVT, V-tach, tach	dizzy, short of breath, not feeling my fast heart beat, headache, hair loss, chest pain,	I started tikosyn after a 3rd failed ablation, no other medication keeps me out of A-fib.  But no other medication put me into V-Tach or SVT's either.  So I guess it is a catch 22.  My hair is falling out, but I atributed that to my hyothyroidism I will ask my doctor.  I thought my medication was working well, or well enough and then my doctor asked me a question.  "If you never had heaart problems before, would you seek help now for the way you feel and the way your chest feels?"  My answer I would not only seek help but I would most likely go to the ER  I do feel better haven't been hospitalized in 7 weeks, a record for me.  for the last 11 months I hadn't lasted 3 days out of the hospital with out ending up back in ICU.

3	AFib and AFlutter	Personality change.  I do not feel like myself.  Anxious. Still get the AFlutter (my thing) but only for a few days at a time.  I have had one frightening episode of chest pain and do get dizzy and lose my balance.	I am also losing hair and I really don't like the strange feelings I have.  Wonder how few of us are on it.  Don't seem to see much input from users. Since I have a pacer and defibrillator, I am protected more than most. Have developed  muscle spasms and aches,too.  I really don't like the way I feel, as I said before but it has helped me convert myself to regular rythmn.	F	73	67  days	12/14/2009
1	Mixed arrythmias	Cardiac arrest after the 4th dose	I was only on this two days, while in the hospital (as required.)  I felt very strange the entire time.  Then I had cardiac arrest and emergency defibrillation.  Doing much better on Rythmol now.	F	59	2  days	12/7/2009
2	arrythmias	serious loss of hair:  worsening of macular degeneration:  dizzy spells;  loss of energy;  tighttness around head;increased severity of tinnutis	Is there anyone out there on this drug;  I believe this is very limited distribution - not available @pharmacy with prescription;Doctor supplied only	F	76	210  days	10/14/2009Email
5	flutter	For the three months I have been on it my breathing is great.  I can walk, cut grass, work in yard, pretty much back to normal old self. I also take Digtek and Warfarin. I also have vocal cord dysfunction which caused alot of my former breathing problems and I control that with a nasal rinse and nose spray.  So far the drug is doing everything it is supposed to but I'm still a little afraid of taking it with what can happen suddenly.	Not knowing if Tikosyn is the problem but am balding, have some kind of skin scaling and redness in spots which come and go. Am being monitored every three months. As of right now,I give it a 5.  My doctor says only certain people can benefit from it and he thought I was one that could.	F	71	3  months	10/21/2007
1	atrial fibrillation	I have been lethargic, nervous, sleepy and generally not feeling good.  I generally bounce back into afib every 2nd, 3rd or 4th day, with some bouts of higher blood pressure.  I never used to have any problems with blood pressure.  By not knowing how I will feel from day to day it is difficult to plan even a day ahead.	It requires 3 day hospitalization to get put on it.  ECGs have to be monitored for irregularities.  Only special physicians are permitted to prescribe it and pharmacies do not keep it in stock.  They have to special order it.  The most troubling possible side effect is causing a rapid heart rate which occasionally could be fatal, according to the descriptive sheet from Pfizer.I have a friend who seems to be doing fine with the stuff.
