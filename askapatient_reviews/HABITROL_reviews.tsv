5	To quit smoking	Sore gums and throat at the beginning	I smoked for 27 years and quit smoking 3 months ago with Habitrol 4mg. It's much cheaper than Nicorette gum and I break the gum in half, so I actually use 2mg (less $$$). At the (very difficult) beginning I chewed one piece every 2 hours, now I only have a piece twice a day and have replaced the with regular sugar-free Orbit gum. Works like a charm. I hope to quit the Habitrol gum over the next month or so. I wish you all the best of luck quitting and remember, it DOES get easier every day you don't smoke!

4	to quit smoking	very sore throat initially. hiccups. indigestion.	I smoked 14 years and very determined to stop. I used Habitrol 2mg gum successfully, following the instructions carefully. I stuck to no more than 10 pieces a day and kept at it regularly for 3 months. The gains far outweigh the side effects. However I also began an antidepressant about a month after quitting. I expected to try this at some point as i had struggled to use ADs before due to too many side-effects. Part of giving up smoking was to be able to use ADs with less side effects. I now have better control of my mood disorder. I feel good about myself being able to stop smoking. I believe I will always need some nicotine and will continue to use the gum, especially in times of stress. I do think people who smoke are attempting to self medicate some sort of illness (depressive or gastrointestinal or cognitive)I got Habitrol through quit smoking support,by a voucher system, so it cost me $5 for $80 worth. I now use 2-3 gums a day.	F	34	5  months	12/20/2008Email
