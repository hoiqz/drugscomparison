4	breast cancer IIA node-positive	IV with Adriamycin, 4 cycles @ 3 weeks. See that drug for main AC  side effects.  Only Cytoxan-specific effect that I know I had are white bands on fingernails, which ought to grow out in time.	I won't know if it worked until cancer never recurs.  Very important to eat an anticancer diet and exercise regularly if you can.  And drink lots of water to get the chemo drugs out of the body as quickly as possible, especially this one.

3		lupus nephritis  I've had 3 treatments so far & I just been so drained. no energy at all. I also have pancreatis & it seems after the monthly treatment it flares up & Im in so much pain. low grade fevers,always 99.0. I also feel numbness in my lower back with dull pain weeks after treatment,no real appetite,stay very thirsty	Im not sure if med is working because Im also on dialysis 3 times a wk. But I have noticed that I've been urinating just a little more since after the 3rd treatment.3 more treatments to go. Im praying this will save my kidneys.	F	34	3  times	4/6/2009Email
4	lupus nephritis	for increasing number of days after each monthly treatment, i have experienced *severe* fatigue (beyond lupus-related), muscle soreness/weakness with minimal activity, waking with feeling of (large) pins and needles in legs and muscle cramps, pounding heartbeat, congestion, rise in blood pressure, hair loss, severe bladder and stomach irritation. there might be more but hard to tell if from solumedrol given with treatment and oral prednisone taken daily.	the docs all say this treatment is helping my condition which is why i rate this a 4. but i cannot hold a job while being treated (don't know of any employers willing to put up with 7-15 days out or unable to function every month) due to post-treatment side effects. prednisone has caused huge weight gain but, and this is especially bad following treatment, if i don't keep my stomach full it nags me constantly and there is horrible reflux pain...dieting has become nearly impossible, exercise difficult in the extreme. from what i hear i am lucky, i only have to do this once a month for six months (until the next lupus flare, perhaps) and i have just had #4. yet it is fast becoming the worst six months of my life.

1	Wegener's Granulomatosis	Infertility	I took Cytoxan in the 80's as a teenager with Wegener's.  At the time, it was (in conjunction w/ Prednisone) the only treatment for Wegener's.  It cured my Wegener's, but I have since discovered that I'm Azoospermic (infertile) and unable to have children.  This is a very serious side effect that should be considered for men when taking Cytoxan.  There are now other medications for the treatment of Wegener's.  I recently had a flare of the disease and have had some success on Cellcept and ALOT of success with RITUXAN.	M	37	12  months	11/13/2005
1	Breast cancer	Complete hair loss, fingernails eventually fell off, violent nausea, fatigue, body aches, vomiting, depression, loss of appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, headache, loss of mental focus (inability to read, eg), shingles, mouth sores, fever (104 for two weeks), flu-like symptoms	This is a barbaric drug. If I had it to do over, I would decline the chemo and live my life the best I could for as long as I could. It's a choice I wish I had made. I feel like chemo aged me by about fity years. (I took this as AC cocktail, so I don't know which drug caused which symptoms.)	F	43	4  times	9/25/2005
5	Systemic Lupus And Anemia	They gave me the pediatric dose, but the only side affects i noticed was a bout of nausea for the first couple of days, mostly in the morning, real early, then it subsided. the rest of the sideaffects are from the Medrol i take with it.	It seems to be working so far, i'm only on my second dose, coming up on my third. i go every month for six months. I've heard many good things and know lots of people who have taken it and while some sideaffecs for them occured, they were happy with the results.	F	25	 	7/18/2005Email
5	Wegener's Granulomatosis	None that I could ascribe to the medication	Drink lots of water when taking this med.	M	47	8  months	4/20/2005Email
