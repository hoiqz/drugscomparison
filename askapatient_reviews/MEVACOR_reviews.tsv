1	Total Cholesterol 301	I have been on lovastatin for 2 months. I have low back issues but when it flares up, only my right leg hurts and this pain is different and in both of my legs equally, not just my right leg. It is a diffuse leg pain/can not pin point the areas but feels deep, almost like the pain is coming from the bones or something. It is worse in the mornings...I would describe it as a deep, achy feeling in my muscles and bones with no definite origin. The pain also occurs in my buttocks, more so on my right side for the gluteal pain but equal in each leg as far as the diffuse pain I experience.  It is more prominent in my lower legs, ie..my calves and shins than in my thighs.		F	52	 20 1X D	5/20/2012EmailHistory
1	high cholesterol	Severe memory loss, very sore and stiff hip bones/muscles and muscle weakness, exhaustion/lethargy	I am so happy I saw this site. I have been so worried about my memory and chalked it down to early dementia. I am 43 and shouldnt feel the way I do. I am stopping immediately. I will exercise and become a vegetarian. I have been thinking my life was over and so upset over it. I am a single dad of two adopted boys and have worried myself sick. I couldnt remember simple words. This isnt worth it. And the tiredness. all I want to do is sleep..like crazy hours of sleep 12-15 hours a day. This stuff is poison. Will report back after stopping	M	43	2  years10mg 1X D	5/8/2012Email
1	very high cholesterol	I took lovastatin 20mg/d for 3 years with no side effects.  Dosage was upped to 40mg and I began to decline.  Joint and muscle pain.  muscle spasms.  Memory loss.  I now feel like I am 80 years old.  Stopped drug 5 days ago.  Doctors reaction is incredible.  No matter what you say they tell you to keep taking this drug.  I will check back in in a couple of months to see if symptoms clear.  Lovastatin reduced my cholesterol, but long term users beware.  Side effects snuck up on me.

1	High cholesterol/triglicerides	I started having shortness of breath about the same time as I started Lovastatin..thought it was just the weather but the problem has persisted to the point where I was having chest wall pain  along with it. Had an EKG and Echocardiogram both of which were normal. Just found on the Mayo Clinic Website that SOB is one of the side effects. Will stop the Lovastatin and see if the SOB goes away.	Very interesting comments. I have tried other Statins too without success.	F	69	3  months10 mgm 1X D	5/15/2011
3	High cholesterol	I've been taking Lovastatin for about 10 years. Had the sore muscle thing, but not severe. I am experiencing tremors (shaky hands, fingers, facial muscles. A "RARE" side effect of Lovastatin is "tremors". I have a friend who has extreme tremors and takes Lovastatin.	I want to know if there are many of you out there who have experienced increasing tremors. Thanks. I might be 74, but I'm as active as most 40 year olds, might account for the sore muscles.

Couldnt sleep at all, pain felt like a burning sensation, hurt all the time. I had to stop exercising completely as that only aggravated symptoms.	after stopping for just 2 days almost all of pain went away, can sleep normally again, now it just feels tender or brused but definitely better.

1	Risky Cholesterol - 214	I have been experiencing pain in my Rt Shoulder...like a rotar cuff injury. Thought I strained it exercising. Neck pain...same thoughts. Dizziness. Then i remembered my Dr. warning me about muscle pains. Came to this site...wow...This is a second round with statins in 3 years. Last time mental impairment led to 3 custom shirt jobs done wrong in a wk...lost $3k. I think I will talk to my Dr and get off them again.Then, improve my exercise and foods I eat as well as pick back up the  red yeast rice, Omegas and CoQ10. A month later, I will get back to using Grapefruit Pectin too. They all helped take me from 240 to 200 last year. then I got busy, lazy, older.

1	high cholesterol	the drug from hell.  I felt like I was 200 years old.  I could not move in the mornings I was so stiff.  All my joints felt like they were swolen, but they weren't.  It was absolutely horrible.  I took myself off the drugs and told my doctor I would NEVER consider take a statin again.  I would rather chance high cholesterol than feeling like that for the rest of my life.		F	50	60  days30 1X D	1/1/2011
3	borderline high cholesterol	Severe muscle atrophy, pain everywhere, migraines frequent & horrible when I NEVER had them before, neck stiffness, unable to exercise effectively any longer.  Have made the decision to go off them.  Cholesterol was 204. Dr said to go on them & it only dropped to 178.  Not worth it.  I am too young.  I have had so many blood tests, MRI & Dr visits with every specialty imaginable, trying to figure out what is wrong with me.  I recently went on vacation & didn't have them & the difference was stunning!  I felt normal.  I have also been supplementing with CoQ10, 50 mg per day, since I came across it 3 months ago.  Migraines are slightly less painful & less frequent only.  No other reduction in symptoms with CoQ10.	Maybe for those in advanced age to help extend or improve life.  However, Drs are prescribing these things to people younger and younger and the 40 year effects of taking these things have NOT been ascertained, nor have the effects on younger people been adequately ascertained.

1	high cholesterol	left toe pain. At first, I blamed my new shoes. Yesterday, woke up with severe neck pain, stiff neck, soreness. Had a massage today, and some of the stiffness left. Some years ago, I took another statin at higher dose, and had continual muscle and joint pain until I figured out that it was caused by the drug. I was wondering if the stiff neck was caused by Lovostatin.  Thanks to this website, I know that I'm not alone, nor am I imagining this side effect.		M	52	3  months20 MG 1X D	7/1/2010Email
1	Borderline high cholesterol	Sleeplessness, significant muscle aches in lower extremities	I am very dissatisfied with this drug.  I have suffered from significantly disrupted sleep patterns.  When I awoke in the morning, I could hardly walk from the muscle aches in my feet.  The foot pain was so bad at times that I thought I had gout.  I have found no evidence that these drugs reduce heart attacks or strokes, so I am not sure why I was taking it.  Even if this drug does work to reduce heart attacks and strokes, I may still not take it because it has lowered my quality of life significantly.	M	41	30  days20 mg 1X D	5/25/2010

Wrist pain so bad could not open a door since turning door knob caused excruciating pain on inside wrists. Physician told me she never heard of these side effects and to keep taking the medication.

1	Type 2 diabetic	Watching my husband become a cripple with severe muscle pain and weakness.  Additionally he saw a neurologist 2 times last year for serious memory and cognitive impairment. Was diagnosed with depression.  He's 65 and over past 2 years he's gone down hill so quickly. he can no longer work as a truck driver. No idea Lovastatin could be the cause until 2 weeks ago when symptoms got so bad he could barely walk. I gave up on docs and searched internet.	He stopped taking drug 2 weeks ago.  No major improvement in muscle pain and weakness so far, but he seems mentally sharper.  I am praying he will be back to himself again in a few months.  This has been a nightmare and in all his many recent doctor appts, this was never brought up as a possible cause for these frightening symptoms.  I am angry!	M	65	10  years20 MG 1X D	3/18/2010

1	Elevated Cholesterol	memory loss, fuzzy thinking, mental slowness, clumsiness, inability to form words when speaking, mild joint pain (wrists)	After taking this for about a week, I noticed the above symptoms on a very mild scale.  I initially wrote it off to the long and late hours I was working for part of that first week. (4 days with only about 4-5 hours sleep.)  After that assignment was completed, I went back to my regular work routine of two or three hours per day and 8-9 hours of sleep, however the symptoms did not abate and got progressively worse. After two weeks, I knew something well out of the ordinary was happening to me and the only logical conclusion was that because I was not doing anything else differently, it had to be the drug. I called a friend whom I knew was taking statins and asked him if he had experienced any side effects similar to mine.  He said that except for severe muscle damage that he experienced, I could have been describing his symptoms.  His doctor told him it was undoubtedly the statin and took him off.  I quit the drug today and have called my doctor.  I will report back on what happens.	M	57	28  days20mg 1X D	2/5/2010

Cramping in muscles, twitching in hip joints. Cannot sleep or fall asleep, pain all over, took prescribed sleeping pill, Oxycodone, Neurontin and still could not sleep for hours. This is after the 2nd time being on the medicine. Told doctor that Pharmacist vehemently warned against using this. Took it for a month, was off 2 weeks.

1	blocked stent	Sporadic but frequent joint and muscle pain, especially in right shoulder and arm, but also left side, also hips and knees.  Considerable and constant foot swelling also being experienced but possible lisinopril effect.	Was reluctant to take it because 4 months after double bypass 9 years ago I was put on simvastatin which made me weaker and weaker but without pain.  Told VA docs over and over but had to find out for myself that weakness was a simvastatin side effect; stopping it stopped the progression of the weakness. Just so, if lovastatin is the cause of my current problems - and the muscle pain is certainly not the result of trauma - the docs just haven't managed to come up with that possibility in three consults.

1	high cholesterol	I am only 43 years old but after two weeks on this medication I developed serious memory problems such as forgetting the birth dates of my children. I've always had a sharp mind and was not taking any other medication so I knew it was the mevacor. I've since read that all statins have this side effect and that drug companies hid the side effect data when the FDA approved statins for human use. I was forgetting critical information at work and was scared that I was developing early dementia. The symptoms stopped within a week of stopping the mevacor. But my doctor still wants to try me on another statin. They say memory problems are rare-tell that to the executive who kept taking a statin for 2 years while his memory got so bad that he lost his job. The problem didn't reverse like mine after stopping the drug. The problem is that side effects like mine happen gradually so that it may take a long time (maybe never) before realizing that it is the medicine that is making you sick.

My father, athletic, healthy male who worked out daily at the gym, went to the doctor for first time just for a physical when he turned 64 years of age. Doctor placed him on lovastatin. Within weeks he had weakness in legs, problems with back, would run into walls, lose balance. After 6 months developed dry eye. When he visited doctor, and explained doctor said it was from 'aging'. My father must have aged 30 years in 6 months. He is now (after three years, 2 of those years on lovastatin) unable to leave the house on his own and can not drive. I had to move back with him to watch him. In the last two weeks I witnessed him take two very bad falls, and he couldnt get up without my help. He has been taking coq10 in high doses due to what i've read on the internet. It seems to have seriously improved him but still he has the above symptoms. This drug changed our lives for good.

For clarification, Mevacor, Lovastatin, Monocolins and Red Yeast Rice are [pretty much] the same drug. - Anyways, my numbers now are: Total 194, HDL 53, LDL 129, triglycerides very good, glucose a little elevated but still well within normal. - here is what I did and what I have changed since these numbers were derived. 1/2 pill of Red Yeast Rice (5.2g monocolins), 1500 mg niacin (actually 1200 niacin and 300 inositol in the form of inositol hexanicotinate), 5 1g fish oil pills (molecularly distilled to remove any toxins), b-complex with and also extra folic acid and b12, 200mg CoQ10 (minimum) - Going forward I will increase niacin to 2000mg to increase my HDL. I must be careful and watch my liver function number because niacin as well as the red yeast rice puts a strain on the liver. CoQ10 is absolutely essential for the elimination of many of my earlier symptoms.	M	49	18  months	6/26/2008Email
1	High cholesterol	Memory loss, numbness and tingling in extremities, muscle pain and wasting, atrial fibrillation, bone pain, joint pain, insomnia, poor vision etc...	According to doctor blood tests seem normal to him. Started having heart fibrillations 6 years into this drug therapy. Stopped taking drug and symptoms went away. Start drug symptoms return. Doctor believes drug not responsible. Common senes tells me to stop but don't want to piss doctor off. Hard to find doctors here in Hawaii. Predisposing factor to having negative symptoms may be stress from police job etc. Being on this drug is like a death sentence. Cannot even work out to get back in shape...ironic..been on drug 7 years.	M	47	7  days	6/10/2008
1	high cholesterol	Nausea, insomnia, nervousness, loud ringing in ears, forgetfulness, confusion on low doses	I've taken several statins with similar intolerable side effects. The cure is worse than the disease in this case of many of us.	M	64	2  months	4/5/2008
1	high cholesterol	insomnia, depression, anxiety, muscle weakness and pain, reflux, loss of energy, enthusiasm and drive.  Tendonitis, stomach upset, pain in side. memory loss.	The worst experience I have ever had.  Have been off one month and am improving in ever area.  The change is very dramatic.  Took it 3 years, no symptoms in the beginning, came on gradual and I didn't attribute them to medication until my doctor had me discontinue.  As if by Magic all my complaints cleared up.  I felt so bad I was feeling suicidal.	F	8	 	3/28/2008Email
1	High Cholesterol	Joint and muscle pain. Tingling and numbness in extremities. Fatigue, fatigue fatigue. Weakness. Stopped taking a week ago and am just starting to feel like myself again.		M	60	3  years	3/24/2008
1	High Cholesterol	Pain and swelling in hands, wrists, elbows and shoulders.  Symptoms were diagnosed as arthritis and prescribed 1600 mg of ibuprofin and sulfasalazine for arthritis.	This drug is worse for your health than high cholesterol.	M	58	2  years	2/21/2008
1	cholesterol	I am having severe muscle aches,joint pain, headache's . I can not walk after sitting for awhile because of ankle and leg pain. I also have found after sitting in a car for awhile is even harder on my legs and my hips. I have been to my doc.test show no arthritis.	My Doc has never mentioned any side effects with lovastatin, he says I have some form of arthritis or auto-immune even though all test are negative	M	51	14  months	2/6/2008Email
1	High LDL	Hair loss/breakage and painful joints after taking 10 mg  for 3 months. Doctor had doubled dose for 3 weeks because there was  no improvement in my LDL when labwork was done.	My hairdresser asked about new medications when we noticed my hair was breaking off and looked very "dull" not shiny. When I contacted my cardiologist, I was told this was a side effect, but I could not find it in anything I had read as a side effect.	F	59	3  months	12/29/2007

1	to lower LDL Cholesterol	Severe pains in all of my upper body joints and muscles, wrists, hands and ankles and feet. My legs felt like they were so heavy when I walked. After being on my feet to cook Thanksgiving food my feet on the top would hurt for hours afterwards.Then my legs began to swell. I was extremely fatigued and lethargic. The muscle in my right bicep deteriorated to mush. This crept up on me.	Mevacor did lower my LDL from 111 to 76. I thought that was great. I have had bouts of fybromylgia for years and I have osteoarthritis, so I thought when these symptoms got really horrible that I was having a major attack in these two areas. I was on CoQ10 from the time I started taking Mevacor. I felt like I was slowly dying on this drug. I would rather die of a heart attack at 65 that feel like I did.	F	56	7  months	12/9/2007
1	Genetically High LDL levels	Nausea, dizziness, acid reflux, chest pressure, woke up belching, went to bed belching. Numbness and/or pain in arms and hands, sudden tiredness. I would become so nauseous I could eat nothing but crackers and peppermint tea. Very similiar to "morning sickness". Yuck! Seemed to be triggered by anything that could become acidic in my stomach - even coffee.	I did not have immediate side effects, rather started having "episodes" of dizziness and nausea after being on drug for about 14 months. Did not relate as side effects, until I had an "A-HA!" moment and realized that was the only thing it could be. And it was. Within 2 weeks of being off the drug, all the issues I was having were gone. My Dr. is now having me try Zetia. I just read the side effect reports for this - SCAREY!My Dr. said NOT taking anything would be "gambling" on what could happen otherwise. I lead a VERY, VERY healthy lifestyle. My achilles heel though is having high LDL!	F	50	18  months	11/13/2007
3	Elevated Cholesterol	..A GUIDE TO LOWERING CHOLESTEROL FOR THOSE WITH BAD REACTIONS TO STATINS DRUGS SUCH AS MEVACOR AND LIPITOR, etc.. ...Write me if you have questions.. I commented on this page before. I had great success with Red Yeast Rice (also known as Lovastatin brand name Mevacor)lowering my total cholesterol from 244 to 168 with my HDL 40. My orig numers were 244 w/HDL 62. But there were side effects and my HDL had dropped 22.	I stopped and tried beta sterols, oatmeal, loss 10 lbs, kept up the exercise (best I could), fish oil 2 pills total EPA 530mg and 1000mg niacin extended release but my numbers were total 225 w/HDL 53. Thats a little progress but I need more. I have increased my niacin to 1200 mg (600 before bed and 600 in the morning) and started taking Red Yeast Rice again but half a pill therefor 5.2 monacolins but my neck has started to tighten up and crack with headaches. I'm taking one day off RYR and tom I take only 1/4 a pill for 2.6 monacolins. I mean Advicor is niacin extended relase and Lovastatin and it comes in quantities starting at 500mg extended release niacin and 20 mg lovastatin. I'm well within the lowest amount so what gives. I'm upping my fish oil to 5 to 6 pills for an EPA of 1100-1350 mg. I had been taking 6 pills fish oil before my first test (HDL 62) but had stopped before my second test (HDL 40).My goal is Total under 200, HDL minimum 75 and LDL under 125 hopefully close to 100	M	49	7  days	11/6/2007Email
1	To lower chlorestrol	After taking Lovastatin for almost one year, several months ago began experiencing severe pain in almost all joints of body. Had no energy and had a hard time sleeping at night. Went to Doctor this week for physical and after telling him my problems, he said to stop taking this drug. Why was I not advised of the side effects before taking???		F	67	 	10/25/2007
1	To lower cholesterol	I experienced heart attack like symptoms and have been having extreme dizziness, vertigo, and headaches for the past 4 months.

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011

I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!
