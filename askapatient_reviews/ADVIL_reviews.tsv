5	Menstrual pain, sciatica	None	Works great for menstrual pain. Gives temporary relief for sciatica and back pain, but I need higher doses.	F	37	 50 1X D	1/28/2013Email
1	I just got braces.	On the third day I was using it I started feeling cramps and I have had them for at least 24 hours strait... It hurts to breath the doctors think I'm bleeding inside of my body which can cause my immune system to burst and fail then I will die of that.. I wouldn't recommend using Advil.		F	13	3  days2 a day	3/22/2012
3	Menstrual cramp and headache	Gas, vertigo, nausea....		F	26	1  days1 pill	3/21/2012
5	PMS Cramps	No side effects, just quick pain relief!  Works perfectly!	I love this stuff.  Takes all the pain of cramping/headaches away so I can function!	F	25	11  years600mg 2X M	3/2/2012
2	Cold and Sinus	I took the drug early in the morning and about 15 hours later I seemed to have an allergic reaction. My knees got swollen and had rashes all over them, then my right ear swelled, and now recently I took it again it produced bumps on my neck. This happened 3 times. The exact same way each time.		F	19	1  days30 mg 1X D	1/20/2012Email
5	Headaches and muscle pain	No side effects at all. I have a stomach condition and even this way, it didn't bring any problems.		M	28	1  days400mg	1/12/2012
5	Endometriosis	No side effects. Just pain relief!	I've never been big about taking medications, but I could not survive my menstrual cycles without inbuprofen. My endometriosis is so severe it literally floors me every month with excruciating pain. Ibuprofen makes the pain tolerable. No other medication works for the pain. I've been taking this stuff once every 28 days since I was 16 and it has been a complete life saver for me!	F	22	5  years400 mg 4X D	11/13/2011
1	Back Pain and headaches	ulcerative colitis	I have been using advil over the years to help with my pain and neck pain, headaches, and fibromialga. 3 years ago I began bleeding with bowel movements. It progressed over the next few months so badly that I couldn't even leave my house because of the pain in my stomach and the blood was constantly coming out so I had to have a colonoscopy. They discovered I had developed ulcerative colitis. I never related that to the advil but then found myself have bad flare-ups everytime I took ibuprofen or advil, so I had to stop taking it and just try to deal with my back pain and headaches when they occur.	F	27	 400mg 1X D	8/4/2011Email
3	sore ankles, leg pain	It took about 4 or 5 days to set in but I developed bad stomach pains, weight gain, got fat, ringing in the ears, and a strange sort of constipation combined with diarrhea.	I took 2 to 3 advils every morning for about a week, it was fine at first, but like a slow poison, after a week I slowly got the listed problems. then took about 4 days to clear up to get back to normal. I might take advil again but only for one day, never for consectutive days in a row.	M	49	5  days2 pills 1X D	3/20/2011

1	pain relief	Took Advil Liqui-gels over the weekend due to sore throat, fever, achiness.  2 days after taking the Advil, broke out in a skin rash from head to ankles with unbearable ITCHING all over, including scalp.  Diagnosed by my Dr. as a reaction from the Advil.  Going on day 5 now, and it's not at all subsided!	LOT: E89434, EXP. 04/12	F	45	2  days200 mg 3X D	3/8/2011
2	For muscle aches and pains	Advil is the very likely cause of my bowel obstruction, which generated extreme pain and discomfort after I ate.  One of the episodes caused me to go to the emergency room and resulted in a three day hospitalization.  I have had laparoscopic surgery and will likely require further, more extensive surgery to resolve the blockage.The first three GI docs said there was no known cause for abdominal blockages such as I had, but my fourth GI doc said Advil and other ibuprofen anti-inflamatories can cause diaphragm blockages within the colon.	Other people I know, including my wife, take Advil without any problems or issues whatsoever.  I did not make the connection to my abdominal issue to the Advil because I took it a couple hours before dinner and before the severe pain / blockage occured.  I can not tell folks not to take Advil, but I would be cautious since the side effects for people who are sensitive to it can require hospitalization and surgery.  And abdominal surgery takes a lot longer to recover from than I expected.	M	55	  1X D	11/22/2010
3	Killer PMS / Menstrual Cramps	The gels stick in my throat sometimes and give me horrible bad breath and heartburn.  Do not take before a date.		F	45	4  days1 pill 2X D	9/23/2010
4	Toothache	No side effects.	This was the only thing that knocked out reversible pulpitis in my tooth after a dental procedure. The drug helped me sleep for several weeks until the tooth settled down and I stopped taking it. As great as it worked for tooth ache relief, the same dose did nothing for frozen shoulder. I guess its effectiveness depends on what it is being used for.	F	43	4  weeks600 mg 1X D	5/17/2010
1	For severe headache pressure I got	Developed stomach problems and difficult breathing the day I started to take it. I caught a cold the day before so I didn't think Advil was causing my trouble breathing. I was more focused on stopping my terrible headache. I notice my stomach rumbling and notice I couldn't finish half my meal(I usually eat a ton and could eat double that size meal before). The next day morning I took another advil and my stomach just wouldn't stop aching so then I finally looked at the advil bottle label.	My painful stomach aches lasted 48 hours after I stopped taking Advil. I also seemed to develop an allergic reaction to Advil which caused my difficult breathing which is labeled as the allergic symptom of asthma listed on the Advil label. I have never had asthma in my life as well but Advil caused it. I only took about 5-6 Advil pills in 1.5days and it messed me up bad. I will never take it again and will stick with Tylenol	M	22	1.5  days 4X D	5/11/2010

5	Random aches and pains.	Heartburn (I have acid reflux. Don't get the burn when I take prevacid beforehand.)	It's the best pain medicine for me. With two liquid gels, my pain is gone in an hour! I have to watch not to take it too often, since I have acid reflux disease.	F	19	7  years	11/28/2009
4	Depression	Take Zoloft 200 mg daily. Need an extra boost during the day. Since Cox-2 inhibitors enhance serotonin and norepinephrine production, it boosts the Zoloft. Yes, I take it for severe back spasms, but am aware that it helps with depression related to inflammation too.		F	45	3  months	11/16/2009
5	Headaches, muscle aches, back pain	Never any side effects other than exactly what i wanted from it, pain relief.	I've taken advil several times for fever reduction and it doesn't seem to do as well as say tylenol...but for anytyhing else including sleeping trouble...advil and advil pm is the way to go for me. Also, i have heartburn problems and alot of people said it bothered their heartburn where as me, it never really gave me that effect.	M	24	5  years	9/12/2009
5	Car accident	None	I've been taking Advil as needed for over 20 years. It works perfectly for headaches, menstrual cramps, and back injuries. I'm rather surprised to see these negative comments.	F	46	20  years	8/25/2009
3	Inflammation	I've heard of people getting very bad stomach problems from Advil.	I'm a musician and sometimes experience repetitive strain but have to perform or rehearse through it.  A lot of musicians I know take Advil, and while I have not had many problems with it other than a little tiredness, I know someone well who has developed severe bleeding in his stomach from taking a lot of Advil.  Be careful with Advil & similar drugs.	F	42	2  years	6/13/2009
4	menstrual cramps,	drowsiness, dry mouth	very good in alleviating pain. I take it for my back and shoulder pains, too!	F	31	3  days	5/24/2009
1	headaches and muscle injury	none initially	have developed a stomach ulcer after taking the medication (500 mg)almost daily for a few months, first for a foot injury and then for severe headaches. I ended up at the ER because I was having chest pains and was told the pains were related to a possible development of a stomach ulcer. I was told to stop taking Advil immediately. I probably wouldn't trust it to take it again.	F	39	3  months	2/4/2009

1	Sore legs	Within about 30 minutes my stomach was gurgling and I had heartburn, just praying it goes away and nothing serious is going on like bleeding.	I took the advil liquid tablets.	F	30	1  days	1/28/2009
2	Gout	Rapid heart beat and high blood pressure	This medication should be taken of the market! Causes heart attacks and strokes...	F	33	15  weeks	11/8/2008
3	Cold and Sinus		My concern w/the product is the fact that I purchased it and the box did not have direction on or in the box as to how to take this product!	F	51	6  days	11/1/2008
1	sports injuries	weakened arteries, resulting in rupture and severe blood loss.	I had a ruptured artery in my esophagus and lost about half of the blood in my system before the surgeon was able to repair it.  After it was all over he asked me if i take a lot of ibupropen .  My answer was yes.  He said that was the reason for the weakened artery..  I haven't taken one since.		64	15  years	8/14/2008
3	Myalgias, cramping	Upset stomach	Only works if I take it in high doses, but it makes my GERD worse, so I have to be careful when taking this medication.	F	40	20  years	8/13/2008
1	For pain post-coronary bypass	600 mg. 3x/day: severe fatigue, depression. Next day, 400 mg. 3x/day: exhaustion, nausea, sleepiness all day. On 3d day, after 1st dose,I felt even worse, cancelled church, because didn't feel safe to drive.	I am a physician and used Advil to decrease need for Percocet (narcotic pain-reliever) after my single-bypass heart surgery. The surgery and post-op recovery went extremely well; my energy got much better. Advil really FLOORED me: knocked out all energy, motivation, my mood (I am usually quite upbeat). I stopped it.	M	73	3  days	7/26/2008
5	recovering from sprained ankle	After an episode several years ago where I had a sudden on-set of a severe allergic reaction (asthma, rash, and stuffed nose) which my doctor attributed to a Advil, I was told not to ever take Advil again.  Prior to that, I had taken Advil regularly for sports related injuries.  Recently, I sprained my ankle and a different doctor said that I could probably try Advil again so I began taking it again.  I was fine for several months of taking high dosages (800mg) of Advil at least once a day, but then I started getting a stuffy nose a couple hours of taking the Advil, which I attributed to my regular allergies.  Then finally, I got to the point where I was having full on allergic reactions, where my ears were stuffed, my eyes were watering, and my nose was completely stuffed.  When I finally suspected that it was the Advil causing this, I tested my theory a few times and sure enough, it was the Advil.  And since I've stopped taking the Advil, my severe allergies have not returned.	Unfortunately, I LOVE ADVIL.  It is the only thing that works for menstrual cramps, nauseating headaches, and for reducing swelling.    And it takes like candy.  I wish I weren't allergic to it.	F	31	4  months	3/26/2008
2	Chronic neck pain	None	A nothing drug, at least for me.  I can take up to 8 of these and not feel a thing.  Have tried it many times over the years hoping it would work, as so many people (incl. my wife) like it.	M	52	 	3/3/2008Email
4	For Fibroid pain	there is no side effect, it only help to take the pain away.	I will always use ADVIl unless advised otherwise.	F	51	3  months	11/26/2007
3	menstrual cramps	triggered my asthma within a day. severe shortness of breath and constant stabbing pain when taking a slightly deep breath for 3 days after that.	is really good for cramps but not so good for people with asthma because the antiinflam can trigger it. really good but personally can't take it anymore since this started happening.	F	21	1  days	10/26/2007
5	Headache, muscle pain, fever	None really. Maybe mild sleepiness, but it's expected - when your pain goes away, usually you feel tired and sleepy.	Great pain reliever for headache or muscle ache.Also I take it when I start getting sick (cold or flu). I take it at night before going to bed and usually next day I feel much better.	F	51	 	9/13/2007
5	head ache	none				 	7/20/2007Email
5	Kidney Stones	Very little. I was on a high dose of 800mg per 6 hours. Noticed light fever and some chills from time to time.	This drug, when used properly, is a wonder drug. I needed it badly for dry sockets (wisdom teeth) as well as for my kidney stones, which are agony without the ibuprofen.	M	32	7  days	5/31/2007Email

5	Headaches/Body aches/Menstral cramp	None	I do take three Advil at a time, but it relieves just about any pain (except sinus) quickly.  If my cramps are extreme, I will take four Advil.  It is a wonderful pain reliever.	F	36	10  years	3/14/2007
1	Menstrual Cramps	Lightheadedness, difficulty concentrating, vision problems, severe headaches, numbness/tingling in hands	I have taken Advil for years and it has worked for my severe menstrual cramps.  Since my son started preschool, we get colds every couple weeks which lead to a sinus infection for me and now i have nasal polyps and a blocked sinus cavity.  I have since discovered that one should not take NSAIDs when nasal polyps are present.  (ENT did not tell me this.) NSAIDs can also cause people to develop polyps if they are sensitive to them.  So I will never know what came first.	F	39	3  days	2/21/2007
4	compressed/bulging disk, sciatica	drowsiness, rash	Advil helped my pain tremendously however it made me sleepy and I developed a slight rash on my chest.  The pain relief is what matters the most, I can deal with the rash.  Advil enables me to continue my job with minimal pain.	F	46	3  months	10/29/2006
1	Dental problems	Skin very sensitive to sun and any cosmetics, even bland lotion. Skin rash and redness. Saw Dermatologist (Nurse Practitioner) three times,who prescribed 3 different ointments. They all made the skin worse. I also had fluid retention, drowsiness and blurred vision. My dental problems were resolving and I no longer needed pain relief. Skin improved. After 5 days, I took an Advil for muscle aches and skin immediately got worse. Then I went to the internet and checked side effects of Advil and mine were all there. I was recently told by the Opthamologist that I have cataracts! I asked him about the Advil causing it and he said no. But, I told him about the side effects listed and an article about children having skin problems and several with blindness caused by liquid Motrin. He shook his head and said that he had never heard of that. The eye side effects listed by the company are "blurred vision, changes in color vision, or other vision problems"! It has been two years since I	Because Advil and other Ibuprofens are sold without a prescription, patients and even doctors don't appreciate its dangers. At the very least it should have to be obtained at the pharmacist's window with clear "black box" warnings.	F	72	5  weeks	10/25/2006

3	menstrual cramps, migraines	Dizziness, lightheadedness.	Taken occasionally when cramps or migraines are severe.	F	23	 	5/25/2006
1	menstual cramps	got dizzy	Try to take 6 pills of Black cohosh a day for menstrual pain.  I took it for 4 months, and now have no pain. This drug doesn't cure, just hides the problem.	F	20	4  months	5/10/2006
4	pneumonia coughing	Sore lung, back, rib, and neck pain from the violent unproductive cough associated with my pneumonia. I took one advil because I am sensitive to larger dosages of Advil. I have no peoblem with one tablet (no liquigels for me) I don't don't what is in the lqui-caps but will not take that version again, tehy work fast but can also have side effects. My stomach ulcer doesn't bother me with obe Advil tablet, but two at a time more than twice a day does. the cure for me in this instance - a table spoon of distilled vinegar in water quelled the ulcer pain in 20 minutes.	Can only tolerate one Advil tablet at a time and no more than 4 a day. Adversely affects my stomach ulcer which I have no problem with except when I increase the Advil consumption to 2 pills or more than  a day with ulcer problems. Distilled vinegar in glass of water cured my ulcer pain. Tylenol doesn't work for me at all, Advil does.	F	46	3  days	3/20/2006
5	menstrual cramps	Didn't notice any aside from the blessed relief from cramps.	Works very well for relieving my period cramps.  I definitely know when it's time to take the next dose 4 hours later!	F	23	 	4/15/2005
1	chronic back pain	severe anaphalactic shock within ten minutes of taking 2 - 400mg.liqui-gels. This was first time I have ever taken Advil in liqui-gel form.	I have taken ordinary Advil caplets for many years without any problem whatsoever. It would be very helpful to find out what ingredients could have triggered my reaction. I had a similiar reaction approx. ten years ago to a Tylenol liqui-gel. Suspected  the trigger was the red dye in the Tylenol gel?	M	53	1  days	1/3/2005Email
5	Various types of pain	None.  One factor may be that I don't take it daily (prophylactically over a long period), but only as needed.  But I've never experienced any kind of stomach upset or any other side effect.	When I have pain episodes, I typically take 400 mg x2/day for 1-2 days.  Serious pain episodes (e.g., pulled muscle, etc.) I've taken 600 mg x3/day for up to 3 days (MD actually advised up to 800mg x3/day) -- this is VERY effective, and I've tolerated well.
