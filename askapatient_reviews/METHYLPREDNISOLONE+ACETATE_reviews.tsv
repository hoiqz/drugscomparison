3	Allergic reaction to antibiotics	First of all, all you young women on here bashing this drug because you claim you used it for "contraception"...get off the Internet, pay attention at your practitioner's office and find out what you are REALLY putting in your body. You're so damned ignorant! Depo medrol is a corticosteroid, not a contraceptive. You women are probably on Depo-provera which is A COMPLETELY different type of drug. If you morons payed more attention to what's going on perhaps you would be in better health, rather than broadcasting your stupidity over the Internet.		F	32	1  days	4/29/2013

1	Thumb Tendonitis	Complete numbness of thumb for 3 days, after which I lost about 60% of sensation in my WHOLE body, particularly my scalp, face, neck, teeth, butt and back.	Doctor says that my symptoms have nothing to do with the injection, but the numbness spread from my thumb all over my body.  It has been a week now and I am not regaining sensation.  I am very nervous and hope that something wasn't seriously damaged.  I can't tell if my tendonitis is better because I can't quite feel anything on my body.	F	30	1  daysunsure 1X O	12/11/2012Email

1	supposed trigger point in back	Update from 7.5.12, 7.10.12, 7.18.12 postings: side effects of pain in extremities persist as well as extreme fatigue and muscle weakness. Also, the injection had no therapeutic effect whatsoever. It seems there is a common, scenario - what I experienced along with many others - that makes me wonder about the competence of doctors who administer these injections: doctors not informing patients in advance about possible long-term, serious side effects; doctors being far too cavalier in administering these injections; doctors denying side effects patients experience (some patients are told that they have "anxiety issues" or it's all in their heads! - read reviews elsewhere, the level of medical incompetence is truly amazing); and doctors being completely uneducated about side effects.	PLEASE, everyone who has experienced serious adverse reactions to corticosteroid injections, file a report with the FDA: http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm053074.htm or call the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 to report by telephone. I had trouble filing online and sent a hardcopy to the FDA (which was acknowledged by letter from the FDA). Lawsuits are very difficult to bring, and the only way to force responsible administration of these potent drugs is for EVERYONE who has suffered serious side effects to report to the FDA. Corticosteroid use (abuse) is now booming business for doctors and drug companies, and it seems that the administration of these drugs has become unbelievably irresponsible. MANY people are suffering from the cavalier administration of corticosteroid injections and you can help put an end to the irresponsible administration of these medications by reporting your experience to the FDA.

Not warned of any serious side effects when I specifically asked and docs later denied any connection between injection and side effects.	Google article Understanding Potential Complications Of Epidural Steroid Injections: Practitioners need to understand and educate their patients regarding the full scope of potential side effects that can occur when receiving epidural steroids." The article states: Despite the indisputable rise in the number of pain interventions, little has been written about the potential side effects of administering steroids into the epidural space. In fact, many premier textbooks allocate only a couple of pages to exploring glucocorticoid mechanism of action and then only briefly mention potential side effects. This lack of understanding has led many practitioners to navely view steroids as benign drugs without fully comprehending the broad scope of potential side effects that can occur when steroids are injected into the epidural space . . . to understand the full scope of complications that can arise from epidural administration of glucocorticoids, it is necessary not only to understand the technical/mechanical complications that occur with needle placement, but also to grasp the role of pharmacokinetics, steroid particulate size, and, most importantly, how glucocorticoids affect nearly every organ system.Also google 1.25.12 Bloomberg News article "Bristol-Myers Warning Ignored on Steroid Shots Tied to Deaths"	F	36	 80 1X D	8/14/2012
1	supposed trigger point in back	Update from 7.5.12 and 7.10.12 postings: side effects of pain in extremities persist as well as extreme fatigue. Also, the injection had no therapeutic effect whatsoever.	I have done quite a bit of research on Depo-Medrol and corticosteroids in general since many MDs seem clueless about the side effects of the drugs they most frequently prescribe and have no interest in problem solving. For those with an indentation from soft tissue injections, find medical article "Treatment of Local, Persistent Cutaneous Atrophy Following Corticosteroid Injection with Normal Saline Infiltration" by PETER R. SHUMAKER, MD, JAGGI RAO, MD, AND MITCHEL P. GOLDMAN, MD. The article is in the following journal: Dermatol Surg 31:10:October 2005. Apparently, saline infiltration which is easy to do, works to fix the indentation (but good luck finding a doctor who has heard of this); you should be able to find the abstract for the article online and the paper at a medical school library. A good dermatologist should know about this technique or be willing to investigate it for you. This doctor is familiar with the technique and it might be worth contacting him: MELVIN A. SHIFFMAN, MD, JDSection of Surgery, Newport Specialty Hospital,Tustin, California.  For other issues such as muscle weakness, extreme fatigue, nerve issues, get your adrenal glands checked by a GOOD endocrinologist. Corticosteroids are known to interfere with adrenal gland function which can result in a host of uncomfortable to debilitating symptoms. I hope this information might help someone suffering from a terrible reaction to corticosteroid injections.	F		1  days20 1X D	7/18/2012
1	supposed trigger point	Update from 7.5.12: all side effects persist.	Found out proper dosage for depo-medrol. In addition to being in the package insert material it's posted in the July 15, 2002 issue of the American Family Physician Journal (article title "Joint and Soft Tissue Injection"): 2 to 10 mg for soft tissue and small joints. So, the 20 mg I received for one trigger point (soft tissue injection) is excessive. I was told by the doctor who injected this that I was receiving a "tiny amount" of depo-medrol, and when I later complained about side effects, I was told that the dose was a "pediatric" amount. Btw, I'm under 100 lbs. and along with horrible nerve related side-effects, lost weight because of this injection.			F	44	1  days20 mg 1X D	7/10/2012
1	supposed trigger point in back	menstrual irregularities; red face and chest; extreme insomnia; pain/tingling/numbness/weakness in extremities - arms, hands, legs, feet.	Just one trigger point injection of 20 mg. depo-medrol 3 1/2 months ago resulted in numerous side effects. The menstrual irregularities, red face and chest and extreme insomnia have subsided, but the pain in arms, hands, legs and feet persists and isn't letting up at all. I was told by my doctor that this was merely a "pediatric" dose and harmless. Well, not for me and it may well not be a small dose for the purposes of one trigger point injection. Corticosteroids are very potent drugs and in my experience with both depo-medrol and kenalog (also horrible side effects) doctors tend to be incredibly cavalier in administering these meds and have a collective blind spot when it comes to side effects.

4	Rheumatoid Arthritis	A single Depo-Medrol injection was prescribed by my rheumy one week ago as a "bridge" to manage pain from RA until the Methotrexate and Enbrel take affect.  Took 2 days to feel any benefit from the injection, but it has helped immeasurably.  At day six I experienced an anxiety attack in the middle of the night with perceived difficulty breathing.  I experienced this same side effect 4 years ago while taking the pill form for several weeks due to a neck injury, so I was prepared for it.  If not for the anxiety attacks,  I would be very satisfied with this medication.  Depending on any returning pain levels as this injection wears off,  I may submit to another one to continue to hold me over until the other meds kick in.  Also,  found the injection to have much more efficacy over the pill form.  Good luck to you who are reading this and I hope this review helps you.  As a footnote,  I want to also mention that I am not normally prone to anxiety attacks and have only experienced them while taking Prednisone.		F	46	1  days80 mg	7/4/2012Email

1	contraception	I would say to ANY girl or women considering this to not even think twice. I'm 21 years old and been on the injection for one year then in January 2012 I experienced extremely painful stomach pains which prevented me from walking. I now live on 30mg of codeine (which doesnt touch my pain) and diclofenick for an anti inflammatory then a tablet to prevent ulcers on my stomach. For a 21 year old girl who is obviously planning to have children then to be told you have cysts is my worst nightmare. I now have the option of halving my chances and removing an ovary if this cyst turns cancerous, put up with the pain or wait for them to shrink. I have already been told it will take me up to 5 years to conceive and it really upsets me. The worst part was that the dep website has the cheek to say "dep decreases the chance of cysts" this is not true as me and a close friend have experienced the exact same problems. STAY WELL CLEAR.

Now I'll be on diabetic drugs, probably for the rest of my life and not counting the potential organ damage that goes with it. I asked the foc when he gave me the shot what side effects I can expect and he said none. What a bunch of liars!

He did not tell me long term usage of steroids will cause all kinds of side effects.  My primary doc sent me to an endocrinologist, who send me for all kinds of tests and found out I now have an underactive thyroid and cushings syndrome, caused by the steroids.

It is an instant relief for me as I suffer from allergies year around, severe year around. I think it just works for some people, and doesn't for others, it also depends on what its given for.

1	An injection for degenerative disk	Pain Doctor (after my severe arguing - since the last one 3 years ago made my condition permanently worse) finally got their way, I believe so they could bill medicare.	My condition is being managed by pretty low does anti-inflamatories and opiates. They insisted they had to "do something" they were just not going to give out medications. So I agreed to the injection after putting them off app. 3 years, after that, the shot was 10+ pain scale wise, in addition I now have numbness in both hands but accutely in left hand baby finger and ring finger and palm. These pain doctors want to just bill the govn.. cause I am on medicare, not caring about my concerns, which came true, now I have to have a NCS and another MRI; it was bad enough before this now all this and I may be terminally damaged. Where is the regulation on these doctors that hold your needed pain meds over your head if you do not do costly procedures?

3	Spine fracture	This doctor gives epidural corticosteroids twice a month. At first I noticed I could walk better. Now, doing research, I believe that I have muscle weakness because of the drug. For instance I don't have the strength to sit up straight. Does anyone else think that twice a month epidural injections are excessive?

5	Allergies	The only side effect I have ever had with Depo-Medrol is an aching in the lower back where it is injected for allergy sufferers. The aching doesn't show up until about 6 hours later when the solution begins to crystallize under the skin. This is very manageable with just some simple Tylenol, and goes away by the next day. I have never had any adverse side effects other than this with Depo-Medrol.	I  began taking Depo-Medrol for severe seasonal allergies. In the summers, I could barely smell anything because my nose was running constantly. My eyes were always watering and my eyes, ears and nose itched so bad from all the pollen. Allergy pills helped a little bit, but not enough to warrant paying the price for them. So my doctor suggested an injection of Depo-Medrol given just above the right cheek. The first day, I was still sneezing a little bit, but not near as bad. By the second day, I could go outside without sneezing, without itching and without my eyes watering, and most importantly, without taking allergy pills. Depo-Medrol gave me my summers back!

5	Acute sinus swelling.	None.	I went to several doctors (allergists and general practitioners) from age five to thirty-five. I could not breathe through my nose or smell anything. My nose would run constantly and I was sneezing often. I finally gave up, as no pills these doctors gave me helped at all. At age 35, I decided that I should have a regular physician, so I called a referral service. During my initial visit, the doctor asked if I had any specific problems. I told him of my situation, and he asked me if I had ever been giver Depo-Medrol or Methylprednisolone. I said that I had tried Methylprednisolone in the six-day dosage pack. He said that wouldn't work, I need an injection. I gave me a dose of Depo-Medrol, within two days, I could breathe through my nose, smell things I never had before, and I could taste food better than ever. I go in every month for an injection and never have allergy discomfort or swelling anymore. It was a Godsend.	M	51	16  years15 MG 1X M	5/24/2010

In the left knee where there's basically no cartiledge, I was waiting for an appt. with a different Orthopedic, my family Dr., injected this into the inner side of the left knee. There's a golf ball feeling there now and it's almost completely immobile. The pain is horendous compared to before and even directly after last years surgery. Being told it would help greatly I was happy to get it as 11 prior other injections failed to help. I've had 5 kids, and this is the most painful thing I've EVER endured! The migraine and shakiness is tolerable, I'm otherwise healthy other than the breakdown in the knees. The fact of my height being 6'3", he said encouraged him to give a higher dose.

1	spasm in neck and thoracic spine	The injections caused a flare of SEVERE nerve pain and spasm in my neck and upper body that lasted almost a month, accompanied by the following side effects: flushing and burning on my face, a rash over my upper body, coated tongue, severe thirst, and heart palpitations.  The spasm for which the shots ostensibly were given is worse now than it was before I had them.  I am extremely angry about this, because the doctor didn't even inform me that he was going to do the shots that day, or that he planned to inject a steroid.  I already knew that steroid injections are dangerous.	I am worried that these injections might have caused other effects than those I'm aware of.  I just hope this will stop.  I will never see that doctor again.  If I thought it would make any difference, I would report him to his medical board.  He also prescribed more of this wretched drug, as well as an anti-seizure medication AND Prednisone.  Steroids anyone?  I have come to hate pain doctors.

I was completely healthy before this injection except for a bulging disc.  1 week later they symptoms started and were full blown within 2 months.	F	46	1  days	8/27/2008
4	knee pain	I have notice an increase of broncitis.  I do not know if this is the reason, but I have loss muscle mass in my legs.  But, I continue to get the shots because it helps the pain in my knees plus the pain in my back and legs. I have been getting these shots for about 3 years now.		F	64	3  years	1/29/2008Email
1	facet joints injected neck pain	I have experienced loss of appetite,nausea,boils, increased neck pain but worst of all severe depression and  severe anxiety. Began three days after injection and continues 5 weeks later. Am now on antidepressant and anti anxiety medication. Also have had several nightmares and just felt very sick both emotionally and physically.	I would never let anyone give me this drug again. I am very sensitive to medication and hypothyroid which may have made it worse for me. Had 60 injected into facet joints 5 weeks ago	F	48	 	12/30/2007
2	Uncontrolable cough	It took away the caugh but I felt awful for about three days after, almost flulike w/ fatigue. I thought the dr had accidentally given me a flu shot. The injection site felt like I had been hit w/ a sledgehammer on my upper thigh.	Next time I'd rather try something not so strong. Unless you're really really dying, I wouldn't recommend it.

1	Post-surgical back pain, L-4-5 disc	1st shot = no relief.  3 days later I was in ER for morphine, toradol, and phenergan shot.  2nd shot = 5 days litte relief, no feeling in legs for about an hour.  3rd shot = no relief.  During the shot I saw "stars" and my BP dropped dramatically.	It really hurts when they insert it in your lumbo-sacral or sciatica nerve.  You will scream.  I have been fighting weight gain, sleeplessness, sweating at night, nightmares, and irritability.  Fatigue and no desire to do anything, probably made my depression worst.

1	inflamation from knee injury	Three weeks after injection - rosacea. -- Four weeks after- mustache growth -- Five weeks after - thinning of the skin on my face (tiny blood vesssels visible all over my face) -- Weight gain - gained 15 pounds in three months - had never had this kind of weight gain ever in my life.	My Dr. said "coincidence" to all the side effects. But ... In researching all this on the internet, I found numerous incidence reports of similar occurances. Contraindications to depo-medrol seem to be thyroid conditions (I a take meds for hypothyroidd.) Kidney conditions (I have only one functional kidney) Hormone replacement therapy (I take estrogen.) -- Would I take this medication again? NEVER!	F	67	1  days	9/11/2007Email
5	poison ivy	maybe a tiny bit of soreness	I got poison ivy for the first time.  It was itchy and it got worse after a few days, and with no help from creams and a prescription anti-histamine.  Finally, I went to my regular doctor, and he gave me this shot.  It's been two days, and the spots dried up.  He said I could have had poison ivy outbreak again if I was touched by it in other areas, and that this shot would prevent it.  My brother gets it badly, and he gets relief from this quickly.It also seemed to help my sinus pain, which I regularly have from frequent allergies and sinus problems.  It feels like someone decreased the swelling.If my doctor would give me the option, I would have this shot more often, as it helps me not feel miserable from sinus headaches.

5	SEVERE Seasonal Allergies	RELIEF!!!	My entire life, my seasonal allergies have been so severe, that every May I end up in the hospital. Weekly Immuno-shots didn't do anything. The drops under the tongue, nothing. Pills like Benadryl, Allegra,  Claritin, etc. are like candy to me. Sprays are just as helpful as squirting water up my nose, and my inhaler just gives me anxiety. I could take them all day with no relief. My allergist decided to give me  one Depo-Medrol shot once per year and my allergies are gone - boom - relief - within 3 days.	F	20	5  years	5/14/2007Email
1	Severe burning due to buldged discs	First, my blood pressure shot through the roof, that lasted about a week. And on top of that i had terrible headaches and sleeplessness. In a week i slept at the most 8 hours. Now i am constipated and my pain and burning still persists.	I would not recommend this drug. I don't know how it works in pill form since it was injected in my epidural space.	F	59	 	2/27/2007Email
1	Poison Ivy	I had horrible itching within the hour and was beside myself within 3 hours. It is 4 days later and I have since that day had horrible hives and itching for which I have to take another med to counter the itching and my poison ivy is no better, actually it is spreading and the hives cover me like nothing I have ever seen. They are spreading too.	I cannot find enough information about this medication which I guess should not be too surprising as the FDA does not like us to know too much. The next doc I saw, mine was on vacation during the 2 visits and is still out for tomorrow's, yes, I have to go back AGAIN, cannot believe I could POSSIBLY be allergic to this fabulous medication. I guess I should be thankful I did not go into anaphylaxis or my heart just stopped beating as in other side effects listed if you look around.	F	38	1  days	8/14/2006
4	BURSITIS		bEST RESULTS ABOUT 5 DAYS AFTER INJECTION	F	56	 	9/20/2005
3	stop the cramps and the periods	the side affects that I had were dizziness,mingranes,and enema.some bleeding within the time I was on the shot.	I thought it was ok yet it did not work for me the way i wanted to . so i wouldnt try it again.	F	20	 	4/27/2005
