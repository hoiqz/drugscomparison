5	Infertility treatments	Little burning at time of injection, but that quickly faded.	I did not ovulate early, which was a huge plus the cycle I used this as my husband was out of town and we were using frozen sperm for an IUI. 39 weeks later we had a perfect 10 lb boy. Well, he does have a hypospadeas, but that occurs in 1 in 200 boys, so it would be impossible to directly link it back to the meds. I know quite well correlation does not equal causation and will not be joining the ambulance chaser lawsuits that are becoming so popular.	F	30	4  days1 syringe 1X D	8/31/2011
3	IVF	Initially when I took the drug my greatest side effect was lots of fatigue and bloating. It also made me feel bad, in a strange way, not physically but emotionally, it's hard to describe and I never felt this way before or after, but I felt really bad. My doctor had me take 2 shots at the same time for 5 days.  Ugh...	My baby had torticolis and a flat spot on the skull at birth.  This is listed on the package insert as a possible side effect.  I wish I had read the package insert before taking this drug because I would have probably asked for something else.  He had a cranial helmut to help correct the problem.  It cost thousands and wasn't covered by insurance.  Out of curiosity I started asking others in the waiting room if they had IVF babies.  Most were...at least at this clinic...interesting...  Fortunately we were able to correct the problem, at our expense of course.  It was very difficult financially and we had to set up a payment plan.	F	40	5  days 1X D	12/24/2010
