4	Sjogren's	Seems to cause increased head sweating. Increased urination.	Provides much needed relief. I had to do something since I was at risk of loosing my teeth.	F	49	6  weeks 2X D	9/21/2011Email
5	Dry Mouth	I haven't noticed any major side effects.	The dose was for 3 times a day, but I have trouble remembering the 3rd dose. 2 times a day seems to do fine for me. It seems funny that I have to take yet another drug to counteract the dry mouth side effect of the drugs I'm already taking	F	53	60  days30 MG 2X D	8/15/2011Email
4	dry mouth, eyes	maybe increased sweating.	I have taken it for 5 years, before that I tried Salagen, but Evoxac works much better for my mouth and eyes.  It really makes a difference as I went without it for a week or so, and really missed it.	F	61	5  years	8/31/2009
4	Dry mouth	Maybe loss of energy?	I was miserable before taking Evoxac, about to go crazy from my dry mouth.  I was constantly chewing my tongue or the sides of my mouth.  Evoxac has helped to increase my saliva flow, for which I am thankful.  I am going to try Salagen to see if it offers greater relief.  I take 30 mg three times a day and chew gum constantly to keep the saliva flowing.	F	55	2  months	6/22/2009
1	Sjigruns	I started with a quater dose every  hours and was ok, except heartburn.  When I took a three quaters dose I was natious, dizzy,cramps, and felt out if it.  It added a little moisture but not the gushes I have heard about.	Some folks say the nausea goes away after a week but I also had dark stools and wonder if it is an allergic response	F	50	2  days	3/22/2009
4	Sjogrens	So far,side effects have been minimal, but I have only been taking it for less than two weeks.  I was told to take 3 times per day but only take in am and pm.	Has tremendously helped my dry mouth and even my eyes.  I had completely forgotten what is was like to actually feel my own mouth produce saliva! What a relief!	F	51	10  days	9/16/2008
4	sjogrens	none	has really helped with the dry mouth	F	50	60  days	8/11/2008
3	dry mouth	none		F	55	7  days	3/31/2008
5	Sjogren's Syndrome	I haven't had any side effects.	I take one Evoxac in the morning and one at night, and have for the past 7 years.  It's interesting to read about the side effects that others experience.  All it's ever given me is relief.  The only complaint I would have is that it's so expensive.	F	66	7  years	3/16/2008
5	Sjogrens Syndrome	Sweating.  I'm having abdominal pain and doctor thinks it may be the Evoxac	Has improved my quality of life greatly.  Would not want to be without it.  My mouth was miserably dry before	F	52	6  months	2/6/2008
5	sjogrens syndrome	took 3 pills a day.  some sweating but not terrible.  increased frequency for urination.  helped dry eyes	very happy with this med!!!	F	43	2  years	2/5/2008
4	Sjogren's Syndrome	Excessive sweating is a side effect that I have experienced.  At times the excessive sweating is unbearable. My hair gets so wet that it looks as though I have just jumped out of the shower  and the sweat soaks through all of the layers of the clothing I am wearing.  Due to the amount of water I lose through sweating, I have to be very careful about my water intake. I have found that I need to drink lot of water or I become light-headed.	This drug has been helpful in treating the dry mouth I experience.  It has not been very helpful in relieving dry eye symptoms.  I was taking it 3-4 times a day when first prescribed but I have reduced the frequency to twice a day.  This has helped to decrease the frequency of excessive sweating episodes.

3	Sjogren's	Sweating	Evoxac has tremendously helped with migraines. Unfortunately it only works temporarily for the Sjogren's. Approximately 30 minutes after injesting the pill, I begin to feel sweat on my back and stomach. It typically last about 45 min - 1 hour and then it's over...until my next pill. It has not helped with my eyes or joints.	F	32	2  months	10/19/2007
3	dry mouth, nose,, eyes	Sometimes none other times profuse sweating. I cannot take in the evenings before bed as I have been awakened choking on my saliva.		F	31	3  months	2/19/2007
5	Sjogrens	Unpredictable side effects. I take one pill 3 to 4 times a day depending on my need for relief. Sometimes 20 to 30 minutes after taking a pill I will have profuse sweating and/or frequent urination.	The drug is a life saver. I would not be able to function without the relief that evoxac provides!	F	49	2  years	7/7/2006
1	Sjogrens	Severe chest pain that put me in the hospital.  It was like having a body slam in the chest.  I hurt so much I couldn't even move.	It did what it was supposed to do for my skin, eyes, and dryness in the mouth.  I stopped having the body slam pains after I quit taking Evoxac.	F	59	6  months	6/21/2006Email
4	Dry mouth,difficulty swallowing.	I have not noticed any side effects from this medication. I have only been on it foe a month	My Dr was sure I have Sjogrens syndrome since I display many of the symptoms. Testing was unconclusive. He said he would treat the symptoms any way since they were bothersome. Dry mouth, dry nose, dry cough, sore throat. I take one night and morning and it has been a tremendous help so me.
