1	HIV	Osteoporosis. Men in their 20's get osteoporosis from this poison, too! After all these years they are finally acknowledging this fact. It will cripple you!	Severe Osteo ain't just for old ladies anymore! HIV meds are just plain toxic and I quit all those meds due to side effects after being tortured into my current physical helplessness since 1996. The pharm. corps are just plain greedy and evil. I wish I never took this drug even if you believe it means I would be dead now. This is not a life, and truvada/viread just give you more problems that never go away.	F	57	10  years 1X O	9/8/2012
