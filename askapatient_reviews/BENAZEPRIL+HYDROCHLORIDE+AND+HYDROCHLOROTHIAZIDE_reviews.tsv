4	HBP	slight ringing or clicking in ears, fatigue, occasional heavy heartbeat at night, occasional headache	Taking twice a day by cutting pill in half. Seemed to need it at night as on waking felt bp high again. Tried other hbp meds past 5-6 years and stopped due to uncomfortable feelings, swelling ankles. Tried to control hbp with diet and good regime, deep breathing but eventually not working. Finally sought new med & tried this. Keeping bp lowered and except for fatigue mostly feel good and ankles not as swollen. Hope new exercise program will eliminate need. Dr. now wants to put me on Boniva for osteoporosis but reading side effects gives a real scare so will stay with exercise.	F	72	6  weeks20-12.5 mg 2X D	11/6/2012Email
