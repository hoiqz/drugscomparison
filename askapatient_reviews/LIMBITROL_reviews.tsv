5	anxiety, depression, sleeplesness,	none...a little drowseyness during the day!	I think it has kept me from being a nutcase. It has helped most of my symptoms a lot. Helps me sleep!	F	70	20  years10/25 1X D	2/28/2012Email
5	Emotional Break Down	I really didn't have ANY side effects from this medication. All I can say is that this medication saved my life! It's an older medication but it's one that works very, very, well!	I actually didn't have any side effects from taking this medication. As a matter of fact, Limbitrol saved my life! Due to a bad marriage and other factors, my doctor ran out of medication options, because we tried so many different medications which I could not tolerate. He said, "I'm going to try you on one more medication," and if this doesn't work, I'm going to admit you into the hospital. At this point I was too depressed to care. I took my first pill, nothing! Then the next day, I took another dose. By the third day, I could actually feel something happening which was a good thing. By the second week, I was feeling very hopeful! I could actually get dressed in the mornings, and things just got better and better each day. I would recommend this medication to anyone who has severe depression and panic attacks. I can't say anything bad about it, only good things!	F	61	8  years5-12.5 1X D	12/20/2011Email
5	chronic tension headache/migraine	Aggravated reflux/weight gain	This medication helped so much with my headaches.  Now only if I can take it without gaining weight!!	F	36	3  months12.5/5mg 1X D	9/24/2011Email
2	IBS, Insomnia	Sexual dysfunction.  Slow at first, but got worse as I kept taking it, and continued on for a long time after I stopped.	It helped me sleep and relaxed my stomach, but the doctor of course didn't tell me about the sexual side effects.  They didn't happen right away, but continued long after I stopped.  Inability to sustain an erection for a long time, hard time ejaculating, decreased sensitivity, etc..	M	32	3  years	1/15/2008
5	anxiety	This drug has helped me to be calmer and very seldom get panic attacks now.  I take one every day and if I get especially nutsy, I may take one more.  Really no side effect except possibly making me a little sleepy after lunch.		F	72	12  years	5/14/2007
4	Headache Preventative	Makes me drousy, but I take it at night. No problems.	As a headache preventive measure, this has helped me. I've tried Verapamil and a few others, only this has worked.	M	41	2  months	8/14/2005
