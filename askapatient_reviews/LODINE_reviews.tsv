4	tooth extraction	Constipation	No swelling or pain whatsoever... just constipation afterwards.	M	30	3  days400 3X D	2/21/2013Email
1	Back pain (car accident)	SEVERE abdominal pain!	I was prescribed this drug to relieve back pain after a car accident.  It helps with pain.  However, I developed abdominal pain so severe my primary care physician sent me to the ER for a CT scan to rule out appendicitis!  Interestingly, the pain peaked several days AFTER discontinuing the medicine.  I discussed the scenario with a rheumatologist; he told me that he has observed this with etodolac (although not as often with acute usage).	M	40	2  weeks500 MG 2X D	9/19/2012
1	tooth abcess	none because i only took once WHICH WAS ENOUGH!!!	THIS IS CRAP!!  I do not take pain meds of any kind so even the smell of a pain med should work on me.  The pharmacy said this is the same as Advil.. what!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I dont know what pees me off more.   the money spent for this garbage or it being garbage   DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS,  Goody's work and cheaper  GRRRRRRRRRR	F	56	1  times300 4X D	7/31/2012Email
4	Arthritis, Spinal Stenosis Degenera	I went off it for 6 days in preparation for an epidural steroid injection.  I noticed that while I had more arthritis pain, my appetite was decreased.  I am not as hungry when I don't take the drug. Since I am overweight and this does not help my back, this is important for me to take into consideration.	My daughter was prescribed Etodolac for menstrual cramps and noticed that her appetite increased when she took the drug.  It works very well for her cramps, however and since is on it intermittently, this is not a problem.  For me, on it twice a day every day for 7 years, I wonder how responsible it is for my weight gain.	F	62	7  years 2X D	1/21/2011Email
3	joint pain, sciatica,stenosis	Joint pain, nerve tingling, arm, shoulder, neck, spine, knee, ankle involvement.	Lodine was the best of the NSAIDS that I tried in terms of keeping pain at bay. Mostly I did not want to move at all. After being sent for yet another MRI, the pain changed sides and I realized it was spinal, probably stenosis. I had gained weight and lost the joy of life, was out of shape. I also read that taking these drugs can lead to tendon damage. Diagnosed as Vitamin D seriously deficient, I supplemented with D, fish oil, calcium, glucosamine, chondroitin msm and multi vitamin. I started aquatic exercise, hoping it would not hurt. In two weeks I was down to one pill a day, in a month to none. I have lost 20 lbs and am on weight watchers and am taking kung fu classes--don't laugh. In all, holistic approach is working. The answer is not found in just a drug.	F	60	2  years 2X D	12/8/2010
5	bad back pain, knee, fibromyalgia	constipation (take magnesium), stomach burning (get scrip for carafate)	I have taken this drug on and off for 15 plus years, after trying naproxen, naprosyn, ibuprofen, and many other nsaids. I have extreme spinal stenosis and am on heavy duty narcotics also but they did little for the arthritis in my knee and other joints. I have found I do best with this nsaid, it takes the pain away and it works quickly, it doesn't take weeks to really take away the pain.  I tried Lyrica, Savella, and Cymbalta for fibromyalgia, and had terrible side effects, the doctor said these drugs would help the fibromyalgia but I didn't find that to be true, I couldn't get past the side effects long enough to find out if they would help or not.  I have discovered that I need to take a drug called carafate (sucralfate) before I take the Lodine for my stomach this drug coats the stomach (it is sort of like chalk) and doesn't seem to have much in the way of side effects for me.  For the constipation I do well with taking 400 mg of magnesium (the basis of milk of magnesia) at night, every night(I graduated up to this amount). Occasionally I have to take a stool softener too, because the narcotics I take also cause constipation.  The only reason I stopped taking Lodine was that I had atrial fibrillation and they put me on coumadin and the doc said I couldn't be on a drug that thinned the blood like Lodine.  I have since had heart surgery and had a procedure that ended the afib.  Now I am back on the Lodine hip hip hooray	F	62	15  years400 mg 2X D	6/5/2010Email
1	general arthritic pain	Had severe skin rash breakout from just one pill. Red rash with discoid charasteristics.  Took me several episosdes to figure this out. Took 8 weeks of prednisone to calm it down.	I have been diagnosed with SCLE Lupus.  This reaction is making me feel possibly I have "drug induced Lupus."  Have had similar reaction to Plaquenil.  Have not found anyone else with this reaction to Etodolac.  If you have had this reaction please post a comment.  My husband takes this all the time with great sucess for back pain.  I posted a 1 because of my response.  I never expected this reaction.	F	60	1  days400 mg 1X D	3/3/2010Email
3	tooth pain	stomach pain and watery stools	my sciatica is gone while i have been on this pain med and the tooth pain is gone.. the stomach pain and watery stools have made me miss work.	F	26	2  days	2/3/2010
2	osteoarthritis: back, fingers, toes	I wound up with either severe gastritis or an ulcer and am now on medication for that and a bland diet till the stomach pain is gone.	Lodine is the best ever for absolutely wiping out arthritic pain. With Vicodin, I settle for mild pain to avoid taking to many narcotics. Unfortunately, I have developed probably an ulcer from the Lodine, and have had problems with previous attempts to take Lodine. With a history of ulcers, this is no surprise, but very sad since Lodine completely resolved the arthritic pain.	F	62	4  days	4/1/2009
5	Arthritis	Warm body; always warmer than others in a room.  When not taking it, body temperature is cooler. ALWAYS take with food, never on empty stomach.  No drowsyness, no stomach upset, no dry mouth.	This is a great anti-inflammatory and works on bursitis pain, knee pain, facet joint pain, heal spur pain.  Costs less than $24 for 60 (cheap generic).  When I have to go off this, my body hurts so much I can barely move.  Replaced expensive Celebrex.  About the same in pain relief.  This medication must be discontinued about 2 days before surgery because of it's affect on the blood just like other NSAIDS (aspirin, etc.).	F	59	6  years	6/10/2008
2	Plantar fascitiis or "heel spurs"	Bad constipation, a little drowsiness after about 1 hour but not enough to go to sleep.  Still, I would not drive after taking it.	It did not help.  And why do so many NSAI drugs make you so freaking constipated???? Thank God for Metamucil.  I took 400mg twice a day.	F	46	2  weeks	6/5/2008
2	neck disk worn	After 2 weeks had burn in belly,and has gotten worse. now on prevacid for 2 years doc says.		M	60	1  days	3/18/2008
4	Sciatic Pain, Back Pain	Mild flushing, more vivid dreams, water retention, very mild headache.	I too was having nightmares on Naprosyn. Nightmares were almost always about having a screaming match with someone over what I can't say. Doctor looked up side-effects and said that was NOT one of them, but switched me to Lodine (Etodolac).  Nightmares went away. Was also taking Skelaxin during the day for muscle spasms (Flexeril was too sedative for day time usage).  Also 5mg Vicodin as needed.  Company switched insurances, and new doctors first comments on my prescription was "What weird kind of Kaiser Cocktail is Etodolac and Skelaxin"? and wouldn't prescribe the Skelaxin... but, he DID up my vicodin prescript from the 20 at a time I was getting with Kaiser with 0 refills to *60* at a time with *3* refills... I have more than one friend who became heavily addicted to vicodin, so one 60 tablet refill lasts me 6-8 months.	M	41	18  months	12/14/2007
4	L5 compression/sciatica	Slight flushing in the ears and a very, very low grade headache in the scalpula (more of a tension in the muscles then an actual headache).	Had been taking Naprosyn.  By experimentation, found out that was causing very vivid nightmares (almost to night terror levels).  First night off of Nap on on Lodine, *dreams* were as vivid as the nightmares, but *not disturbing*. Greatly reduced sciatica pain, but didn't relieve general aches in the back (related to my muscles attempting to "re-adjust" their function to automatically compensate).  As a result, my regular walking gait is "different" (however, I just traded trucks with my partner for a week, and am now driving a clutch instead of an automatic).  Also just tried Skelaxin for the first time tonite, and am AMAZED at the relief this has provided, in addition to the Lodine.  For the first time in years, I can pretty much "jump up" from my chair at the computer, walk around the house, back straight, no pain, do regular duties (dishes, bend over to pick up the cat's bowls, everything (mildly, so far ---I'm not pushing it!) I used to do coming home	M	40	1  days	4/10/2007Email
