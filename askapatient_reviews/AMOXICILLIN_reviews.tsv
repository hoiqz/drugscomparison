5	lung infection/common flu	Confusion/headaches	The first 3 days of taking this medication, I experienced slight headaches, nothing too terrible, and i noticed that my teeth hurt whenever my head did. Once again, it was tolerable. I also found that I was a bit confused, when reading, or writing.

5	sinus / ear infection	none.	I have taken amox for ear / sinus / upper resp infections for 20yrs. no side effects at all compared to newer drugs. this is a great first line drug, inexpensive and tried and true for decades. only if you are allergic to penicillins, or have a known bacteria that doesnt respond...this should be the first choice.

1	strep throat	Nausea, diarrhea, weakness, extreme fatigue, headaches	This drug did not work for me. 5 days after starting the med I was still in extreme pain. I Continued to be in pain for 2 weeks so it took me 2&1/2 weeks to recover and then I had it again which I am told was most likely due to the meeds (amoxicillin) not being effective the first time around.	F	31	10  days500 mg 3X D	7/21/2011Email
2	Bronchitis/Sore Throat	After taking my meds I experienced extreme (EXTREME) tiredness and a very spaced out feeling. I have no desire to do anything or be active like I usually am.

3	sinusitis	panic attacks, back pain, leg pain, dizzy, lightheaded,exhausted, depressed, insomnia, feel psychotic, stiff neck,legs and arms feel heavy, heart palpatations.	I feel crazy on this medication. But it seems to be clearing up the sinus infection. My face was swollen the infection so bad and I had an infected area in my nose. All of these things appear to be getting better. But every night when I lay down to go to sleep, I start having panic attacks, heart palpatations, chills, sweats, shaking, tingling, every symptom of a panic attack. So bad that I start hyperventalating. I have to sit up. When I sit up, I start to feel better slowly, but as soon as I lay down again... they're back. I'm on day 3 of this medicine and now I'm starting to have them during the day too. I also feel like there's no hope. I'm so depressed. I have a dendency toward depression, anxiety and OCD, so this is causing it to be sooo much worse. This medication is causing me to constantly think I'm dying. I just want to get off this med! But I'm scared to, cause I am scared the infection will come back and then it will go into meningitis. I'm so terrified of everything. My paranoia is so high right now. Every pain and pinch and little thing I feel, I freak out! I'm so tired. The insomnia is horrible. I've barely slept. I can't wait until this med is done... I never want to take it again!	F	33	10  days875mg 2X D	2/9/2011
3	Infected Wisdom tooth	Rapid heartbeat, insomnia, confusion, anxiety, panic attacks, SEIZURES, depression, attempted suicide	I've taken Amoxicillin since I was a baby. However, for this infection I was taking 2,000mg per day (500mg 4x/day) - highest dose I've ever seen for anything. The first day I developed insomnia, and things just went downhill from there. By day 7, I was having panic attacks every half hour, SEIZURES, couldn't sleep a wink, and sliced my wrists open with my own fingernails. I stopped it at this point despite being RXed for 8 days - it was making my INSANE. The next day I began to calm down, and within a few days I was back to my old self. The infection cleared but it took 5 days and it came back before my extraction appt. All in vain. Seems I have worse side effects at higher doses. At more normal doses (e.g., 250mg/3x.day) I never got these whacko crazy mental changes.	F	24	8  days500 4X D	1/30/2011Email
2	UTI	No side effects just didn't get rid of my UTI, was still having high fevers after 10 days. Went to the ER found out the infection was in my kidneys and the attending was perplexed as to why I was given this, he said most bacterias are now immune to amoxicillian.	Was given a rocephine injection and the fevers are gone.	F	30	10  days500mg 3X D	1/5/2011Email
1	tooth extraction	Developed C Diff, a horrible toxin that was caused by killing all the bacteria in my gut.  I had explosive diarrhea the third day on it and it continues 2 weeks later.	Take probiotics when you take this drug.  I did not and paid the price.	M	58	6  days 2X D	12/27/2010
4	Pneumonia	I am extrememly sensitive to most all meds; you name it, I react to it.  So, when I got pneumonia, I was scared to death.  I read on the internet that Levaquin, and amoxicillin are both indicated for pneumonia.  Since Levaquin is a fluoroquinolone, and I cannot tolerate that, I was at no other choice but to give the old school a shot.  The first night I took one 500 mg pill, I had horrible insomnia.  The doctor said that I needed to take at least 3 days on three pills of 500mg.  UGH.  The insomnia made me CRAZY.  I was given a Trazodone to help sleep; MORE INSANE, went to ER.  Then, finally I was able to go on 2 pills of 500 mg per day.  My insomnia stopped.   I did feel very foggy headed however.  I had to do the 14 days instead of the normal 10, because I did 2 times per day instead of 10.  The pneumonia went away.	After having completed the course, a DARK deep depression set in.  Yuck.  The sleep I got was what I would term, "surface sleep", not deep, restorative sleep.  I went on the internet and read about the "gut-brain" relationship.  I have intrepidations about pro-biotic pills, so I decided to have yogurt.  I went to Whole Foods Market, and bought a particular yogurt called White Mountain Bulgarian Yogurt.  I had a cup of this on an empty stomach, and within 20 minutes, the dark depression lifted.  WOW!  There is a problem with yogurt however, if you still have bronchitis, you see, yogurt (and all dairy) makes mucus, which is the LAST thing you want.  It can actually make your bronchitis WORSE.  Therefore, I think maybe coconut yogurt might be best, even though it tastes nasty. So, I give Amoxicillin (Teva) a 4- It did its job, but the insomnia really sucked.  Oh, also after 4 days of having completed the course, the side effects were gone.	F	41	14  days500 2X D	9/25/2010Email
4	sore throat, bronchitis	No side effects noticed, not even the stomach upset.	After ten days this finally seemed to clear up a lung infection that started with a swollen throat two weeks earlier.  But three days later I still have a lingering ear infection and doctor has prescribed Avelox, but it is one of the lowest rated meds on this site due to side effects and I am hesitant to take it.	M	52	10  days1000 1X D	6/22/2010
4	Throat Infection	The only side effect I noticed from Amoxicillin was that it left me lethargic, feeling of mallaise.	Amoxicillin did the job. Outside of the lethargy, I did not experience any substantial/noticeable side effects.	M	30	10  days? 2X D	6/7/2010
1	strep throat	nausea, anxiety, confusion, abdominal pain, dizziness	It's the first time I got this problems, other time I used it without significant side effects. In this case I had to stop at day 3		37	3  days	12/7/2009Email
1	tooth infection	severe back pain, high fever, cramps, dizziness, after taking only two doses	my doctor told me in phone to quit immediately. the pains subsided after seven hours of agony. i had interstitial nephritis and i was told never to use this species of antibiotics because taking them would lead into renal failure next time. i was prescribed another antibiotics that suited me and cured the infection.	F	49	1  days	8/26/2009
3	Swollen lymph glands & sore throat	Meds worked great other than causing me to get Bacterial Vaginosis.		F	19	10  days	7/30/2009
2	prior root canal	on the 7th dose i got severe stomach pain and vomiting	i was on a high dose...500 mg 4xs a day so maybe that's why	F	39	2  days	3/30/2009
2	Upper Respiratory Infection	I've been on it for 5 days now for the first time in 10 years.  I feel like I'm under water, horrible head ache, sinus drainage, itchy & sore throat, jaw pain, light headed		F	34	5  days	11/13/2008
4	Bacterial Sinus Infection	abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea	Worked well. Cleared up infection. Due to GI side effects listed here, especially diarrhea, (during treatment they subsided then returned after treatment) had stool test for c. difficile infection, came out negative. I would recommend you check with your doctor if during or after treatment with amoxicillin you get these symptoms:  frequent diarrhea,  abdominal pain, nausea, fever.	F	38	10  days	9/12/2008
4	Urinary Tract Infection	Horrendous headaches, nausea, flu-like symptoms and fever.  I'll never take this med again.  I'm sensitive to many anti-biotics, so I hope there's still something out there I CAN take!	I think that as we age, we become far more sensitive to meds than when we were younger.  This one almost had me running to the ER.  NEVER AGAIN!	F	63	2  days	9/7/2008Email
3	Possible Strep Throat	I developed thrush, my tongue and gums and the inside of my entire mouth was covered with sores and bled. This happened 2 days after starting the drug. I had to get Nystatin swish and swallow to clear up the thrush. So far, I am still using the Nystatin after 2 days and I am still in pain.I also had fatigue and irritability.	My sore throat did seem to clear up pretty quickly after starting amoxicillin, but I am not sure if the side effects were worth it.	M	32	5  days	8/5/2008
1	root canal	i took 500mg 3 times a day before a root canal procedure.  This medication gave me a yeast infection which caused immense physical pain and discomfort.  i was put on more antibiotics to clear up the infection and the new pills, particularly Cipro, gave me the worst side effects and kept me in bed throughout.	im never taking this again.  my sister also took it a few years back for her root canal.  she turned out to be allergic and got steven johnson's disease.  she had rashes all over her body, was hospitalized and almost died.  prescription drugs are horrible, there has got to be a better way.	F	27	7  days	3/14/2008
2	Prevent infection after surgery	Severely upset stomach.	I ended up getting an intestinal infection after taking this medication.	F	23	7  days	10/3/2007
4	Urinary Tract Infection	Had diarrhea and vomiting and was told by my physician to take Flora Q when I have to take Amoxicillin.		F	71	10  days	9/2/2007
4	Post-op surgical site infection	None	I took this after a round of Keflex failed for a post-appendectomy surgical site infection.  It appeared to help healing for a swollen, infected incision-now I am just left with a hard, pink scar.	F	52	7  days	5/11/2007
4	chronic sinusitis	hardly any, mostly dizzyness or light head.	have been taking amoxy for 3 years on and off due to chronic sinusitis. slowly have stronger and stronger doses most recently up to 3000mg a day! finally found cause so can stop antibiotics, but never had a problem and usually cleared up and stopped pain within 24-48hrs	M	20	3  years	5/6/2007
5	abscessed tooth	I needed this to kill the infection.  It did the job well.  Within 24hours I was feeling better.. I recommend it.  I never had any yeast infection or upset tummy.  I took it three times a day for seven days..		F	60	7  days	4/25/2007
5	Chronic sinus infection	None	Worked very quickly within 24hrs & only took 500mg/3xday!	F	56	5  days	11/14/2006
3	possible sinus infection	i got thrush	i was taking 2000mg per day for a possible sinus infection, and the dr said i would need to take it long term, about a month or maybe longer. it not only didn't cure my problem, but it caused thrush after about a week and a half or two weeks. i stopped the amoxicillin and had to swish & swallow nystatin to cure the thrush. although i've used amoxicillin in the past for ear infection (which I had to take twice at 1000mg/day) I wont ever take that much again.  but it didnt bother my stomach at all as long as I had lots of yogurt.	F	40	2  weeks	11/4/2006
2	strep throat	cramps, gas, nausea, strong digestive problems, infection came back after a few days	Acidophilis or yogurt eaten anytime daily often relieves digestive problems. Augmentin is better version of this antibiotic and much more desirable and finally cured me.	M	55	10  days	12/29/2005
2	sinus infection	dizzy, nausea		F	25	10  days	3/30/2005
4						 	2/27/2005
