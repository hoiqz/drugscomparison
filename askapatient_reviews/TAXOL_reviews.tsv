5	Breast Cancer	Fatigue.	Taxol helped save my life.  I was Stage 2B when I started treatment with a tumor 4 1/2 cm in size.  Opted for neo-adjuvant chemo in the hopes of saving my breast. Started with dose dense A/C for four treatments every other Tuesday and ended with dose dense Taxol, four treatments every other Tuesday for a total of 16 weeks of chemotherapy. Because of the positive response to chemo my tumor was shrunk to 1.1cm and removed successfully.  Followed with daily radiation for 7 weeks.  Six years post treatment I am completely disease free.

4	Bc  her2 +	First 8 treatments were a breeze. Last 4 stomach issues got bad. Been off 3 weeks and am still having bouts of bad nausea. Thought it would be over by now.		F	56	3  months	7/1/2012
4	Stage IIa Breast Cancer	Taxol has, so far, been so much easier than A/C that I feel as if I have been given a second chance. I am between week 5 and 6 of weekly infusions and so far the worst side effect has been insomnia the night of the infusion and fatigue on day 3. This has been so much easier to take compared to the first chemo.		F	41	12  weeks100 mg 1X W	6/10/2012Email
4	Stage 4 lung cancer	Slight neuropathy and swelling of feet; slight tingling of fingertips; almost complete hair loss including all body hair. Side effects not suffered include nausea, intestinal problem, heart or kidney problems.	I have had 20 injections (each lasting 2 hours) of Taxol in the last 26 weeks. I take 3 weeks in a row, skip a week, and then start another 3 weeks of injections. Currently I will be skipping 3 weeks (impending cataract surgery) and resuming weekly injections on June 13th. I have found that this skipping allows my body time to rebuild and not leave me completely drained and weak..The day of and the day after chemo are my coming down from the steroids days. Days 3 and 4 after chemo are generally my "don't do anything" and rest days. Days 5 and 6 are my "normal" and productive days. The latest CT scan shows that Taxol has reduced the cancer mass in my lung to one-third the size it was before Taxol. Prior to Taxol I was on Carboplatin every 3 weeks, however this chemo still allowed for the effusion to build up in my lung. Since starting on Taxol last November I have not had the need to have my lung drained of effusion (thoracentisis). As a comparison, between my diagnosis in June 2011 and my last thoracentisis in Nov 2011, a total of 11.3 liters of fluid at 7 different times were removed from my left lobe.

3	Adv Metastatic BC stage 3C grade 3	I was treated in May 2006 first with A/C and after no affect 6 weekly doses of TAXOL. I had lost my hair from A/C treatments but after taxol I lost ALL my body hair. The neuropathy began my second treatment which was done while I had shingles. I know I am alive today because of this drug but I hate that for so long Doctors have not taken the long term effects of Chemo drugs especially taxol seriously. After almost 6 years I continue to walk like an 80 year old. My fatigue is severe, I have constant bone pain in both my lower legs, numbness, burning, aching, and shooting pains in my feet and hands. I am a single mom, a middle school teacher, and I haven't been able to work a full year since treatment. I have to take pain medications to work and it is depressing not to be the active strong person I was before treatment. I am thankful to be alive, yes, but please give us the information, care, and belief following treatment as well. I want to live happy not be in horrible psn and a burden to my kids. My older two live at home because of this and I hate that this has changed their lives as well!.		F	50	6  weeksmax dose	4/10/2012Email
3	stage 2 breast cancer	Put on after severe neuropathy caused by taxitere. Neuropathy continued to affect my feet but gone in hands. Lost 17 finger/toe nails. Extreme fatigue but continued to work from home office all but day of treatment due to time. Cracked corners of mouth, gooey mouth or cotton mouth. 2 weeks after last treatment extreme leg/joint pain and edema in legs. Still unable to do many things with my hands; buttoning, picking things up, holding onto things w/o dropping. Loss of balance, difficulty walking. Hoping these subside quickly.

3	Breast cancer Stage 3A	I was just diagnosed last year MAY 2010. I can admit I am still alive but living in a body that feels like I am 90. I wake with such horrific pain I have to take my Morphine 30 mg instant release and 60 mg slow release. It takes about 1 hour to feel well enough to get out of bed, just to go to the couch, I can hardly stand for 5 minutes, I cannot climb stairs well, use handicapped parking areas to avoid walking so far, my legs feel like they are on fire. They pinch, burn, throb, ache, with pulsating pain and sometimes shooting pains. I can have a massage but as soon as I am finished they hurt equally to when it started. I have found a scalding hot bath helps until my morphine kicks in and takes the edge off enough to sleep. Since the taxol I have become an insomniac. I dont sleep well or at all with out the help of 2 sleeping aids. My arms up to my arm pits ache when things get really bad. Also I believe A/C first contributed for my hair loss but I am sure taxol didnt help because abou	I too wish I would have known about these side effects. I noticed the extreme "I cant take it" kind of pain right after my 2nd dose of taxol, Where as A/C just made me feel like I had been hit by a bus and I was nautious the entire time. Those symptoms started the 2nd day after treatment and lasted until about day 10. Things were the very worse at about day 5 through 9. My quality of life is ruined. I used to work managing large hotels and was used to running around the building to manage things. I excercised regularly and lifted weights. I loved rollerblading and biking. My feet go numb after an hour of wearing shoes.I cannot keep up with my 3 year old. I am unable to work, not even able to depend on myself to wake up in time, since I dont sleep well, All I can say is without the morphine I am on, I would rather die than feel the extream intense pain I have when it isnt in my system. I have tried to go off of it many times but the pain is so horrific. I am looking for someone else like me, in my situation. I have tried ketamine infusions which they said will reset my nerve path but even that, which was helpful, did not work. HELP!!!	F	31	2  months 2X M	12/13/2011Email
4	Breast Cancer	No noticeable effects until after 4th treatment-now up to 7th. Rash and swelling on both ankles, muscles hurt during exercise, accumulative effect fatigue.	After A/C -four 3 weekly sessions- Taxol is not so bad. However, I believe that the side effects are accumulative and depend on the dosage as  well as the capability of the individual's body to deal with the drug. Just hoping I won't have problems with my nails!!!	F	61	12  weeks80mg 1X W	11/27/2011

3	stage IIIA breast cancer	peripheral neuropathy after 8 treatments, severe joint and bone pain, felt like I was 90 years old (I'm 53).  Much easier than AC but long term effects more pronounced.	My doctor didn't have any answers for the long lasting joint pain but it DID disappear about 18 months after last dose.  Previously had trouble getting out of a chair, felt stiff and sore, but after walking a few steps it would improve.  I didn't think it would ever go away but happy to say there is light at the end of the tunnel! Still occurs once in awhile after a long day at work or exercise.  No recurrences (yet) in 2 years so hopefully it was worth it.	F	53	12  weeks 1X W	10/5/2011
3	breast cancer stage 1	numbness in left toes after my 11th treatment.  Also very tired by the third and fourth day and didn't bounce back till day 5 for the next treatment on day 8. Hair growing back on taxol	AC was tough to take, taxol was easier in alot of ways until the numbness set in on left toes by the last treatment. Hopefully it will fade over time. Otherwise, besides crashing from the steroids 36 hours later it was a breeze. I am still tired from all the AC/Taxol treatments. total of 22 weeks. WHEW!!!!!!! Looking forward to radiation (10 minutes vs. 2 hours)	F	50	12  weeks124 1X W	8/11/2011Email
4	BC-Stage 1a	Definite bone and muscle pain from the waist down. Tingling in fingers and feet. Usually subsides within 4 to 5 days. Loss of eyelashes and eyebrows as well as other body hair including facial and pubic(hair was already gone from AC). Bad taste in mouth.	I have one more treatment to go and the Taxol is definitely harder than the AC but I am going to make it through!I have had my treatments on Thursday, shot of Nuelasta on Friday and taken the weekend to recover, returning to work on Monday after 7 treatments so far.

3	Fallopian Tube Cancer	Severe neuopathy in hands and feet/toes. Loss of taste, dry mouth, inflammed veins, complete hair loss, and nausea.	Due to the level of my neuropathy, my doctor took me off of the Taxol after the 3rd treatment. After a few weeks, some of the symptoms did subside and my hair did actually begin to grow back(not that this was my main concern), after 6 weeks. Everybody is different, but I will say that the recovery period after each treatment without the Taxol was reduced by about a week.	F	47	2  months 1X O	5/29/2011Email
5	stage I grade 3 triple negative BC	intermittent very mild neuropathy, some stumbling, but not too bad.  a little fatigue, but not too bad.  After the Epirubicin and Cytoxan, the Taxol is wonderful  I think the pre-meds are the primary cause of my tiredness and malaise for a day or two after the treatment.	my WBC and RBC counts are low, but staying constant  I am ravenous due to the dexamethasone pre-med, but try to eat lots of proteins to keep my blood counts up.  I take a couple tablespoons of blackstrap molasses every day, and I'm convinced that that is helping with the blood counts.	F	49	6  weeks12 weeks 1X W	5/15/2011Email
4	breast ca		Interesting comment about the Claritan as I take that daily for seasonal allergies, and living in FL we have been in high pollen for weeks.  I just finished Taxol last week and did well; common symtpoms were fairly mild and manageable.  For the person needing advice re: nail fungus...try Tea Tree oil daily to the affected nails.  This was recommended to me by a podiatrist for common nail fungus (another prevalent condition in this warm, humid climate). Tea Tree oil has a pleasant, medicinal smell and the oil base probably helps nail growth also.  I find the oil I get at a reputable health food store to be a much better quality than the cheaper brands tried from big chain stores...hope it works for you.	F	54	12  weeks 1X W	3/18/2011
5	MD Anderson	I am in my 9th week of Taxol treatments and have not experienced any major side effects.  (oh, except for my hair thinning out)  i take my treatments on Saturday mornings so I have the weekend to rest.  I still work full time in upper management.  Everyone responds differently to treatment.		F	40	9  weeks 1X W	2/22/2011
2	Stage 2 - Triple Neg -Breast Cancer	Peripheral Neuropathy set in following the first Taxol treatment, hands first then feet.  I lost all skin on my hands, numb at the tips, sharp electric shock feeling when I touch things.  Side affects got worse following each treatment. Lost toe nails after second treatment and big toes hurt, finger nails are now purple and they say the finger nails will probably fall off too.  The pain is intolerable at times, especially at night.  After a few weeks it has gotten a little easier to walk, hands are arthritic feeling, ankles hurt - I just hurt all over and I feel 90 years old instead of my usual active and happy self.  Not sure if it was worth it yet as I had chemo first, with surgery to follow.  I cherish my quality of life over length and this is far more severe side affects than I was told to expect with only 4 treatments.  They gave me pain meds the first few weeks, but now suggest the symptoms should be subsiding and I should use natural remedies and buck up and it will go away in	Chemo is poison for some and medicine for others and doctors are not sure how anyone will react for sure.  More research is needed to find a cure, but in the meantime more emphasis should be spent on treating the side effects and not just the cancer.  Side affects are real and most often pushed off onto the aides and nurses to treat and unless you get a really qualified nurse, this can be emotionally and physically very difficult.

4	Stage IIB Breast Cancer	The main difference between Taxol and my A/C chemo treatments is the pain in my bones and my abdominal distress. Of course I have fatigue, complete hair loss, eyebrows and eyelash loss, weight loss of 40 lbs because everything tastes horrible, and sometimes I just get sick and tired of being sick and tired! I was told by one of my chemo nurses to take Claritin after chemo and IT WORKED really well! I have very strong pain medicine that doesn't even work, but the Claritin (just one pill) helps with the pain. I also take 3,0000 mg of L-Carnitine - 1,0000 mg 3X a day and have not experienced any tingling or numbness...yet anyway. I hope this helps someone feel better. I still have five more treatments to go.	I am a middle school teacher and could not work at all with A/C chemo treatments - 4 rounds after a double masectomy and 38 lymph nodes removed. I went back to work 3 days a week on Taxol. I am tired and in a bit of pain, but I'm praying to be cured and cancer free after all this. I also have 33 radiation treatments to look forward to. I think you just have to try to stay positive and remember you are not alone in this fight. I wear a shirt that says, "Fight Like a Girl!" Would be happy to correspond with anyone who needs a friend to talk to.	F	51	7  times30 mg 1X W	2/10/2011Email
3	Grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma	Very severe pains in the legs started three days after the first dose was given. Lasted three days. No painkillers seemed to work and it was awful. Also got peripheral neuropathy (numbness) of all toes and fingertips, plus slight nosebleeds and gum soreness but all manageable.		F	52	1  days? 2X M	1/14/2011
3	Stage 4 Met. Breast Cancer, Her2+	Been on some sort of Chemo, radiation or Cyberkife since 2004! Started out after surgery in2004 AC+T 4 rounds each. Stopped after round 3 of Taxol, feet, arms and legs one giant blister. Went on to many other types of chemo, Navelbine,Tykeb,Arimidex,Taxertere,Herceptin. Different combos sometimes. Presently on Toxol and Herceptin and I'm in remission for the forth time. Had kidney stones removed 2 months ago. Itching, lack of sleep, joint pain, not being able to eat, radiation burned my esophagus.Lost 50+ lbs.past 6 months.Working one day every 6 weeks having problems with my cell counts(RB&WB) getting shots of Neupogen. But Im still here and plan to go to my 40th reunion in July 2011.	Seems to work well with Herceptin. Did nothing for me with AC.	F	57	  1X W	12/8/2010
3	Stage 3 BC	Much easier than AC. Initially, seemed like a walk in the park. After a few weekly treatments, joint pain, extreme fatigue, mild nausea, neuropathy, acne from steroids, memory impairment.	My hair grew back while on Taxol!	F	40	12  weeks 1X W	11/25/2010
3	Stage 1 breast cancer	Extreme fatigue - I was unable to work, read a book or, most days, even watch TV, muscle pain - especially in legs, complete hair loss midway through treatment, eventually toenails turned blue and split, premature menopause for 16 months after treatment, diarrhea, acid reflux, tinging feet and hands (neuropathy) that lasted a few weeks post treatment, but I id well with this side effect as it was only mild and went away very quickly when I was done with chemo. The last two weeks of treatment, I also got serious nausea. The fatigue was so bad by then that I could not drive a car for more than 10 minutes. It took about 3-6 months to begin to feel myself again.	I also took this med with weekly herceptin, so it is not possible to precisely know which medication caused which symptom. But I am two and one half years past treatment, and I feel 95% recovered. Not fully regained my energy - yet.This medicine obviously affects people VERY differently, as working during treatment would have been a complete impossibility.

4	breast cancer	After my mastectomy, I did AC-T chemotherapy. 4 treatments of AC, then 4 of TAXOL. Treatments were intraveinous, once every two weeks. With the TAXOL, I got severe pains in the legs two days after the treatment. I took  one ARCOXIA pill - and was pain free for the next 2 weeks. This happened for all four treatments. Hope this works for you too !!		M	63	60  days 1X AN	10/30/2010Email
4	Breast cancer	After 4 3-weekly doses of A/C (few side effects, mainly tired and complete hair loss), I started on weekly Taxol, 12 doses, 3 to go. Apart from tiredness, I had no problems until the 6th dose. Since then I had haemoglobin loss (had to have a blood transfusion) and have had red, swollen, scaly, intolerably itchy hands and wrists, and one badly swollen, red, painful foot and ankle. I had a couple of minor infections. I've also lost all sense of taste except for the metallic taste in my mouth which no amount of mints can cure!	Reading other people's experiences, I realise that I've had it pretty easy. Cortisone cream and vaseline on my hands is helping a bit. Antibiotics cured the infections. Only three more weeks of Taxol to go (then radiology). Don't know if it's 'cured' me, but I trust my oncologist, and he reckons I'm doing very well, and hair, taste buds, and decent hands and feet should soon come back.	F	68	9  weeks 1X W	10/13/2010
4	Stge 3 G3 Triple negative breast CA	Joint pain in legs, arms & lower back, numb fingers and feet.	I received this treatment after 8 weeks of AC which was a non-stop nausea ride & lost all my hair. I would take Taxol over that anyday. No motion sickness or nausea. I've worked full-time (office) while getting both treatments & I'm alive. Yay!	F	37	8  weeks 1X W	9/29/2010
3	stage 2 breast cancer	Experienced the classic symptoms during treatment.  However, after treatment,   peripheral neuropathy in my feet.  Numbness in all toes.  Tingling in all toes.  All toenails and fingernails are falling off and have fungus infections.  Balance and walking are severely affected.	Help! What is the treatment for the fungus????

3	breast cancer	I took Taxol weekly for 12 weeks, along with Herceptin (I just finished my year of Herceptin).  I've been off Taxol since September 2010 and while my counts and general health were good throughout, I had some severe neuropathy and balance issues.  I tried Lyrica, gabapemtin, glutamine and lots of naturopathic remedies.  I still have intermittent intense discomfort in my feet, muscle weakness, balance issues.  I am an active 55 year old and it has definitely diminished my level of activity.	I still feel I did the right thing, despite the neuropathy.  I had a recurrence (actually a totally new breast cancer in the other breast).  Was HER2 neu positive, too, so feel I have to deal with the side effects as I want to stay healthy!!!

3	Stage 2b Breast Cancer	Four A/C treatments with minimal side effects (fatigue & hair loss). Thought Taxol would be a breeze but I was wrong. The bone & muscle pain (mostly from the waist down)started 3 days after my first Taxol treatment and was so severe I took Darvocet that was leftover from my surgery. Pain lasted 5-6 days. Second Taxol the pain started 2 days after and lasted 9 days. Third Taxol the pain started the next day and lasted the full 2 weeks until my last Taxol which was 2-1/2 weeks ago. Pain is still incredibly intense. Initially the pain was more in my hips, legs and feet.  Now it's also in my shoulders, arms & hands. I also have neuropathy and darkened nail beds but I can deal with that.	I had 4 A/C treatments with very little side effects. The Taxol has definitely been much harsher on my body. I have a very high pain tolerance and the bone and muscle pain is about a 9. I've been on Vicodin since the 2nd Taxol and have had to increase the dosage with each treatment. The pain came on earlier and lasted longer with each Taxol treatment. I called my oncologist 2 weeks after my final Taxol and he increased my Vicodin dosage and also prescribed a muscle relaxer. Not sure how long this will last but I'm hoping it won't be much longer. I had the option to go with the 12x weekly Taxol dosage but thought since the A/C was so easy that I'd do the 4x every other week. Not sure if it would've made a difference.

1	breast cancer stage 2 grade 3 ducta	8 months after my last treatment I am still experiencing peripheral neuropathy in my feet, ankles , hands and wrists. My pain was 10 out of ten (agony).  I have numbness in both of my feet that cause my mobility and balance issues.  I have fallen an injuried myself because of the numbness in my feet.  I wear protective  shoes at all times to prevent injury if I step on something and to give my balance.  There is not a time that I am without pain.  I have tingling in my ankles at times of shooting pain.  In the morning I my hands are curled up and in  pain.	I have not returned to work because my balance is so poor.  The quality of my life has diminished.  At 53 years of age I feel 90 years old.  I have tried Lyrica , gabapatene, and amitriplyne as well as Vitamin B and glutamine.  None have been able to relieve the pain and often have left me in a bit of a mental fog.   I have always been physically active and have tried to continue to exercise by riding my stationary bicycle, walking,( with the worst gait possible)yoga, weight lifting  rehab pilates on a reformer and just started dragon boat racing.  Any exercise you can do sitting down . I have tried to golf 9 holes riding a cart however my ankles are so painful afterwards I con't know if it is worth it.   My typing accuracy is dreadful since I can't feel the keys.  Taxol might have saved my life from a recurrence of cancer but it also stole the quality of my life and livelihood.  All I have been told is that it might get better over time.  One can only hope.    I have just recently been seen by a neurologist.  When I told my oncologist after the first round of taxol that it was the worst pain I had ever experienced that he joking said that I had never experienced labor as if that would be more pain than I was experiening . I told HIM, HE never experienced labor either and not that type of pain now for 8 months....I have tried everything I can do from drugs, diet, exercise, mediation etc...however I have no control when or if the periperal neuropathy and my mobility will	F	53	4  times 4X O	5/20/2010
4	Triple Negative Breast Cancer	Some fatigue on days 3-5 post treatment.  Some joint pain in shoulders.  My hair thinned out significantly, although I didn't lose it completely.  I ended up shaving it off anyway since my insurance paid for a wig.  I just had my 9th treatment (3 more to go) and I have been getting headaches now for the past couple of weeks.  Today's was the worst yet.  Hoping they subside soon.	I haven't had any major issues with Taxol.  My chemo experience thus far has been better than I anticipated.  I begin FEC in 3 weeks and I'm hoping it goes as smoothly as the Taxol has gone.	F	35	12  weeks 1X W	4/15/2010
2	Triple negative breast cancer	Numbness/loss of sensation in fingers and toes; no sense of taste, so food seems disgusting; awful, bitter coating in throat; 3 days after treatment bone/muscle pain starts and lasts for 4-5 days. Worst in the hips, lower back, and knees, but also shoulder bone and ankles. I hobble around like a 90-year-old, just as many of the comments above mention!	Did 4 rounds of A/C followed by 4 rounds of Taxol--the last round is later this week. My onc said that since I tolerated dose-dense A/C so well, Taxol would be a breeze. Well, it's different from A/C but I wouldn't call it a breeze. I sure hope that this was worthwhile, but I guess that only time can tell.	F	49	2  months 2X M	3/15/2010Email
4	Stage IIIa BC, one side mastectomy	Painful brittle, yellow nails; mild neuropathy in fingers, tired	I took 12 weekly Taxol Tx after AC for 2 months every 2 weeks. Taxol was so much easier! Dexamethasone was giving me trouble (water retention and weight gain of ~12lb by the end of tx). I am now 1 month after tx and feeling really well. I was exercising throughout my treatment, walking 4-9 miles almost every day, swimming several times a week and working almost full time. I even went skiing in the Rockies while on Taxol! I believe that good physical condition before dx and continuous exercise during tx helped me to go through this difficult time. It was not exactly a walk in the park but close enough. I started radiation now, Arimidex and Clodronate and still run.	F	59	12  weeks 1X W	3/13/2010Email
5	BC Stage3A	Hair loss, nausea, neutropenia and anaemia.	I continued working (office), but had to quit the gym, which I resumed 3 months after the last chemo and surgery. I had a giant tumor, which after Taxol reduced to 10.5 cm but had free margins. I'm currently finishing my rads and taking Armidex. Apart from the anaemia and neutropenia, which required some extra care the treatment went smoothly. 3 months after I still have a bit of neutropenia but my quality of life is OK, besides the doctor says I'm cancer free!

4	BC Triple Neg Stage 1 (1.8cm)	Numbness in fingers and feet.  Joint pain in shoulders.	My treatments consisted of a lumpectomy, 4 rounds of Adriamycin/Cytoxan, 4 rounds of Taxol, and 33 radiation treatments.  I experienced joint pain and numbness in feet/hands from the Taxol.  Did chemo from April through July of 2008.  Still experiencing shoulder pain and some numbness in my feet.  Drinking Kangen Water (electrolyzed water) helped to keep me hydrated throughout treatments.  Also - never threw up during chemo.  This redhead barely got pink during radiation.  I love my Kangen Water and feel it helped tremendously during my treatments.	F	45	4  weeks	1/22/2010Email
4	BC Stage 2A		04/16/09 was my last Taxol treatment.  I am still experiencing joint pain, muscle weakness BUT, it is much better now than before.  The joint pain/stiffness is worse of a morning.  Once I take a shower, the warm water seems to allow me to be more moble.  I haven't gained weight, actually I've lost more since treatments.  I also took 33 treatments of Radiation after Taxol.I would like some feed back from other BC survivors who was dx with triple negative BC.  My appetite is back to normal, I just get full quick, also experience alot of loose stools. I also notice problems with my memory. Not too back, but it's there.	F	53	12  weeks	11/17/2009
5	Stage IIA Breast Cancer	After 4 treatments of AC, Taxol although isn't a walk in the park is easier.  Side effects include bone aches days 3 - 5 usually starting in the afternoon.  Fatigue.  Bowel problems.  Mucous in stool and stomach pain.  No nausea.  Nose bleeds.  New side effect - rash on hands.  Lost my hair during AC and seem to be losing more with the Taxol.	Currently on 8th cycle of a 12 week low dose Taxol.  Looking forward to having some energy again.	F	51	12  weeks	10/26/2009
5	Stage I Breast Cancer	Some fatigue, short-term memory loss (but not enough to affect my work), very upset stomach for three days following treatment, diarrhea/constipation and loss of menstrual cycle.  NO mouth sores, joint pain, nail problems, neuropathy, or total hair loss (just some thinning of my hair, but not my facial or bodily hair).	I was prepared for the worst, but found Taxol to not be as bad as I thought it would be. I just finished my last dose on August 13th.  I participated in a clinical trial where I received Taxol weekly for 12 weeks.  I think the data is showing that a lower dose administered weekly is easier on patients.  At least is was for me.  I was able to work every day but the day I got the Taxol.  The worst symptom for me was my stomach/bowels. I didn't lose my hair.  It continues to fall out, now 3 weeks post Taxol, but I never lost enough that I had to wear a wig.  I did, however, have to have high does of Decadron because I had a severe reaction to my first infusion. After that (which wasn't fun), it was faily unremarkable.  I have three children under the age of 4 and was able to care for them without them ever knowing I was sick.  So, I recommend Taxol, and definitely given weekly over 12 weeks.  Hope this helps :-)	F	37	12  weeks	9/6/2009Email
5	Breast Cancer Stage IIIB	Neuropathy in hands and feet; rash on my face, progressive memory problems/light headedness; weight loss/loss of appetite; loss of hair on entire body	I am sure this is what helped me to have complete response; more and more research is showing weekly dose is the way to go; I did it because of side affects I had with AC; I still have back pain and numbness 3 months later but I show no cancer on my scans and path report	F	53	12  weeks	8/29/2009Email
4	AC for stage 3c BC, reduce tumors	Fatigue, incontinence, more hair loss, low BP, not too bad. Intermittant bone discomfort,	AC reduced BC stage IIIc from 4 cm to 1 1/2 cm. Still not small enough for surgery. Will be 11 more weekly infusions as I seem to respond well to chemo. Am getting benedryl to reduce side effects. I can tough it out! AC was bad, yet I survived that. Am taking probiotics, antioxidents, calorie counting, metamucil, etc. Keep the body alkaline and healthy so the chemo can do its job. Nausea was associated with low blood sugar. Don't listen to horror stories, a positive attitude makes an alkaline body. I know its going to get worse but I have faith in my oncologist. She'll get me through it.	F	73	5  days	8/21/2009

5	Stg.4 OvarianCancerPrognosis 2 mos.	Tired, weak.#10 pain @times in feet and legs.It has been 16yrs. this June and is difficult to remember everything about the treatments. But I have SUFFERED incredible pain since then. Every hair on my body was lost during treatment but came back.That was nothing compared to this last 16 yrs. I would take it again because it helped save my life. I have memory loss and difficulty concentrating. Just something else to work on. LOL.	Thanks to my Dr for putting me on anti-depressants. That in itself helped so much. Knowing that I am mind, spirit and body I went to work on all three. I "raged against the dying of the light", that ol' cancer. I suffer daily but would have missed so very much. Peripheral neuropathy and shortly after I completed the Taxol and Cysplatin I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.Some folks think I'm lying about having Ovarian C.especially metastasis but I have the papers to prove it. First I had to decide whether I REALLY wanted to live. Then I started kicking butt My story is too long to tell now but I'm still amazed that the bark of the Yew tree helped save my life. After 3 rounds we did another CT scan and the mass of 3 tumors in my pelvic area the size of grapefruit were gone. Still had many small tumors "lining the wall of my abdominal region." They had to put me in intensive care to administer it every 21 days because it was so strong. I was diagnosed June 1, 1993. I'm still here.The staph in my port. almost took me out! Sometimes when it gets so bad you just gotta laugh..it helps.	F	65	9  months	6/22/2009Email

So far my only side effects are some fatigue after the decadron steroid wears off, and a little stomach acid so I avoid spicy foods.  No hair loss yet, although I'm expecting it.  No neuropathy or joint pain as others have described.  No other side effects. I was on AC for four cycles before and it was horrible.  Compared to that, this is a walk in the park!

1	Breast Cancer	I had a stage 2b breast cancer. Taxol resulted in an 8cm abscess in my lung.  I had anemia.  It was discussed on my second treatment if I should have a blood transfusion, and not have the second treatment at that time.  I was given an injection of medication that was supposed to increase my red blood cells, and then given a taxol treatment directly after given the. I believe that  this treatment resulted in the lung infection, for I had a low grade fever for several days following this treatment.  Despite, complaints about feeling ill, treatments continued.  Throughout the treatments I was developing pain in my feet and hands. I was told to take large quantities of vitamin B, which I tried. I developed peripheral neuropathy that continues  to the present, 5 years after treatment ended.  In fact, over time it got worse until finally I couldn't walk. I was told it wouldn't last but tests show I have no reflexes from my knees down.  I finally was given neurontin, by a physiatrist, which w	I think if I had a stage 4 breast cancer, I wouldn't be as angry about the resultant deterioration in my quality of life, and would have seen it as it as saving my life (many people have said "well it saved your life").  I know there were other ways to go, with regard to chemotherapy, which I only found out after the fact. I don't believe it was necessary for the stage of cancer I had, but would definitely not have felt that with a stage 4 cancer. I checked off dissatisfied but that was with regard to having a stage 2b breast cancer. I do understand that not everyone has these side effects, but for whatever reason I do, and thus the anger and frustration.	F	62	2  months	6/6/2009Email
4	Metastatic Breast Cancer	Severe itching sometimes, fingertips norm, fatigue, depression, digestion problem, severe gum sores and teeth sensitivity-can't chew my food and have to eat soups. I wish chemo drugs would target only the cancer cells and leave the normal immune cells alone. I can't believe with all the technology out there, the research and drug companies can tell the difference between cancer and non cancer cells and still can't treat only the cancer cells.	I don't know what the deal is, but there's got to be a better way. This is just too much sufferings from side effects and sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. I have been told I have to be be on chemo for ever but I still hope not, and hope for the day they will announce a chemo that targets cancer cells and short on side effects. The taxol is helping to reduce the tumor count and skin lesions, I just wish the side effects are not affecting the quality of life as much as it is	F	51	4  months	4/23/2009

First I have a very intense astanga yoga practice helping to keep the numbess at bay and keeping my mind focused both inward and outward because of the asanas, breathing and inward focus.  Second, I have a husband who is determined to keep me alive, and groown loving children.  Third I team-teach in a high school theater arts program.  Every day the kids inspire me to work and forget about myself.  I also have friends who understand and love me.  Taxol is a challenege and I wish I were not taking it.  Yet I am vitally alive even on the many moments when I bemoan my "FATE."  The other day I saw a ten-year-old boy using a walker to get to his seat with family at a restaurant.  He had a sparkling Cheshire-cat grin with no attached cyniscm.  I can stand on my hands and do a drop backbend, thanks to a wonderful and patient teacher.

5	Stage 1 Uterine cancer	Hair Loss / temporary very mild neuropathy	I began Taxol on a weekly basis (3 weeks on 1 week off) in Nov. 2008. Due to thinning I finally cut off my hair the middle of Jan. 2009 and went to a wig.  I have not had any of the normal side effects - no nausea, fatigue, body aches. I work 32+ hrs. a week (75% on my feet)and have not missed a day of work. I take myself to and from treatments.  My treatment effectiveness is being monitored by CT scans and CA125 blood tests for tumor markers.  Both show my tumors are rapidly shrinking. I was determined not to let Taxol get the better of me.

3	stage 1 breast cancer	I got taxol weekly, and this reduced some of the side effects but I have nothing to compare it to in order to say "yes weekly is better". I would start feeling sick the day after i got it, and this sick feeling would last about 5 days, and then I would recover day 6 and 7, and then it was time for the next dose.I got severe fatigue that felt like a horrible flu, very serious weakness, digestion problems, acid reflux, diarrhea, lost menstrual cycles after 4 weeks, some mild tinging in toes and hands. Some itching. At the end, serious muscle and joint stiffness - that felt weird and annoying. A lot of taste distortion and lack of appetite sometimes. The very last two weeks, I also got nauseous, but did not take medication for this because of side FX... though later tried ativan and this worked. I also had a few nails that became loose on toes and fingers; one toenail turned purple. Red counts down but not white count.Hair loss and some body hair loss (legs) of course an	I am about 4 months passed Taxol. It took me 2 full weeks to feel ... well, i cannot say better, but I would say "not sick", but there were other side effects that lingered until now -- fatigue being the worst one. the mild neuropathy only lasted a few weeks after completion but it showed up again in tiny spurts later - dr said this is part of the healing, and now I am OK in the respect. I still have acid reflux but this could be due to the herceptin that i still take. I also still had joint stiffness though it is improving. But this does not stop me from working out, i just feel creaky and stiff.*I got acupuncture every week during treatment and still get it*, and this has been proven to improve immune system and neuropathy. This could be why i did well in this respect.All in all, taxol felt like a very strange and awful virus.

5	Stage IIIb ovarian cancer	I began taxol and carboplatin following my surgeries, partial hysterectomy when cancer was found, then removal of my ovaries (both cancerous), debulking of largest tumors in the abdominal/chest cavity, and staging 3 weeks following my initial surgery.I took 6 treatments of taxol and carboplatin, I think every 5-6 weeks, and was in remission on PET scan upon completion of treatments.I did have problems with decreased white cells and had injections daily for 5-7 days following chemo to boost my white cells (which added more extreme bone pain).I took scheduled doses of Phenergan for 3-4 days following treatments to control nausea.I had flushed face, shoulders, and chest on the second day of treatment (which I was told was a side effect of the steroids given with treatment to prevent side effects of the chemo).On day 2 following the chemo I had severe bone and muscle pains and learned to take scheduled doses of Lortab the day of treatment for 3-4 days to keep pain under control.About 4 day	Started just taxol 2 months later.The day of my 3rd treatment they discovered my heart rate was 144, treatments were stopped.I went through an extensive cardiac workup.Question if chemo caused the problem,I had never had trouble before.Treatments were resumed.I have now had 9 treatments/3 more to go.CA125 levels are 5-6.Have had no problems with low white cells just on taxol.Treatments 8&9 I have noticed worse side effects for longer period of time with bone, muscle, nerve pain.Also have extreme pain both knees,trouble walking after sitting for a prolonged period of time.Walking does seem to ease these problems but I still move slowly.I was a very on-the-go,energetic person before all this.My energy level is now zero.I find it difficult to accomplish half of what I used to.I work 37 hrs. a week, barely get through it & and take care of my pets.Have had a 50+ lb wt gain from the steroids with treatments,fluid retention.Have bouts of depression, back pain (have DJD but back pain	F	54	15  months	11/10/2008

All food tastes bitter. I'm scared this will last or get worse for the remainder of treatment. Dr's please consider the efficacy of these drugs as opposed to long term side effects.

5	Metastatic Bladder Cancer	Following my diagnosis of metastatic bladder cancer to the bone of my neck and spine I was put on unlimited morphine & cycplatin & Gemzar.  Lasted only one cycle on regime, Scans showed the cancer was progressing with treatment. Went on a 9 day bucket list cruise.  Was put on Taxol & Gemzar.  After the first treatment spent day 2 post treatment in bed with chills, fever & fatique.  By day 5 fatique subsided.  I am now 2-1/2 months into treatment.  Side effects are predictable.  Day 2,3,4 post treatment some fatique, loss of hair, including nasal lining, I always had osteoarthritis so I can not attribute joint & muscle pain to taxol.   Taxol was prescibed as pallative, but I now am almost normal, scan show the cancer has stopped progressing and bone mass in regenerating.	The results of Taxol have been nothing short of miraculous.  Prior to treatment I required vicodin every three hours, I have reduced my pain medication to every 6 hours and often forget to take the drugs.  Prior to Taxol I could not stand or sit erect for more than 15-20 minutes due to pain in neck and spine.  I am now remodeling my home, washing cars and driving again.

Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds.

4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email
1	depression/anxiety	severe muscle weakness, tremors that have yet to stop 2 months in, not sleeping, pacing		M	44	5  days5mg 1X D	9/19/2011
1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email
1	depression	i would studder sweat like crazy eye twitching hyperactive cry for no reason heart pounding out my chest really high blood pressure pass out from panic attacks insomia talk really fast umm flame up inside theres more thid pill sucks i thought i was going to die		M	31	 30mg 1X D	8/25/2011Email
5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
