4	rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis	Very dry skin. Good moisturizer solved that problem.	My worst trigger is heat. If I just remember to apply it twice a day (only during the summer) the redness is completely controlled. During the winter once a day is enough.	F	54	3  years 2X D	7/17/2010
3	BV	I saw that everyone had the clumpy disscharge that I also had. I talk to my dr and I said "was it supposed to make me itchy?" the first the she asked was "did you have white clumpy disscharge" i replied "yes" and she so ohh if you had that clumpy disscharge then you didnt have BV you actually had a yeast infection. so all of you guys were prob prescribed the wrong treatment.	it made me itchy and I had white clumpy discharge.

2	facial rosacea	Dry skin and my eyes have puffy bags underneath them. I look like I've been on a bender! Skin feels like plastic. Rash still present, unchanged.	My dermatologist "thinks" I have Rosacea so she prescribed this, but I'm not really sure what I have. About 2 months ago, I just started having red raised bumps on forehead and scattered on cheeks, a few on chin. It is NOT acne since I have had acne when I was younger and this has no resemblance to it. It also itches slightly. I'm feeling very helpless.By the way, posts here should only be for the topical gel. NOT any other form!	F	67	3  daysgel 1% 1X D	4/27/2010Email
3	rosacea	Metrogel VAGINAL reviews should NOT be posted here and should be ignored because this is NOT the site for Metrogel VAGINAL.	Metrogel is applied to the face to control redness.  Metrogel VAGINAL is inserted into the vagina.  Do NOT confuse the two.  This is the site for Metrogel.  This is NOT the site for Metrogel VAGINAL.	F	63	1  years 1X D	4/7/2010
1	supposed BV	Immediately felt like I'd been poisoned and felt very weird, out-of-it, almost out-of-body feeling; developed peripheral neuropathy within just hours from elbows to tips of fingers and from knees down to toes.		F	27	1  days 1X D	4/6/2010
5	moderate acne/very mild rosacea	None	I think some reviewers must be confusing this with a different forumulation of Metrogel. My review is for the topical formula. I used it on my face 2 x's per day at my OB's suggestion due to jawline/cheek acne and mild redness in my t-zone.  I noticed better results with this than with Obagi Nuderm/Tretinion. I could tell within a few days that it was working. If you look on the product website you will find a very good coupon for the product!	F	26	2  weeks	11/24/2009
4	Perioral Dermatitis, Rosacea	Some increased redness on my cheeks, decreased redness around my nose/lips	Made my rosacea (on my cheeks) much worse, yet made my perioral derm (around my nose, under my lips/on my chin) much better.  I saw some improvement, though not tons, with the metrogel alone. Same with an oral AB-some progress but not tons. However in combination with the oral AB the perioral derm has almost completely resolved itself.	F	26	6  months	11/1/2009
4	Rosacea	Slightly dry skin, nothing terrible	Used twice per day.  Significantly reduced overall inflammation and redness.  Unfortunately, recent work stress caused a flair up that Metrogel was not enough to overcome.	F	40	9  months	10/23/2009
5	BV	No side effects. I actually drank while using it and had no side effects. If you take the Oral medication you will be VERY ILL. Don't even have a sip of alcohol.	I think I took used the gel once a day for 7 days. It was awhile ago so I don't really remember but let me tell you its a miracle! I was so embarressed. I asked a good friend thats a doctor about what i should do and he recommended it. So thankful.	F	26	 	4/13/2009
5	Rosacea	None	I have taken it twice a day for about 3 years. It solved my long standing Rosacea problem with no ill effects.	M	80	3  years	10/17/2008
5	acne	I have not had any side effects so far! Take note that several of the people rating on here are NOT reviewing the topical acne rosacea drug METROGEL, but it sounds like its oral antibiotic/anti-fungal form used for other conditions.  They are clearly in the WRONG place for review.	Derms have only dx'd me with acne (NOT rosacea), but a new derm prescribed this after I was unable to continue using Finacea (which worked well, but which caused a severe flare-up of my formerly controlled asthma in less than one month).  He said Metrogel works similarly to Finacea.  I also take 50 mg of spiro a day and use topical Benzamycin and Klaron at night on my skin, but the addition of Metrogel in the morning has been really excellent.  In only a few weeks, my skin has become sooo much smoother and regained the "bright" look of normal female facial skin.  I am really happy; it has worked symbiotically very well with my other derm meds to make my skin much better!	F	31	4  weeks	10/10/2008
1		headaches, naseua, vomting, a really bad taste in my mouth. I just felt really crappy and drained all the time even after i stopped taking the meds.	these meds worked really good but the side effects are too hard to deal with. they needs to make another type of med without all the horrible side effects b/c i couldnt even finsh all of the medicene i only got to three days and i was directed to take if for seven. and even after i stopped the side effects kept occuring DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE!!!!	F	20	3  days	3/12/2008
2	acne roseacea	No side-effects. No benefits, either.	I may as well have been putting KY Jelly on my face. I had no side-effects, but I also noticed no change whatsoever. I would still recommend TRYING it, because it may work for you... but it did absolutely nothing for me, good or bad.	M	35	6  months	7/10/2007Email
2	perioral dermatitis	Extreme dryness (sometimes to the point of the skin cracking and bleeding), scaling, slight itch	I was prescribed Metrogel for perioral dermatitis and it didn't do squat!  My skin was still red, scaly, and bumpy around my nose, mouth, and chin; the Metrogel just added extreme dryness to the mix.  Metrogel made my skin so dry it would crack and bleed - not a very pleasant thing for a young woman to have on her face!  When I told my doctor the gel wasn't working, she prescribed me an oral antibiotic.  My skin looks a lot better, but I feel like a zombie.  I guess I would rather have a rash than be in a constant stupor...	F	22	2  weeks	11/2/2006
1	acne rosacea	alcohol intolerance	My dermatologist prescribed Metrogel for acne rosecea on my nose. It works, but for months I had to give up my habit of a beer or two with dinner because even a single beer caused rapid hearbeat, flushing, insomnia, and the next day it felt like I'd had 6 beers instead of 1. In the Metrogel product literature there was no mention of adverse reaction to alcohol, but I finally figured it out myself by researching the side effects of oral Metronidazole.  When I stopped using Metrogel, the alcohol intolerance went away.  Even if you don't drink, you have to wonder how good it is to have low levels of this antibiotic constantly in your bloodstream.  Another case of drug companies downplaying side effects, I think.	M	48	2  years	9/13/2006
1	rosacea	none - yet	metronidazole causes cancer in mice and rats but not hamsters according to the package insert.  I'd rather have rosacea than cancer.	F	36	5  days	3/22/2006
2	Bacterial Vaginosis	It has been horrible. A Yeast Infection. Mild abdominal cramps, just feeling crappy. Cottage Cheese like discharge, yellowish white.		F	40	7  days	2/6/2006
1	BV during pregnancy	Cramping for a whole day, which caused  a lot of anxiety, as I'm 5 months pregnant- my ob/gyn decided to take me off the medication after one dose as a result. She found cottage cheese-like discharge already after one day- she thought it was candida, which I did not have the day before when she examined me. I also have developed very dry and tingly lips and cracks in the corner of my mouth.	It's poison in my opinion. I would never take this again. I'm just grateful my baby appears to be OK.	F	42	1  days	9/21/2005
5	rosacea	none so far	works pretty good. a lot of the redness is barely visible after 1 or 2 application	M	36	3  days	7/16/2005
1	Rosacea	Very intense numbing and tingling in the upper legs		F	44	6  days	4/29/2005
