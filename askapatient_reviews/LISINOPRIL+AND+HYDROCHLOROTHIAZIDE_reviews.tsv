1	HBP	At first I just started to feel weak. As the week progressed I continued to get weaker. I finally called in sick and decided to take my blood pressure. It was 87/54. Called the Dr office and they had me stop it. Changed med and so far no problems. It was a scary week though. I didn't realize it was the med since I'd taken plain lisinipril with no problems. The med they changed me too still has  HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE but I'm doing fine.			59	7  days10 mg 1X D	8/30/2011
1	Hypertension	After six months of good effects, I had my gall bladder removed.  Within a week, I had tremendous swelling of my lips, toungue, genetals and hives.  My latest lip swelling occured after stopping for 23 days.		M	56	6  months10 1X D	8/14/2011Email
2	High blood pressure	I have been on Lisinopril 20mg for years. Two weeks ago I experienced very high b/p, so my doctor put me on the Lisinopril with diuretic and I have been having severe cramps in my hands and legs, insomnia, very dry mouth.	I had no side effects with regular Lisinopril. I called my doctor regarding the side effects, namely muscle cramping. I don't know what she will put me on. I don't know if I stay on it whether the muscle cramping will go away.	F	53	1  weeks20mg 1X D	6/13/2011
2	High Blood Pressure	Frequent urination, impotence and higher blood pressure.	I just didn't feel well on this drug combination.	M	59	5  days20 mg 1X D	3/8/2011
1	"high" BP	Horrifying heartburn, odd tightness in chest, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, thorough exhaustion, mood swings, and general malaise.	Lifestyle changes and natural therapies work so much better for blood pressure control.  Of course Doctors can't make any money that way, so most won't tell you that.  Drugs that artificially lower blood pressure just mask the symptoms, while doing nothing for the underlying problem.  There is some benefit to that, but many blood pressure drugs are known to cause cancer, diabetes, and other nightmarish ailments.	M	34	1  years20 mg 1X D	9/12/2010
1	protect kidneys	tickle in throught, severe dry cough; extreme lightheadedness and dizzy - to point of blacking out - when standing up.  Dr. took me off at day 21, telling me to list it as allergic reaction.		M	70	21  days5 mg 1X D	8/6/2010
3	High Blood Pressure	I don't mean to sound crass but for the entire time, I have had bowel problems.  It is like peeing out my butt.  I also experienced depression and extreme indigestion.  I have had acid problems for the first time in years. I have experienced exteme lethargy and massive leg cramps.	It did help lower my blood pressure...but the fatigue, the indigestion, the bowel problems, the depression have been just too much for me.  I am trying to wean myself off now.  I also took extra potassium to try and ward off the leg cramps.	F	57	6  months20/12.5 MG 2X D	5/6/2010
