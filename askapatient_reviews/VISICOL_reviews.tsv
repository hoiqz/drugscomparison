1	Prep for colonoscopy	Warning! It nearly killed me. I'm a healthy 52 yr old woman. I was sitting down and A few minutes after taking the 20th pill, I told my husband I didn't feel very good, and lost consciousness. I tried to stand up and I passed out again. He called the paramedics. They sat me in a chair, then I heard them say "We are losing her" next thing I know I was in the hospital.  After 7 bags of IV fluids, potassium pills and 4 days in the hospital, my potassium and heart rate came back. This was two weeks ago, and I still don't feel well. Avoid this medication. Very dangerous. It was very difficult to find a pharmacy to fill this bad medicine. Not many carry it. No one I know has used this method. Now I know why. I wish I would have been warned. I hope no one else has to go through what I did.	Visicol tablets are dangerous to your health.	M	52	1  days	10/9/2007Email

It's a lot of pills to take, but they were no larger than my Vitamin C tablet I take daily, so not hard to swallow.  I started getting results 45 minutes after taking the first pills, and it lasted for several hours afterward - around 5 hours from start to when I stopped getting the urge to have a BM.  My procedure was scheduled for the afternoon, so I did the first round at 5pm the night before, then started up the second round at 5am the next morning.  I didn't feel dehydrated at all afterward.  This drug can also put a heavy load on your kidneys, so I continued drinking fluids for the entire 5 hours to insure there would be some extra fluids available for my kidneys.  Most of what you drink with the prep is sucked out by your colon, so I feel it's important to	F	43	2  days	12/2/2005
