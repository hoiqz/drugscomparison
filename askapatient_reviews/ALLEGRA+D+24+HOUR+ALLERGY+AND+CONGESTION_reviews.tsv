4	Seasonal Allergies	Weird dreams	, yep you heard it right. Last year I took allegra and I didn't have any side effects and it worked great! This year I took zyrtec for a while and then realized I had stopped taking it last year because it didn't work. I took Zyrtec from age 6-13 from serum, to pill, when it was prescription to over the counter pills and it started to lose lots of the effect it used to have. I then started taking allegra and it was a miracle to me. My allergies were the best they had been since I'd really developed them. Started taking Zyrtec this year then discovered it didn't work so I took an emergency run to wal-mart last night to pick up some allegra and took it last night. last night's dream was fine, in fact I didn't even have one but i took a nap at around 11-11:30ish and slept very very lightly and had a strange dream that I almost controlled but was twisted a bit by my brain. it was rather odd as the subject changed many times, and I was insane in pretty much all of it. it was actually rather entertaining and I'll have a great load of fun telliing it to my friends lol. this isn't really a bothering side effect for me but some may have nightmares rather than just strange dreams, which may be disruptive or disturbing.

5	seasonal allergies	Absolutely no side effects that I am aware of	I used to get shots,then eventually allegra twice daily and finally Allegra D 24 hrs.When I think ,how I used to suffer with the itchy eyes,headaches,running nose,even while sleeping...I have been thrilled with this medication !!If the spring season is worse on rare occasion days ,I take 1/2 of a 25mg Benadryl tablet, with good results.So glad it is an OTC med now, as it is less expensive for me,and I can buy it ahead of time during sales and using coupons. I recommend it!     Patti	F	55	12  years80 1X D	3/25/2012
3	Severe year round allergies	insomnia, loss of appetite, some dry mouth/dehydration, feel little nauseous/lethargic for a short bit right after taking.	Been taking for 2 or 3 years and it sorta takes the edge off for me. I still have pressure in my head and bad nasal drainage. However, it keeps my eyes from itching and my mouth/lips from breaking out and itching.	F	19	2  years 2X D	9/20/2011Email
4	Spring-time allergies	Insomnia, erection/ejaculation diffculties, dizziness/vertigo,jitters.	Almost mpossible to sleep or ejaculate, but better than my spring tree and grass allergies.   This is the only medication that works for me.Allegra-D 12 hour, twice daily.	M	31	3  weeks 2X D	5/27/2011
1	alergies	Still experienced seasonal alergies.	No luck for use. I took it when it first came out. I miss the drug Seldane that it replaced.	F	30	2  years 1X D	5/16/2011Email
3	Allergies	Drowsiness. Dry mouth.	I have no official complaints about Allegra D. I was taking it when you still need a prescription and the only problem I had was that the pill was giant!  It also gives you dry mouth and makes you somewhat drowsy. Other than that, it works fine.	F	24	1  weeks240MG 1X D	5/15/2011Email
4	severe allergies	dry mouth, slight decrease in appetite, insomnia (maybe caused by allegra.. not consistent enough to be sure), feeling of dehydration in general (my skin is extra dry, my nose gets really crusty (sorry its gross, but true), feeling kinda "drugged" (like a little out of it, but not too severely. I can still drive and function normally, but I feel a little foggy).	The side effects I described seem really bad, but my allergies are worse. The side effects I listed are not bad enough (for me) to stop using this medication.	F	22	2  years180/240 mg 1X AN	4/25/2011Email
1		insomnia, dry eyes, heart palpatations, anxiety	generally have no problem sleeping, but when I took this drug I was up all night but still tired and could not calm down and go to sleep. Didn't take it the next night and slept fine. Took it this morning instead and am up tonight and cannot sleep again. switching back to zyrtec	F	26	2  days 1X D	4/2/2011Email

1	allergies and congestion	Allergra D changed my menstrual cycles. My periods were only 2-3 days long for most of my adult life. I was in my late 30's when I started taking it. I thought I might be in perimenapause. Over the 4 years of my taking it my periods grew to be 8-10 days long: a bright cranberry-red color. I would even bleed when I wasn't on my period during sex. I was getting worried and I was about to have an endrometrial ablation. But, I happened across this site and found someone else had a similar experience. I stopped taking it right away and I had a normal - 3 day long menstruation the following month. I'm trying Claritin D now. I've heard it doesn't have this side effect.	I just found out the FDA approved of this med being offered OTC this month. If you know of anyone taking this and having this side effect please let them know.	M	42	4  years12 hr 1X D	2/5/2011Email
2	Allergies and congestion	Difficulty urinating, dry mouth, inreased heart rate, excessive sweating.	Didn't do too much for my allergies and side-effects outweighted benefits so I am tapering off this med.	F	55	1  years180-240 1X D	7/10/2010
4		only side effect is if i dont take it! then i go through a withdrawal like not having coffee...tired, headache...etc...but I can get through it using the 12 hour just once then veramyst and then using just the veramyst...		F	40	2  years150 1X D	6/16/2010
