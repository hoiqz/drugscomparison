1	Flu like symptoms	Flushing, anxious, palpitations, strong headache and eventually vomiting.  I had the flu for 4 days before I took the Mucinex and had none of these symptoms before taking it.  All symptoms would go away in about 5-6 hrs after taking a dose but kept reappearing with the next dose.  Not recommended.		F	56	2  days200 MG 2X D	4/7/2013Email

5	chest congestion	no side effects	i usually take 2 600 mg of regular mucinex before going to bed and usually after i wake up. it helps out a great deal. i also sneak in a children's mini-melts cough also. mucinex works so well!	F	19	4  days600 mg 2X D	1/19/2011Email
5	flu/pneumonia	No side effects	This stuff works well... Coughing is key to getting the infection out of your system and this stuff really helped me have a more productive cough.	F	29	3  weeks1 1X D	1/5/2011
1	Cold and Congestion	Broke out in hives from mucinex at this high dose. I can take Robitussin DM at the lower dose, but not the 12 hour Mucinex. Stopped immediately.	The dose in Mucinex 12 hour is quite a bit higher than Robitussin and such. So beware.	F	38	2  days12Hour 2X D	12/20/2010
5	asthma congestion	None that I know of.	I take the generic form but it is Guaifenisen the same as the brand name. Took the liquid for years, but it tastes bad, so the blue pills are better.Helps to thin my cottony mucus that comes with asthma. Seems very safe and very helpful	M	53	3  years400 mg 4X D	12/7/2010
4	Chronic sinus and ear problems	No serious noticeable side effects. It has a bad taste that can linger but I've not had any other side effects.	Mucinex has been great helping to keep my sinuses from acting up. My dr recommended it because I was so backed up my ears got clogged (this has happened numerous times). This product helps keep me fairly clear and keeps the pressure headaches to a minimum. My dr has told me to keep using it.	F	31	4  months1200mg 2X D	10/9/2010
5	chest congestion/allergies	No side effects.	I also take the children's mucinex mini-melts.  That's plenty for me.  Cleared my chest up.	F	23	2  days200 MG 2X D	8/31/2010

5	Congestion	Dry mouth and dull taste the next morning.	I took the children's fizz packets...tasty as well as effective.The packaging is correct...it'll really clean you out! Was up half the night coughing up mucous.	M	38	1  times	1/11/2010Email
4	Sinus problems	The D version makes me jittery and dizzy, so I take the regular one, which has no side effects.	Works good.	F	19	 	11/28/2009
