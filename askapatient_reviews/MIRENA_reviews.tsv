4	birth control/heavy periods	I'm on my second mirena coil.  I have no periods at all for around 5 years which is great.  I noticed since I had the coil changed for a new one a year ago that I am getting a lot more spots. Almost one every day,  sometimes quite big and lots of small ones under the skin.  I've also noticed excess bodyhair on my belly and a ccouple of patches on my upper back near my shoulders. I seem to have extra hair on my chin too that needs removing weekly.  However,  I have had no issues with feeling depressed or down so for me,  compared with other contraception,  it works and the side effects can be controlled with some extra time invested in personal grooming.

2	Birth control	pelvic/back cramps, shooting pain in ovary area, breakthrough bleeding lasting 1 month, blood clots,  leg pain, numbness/tingling hands & fingers, breast tenderness, blurry vision, foggy, unable to concentrate, constant tiredness, absolutely no sex drive.

3	Birth Control	Hot flashes, acne	I had my mirena placed almost 5 years ago, at first I loved it and didn't notice any side effects.  But then about 8 months later I started getting hot flashes that I have never gotten before, one minute I will be sweating then the next I will be freezing!   In the past years I have also began getting pimples on my forehead and chin, I am 34 years old and never in my life have I gotten pimples, not even in my teen years so I am blaming it on Mirena!  I can't stand having hot flashes so I will be switching my birth control when it is due, at the end of next month.  What I do like about this is the convenience of it, you only have to have it inserted once and you are good to go for 5 years.  I am one who can not take pills because I ALWAYS forget so this was so simple for me!   Also my period is almost non-existent, which I LOVE!   I just can't handle the zits and hot flashes no longer, time to move on.	F	34	5  years 1X O	4/3/2013
5	Birth Control	None that I've noticed.	I currently have very short light periods now thanks to Mirena. I absolutely love it and am looking forward to exchanging it for a new one next year.	F	33	4  years 1X O	3/28/2013
3	Prevent Pregancy	I have been gaining 6-8 pounds a month, with no periods. The first year and half no weight gain or hardly any. Also, have back pain.		F	31	2.5  years 1X D	3/21/2013
2	endometriosis, birth control	breast PAIN, fatigue, constant cramping in back, spotting, breakthrough bleeding, pain on insertion	I had severe pain when mirena was inserted (I haven't had kids). Procedure was very quick. I did cramp for 1-2 days after insertion. About a week after insertion I started feeling very fatigued, my breasts hurt constantly and I had spotting. I have now been bleeding for 14 days. This has made my endo pain worse. I am sensitive to ALL hormones and even though this is not systemic it still affected me like all other hormones. I am having it removed in a week and getting the paragard.	F	24	90  days 1X O	3/11/2013Email
1	contraception	Hair falling out, tender breasts, nausea, irregular bleeding, felt pregnant every few months, constant bacteria infections		F	26	1  years	2/10/2013
1	Contraceptive	I've waited a long time and did not want to solely blame the IUD, but after 2+ years, I know that my life has not been the same.  With Mirena, I have experienced: weight gain (40 pounds in 2.6 years), heavy mood swings, increased acne, hair growth on lip and chin, increased back pain, and frequent feelings of complete exhaustion and/or depression.  This device really messes with your hormone balance, I wouldn't recommend it.		F	29	2.6  years 1X D	1/23/2013
1	Contraceptive	Weight gain, acne, oily skin, no libido, CONSTANT yeast infections, hair growth	Awful awful BC. I gained 15 pounds in 3 months, no amount of exercise wold get rid of it. My face was so oily I could fry an egg on it in the sun. With the oil came awful acne which I'm still struggling to get rid of. (I have never had acne in my life) I had no libido and a yeast infection every month. I also started growing hair on my neck. I felt awful and was constantly in a bad mood. I took it out and feel much better except for the struggle to eliminate the pimples.	F	24	9  months 1X O	1/21/2013
2	birth control	i have used this method of contraception twice in between pregnancies. no major problems first time round and stayed on it for 5 years,only had it removed as severe back pain which immediately went after coil removed. different story second time round,had 6 months of heavy bleeding and initially lost alot of weight. after this time my periods completely stopped,gained all the weight i lost plus more and was constantly bloated,had severe headaches which again went as soon as removed. came off after a year and lost all the weight i put on following a healthy eating plan combined with exercise,no more headaches and bloated belly...would not use again as second time round horrendous.

4	Birth control.	After the ridiculously heavy cramping initially (I thought I was going into labor again), I didn't have a single side effect or even notice I was on it. After about 2 years, my breasts started to become sore. I took a pregnancy test and it was negative so that was not a factor. Over the last few months the pain has gotten worse and I am scheduled to discuss this with my OB and possibly  have it removed and go back on the pill.		F	29	29  months 1X D	12/13/2012Email
3	Contraceptive	Just came off like 3 days ago ( already got my period )  I came off because of excess chin acne which I never had before, and now it's getting out of control and excess hair growth on chin, upper lip and arms, it's like I'm  turning into a man, so I decided To take it out and see if the mirena is responsible for these side effects, have gain some weight but I think it's just me being lazy , but other than this very convenient, the placement was good, a little cramping after placement but just one day, light periods , not bad		F	25	2  years	12/12/2012
1	Birth Control	Weight gain, hair loss, breasts leaking, breast pain (not tenderness- PAIN- scale of 8/10), fatigue, periods are crazy (on and off), cramping, false pregnancy symptoms, etc.	I know people that loved Mirena. I am not one of those. Since it was put in I have been miserable. I have given it a good 10 months and it is not working and will be taken out ASAP. The doctor is testing me for both prolactinoma and breast cancer. It's crazy.	F	31	10  months 1X D	12/6/2012Email

4	birth control	I love Mirena-haven't really had problems. I may have had weight gain but I cant be for sure if it's Mirena or another problem.	Love it-no periods! No pills to take!	F	36	3  years 1X D	11/3/2012Email
1	Heavy cycles and contraception	Bloated(think 4-5 month pregnant size)AcneLight but long lasting cycles currently nearly 4 weeksMood swings (so I'm told)Always tired I thought it was my thyroid problem realising its now probably mirena Have doc app next week think I'll have them remove it i would rather not be able to leave house for 3 days a month than feel like this :(		F	31	1  years	8/30/2012
1	heavy periods	Diagnosed with Pelvic Inflammatory Disease about one week after insertion. Had 9 cm abdominal abcess that had to be drained. 1% risk of this occuring per product warnings. Five days in hospital, delerious with fever, on IV antibiotics. Eventually (about seven months later) the infection colonized in my fallopian tube and I had to have a hysterectomy to get rid of the infection, which was cultured and identified as e-coli.	I had one mirena for five years with zero side effects. The second mirena caused the infection.	F	49	  1X D	8/14/2012
5	contraceptive	NONE	Best thing I ever did. No complaints about Mirena! Will always have one in.	F	35	5  years 1X D	8/9/2012Email
1	birth control	Hip pain, nausea, diagnosed with Avascular Necrosis which resulted in a hip replacement. Became ANA positive (indicating an autoimmune issue) with elevated ESR levels. I was perfectly healthy before Mirena insertion. Research Mirena and autoimmunity and Mirena and joint pain. You may have no negative side effects, but dont take the chance ladies. I spent half of this year in a wheelchair and had to learn to walk again!!		F	33	7  months	6/24/2012
3	Heavy periods	50 pound weight gain! Mood swings, low back pain, hairloss, breast tenderness, fatigue.	I got the Mirena inserted for heavy bleeding. For the last year I didnt link all my symptoms to this IUD. I also suffer from depression and Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. After doing research online I am convinced these symptoms are resulting from Mirena. The only good thing is is that I stopped bleeding shortly after it was placed. I am stuck with a difficult decision as I cannot take other forms of birth control due to blood clots. Though it helped me stop bleeding I would not recommend Mirena.

1	Heavy bleeding	Heavy bleeding, strings not there and now doctor can't find coil.  Having x ray to try and find it experiencing labour pains, doubled over at times not recommend!		F	49	1  days	6/17/2012
1	Heavy Periods	Heavy bleeding for first 2 months. Daily spotting after the first 2 months. Thick yellow/brown discharge when not spotting. Horrible vaginal odor. Pain during sex. Bleeding after sex.	I would never recommended this to anyone.	F	35	7  months 1X D	6/5/2012
1	Birth Control	SEVERE joint pain, abdominal cramping & weight gain.	I had the Mirena placed 7 weeks after the birth of my first child. When I had it placed I was at 148 pounds, but 6 months later I am at 162 pounds. I have made nothing but positive changes in my diet and walk 4 miles, 5 days a week, but my weight just keeps going up. I have also had severe joint pain in my knees and hips, which started after the Mirena insertion. I attributed the weight gain to pregnancy and the joint aches to the weight gain, but despite my healthy, active lifestyle I am still not not getting better, I am only getting worse. I am convinced the Mirena is causing these issues. It is the only explanation, all of my blood work came back fine.Out of desperation, I removed the Mirena yesterday... myself. Yes, the thought made my cringe, but a tiny little tug and there it was, in my hand. Hopefully I will soon start to feel normal again. Never again, will I look to hormonal birth control... never.

5	birth control, heavy periods	Uncomfortable insertion but only had mild cramps that were relieved by ibuprofen. Can't take hormonal birth control as I have epilepsy so this was really my only option. Luckily I have had a good experience so far. My periods are much lighter and less painful. The only side effect I have experienced is acne around my jaw and neck but I have always been prone to break outs any way. A small price to pay for no babies and lighter periods!

5	birth control	None i loved it! No periods no wieght gain no unplanned pregnancy  I really did love it		F	24	5  years 1X D	2/9/2012Email
4	prevent pregnancy		After reading the reviews, I decided that I should add my own. Most of the time women who have not had children would not be recommended for this birth control method. The insertion is painful, but if you have had a child vaginally, it is very little pain compared to child birth. I had bleeding after insertion, thankfully no infection!, and it was painful for a while during sex. However, the doctor did tell me to refrain from sex for about 2-3 weeks to help close the cervix again and heal a little. Also, what persisted the following months were sharp stabbing sensations after having an orgasm. This has gone away and I have enjoyed my mirena after those initial 2-3 months. I have had slightly increased acne on my face, but it could be due to a more stressful lifestyle right now. I have had it for a year and a half now and have stopped having periods as of the past few months.	F	22	  1X D	2/9/2012
5	birth control	I LOVE THIS THING!! After having 2 children from a bad relationship I decided I wanted more but not right away so I opted for this. I had it for 5 years never had an issue or medical problem related to it. I did get the usual cramping spotting and wires jabbing me when it was first inserted but never had an issue again. I never had a problem with my period it actually made it even more regular I got it the same day of the month every month. Here and there I wouldn't get a period for 3-6 months. My periods also were lighter, not crampy at all, and lasted about 3 days rarely 5. After 5 years I had it removed and my now husband and I decided to try for our first child together. The first 3 months we had no luck but the doctor said it takes about 3 months for it to fully leave your system. The fourth month again like clockwork we were pregnant. I now have a beautiful healthy happy baby boy that's 7 weeks old. This is an awesome birth control. I had taken 5-6 different oral contraceptives a	Make sure your doctor is familiar with it. Has experience placing it and stick to your follow up appointments.	F	31	5  years 1X O	2/6/2012Email
1	Heavy, painful periods	DO NOT GET A MIRENA! Swollen stomach; gained 11kg in 9 weeks (due to hormonal changes); bruised bowel; irritable bladder; malodorous vaginal discharge; bled for the entire 9 weeks; depression; Sore breasts; back pain; ovarian cysts; cervicitis; ongoing cervical inflammation.	I had the Mirena put in under general anaesthetic and then removed 9 weeks later, due to severe side effects. It was the worst thing I have ever experienced. It did not stop or alleviate heavy bleeding. All it did was upset my entire system. 7 months on, I am still experiencing Cervicitis (requiring surgery), bladder problems and swelling in my pelvis.Whatever you do in life, DO NOT get a Mirena! Please do NOT!	F	37	9  weeks 1X D	2/3/2012Email
1	Heavy, painful periods	constant bleeding and pain for the entire 6 months after placement...EVERY DAY, for SIX MONTHS. Brain fog, blurred vision and pressure in my head, like it was going to explode. increased appitite and terrible nodular acne and pelvic cysts.  Depression, vaginal odor, and pain during intercourse. Chronic fatigue	To start with, the pain of insertion is ridiculous. By the time it was over, i could barely walk and i was so dizzy that i thought i was going to pass out. Then, for the entire 6 months that i've had it, i have experienced constant bleeding or spotting to the point that i have no idea when i'm having an actual period. The cramping is constant and the pain is far worse then before i had the IUD placed. Then there's the acne, or a better description might be, the HUGE, painful knots that keep developing on my face. Knots that my doctor keeps telling me are unrelated to the IUD, dispite the fact that I've never had acne before. Also i get the same painful cysts in my pelvic area as well. I'm exhausted ALL the time, no matter how much sleep i get. i've had issues with depression and anxiety for years but it's definitly gotten worse. Then there is the blurred, out of focus vision. To cap it all off, it's implanted inside me so i can't remove it myself and everytime i go in to have the doctor take it out, he tells me that i haven't had it long enough and that none of my symptoms are related to the device. mind you, all of the symptoms i'm experiencing are listed in the MIRENA paperwork he gave me. So he is basically refusing to remove it. Yeah, mental note, never start a medication that i can't stop at my own discretion.	F	35	5  months 1X O	1/10/2012Email
1	Birth control/DUB/Cramps	Dizzines,extreme periods,severe pain, irregular bleedings,vaginal odor,painful sex,hunger,weight gain,depression...etc	This WAS supposed to help, my ob gyn recommended it after my third prenancy...never again as soon as possible im getting it removed .

4	birth control	Acne	had light continous spotting for the first 3 months and then no period at all....it became displaced this week and am getting it taken out and am unsure about getting another or just going on the pill.  Beside the acne, yuck! on back shoulders, face, (have never had acne issues) it is totally fine and convenient. No loss of libido, want it all the time... lol.... i would recommend, just check your strings regularly.  :)	F	27	11  months 1X D	12/9/2011
4	Birth control, heavy/painful pds.	Pain during intercourse, no period	I love this form of birth control, and will be returning to it within the next month. I had to have it removed due to extreme pain during intercourse and inflamation, but it was much better than the cramps I am experiencing now on the pill. I would recommend Mirena to any woman!	F	27	4.5  years 1X D	11/12/2011Email
2	Birth Control	BV, and cramping.	I got this after suffering bad side effects from the patch. The good thing was the over 99% success rate at prevent pregnancy. My libido stayed the same after it was placed in. However, it did make sex uncomfortable. Also, I got an infection from it. I had it taken out this week. I am going to try the ring and see if it helps. A side note: If you have not had children, this will hurt when they insert it. Worse pain I have felt, and it had me rethinking what kind of drugs I will take when I do decide to have children.	F	26	2  months 1X O	11/11/2011Email
1	Birth Control	pelvic pain, heavy bleeding, two long periods a month, ovarian cysts, acne, vaginal odor, painful sex, loss of libido, mood swings, headaches, intense hunger	The last three months have been the worst three months of my life. My gyno recommended Mirena even though I have never been pregnant. The insertion was incredibly painful and within a week I was in the E.R. I've been to the E.R. two times since due to debilitating pain. The gyno's I've seen assured me the excessive bleeding would get better (which it did) but the other symptoms got worse. After reading the reviews on this website I had my gyno take it out. The moment it was out of me I felt normal again. The cramping stopped and within the next week all my negative symptoms disappeared. Mirena was awful.	F	25	3  months 1X D	10/7/2011EmailHistory
3	birth control	No period, cramping, irritability, spotting after insertion, extreme dizziness after insertion	This is a fantastic form of birth control, if it's inserted correctly, and you are one of the lucky people that does not have issues with it. Unfortunately mine was not inserted properly, and after a few months it had turned upside down and fallen partially into the cervix, therefore it did not protect against pregnancy. When it was first inserted I became extremely dizzy and had a bit of spotting for one day. It worked great for a few months, but then I started to have horrible cramps and pain in my cervix (because of what had happened). I will most likely be getting another one, hopefully inserted properly this time.	F	19	4  months 1X D	8/28/2011
1	Birth Control	Mainly Acne, weight gain, light break-through bleeding. PAIN when inserted	I hated the Mirena from day 1, because of the extreme pain I was in when they inserted it. My acne and weight gain have been HORRIBLE!!!! I would NEVER recommend this form of BC to anyone. I finally decided to just go through with permanent sterilization.	F	33	  1X D	8/25/2011Email

2	Endometrial hyperplasia	Constant vaginal discharge	Although it has had the desired affect as far as reversing the effects of endometrial hyperplasia i have had to put up with being constantly 'wet' down below it is really getting me down and if i dont wash at least 3 times a day it starts to smell :(	F	37	 coil 1X O	7/18/2011Email
1	contraceptive	CONSTANT menstruation	I suppose I was the unlucky one when I see all the women whose periods stopped completely with this medication. Shortly after placement, my periods increased in duration (10 days beginning to end... then 2 weeks... then 3 weeks..) then I experienced daily bleeding for the last 6 months. The aggravation (and cost, if you know what I mean) of daily menstruation drove me nuts. Don't know why it took my doctor so long to recommend taking it out. It's been out for 2 months now and my cycles are back to normal. It was sooooo NOT worth the convenience.		41	2  years 1X D	7/14/2011Email
5	birth control	When I had my first Mirena inserted 5+ yrs ago, I had a nonstop period for 90 days then...magic...no period for the remaining 4 yrs, 9 mths.  Just had it replaced for another 5 yrs and only had light spotting.	Love it!  Since I've never had kids, the initial insertion was extremely uncomfortable because I had to be dilated. It was worth the cramping and pain for 10 minutes while the MD inserted several rods into my cervix to make it open.  When I had the second Mirena inserted, no dilation was needed so it was a quick but still uncomfortable procedure. Again, I'll endure 10 minutes of discomfort for 5 yrs of birth control!

1	Birth control	Weight gain, acne, severe cramping	i liked that my periods were so light, but I have never had such frequent and horrible cramping...It would drop me to my knees.  Also, I gained 30 pounds in six months, even though my eating/exercise habits didn't change.  I went through tons of testing to figure out what was wrong, and then I thought maybe it's Mirena. After some research, I realize that I'm not alone in my symptoms, and I'm having it removed ASAP. I just need to find another form of birth control.	F	30	6  months 1X D	7/5/2011
5	Birth control alternate to the pill	Some minimum break through bleeding at very beginning months only. Otherwise nothing.	This is a terrific form of BC that should be considered far more often. Trouble free with the added bonus of no periods.	F	46	10  monthsNA 1X O	6/25/2011Email
3	Birth Control	Extreame Irritablility, Mood Swings (super mad followed by super sad), Irregular Periods (never know if PMS or crazy because of IUD), Absent Mindedness	After taking ortho tri cyclin lo for the past 10 years, i decided i didn't like the risk of heart attack and figured 10 years was too long to take a hormone like that and decided to get the Mirena. The first time my doctor tried to insert the IUD on my regular visit and the contraption was defective and wasn't opening properly...found this out by trying to force it in.  OUCH!!! Realized during this visit that I have cervical stenosis (cervix wont dialate) so she scheduled me to be under anethesia for the 2nd attempt.  Thank god because she said even under anethesia a tensed up and outstreatched my legs upon insertion.  First 3 months were constant cramping and spotting.  Painful sex so didn't even try.  Finally stopped being sore but periods are very irregular, sometimes will have two back-to-back and then skip a month.  The worst side effects by far are the raging mood swings.  My poor boyfriend.  It takes alot of patience to deal with me when i am so irrationally enraged about the most insignificant things. Also, went and saw the movie "bridesmaids" (a comedy) and cryed through the whole thing!  I am giving this another 6 months to a year because even though i have read that there are similar experiences and that people have them removed...no one comes back on and says how they feel 6 months to a year later.  I am hoping my body evens out. Probably wouldn't do it again but i have no kids and don't want a permanent birthcontrol yet.	F	28	1.5  years 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	birth control	daily bleeding, terrible  cramps, hair loss, perforated uterus requiring surgery	This birth control is a TERRIBLE choice. I had really painful cramps for weeks after my mirena was put in. I bled every day for nearly 10 months. When I went to have my mirena removed, I was told it had perforated my uterus and I needed  to have it surgically removed from my abdomen. This was apparently a "very uncommon side effect" until the doctor discovered I needed surgery and then apparently "oh this happens all the time." Also, I lost nearly all of my hair. I wear hats every day now.  DO NOT PUT MIRENA IN YOUR BODY!	F	22	10  months 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Contraceptive	Spotting, Loss of libido, painful sex, UTI's and Bacterial infections.	I have had Mirena twice. The first I had removed after 6 months of painful sex. I had it put in 2 months after having my first child. I decided to give it another chance 6 months AFTER my 2nd child. It was okay for a while as long as I wasn't having sex while laying on my back. My husband and I figured it was just a change in my body after having a 2nd child and possible Cysts. I decided recently that I should have it checked and sure enough the strings were barely visible and it was misplaced and on my cervix. I had it removed. Never again. I am going to stick with Nuvaring.	F	34	5  years 1X O	6/15/2011
1	Birth Control	Complete loss of libido	After getting the implant, my libido slowly but surely diminshed to nothing. I didn't want my boyfriend touching me, kissing me. i would rather watch paint dry than have sex. And before mirena, my libido was through the roof!!! It was awful. I didn't even fell human anymore. I had really bad headaches too. I have always suffered with headaches and migraines, but they were way more frequent with the mirena in. I had it taken out a little over two weeks ago and now I am back to my old self. I love kissing, cuddling and having sex again. Thank God I figured out the problem because my boyfriend and I almost broke up over this.	F	32	2  years1 1X O	6/8/2011Email
2	Birth Control	Headaches, strange vaginal odor, cyst-like acne on jaw-line, bleeding for 1st month and a half, weight gain	Too many side effects that are more inconvinient than taking a pill (which I tend to forget), Really unhappy about the weight gain and acne!	F	33	3  months 1X D	5/26/2011
2	birth control	weight gain, spotting, cramping, bleeding	I had heard wonderful things from a friend who had the same IUD, so after my first child, I had one put in.  For the first 6 months, I had almost constant spotting.  After that, I began to get more normal periods, but had HORRIBLE cramping on the first day- much worse than before I had my child.  I have also had a steady gain of 20 lbs since I got my mirena.  I am trying to stick it out for a little while longer since we're not ready for another baby, and I cannot use oral birth control, but I don't know how much longer I can stand it.

1	Birth Control	Constant heavy daily bleeding, fatigue, abdominal pain, urinary tract infection, and 15 lbs weight gain.	I was told that I may have breakthrough bleeding however I had severe heavy bleeding with abdominal pain and bloating. My obgyn had me come in after 30 days for an ultrasound to check placement and at that point I developed a UTI and requested the Mirena to be removed. Definitely not a positive experience, this is not for everyone for sure not for me. Appreciated taking a daily pill after that experience. Its been a year and my body is still not right.

3	Birth Control	Migranes, back pain, strange cycles, some heavy some light some didn't even happen.	I think it worked well for me as a contraceptive, but the side effects were bad. I had never had never had a migrane, and had 2 while on this, also constant back pain, some cycles were heavy and for 2 wks and others never came, with Months inbetween. With 3 kids I couldn't not lay around with a Migrane so I needed this to be removed.	F	29	2.5  years 1X O	3/4/2011Email
4	endometriosis	chronic yeast and cervical infections, severe back pain, weight loss.	Had mirena inserted at 18. no kids still a virgin. NEVER had a period from day 1 of insertion but yeast infections were horrible which im still batteling after 1 year. found out the doctor put it too low where it was in my cervix rather than uterus which causes all my issues. im now 19 and had it reinserted higher up 2 days ago. so far so good and no issues except cramping. keeping this one in for 5 years regardless.	F	19	3  months 1X O	2/26/2011
1	Birth Control	Hair Loss, joint pain/swelling, fatigue, headaches, back pain, weight gain, hormone imbalance, chronic yeast infections, vaginal odor, body went through false pregnancies.	I just had Mirena removed during Tubal Ligation and WOW I feel GREAT!  The last 2 years were pure hell trying to figure out "what's wrong with me?".  I never thought Mirena would cause so many ailments in fact I rarely remembered it was in my body.  Having it inserted was a little painful but having it removed ranked up there with labor pains.  My suggestion try a birth control that can easily be removed or stopped because it was very difficult to find a doctor willing to take it out.	F	32	4.5  years 1X D	2/23/2011
3	Birth Control	Insertion was painful and I had heavy cramping and bleeding for about 1 week. Then I went back to normal periods that faded away to nothing after about a year. My husband complained about being poked every once in a while but we decided it was worth the convenience. About 18 months I began cycles of feeling very bloated and tender in my lower abdomen. No periods though. I started gaining weight and am still gaining (up 15 pounds) despite heavy exercise and dieting.	I've also had several bladder and vaginal infections in the last year. I've never experienced this type of frequency before (and yes, I'm very careful with my hygiene). I'm suspecting it's all related so I'm having the device removed to see if there's any improvement and a return to my normal weight. At this point, I'm giving Mirena a 3 since it really is effective and at first has minimal side effects. If I find out these later side effects are related to the Mirena, I will score this drug lower.	F	36	27  months20 mcg 1X D	2/22/2011Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out!

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
