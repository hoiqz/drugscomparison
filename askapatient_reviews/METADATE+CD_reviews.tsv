4	adhd	Switched from this to generic ritalin because of ins copay and switched back despite $50 copay because it worked so well whereas generic was useless after 30 days. Metadate cd 30 mg 2x a day took an hour to kick in but was great. Not to be confused with metadate er tablet which did not work.		F	41	3  months30	7/16/2012
