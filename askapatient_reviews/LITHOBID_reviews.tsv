5	BiPolar 2 / Cyclothymic	None to speak of. Lithobid about 7 years now. Prior used Eskalith (900 mg) [1987 Started on lithium capsules, then tried the liquid. Stomach upset was a problem]No libido issues, no weight gain. I do need to make sure I drink a lot of water.	When I was diagnosed 25 odd years ago, I was told I was BiPolar II. I had mostly depressive episodes, always in the winter. I became hypomanic and it was strongly suggested by my Psychiatrist to go on Lithium. Today I feel my cycling was more due to cyclothymic mood disorder, but the Dx may not have existed in the '80's. Lithium was still fairly new to use day-to-day as it was mostly used to quell full-blown manic episodes.Although I have had side-effects of dulled feelings, at this time I do not have the "cotton-wool" feeling, where my emotions are blunted down, but that is because I take what is considered a barely therapeutic dose. My levels are always in the proper range, however.Additionally, I take 150MG of Lamictal and 50MG Trazodone. The Traz pops just the right amount of serotonin. I take at night before bed, and I wake up happy. Much better than with Lith and Lamictal alone.Stabilized for many years. Depressed moods are usually reactionary, and no hypomania. Gee that part was the best! Nothing like a little hypomanic road trip. Crash and burn though	F	54	25  years600 MG 1X D	1/20/2012
5	Major Depressive Disorder	LITHOBID gave me my life back. It virtually eliminated my suicidal tendencies and helped with my self harm. I do however, experience long term persistent diarrhea after every time I eat.		F	18	9  months100. Total	12/1/2011Email
2	Bipolar	Stopped taking as took before and weight gain and bloating was horrible lost 40 lbs when I went off this drug in approximately 2006	was on abilify for 5 yrs had severe depression issues in 2009 and 2010 only one manic issue in feb mar and april 2009 started mania in march 2011 given depakpote and now lithobid won't take due to above	F	65	8  days300 mg 3X D	4/25/2011Email
4	bipor II	Definitely blurred vision. It took me awhile to realize since I wear glasses, suffer from allergies and have long eyelashes. But yup, blurred vision, but no other discernable side effect.	It works to level me off, to be sure, but since it is blurring my vision I will probably return to my old 'script, a generic lithium	M	47	3  weeks100 mg 2X D	3/2/2011Email
1	Bipolar	anger, weight gain, gas, bloating, diarrhea, throwing up, migraines, insomnia, anxiety, loss of reality, thirsty all the time, blurred vision, excess salivia, acne, loss of balance...Theses are my side effects from only 3 weeks of use	I have only been on this for a short amount of time, but the side effects are not worth staying on it.  I did a little better on lithium.  I can't say that I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, because people respond to meds differently.  For me, I can't wait till this stuff gets out of my system.

1	posible bipolar	major weight gain, not myself what so ever I gained like 30 or more pounds and for a while I did not think that the weight gain was not the Lithoid but it was and now it is hard to lose the weight.	Do not use if under the age of 18	F	17	6  years	6/12/2009Email
4	Extreme Mood Swings	Dizziness, Trembling hands, excessive urination, stomach pain, Increased thirst	Not too bad, trembling in my hands and body sometimes becomes a bit too much and embarrassing, but tremor only happens after a workout, in a stressful situation, or if I concentrate on holding something tight (water bottle/ can, phone) and the tremor shows up randomly.	F	19	5  months	5/31/2009
1	ptsd/ depression	agitation, confusion, suicidal thoughts	I am on a combination of celexa and welbutrin for depression and valium to help with night terrors; xanax PRN. I took lithobid for 3 days. The first day i experienced severe agitation and confusion but thought it was anxiety related to my new rx. By the third day i felt like there was something invading my body that I had to physically extract. Suicide was my first solution to my awkward state, so i decided to sleep it off (19hrs straight) and dc use.	F	21	3  days	3/31/2009
4	Bipolar	Hidratenitus ( really really really bad cystic acne). I was cutting 5 cysts open a day. The acne was painful!!!! When i finally went off lithium, i had over 500 acnes scars on my back, 100 scars in my but and legs, and some on my face. I couldn't even walk the acne was so painful. weight gain ( but i was taking depakote and seraquel too), craving sweets!!!!	Most people don't get hidroatenitus from lithobid, it's usually a great drug, but if acne shows up when you take it, don't doubt the fact that its from lithobid! Great for mania though!	M	19	5  years	12/3/2008Email
5	Bi Polar	After taking lithium which did not work for me at all. The change to Lithobid the only side effects was minor weight gain,dry mouth.	With the help of this drug, counseling and myself, have not had a episode in 21 years. The most important thing to know not just one thing helps it takes all three. Continue to take medicines no matter which one helps you.	F	62	21  years	12/2/2008Email
3	Recommended	Thirst, anxiety, disorientation, fuzzy feeling, loss of short term memory, anger, frustration, not 'getting it', out of touch.	On lithium to control mania, but anxiety quickly followed along with the side effects. Ambien at 6.25mg (1 at bedtime and 1 after 4 hours) got sleep patterns back after a week, then began reducing the lithium to get back out of the side effects. It worked the last time too. Seems good sleeping habits and exercise helps stay out of the mania pattern. Does anyone else have poor sleeping habits that eventually lead to mania episodes?	F	45	14  days	1/17/2008
1	possible bi-polar	extreme muscle tremors, dry mouth, thirst, "out of body" feeling	i was on lithium regularly for six months to stabilize my mood. in this time i experienced tremors to the point that i could not write legibly, do my beadwork, or do yoga (because my muscles shook so badly i couldn't hold myself up). i also felt extremely robotized, like i was living in a dream. i almost got in a few potentially serious accidents because i was "out of it" while driving. the doctor reduced the dosage and this helped calm the shaking, but my hands still trembled and all the other side effects remained. in addition, my mood did not improve one bit; i became even more volatile than i had been before. i was finally taken off of it after my fourth stay in a psychiatric hospital in less than four months.	F	20	6  months	12/5/2007
4	bipolar 2 (rapid cycling)	thirst, salty taste in my mouth, dry skin, reduced libido, possibly some cognitive issues with memory	This medication has been very helpful. It's not perfect, but it has a strong, measurable stabilizing effect on me. I'm willing to take it despite the side effects. Lower doses in combination with other meds (Lamictal, Well-Butrin, Invega, Risperdal) have reduced the side effects. It felt like a bright light came on when I started taking it. I did quit cold-turkey one time and had a severe suicidal rebound it took divine intervention to get me out of. Do NOT quit taking this medicine cold turkey.	F	37	4  years	7/26/2007
2	Bipolar II & Depression	Weight gain (21 lbs in 4 or 5 months), Extreme tremors (to the point where my hand writing was getting ugly and it was hard to do my makeup), acne, uninary tract problems, sleeping all the time, seemed "out of my own body" at times.	I was taking 900 MG Lithobid and 450 MG Wellbutrin XL, the Lithobid did not make me feel any better, actually worse. I stuck it out to see if i got any better but didnt. My doctor did not wean me off of the Lithobid, he took me off all at once which was a horrible idea. I was really edgy and had no patience for anyone. I was crying more and yelling at everyone. This medicine worked for my father, but the weight gain and tremors were not worth waiting any longer to find out.	F	18	6  months	6/27/2007Email
3	bipolar disorder	thirsty, trembing fingers at times, constipation, no energy	Wish there were a way to wean a person off of this to see if they really need it...I'm feeling better now and would like to know if it truly does help me by the weaning off, though I know that sounds illogical.  this drug slows a person down, makes them tired, lose energy.  You know you have things to do, but you are so tired to do them is difficult.  I want my energy back.	F	50	2  days	4/25/2007
5	bipolar I	tremors, weight gain (about 5 lbs/300 mg), hypothyrodism, increase in thirst, gritty skin	I've tried abilify, depakote, zyprexa, and tegretol.  So far this has worked the best for me in terms of side effects and fixing what I wanted it to fix (stablizing my mood).  I switched to time release when I started getting frequent nausea, diahrea, and stomachs after taking my pills.  Time release has been well worth the extra $$.	F	29	12  years	4/11/2007
4	Bipolar Disorder - Mostly Manic	Irregular bowels, some nauseaus when I have an empty stomache, dry mouth, acne at first - then it totally subsided, curlier hair, and bloating - these of which were easier to deal with.  The eight years I've been taking this medicine, I've gained about 35 lbs.  I'm not happy about that.	For me, Lithobid (lithium) works.  It has greatly reduced the more severe bipolar symptoms such as anger (I can especially see this when dealing with my children), uncontrolable manic episodes and extreme depression periods in my life.  It's not that these things don't happen, like the anger and depression, it is that when they do, they are not as severe and I feel like I am in more controll.  Everyone has more happy and more sad days, with lithobid I still feel the different moods but not to the extreme that I might have if I had not been taking anything.  It is possible there aren't as many dangerous mood swings either.  Other than a few mild side effects, I could hardly tell I was taking anything.  It has been my family that has helped me to see that it is working.  I will say, however, that the bloating and weight gain has been no fun.  The sadness of the weight gain has caused me to stop taking the medicaton a few times, but I quickly realize that I NEED and must take the Lithobid	F	32	8  years	2/11/2007Email
5	Bipolar Disorder	lethargy and difficulty concentrating/cognitive difficulties. i had tremors, blurry vision, slurred speech, and extreme sleepiness in the beginning but they went away within a couple of weeks.	The difficulty concentrating and the cognitive problems have been the worst for me because it makes it unbelievably difficult to get through school. But for me it's been a miracle drug. I'd been on dozens of different meds before they put me on lithium when I was 14, and it was the first to ever make a positive difference. The side effects are completely worth it for me, and I feel that it would still be worth it for me even if my side effects were worse. Lithium saved my life.	F	18	4  years	1/30/2007
3	bipolar	Restless leg syndrom all over my body, random twitches, shaky  hands, nasseau and loss of appetite, keep seeing a trail when objects move, i can still see the object moments after it is gone, EXTREME ANXIETY ATTACKS!!! to the maxxxxx	I dont know if i like it, i dont know if the sideaffects are worth it.	F	16	1  days	1/5/2007
3		restless leg syndrom, twitching, shaking, naseau, trail when objects move, anxiety	I dont know if i like this	F	16	2  days	1/5/2007
3	see if im bipoloar	restless leg syndrom, twitching, shaking, naseau, trail when objects move, anxiety	I dont know if i like this	F	16	2  days	1/5/2007
2	bipolar disorder	horrible bloating all over, rapid weight gain, thyroid problem worsened, and I developed what the doctor called restless leg syndrome--except this was more like restless body syndrome.  It was hell!	a last resort medication	F	46	2  weeks	12/26/2006
2	Bi-polar possible BPD	Frequent unrination. Loss of bladder control. Ringing in ears.	My BF claims he noticed a difference in my behavior. I did feel more balanced but I missed having emotions. I missed feeling human.About taking it after a week, I had this horrible ringing in my right ear. It was so loud I cringed every time it happened. Than came the frequent urination. It was so bad one night I pissed the bed. How do you think a 23 year old feels when that happeneds? I stopped taking right away.	F	23	2  weeks	8/22/2006Email
1	bipolar I disorder	apathy, lack of motivation, rastlessness, disphoria.	this medication was not good for me It gave me symptoms similar to depression. I was sleepy all day and I did not want to do anything but sleep. it kind of made me question wheather I really suffered from bipolar disorder and if my psychosis had a different origin.	M	21	4  months	8/1/2006
3	yes	Weight gain (15-20 lbs)	It helped initially but the extra pouns I could ndeal with. Isd rather be crazy than fat!	M	39	1  years	7/26/2006
5	mood swings/possible bipolar II	nausea (though far less than straight Lithium Carbonate), recent development of slight hand tremor	Lithobid has been the LEAST problematic medication I have ever been on. It has had a really positive impact; my mood swings, which were once quite radical, have subsided. I also really like that a simple blood draw can tell your MD what your level is -- it takes a lot of the guess work out of things.	F	21	1  years	6/4/2006
2	Bipolar Depression	it rotted my teeth, it gave me awful acne, it made me uncontrollably hungry at night, I gained at least 80 lbs in 3 years. My behavior became worse and I had anxiety attacks. I was irritable.	This medication isn't worth it. It helped a little at first but by the time I stopped taking it I was worse than when I started it! It rotted my teeth so bad I had to have root canals on most of my teeth, had to have some pulled, and the rest all have big fillings. I spent the entire 4 years I was on this going to the dentist. It made me hungry at night so badly I felt like I couldn't sleep and was being DROVE to do so or I couldn't sleep although this may also have been the Serquel, I'm not sure. I gained so much weight nobody could recognize me and within 4 months of coming off the medication had lost about 75% of it without trying. I've also heard it can cause worse problems - like people starting fires.	F	18	4  years	4/1/2006
2	Bipolar	It also caused thyroid problems and made me constantly thirsty - also my skin was dried out while I was on it.		F	19	4  years	4/1/2006
3	BiPolar 2 and severe depression	25-lb. weight gain in two weeks, no sweets as I am a salad person, and fix two meals per week, either fish or chicken plus baked tator! Naseua, diarehia, constipation, shakes, memory loss, lethargy. Concetration sucks. Scared to go outside in public for fear if people look into my eyes they'll know how screwed up I am. However, I did have a wonderful day (3 days ago) 1st time in six months! Funny, I wondered if this was manic or just nice Day!! HA! But,I spriral down severely yet,and it sucks.	I was diagnosed with this 10 yrs ago,tried the lithium, however quit, due to my denial of being bi-polar. Taken Zoloft since I was 20, now upped to 200 mg for last 6 mo., Doc now added 200 mg Lamictal, plus Seroquel and Klonapin for panic attacks.  I hate taking all these meds, but KNOW that I need Lithobid, so will continue. Sad at my age that I've never had a weight problem til now, most men don't give a 'chunky woman a chance, they forget the woman's soul.'  Having been single for 13 yrs, I know that most of my dates started w/my beauty, (NOT bragging), then it led to knowing my soul.' Crap this is a nightmare...thought I'd someday find my soulmate...not now. Weightgain+bipoler=lonliness! Please forgive my mispelling-memory loss.	F	50	2  weeks	3/31/2006Email
5	Bipolar II disorder	hand tremors/diarrhea/nausea(sometimes extreme) frequent urination, tiredness, sleepiness, constant thirst	I've been taking Lithium in some form or another for almost 10 years. I really don't think it contributed to my overall weight gain, I've always been overweight. It was a real lifesaver. It really began to effect me positively when I took 1200 mg daily. This is not a medication that you want to stop and start either as it may lose its' effectiveness with you if you do this. Some of its' overall long-term side effects are concerning however. Also, not a drug to use if alcohol plays a large role in your life. The liver can't process both well at the same time.	F	34	9  years	12/28/2005
5	Mixed bipolar II	Tremor, which has recently subsided... hypothyroidism within the first two weeks, which I take synthroid for... my thyroid levels are now normal. I am a bit more bloated than I used to be, though.	I wish that I had tried lithium sooner. On that note, I've found that lithobid is more effective than lithium bicarbonate, and so I use it despite the steep price increase. It is nothing like atypical antipsychotics, which killed me even at the smallest dosages. It's really been a lifesaver. I use it 600 mg, with lamictal 100 mg, with zonegran 50 mg, and with concerta 36 mg.	F	17	1  years	12/12/2005
4	BiPolar I (rapid cycling)	Weakness, lethargy, chronic thirst, weight gain (5-8 lbs), forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating.	I've fought taking Lithium for nearly ten years and have finally admitted in the last year that life is just easier when I take my meds and stay on them.  All the side effects I've listed are much more minor than I experienced on Eskalith and I have none of the nausea.	F	24	7  years	7/28/2005
3	bipolar 2	Weight gain. Carb cravings. Oily hair and skin.	I would like to find a better way of dealing with bi-polar.Because of all the side effects I've had.It has only helped my moods to an extent not totally.	F	26	2  years	7/1/2005
4	Bipolar I	Nausea, dizziness, dry skin and mouth, loss of appetite		F	21	1  years	2/17/2005Email
1	Bipolar Disorder	15+ lbs. in the first two weeks that I have not lost.	Wouldn't take it because of the weight gain.	F	16	2  weeks	11/30/2004
