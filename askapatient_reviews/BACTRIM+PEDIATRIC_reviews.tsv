				F M	 	 	    
1	Recurrent ear infection	My 2 year old is having a terrible rash all over her body and high fever for over 24 hours now and feels terrible from this medicine.  Just started at 10 days.		F	2	10  days	2/1/2010
2	pilonidal cyst in lower back	Lightheadedness, vomiting, forgetfulness, anxiety, sun sensitivity	I was taking this medicine for 2 days when I decided to stop.  It said on the bottle not to be exposed to direct sunlight.  But what they really meant was draw your curtains and live in complete darkness in your house.  It was to the point I could not even carry on with day to day activities.  I know I only had an allergic reaction, but I will never take this again.	F	23	2  days	2/18/2007
1	bladder infection	severe leg cramps rash all over my face headaches weakness raised my red blood cell count made me very ill! DO NOT EVER TAKE THIS MEDICINE FOR ANY REASON!		F	26	10  days	10/6/2006
4	ear infection	severe anxiety, lightheadedness, insomnia, pressure in head and face, forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, depression		M	43	6  days	4/12/2006
5	Acne	Loss of appetite (why can't someone figure out how to extract whatever ingredient makes the user lose their appetite to make a REAL appetite suppressant?); yeast infection	Bactrim was the ONLY drug that ever cleared up not only my adult cystic acne, but also  regular acne and blackheads -- an embarrassing and nasty issue I had dealt with since I was in college.  If only the results were permanent.  After I'm on it for two months, I develop a yeast infection.  And after I'm off it for two months, the acne starts up again.  But while I'm on it, it's amazing.

5	liver infection	no side effects	Took for thirty days worked great.	M	45	30  days	9/28/2004
