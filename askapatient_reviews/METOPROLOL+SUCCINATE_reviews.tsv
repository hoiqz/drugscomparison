1	Hypertension	Started at 25 mg for a week and my blood pressure did not decrease, it stayed the same.  My generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) did get a tad worse.  My GP increased the dosage of the metoprolol succinate (generic) to 50 mg.  Anxiety significantly increased, and the tinnitus that was part of my anxiety increased as well.  That was troubling, but my blood pressure actually went up from borderline 145/90 to 160/110.  I was at this dosage for a week and convinced my GP I needed to go off it.  She told me to taper over 5 days.  At the end of the taper, I started having jaw, arm, and chest pains.  Went to the ER, no heart attack, but probably just angina.  About a week later I felt much better, but my tinnitus has stayed at the same elevated volume.  It has gone from slightly noticeable to intrusive at almost all times.  It did not help with my blood pressure, it ramped up my anxiety significantly, but it did lower my pulse to about 60 bpm.	This drug, unlike most other beta blockers, can cross the "blood brain barrier" and can interact with central nervous system tissues. If you have anxiety, tinnitus, depression, etc. I would steer clear of this drug.  	M	44	30  days50 mg 1X D	12/31/2012Email

1	changed to generic from Toprol - BP	sharp constant headache in area where headband would goincrease in heartrate and BPconstant sinus draining resulting in heavy coughacute fatigue, odd GI upsets, insomnia, anxiety.shortness of breath	This generic has been forced on me 3 times now.  Each time, I get the same symptoms.  When I get my AstraZenica Toprol back, the symptoms disappear almost overnight.  Some of the Metoprolol was recalled back in 2009.  It was supposedly corrected, so I tried it again.  Guess what?  It wasn't corrected.  Sorry I won't be able to update, because I'll NEVER take generic metoprolol ( Watson ) again.
