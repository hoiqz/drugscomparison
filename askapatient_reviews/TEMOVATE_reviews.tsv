4	Scalp psoriasis	Slight tingle when applying to the areas on scalp	This really hepled with the itchy, flaking in about 3 days!! Now I use a couple of times a week to help with the flares.	F	49	2  months30 1X D	1/21/2011
2	Eczema	After 5 days of application (twice a day), caused an allergic skin reaction: painful and itchy blisters. Doctor prescribed antihistamine (with side effect of somnolence/drowsiness) subsequently but no additional topical treatment. Skin blisters became dry, scaly, ugly-looking subsequently.	Hopefully, with the anti-histamine the allergic reaction shall subside. Will need a more effective treatment for the original problem of eczema.	M	36	5  days	10/27/2007
2	seborrheic dermatitis	peeling, itchiness, oiliness in skin, acne on my scalp	way too strong, get rid of the dermatitis fast, but it creates more problems that looks like it invites the psoriasis to come back. Temovate made matters on my scalp worse. Better to go with a medium potency whenever possible.	M	30	2  years	10/28/2004
