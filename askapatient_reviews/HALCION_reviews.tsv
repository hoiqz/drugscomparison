2	Dental surgery	Went to dentist for oral surgery. Giving 2 pills, at 8:00 an. After taking, pulse rate dropped below 40. Dentist took pulse on hand & neck. Aborted surgery, I didn't feel a thing, slight calmness. Walked out at 10:30 after monitoring. Had no effect on myself.		M	43	1  daysUnknown	3/6/2013Email
4	Insomnia problem	I had been on halcion for 7 days. I experienced just a bit of anxiety the day after. I was on stilnox but it gives me a terrible amnesia and headache, so i decided to start with halcion. I took it for a week and then stopped the use for another week (in witch i slept wery well without this med). Now i'm taking it again cause i have trouble to sleep again. But i will end my prescription and i will try others natural aid.		M	27	7  days.250	1/6/2013Email
5	Sedation for dentist appt.	N/A	I was very satisfied with this medication. I took .25 MG the evening before my dental appointment and .5 MG an hour before. I had six hours of dental work done and remember very little of it. I honestly didn't feel like I was in the chair for more than an hour or so, and I definitely didn't care about whatever the dentist was doing in my mouth. I definitely recommend this for others with dental anxiety!	F	27	2  days.5 1X D	11/1/2012
5	sleep aid	One slight side effect after taking for few days u get inflammed throatSome people on here are thick dopes and the doctors should be shot NOTE HALCION IS A SLEEPING TABLET NOT AN ANXIETY TABLET NOT A TAB FOR GOING TO DENTIST OR GOING TO HOSPITAL JES WHAT FOOLS TAKE A SLEEPING TABLET GPING TO DENTIST HALCION IS DESIGNED TO KNOCK U OUT PUT U ASLEEP AND IT DOES SO WHY TAKE IT FOR ANYTHING ELSE THE DOCTORS PRECRIBE XANAX FOR ANXIETY OR TO RELAX OR UNSTRESS NOT HALCION		M	46	4  days25	4/21/2012
5	Insomnia	For occasional use, Halcion has always proved itself to be very effective. I have never experienced any side effects and wake up refreshed and not like a zombie.		M	43	6  years.25 1X D	3/26/2012
1	pre-dental surgery	psychosis, panic attacks, hallucinations and confusion	One of the scariest moments of my life. This drug made me a complete mess. Needless to say, the dentist could not perform the operation.	F	18	1  days 1X D	1/24/2012Email
5	Sleep disorder	Great sleep no side effects for me	I have been prescribed halcion for nearly 15 years as necessary... not daily. I have tried most every sleep medication out there. .Nothing works as well for me. I get a great, deep sleep and wake up without the usual "sleeping pill hangover"  and fully mentally functional. For me it is perfect!	F	46	12  years.25 1X D	5/11/2011Email
3	Dental Procedure/Anxiety	Nausea & vomiting	I was prescribed .25mg Halcion to take 1 hr prior to my dental procedure.  I had never take it before, and am quite petite and was somewhat worried about the effects.  It made me "cloudy" and a bit dizzy, but there was no memory loss as everyone says, and you are fully aware of what is going on around you.  It made me vomit once at the dentist's office and then once again when I arrived home.  The nausea lasted on & off throughout the day.  I did take a little nap, couple hours, and woke up fine and without having that hangover feeling.  I have chosen not to use it again, due to the nausea, and can tolerate dental procedures without it.	F	37	 .25mg 1X D	4/19/2011
2	Dentist Appt Sedation	Dizziness and vertigo.	This was prescribed to my 8 year old for dental sedation, and although it made him loopy and dizzy it was exceptionally ineffective.  The purpose was to relieve anxiety and prevent traumatization and memory for my son- the meds did not work, he remembers the entire procedure and was EXTREMELY traumatized by the entire situation.	M	8	1  days 1X O	11/10/2010
4	dental anxiety	short-term amnesia; slightly unpredictable effectiveness. Make the assumption that you will be confused and require supervision for 4-6 hours after taken if using as an anti-anxiety.	While I am not thrilled about having a 4-hour-long "hole" in my memory, I had been unable to go to the dentist for a couple years over anxiety. With halcion, I was able to sit through two sessions each lasting a little under two hours of drilling and such. I have vague memories of the dental work being done, but they are only fragments, and don't cause me the kind of anxiety that will keep me from finishing up the work I need done. It's a reasonable trade-off for me.	M	47	3  times 1X AN	10/2/2010
5	Insomnia	None	Works faster than the Restoril I was taking, but wears off faster so I wake up feeling much more rested. When I take Restoril to sleep I alway feel so tired the next day. Not the case with this med. I am very happy though I worry about building a tolerance to it.	M	40	1  months.25 1X D	9/9/2010
1	oral surgery	I have spotty memory of anything that happened in the first 8 hours after taking the medicine when I slept half of the time.  After the sedation properties wore off, I vomited for 6 hours.	I am telling my endodontist to prescribe something different next time.	F	53	1  days.5 1X D	8/15/2010Email
3	Severe Insomnia	Gained a ton of weight on this med! Was sleepwalking and eating with NO memory of it. I figured it out when I would wake up and a loaf of bread was gone, a jar of peanut butter was empty, or an entire cake was gone!!		F	35	6  months0.25 1X AN	4/5/2010
1	1 hr pre-op dental surgery	Was told to take this by my oral surgeon as I would have no pain & no memory of the procedure. Per oral surgeon, I had severe agitation within 1 hour of ingestion, inability to sit still. Complete memory loss, inability to walk correctly x 1 day. Slept for 5 hours after getting home. No known etiology-not due to drug interactions. Had never taken this drug before. I would never recommend it to any patient, although it is now widely used in dental practices. Per pharmacist, a certain % of patients who do not have psych hx, depression, or hx of alcohol use will have a poor outcome with this medication. Patients become zombies, no memory, no conscious control of actions. This is a sedative-hypnotic. Per FDA warnings: Serious side effects of SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS include:getting out of bed while not being fully awake and do an activity that you do not know you are doing. (See What is the most important information I should know about SEDATIVEHYPNOTICS?)abnor	Ask for another medication-this is not the only drug that is available for patient anesthesia, which is basically what it was used for in my case.	M	45	1  times	1/7/2010
4	insomnia	None	Built up tolerance after a few weeks - if not then I'd still use it - clean -I just want to sleep	M	56	30  days	11/2/2009
1	1 hr prior to dental appt	uncontrolled laughing, feet/legs giving out (falling down) & extreme tiredness	I showed no anxiety nor had any at the prior day's dental appt. Why this was prescribed is beyond me but I will not be using that dentist again. They told me it would relax me & that I would be able to care for my 1 1/2 yr old son afterward. Needless to say, my mother had to help me to bed and take care of my son.	F	20	1  days	8/13/2009
5	Insomnia	None. Overblown press accounts.	Excellent therapeutic.	M	41	42  days	5/14/2009
1	prescribed on admission to hospital	extreme paranoia, complete loss of short term memory, poor judgment	I was admitted to hospital for OCD-related suicidal depression and the doc put me on antidepressants (clomipramine/anafranil) which was successful, xanax, and 1mg of halcion every night! Already at that time (1984) there were warnings about halcion and this dose was way too high, yet he kept me on it for 7 years! Even though I reported to him things like I refused to touch my pen after someone borrowed it because I thought he had poisoned it, that I lay down in the road at night for a rest, etc. He only showed concern when I told him I did an assignment and only when I put it in my folder did I realize I'd already done it before, exactly the same like a photocopy! That's when I quit it. I never needed it anyway as I had xanax to get to sleep. No wonder it's been used as a date rape drug and also murder charges have been dropped against people when the judge found out they were on halcion!	M	62	7  years	3/10/2009
5	Severe insomnia	Absolutely none.	I suffer from severe insomnia, I would be up for 4 to 5 days at a time. I have tried all types of sleep agents and Halcion is the only one that has been effective thus far.	F	36	5  months	1/16/2009
2	Insomnia	Emotional instability.	I took this a few times because I'd been waking up during the night and not able to go back to sleep. Since the effect is short-lived this was prescribed. Almost every time after I took it, the following day I would get extremely emotional about insignificant things, to the point of crying uncontrollably.	F	34	5  days	1/15/2009
3	Sleeping aid	I have taken Halcion only a few times in the past 15 years.  I have always loved it because I am very sensitive to medications and with this I was able to sleep great and still feel great in the morning.  However, I recently took it about 3 months after having a PTSD type reaction to Versed and it triggered the reaction again.  I slept great the night I took it but it has been 4 nights since then and I wake up at 1:00 AM experiencing severe panic and can't sleep for the rest of the night because I feel like I'm going crazy.  Literally every muscle in my body feels like its buzzing and my heart it racing and pounding.  It is very scary.  I have never had this reaction to Halcion before, but I feel exactly like I did for about 2 weeks after being given Versed.  I am now afraid to take it again.		F	47	1  days	12/2/2008
4	Insomnia	If i took over the recommended dose I still had hangover. But with the recommended Dr dosage I slept very well with no problems at all.	Regardless of the negative publicity halcion had years ago. It taken as directed it really does help you sleep with no problems. Plus is comes generic.	M	48	4  days	7/26/2008
1	Anxiety	slight drowsiness and headache	I felt no difference, if not more anxious than before I took the drug.	F	17	1  days	7/14/2008
5	Insomnia	I take it 30 minutes before I want to go to sleep and sleep great afterwards.  I wake up feeling great.  I only take it if I am having problems sleeping and never take it more than 5 days in a row.	I have used Halcion on and off for twenty years.	M	49	20  years	11/5/2007Email
4	insomnia	When I took it responsibly there were no side effects.  When I was an idiot and took to many I almost killed myself in a car accident.	This is the only sleep medication I have ever taken that has not caused drowsiness the next morning, and it works almost nightly.  The bad thing is that the half life is around 4hrs. I think you will either love or hate this drug.  It is unlike any other sleep aid I have had.  Take it responsibly though as it is a potent drug.	M	42	2  years	8/2/2007
3	insomnia	none	Sometimes it helps me sleep; sometimes I stay awake all night.	F	35	2  weeks	7/29/2007
2	resistant insomnia	When I tried Halcioln it was a disaster. I couldn't fall alseep, so ikept taking tablets every half hour (like you're never done it), and, while feeling normal and awake, apparently I fell asleep, and then woke up half an hour later swaddled in couch blankets not know where I was or how I got there.	Halcion either takes a VERY long time or a very large dose to kick in for some people (I'm pretty drug resistant) but no pharmacy in the US will actually give you a reasable dose. I don't remember having any induced nightmares (possibly because I was asleep for souc a short time), so I suppose that's a plus, but I'm not willing to put up with that sort of disorientation unless there's a benefit.	F	25	2  days	11/10/2006
1	Insomnia	Although the 25 mg Halcion had a relaxing effect I was wide awake for 4 hours and then decided to take another half tab. Slept fitfully at best.  Next day I was so confused and sleepy that I could not drive safely and spent a good portion of the day in a drowsy state but unable to sleep.	I have taken this medication some time ago and remember the lingering drowsiness. Both times I have been on SRI anti-depressants simultaneously.	M	62	1  days	4/15/2006
1		made sleeping harder instead of easier.and to the person that said they liked it, it's because you don't actuallly				 	6/5/2005
5	Sleep Aid	Perfect restful sleep.  Rapid	Took it off an on for 4 years to help adjust to rotating day/night work shifts.  Extremely refreshing sleep with full alertness and energy upon awakening.  Ambien does not get you to sleep as rapidly nor as well as Halcion and Ambien leaves you very groggy upon awakening by comparison. Too bad irresponsible patients made the med nearly impossible to get any more.	F	43	4  years	5/18/2005
1	to control anxiety	Psychosis.	The psychiatrist, not knowing (or caring?) that I had been taking Haldol and Halcion, informed my parents that I was psychotic and should be institutionalized (?!). Thank God my Mom obtained both MRI and CAT scan results to prove those people wrong. There is a possibility that these drugs will worsen any kidney problems that you may have [or that you  may not be aware of at the time :(]. Therefore, I strongly recommend to find out as much as you can about the medicine(s), and to have your physician test other medications before agreeing to take either Haldol or Halcion.	F	36	1.5  months	2/8/2005
2	anti anxiety	made me extremely hyper and couldn't feel any effects		F	19	1  days	2/3/2005
1	insomnia	Confusion, amphetamine-feeling	Halcion has been banned in Canada and England.	F	39	4  weeks	11/26/2004
