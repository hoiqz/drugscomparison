2	seizure disorder	I was fine on the old dilantin kapseal for over 10 years.  when pfizer changed the formulation in 2008 all of my problems began.  Even in my therapeutic range  I had seizures.I  tried other meds, Dilantin kapseals worked for me with no side effects,  .  Maybe that's why so many people are having problems with this drug.  did your problems  start after 2008		F	55	10  years500 mg 1X D	3/13/2013
3	pettite mal seizures	I experience few side effects similar to what people are stating.  Little shaking in the hands, i feel rather dumb at times, little memory loss, and a fuzzy feeling at times.		M	30	3  weeks300mg	6/27/2012Email
3	undiagnosed seizure	Though I am new to this medication and adjusting to the baseline feeling on this medication, there have been several noted side effectsTroublesome memory loss. 'train of thought' issues, loss of concentration, hand tremors, bleeding gums and a worsening body tremor as I initially stretch in the morning. One side effect I have enjoyed is hair growth. My daughter noted that I am no longer bald. As it increases growth of facial hair I could see this side effect being troublesome for women My blood levels have failed to maintain within clinical levels which is worrisome.

2	seizures	When there are many other anticonvulsants available, its side effects make Dilantin undesirable and unnecessary.		F	66	10  years100	5/25/2012Email
2	PCSeizure	Lack of focus, fuzzy feeling, tingling in hands and feet, issues with memory.	While I'm sure this medication works well for others, it has been affecting be poorly, as I have been unable to work. If this happens to you recommed you do not wait as long as I did.  The doctor has now put me on another medication which is working well.	M	60	6  months300MG 1X D	3/9/2012Email
2	seizures	I feel lightheaded, unable to focus, fatigue, Some loss of balance, Some trembling of hands	The side effects of this medication is worst than having the seizures themselves.   I would not recommend it to anyone, my doctor Changed my medication two weeks ago and am no longer seeing these side effects	M	60	4  months300 mg 1X D	3/8/2012
5	head injury playing football	numbness in feet, hard to focus in the morning until I get going,  dry mouth and who knows what else.	Have had epilepsy for 58 yrs and dilantin was the drug that really made me abel to function normally after going thru other drugs.  Who knows what ailments I am experiencing now are due to the dilantin or old age.  Taking care of teeth and gums, exercise, vitamin supplements and eating properly are the key to surviving.

1	Dilantin	Memory Loss Bleeding Gums and Depression	I found a good Doc and he took 1 look at my gums and took me right off this stuff and gave me a prescript for Phenobarbitol I take it at night only 100mg 2 pills before bed.  I have taken it for about 25 years and felt much better	F	63	7  years 1X D	1/5/2012Email
5	epilepsy	some trouble gums but brush 3 times day gums are good ..sometimes feel little tired thank god they found a drug helped me dilantin in great		F	25	15  years500 mg 1X O	8/17/2011Email
2	Diabetes	Extreme fatigue, headaches, unable to concentrate or remember things.	I had seizures from low blood sugar associated with insulin use for diabetes.  I would not recommend this drug for this purpose.I experienced a seizure from the drug itself, and was promptly taken off the medication.	F	45	2  years 3X D	8/12/2011
1	seizures	tired and sleepy, level were always high , admitted to the hospital for this since i have been taking this		F	29	6  years100 4X W	8/11/2011Email
3	Epilepsy	Headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, tired all the time, hard to sleep at night, can't find the right word at times, problems with speech at times, overgrowth of gums, can't concentrate, some shakiness in hands.	I think dilantin is good for stopping seizures, but the side affects are really bad. They seemed to take over my life more than the seizures would have.	F	17	3  years100MG 2X D	7/20/2011Email
5	Partial-Complex eplilepsy	Tiredness, hair growth, continually worsening vision, decrease in bone density,	Lately I have noticed my eyes are slow  to focus which is kind of new and may be due to me not getting enough sleep also. I have been taking this for the past 18 years and have not had any real problems with it. I lead a relatively normal life, I am a Police Officer, have two kids and a wife and seem to do ok.	M	25	18  years350 1X D	6/10/2011Email
4	Petitte Mal Seizures	Extreme fatigue, Light headedness, Nausea, Loss of balance, Dizziness	I didnt know that I was having these seizures until one day when I went into a full blown Grand mal seizure while I was working. It started off as a severe head ache that last about 2 minutes, dizziness, nausea and a weird iron taste in the back of my throat. I was finally diagnosed that I have scar tissue on my right front temporal lobe from a old car accident where I sistanded from moderate head injury.	F	26	3  years500mg 3X D	4/27/2011Email
4	Idiopathic siezure disorder	None until about three years ago: initial peripheral neuropathy in toes(now diagnosed as axonal degeneration / demyelinization), has now progressed to reduced NCV below the knee with loss of muscle tone; upper extremities not affected; now Vit B12 and D deficient; tinnitus with mildly impaired hearing (unilateral), now showing increased inflammation parameters, with unusually elevated Dilatin blood levels.	In general, I tolerated this drug without side effects until about three years ago. As are many people, I'm uncertain as to the bioavailability of the new formulation, although I am also aware that this varies greatly between patients. Final comment: If nothing else works and side effects are minimal, the duration of use should be 5 years maximum for patients like myself (well-controlled idiopathic generalized seizure syndrome). There are a number of other equally good or superior AEDs on the market today.	M	54	38  years100 4X D	3/5/2011Email
4	Night time seizures only	Reaction time is slower. Slurred speech comes and goes 3-4 times a month or more. Face irritation occurs (a feeling like your face is drooping). May have an effect on your extremities (hands and feet). Blood levels may be altered by medication. (Elevated liver enzymes, auto immune diseases). Effects are different for everyone, this does not mean everything I said here will happen, this is only from what I've experienced living on dilantin.	I've been on dilantin for a little over 16 years and counting. Its helped me with my seizures at night. I have ones where they only happen at night in my sleep. I'm athletic and eat fairly well (semi vegetarian Is suppose lol) and in need for change. I'm done with doctors experimenting with my brain, late in this stage I just can't handle these side effects, it ruins a large aspect of my social life and I feel stupid around others when I'm not engaging quick enough in conversation. This medication is helping me control my seizures and I'm grateful for that but at what price? There are so many medications and dosages out there, I don't know where to look anymore. I simply want to feel "right" again.	M	27	16  years400 2X D	1/7/2011Email
5	epilepsy	none		M	52	25  years 1X D	11/10/2010
5	Epilipse	I was diagnosed with epilipse in 1965 at the age of 18. The only side effect at that time was swollen gums in the mouth. Quite common as I understand. This subsided soon.	I have taken Dilantin since 1965. I have been taking this once a day 3 100mg tablets before bed. I have had no side effects and my life was as normal as if I never had epilipse until June 2006 when I had a seizure. My doctor increased the dosage to 4 100mg tables ,  2 taken at 11 am and 2 at 11 pm. I thought that was it for another 40 years until Thanksgiving 2009 when I had 2 seizures within 8 hours. My doctor added 2 500mg Keppra to the Dilantin. Then in Sept. 2010 , I had a mini mal seizure where I was out for maybe a minute. What is happenning to me. Is it just because I'm getting older or because I have been taking the medication for so long ? Also , my feet have become dumb over the last few years, like pins and nettles.	M	63	45  years2 100mg 2X D	10/27/2010
4	Grand mal seizures	Delayed reaction times in thought. Some slurred speech -- maybe happens 2-3 times a month that I notice speech is slurred or that I can't think of the right word.	DILANTIN has worked pretty well in keeping grand mal seizures relatively well controlled (about 8-9 seizures in 10 years), with all of those seizures coming when the therapeutic level was low.  In fact, the dosage may have been increased during times when compliance was the issue rather than a breakthrough seizure, but it was hard to tell.Although the slurred speech is definitely a post-DILANTIN symptom it is really hard to tell with some of the memory/ delayed reaction issues. I definitely had some of those symptoms before diagnosis and also had insomnia issues as well. Was also diagnosed with sleep apnea, and with the wide range of problems that sleep apnea can cause it is hard to really pin down any of those symptoms on DILANTIN or epilepsy. The sleep apnea existed before the epilepsy and it's possible they're even related. I will go through periods of drunk-like and there are times I can be at work and close my eyes for a second and suddenly be in REM sleep, but it is still hard to tell anything if you're not getting sleep.I have had not had gum growth or recession. Overall, it's worked pretty well and unless I addressed the other issues of insomnia/ sleep apnea it's pretty hard to justify switching when I haven't had a seizure in 2 years.

5	Grand Mal	Moody and shaky as in motor skills. And a couple of much tolerable side effects. Was safe on this dosage for all this time.25 years.	AFTER 25 years, All of a sudden had seizures and could not be left alone, had seizures to point of comeing out of them and not at all "knowing" I had lost conscienceness until later that day. Of course stopped driving all together.  Was treated after MRIs and EEGs with Keppra and I did not respond to this at all. Unable to even be trusted to walk outdoors and cried as the episodes/ much pain continued. Was then given dilantin again but increased the dosage to 200mg twice a day. It has now been almost one year and a half, and can now hold my grandchild. I do have poor bone density but am treated for this. Praise the Lord.	F	55	25  years100 mg 3X D	6/10/2010Email
4	Seizure Disorder	Poor concentration,retention and memory, word retrieval, slow learning capability	I've taken Dilantin for 10 years. Had been seizure free until 12-23-10. Dosage was increased to 260 mg daily. The increase caused shakiness "dry mouth" and constipation. Dosage lowered to 230 mg, shakiness subsided, eventually "dry mouth" also.  Originally, took Tegretol for 2 years. Too many digestive problems switched to Dilantin. Really drug resistant person but it's beats having a seizure, then not being able to drive for six months.	F	65	10  years200 mg 1X D	5/31/2010
4	Seizure disorder	Clouded thoughts, trouble recalling names / recent conversations, short term memory issues, extreme drowsiness, vivid dreams, occasional disorientation, clumsiness, concentration issues	When younger I did a poor job of taking my Dilantin regularly and experienced several seizures after missing days, but the past several years I've taken religiously and haven't had any issues.  Dilantin has allowed me to live a normal life and drive, work, etc without constant fear of seizures, but not without some costs.I have definitely noticed that I'm not as mentally sharp as I was before I started taking it.  I wasn't the most agile person before, but I've also noticed I'm significantly clumsier.  I also will fall asleep almost immediately at night even when I'm trying to stay awake, sleep deeply through the night, and wake up very groggy in the morning.

5	epileptic seizures	My gums have receded.  I have experienced no recent, significant side effects besides.	Dilantin has kept my seizures well under control.  I have been seizure free since 1996.  Compared to the benefits, I find that, compared to the benefits, the side effects are minimal.	M	62	53  years100 mg 4X D	3/2/2010
4	Seizures	Early on when determining the dose, I had issues related to dizziness and word retrieval.  Even to this day, I had a friendly disagreement with my doctor who wants 400 mg per day to my 300 mg per day. On 400mg, I feel the above side effects which affect my livelihood and social interaction.  On the dose I take, only once in a blue moon do I feel a slightly off balanced.  I do know to take extra care of my gums and will take a bone density test when I turn 40.  I love daily products so I don't anticipate this being a problem.	My only additional comment relates to the one time in 18 years where I ran out of the medication.  And in this instance, I took a little extra dose when I received the meds and this was not a good idea and the underneath of my arms swelled with bumps and lumps.	M	39	18  years300 1X D	2/27/2010
5		Speech, cognitive and balance issues, but see below.	After two severe grand mals and a host of petites, focus seizures, involuntary muscle spasms I was given Dilantin. Efficacious dose [no seizures] turned out to be 400 mgs/daily. But still a mess. Speech, cognitive, balance,,, you name it. Went on Disability. Didn't drive for 5 years. Then saw an infomercial for a sub-lingual Vitamin B pill. It was pitched by a doctor we once knew in another town. Liked him. Trusted him. No mention of post-seizure, or Dilantin, but he claimed the stuff would help with the symptoms i was  experiencing. What the hell. We ordered some with limited expectation. About 6 weeks later we realized my condition had changed very noticeably. A couple months later I went through an exhaustive [3 hour] eval and road test to determine if I actually was ready to drive again. Bingo!Not 100%, but I'm 73 and few in my group are. In the last year I've done all the driving on trips of 2500 miles, and several of almost 800 miles. No sweat.Every case is different but it's worth  a try for anyone who's in comparable straights. Just be patient though. It takes a few weeks.It may not be easy to find, but anyone on Dilantin, considering another anti-seizure drug, or worried about long-term use must read the Jack Dreyfuss  [the mutual fund pioneer] book: "A Remarkable Medicine Has Been Overlooked". I can vouch for the anti-depressant qualities.Jim	M	73	10  days	1/23/2010Email
5	Life-extension purposes.	No adverse side-effects whatsoever.	I have taken this drug at 100 mgs daily for long spells but today take it occasionally especially if I am about to face some apprehensive social situation. It helps at maintaining one's composure. It also inceases one's stamina enabling one to do manual tasks without exhaustion. On intially taking it (the first 3 doses) I experineced a psychological high but thereafter no noticeable effect. My wife too takes it when feeing apprehensive or depressed but requires 200 mgs for her to notice its benefit. We self-medicate.	M	79	16  years	12/30/2009Email
4	seizure disorder	Hand tremors started after 10 years of use (worse with caffeine and low blood sugar); more hair on my arms than your typical woman; get very sleepy after 1-2 beers or glasses of wine on an empty stomach; forgetful with names, but this is part of aging for all of us!	To encourage those who worry about long term use...  Dilantin may be an oldie, but for me it has been a goodie at 300 mg/day alternating with 400 mg/day.  I have climbed mountains, run a half-marathon, and not been cognitively affected at all. I am now working on my PhD in the top program in my field. Gums fine, bone density fine (with vitamin supplements and weight bearing exercise).  I don't know what the future holds, but Dilantin has been a blessing and a constant for me over the last 26 years.	F	33	26  years	11/23/2009
5	car accident head injury first time	short term memory problem starts,super dose 600mg daily.burns like a bugger if it gets cot in your throat.bone and cartilage problems arise.muscle atrophy and constainly weak and tired	this drug works to control seisures but not enough is said about the side effects.Personally i've uncovered my need to supplement vitamen D,calcium and just about any healthy food group because osteoarthriyis was discovered at the age of 45. At the age of 39 i was misdiagnosed with sciatia.Get more than one oppinion from a doctor as uncertain etiology after suffering for five years and one leg being an inch and a half shorter then the other.Yeah that coffe wake up trick is also shared.Two pots a day ,remain at 2- 300mg dosage Your damned if you do'nt take dilantin but the family doctor did warn me about a rash and proper dental care.

5	A.V. Malformation	Tired as a result from taking Dilantin.Memory retention seems to be effected by the medicine.Numbness in hands and especially bottom of the feet.Concentrative ability noticeably effected at times.	Tiredness countered by drinking coffee.(It works)(My case only): In an emergency situation, I have inhaled 1/2# 100mg capsule of Dilantin in order to stop a seizure.I have tried Dilantin under the tongue. It burns.Cold water used in conjunction with taking Dilantin has stopped an oncoming seizure before happening. A Cold towel around the neck-(loosely), and cold towel under the arm pits.Having a fan helps too. (oxygen)(Note): Age & condition are to be taken into account.Dilantin has saved my butt for 26 yrs. Even with all the drawbacks that accompany its use, How can I complain to much being still alive.	M	52	26  years	8/31/2009Email
4	Asperger Syndrome - 9 yrs old	Dilantin Infatabs were very easy for my 9 year old to take.	REmained on this medication for 9 years.  Good mood stabilizer for children.  Made him more outgoing.	M	17	9  years	8/29/2009Email
3	epilepsy multiple seizure types	on normal drug level :I am tired and my thinking isn't efficient Memory slow it does impair my thinking process alot . Really bad gum over growth Extra growth of hair over legs and face which is not what a girl wants.And my eyes bother me don't focus as fast   On toxic blood levels:Can't do nothing can't see nystagmus dizzy sleepy my head is floppy and I am completely goofy	it works well in emergencies and neurologist are comfortable with it I don't like it I wish I don't have to	F		19  years	8/20/2009
3	seizures	tends to make me feel tired... Don't know if it is because of the benign brain tumor, but I have trouble finding the right word.  Then after feeling tired all day, I have insomnia at night. Go figure.		F	50	2  years	7/24/2009
4	choreoathetosis	I've been taking dilantin for 25 years (started at 13) so it's difficult to distiginguish general shortcomings from negative effects from the medicine. Lack of concentration and coordination problems are two things I would like to attribute to dilantin. Maybe a slower thought process.	I take half of what was prescribed to me (200 mg opposed to  400 mg) to reduce side effects and it's been an effective dossage. For the most part it's been a miracle drug but have alway been concerned about potential ill effects. Somebody recently told me they stopped taking the drug because of a whole litany of damaging effects including liver damage to memory loss to deadening of the nerves. I would like to experiment with a different medication.	M	38	25  years	5/30/2009Email
5	unexplained tonic-clonic seizures	swollen gums	Dilantin has been great but I am now worried about possible long-term effects. My Dr. wants me to switch to Lamictal. I am worried because I have been seizure-free for so long and haven't had problems other than my gums. But I am concerned about cerebellar atrophy. Has anyone else switched medications and been successful?	F	37	22  years	4/14/2009Email
5	Seizure Control	Slight drowsiness, bad constipation, & intermittent (last for a few minutes every few days) uneasy dizzy feeling.  Mostly these side effects were only during the first few months of taking this medication then subsided or learned how to control.	Excellent medication that I am very grateful for as it has eliminated seizures for over 20 years.  Very few side effects and this medication controls seizures for me even though my blood levels show that I am below the therapeutic level.  I take 400mg of Phenytek (time released Dilantin) and my body must metabolize most of it as my blood levels are below theraputic....but it is still very effective and controls my seizures.  No need for me to increase level and every time I had lowered my dose I have had a seizure.  Early on I had some uneasy dizzy spells where it kind of felt like the earth was moving and I would get very anxious (sweaty palms, increase heart beat) but it wouldn't last very long.  It was not so bad that it would affect my driving, walking, function or anything, just an uneasy feeling as I thought maybe it was a sign that I was going to have a seizure.  Once I realized this feeling was from the medication and not a forewarning of a seizure then it didn't bother me.  Mo	M	42	22  years	2/21/2009
4	Grand Mal Nocturnal Seizures	Tiredness or drowsiness,  My gums are a bit swollen, have had periods where my speach was a bit slurred, itching of the face and neck may be an allergic reaction from dilantin or something else and peripheral neuropathy in both feet and lower legs	Its good to have something that will control your seizures. The only thing I find a bit difficult to handle is the peripheral neuropathy,  because I don't know how far it will advance. I am currently taking 600mg of dilantin one day and 500mg the following day.	M	59	40  years	2/20/2009
3	Seizures	Fatique, memory loss, lack of concentration and can't even read a book, falling asleep sitting straight up or at the computer during the day and then cant sleep good at night, the most I sleep is 4 to 5 hours per night. Loss for words, blurred vision, raises blood sugar, depression, dizziness.  The One thing that is bothering the most now is a loss of feeling in my toes, completely numb. Loss my balance because of it fell down the steps because of it. Seems like the doctors just blow me off.	DOES ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCE THIS NUMBNESS??  SO FAR I AM ON 4OOMG. OF DILANTIN, 5MG OF KLONIPIN , AND NOW 1,000 MG OF KEPPRA. THE DOCTOR WANTS TO ADD ANTHOER MEDICINE TO TRY AND GET ME OFF THE DILANTIN.  I AM NOT SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT DECISION. .  I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT THE DOCTOR HAD MY LICENSE SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF ALL THIS.  NO JOB, HOME ( LIVING WITH DAUGHTER_	F	55	15  days	2/16/2009Email
2	Grand-Mals Since 31 yrs old	Massive backside headaches. Heart Flopping excessively. Feel heartbeats so strong up through the vessels in my high chest and neck & jaw. Feels like pressure wants to explode. Brain Fog/Memory Loss/Loss for words-embarrassing at work. Pain in chest and under left top arm. Severe weakness in muscles to where I drop things that are light or feel like a raggedy ann doll with no backbone to hold me up. Tingling fingers/feet. Breathe heavily. Sweats/Chills. Low grade fever. Eyes side to side. Dizzy.  Not acceptable to work in.  Seizures are better than working in these continuous side effects when job requires hard strong mind and body.	Every Body is Different.  What works for one may not at all for another.  This does not work for me.  The few Grand-Mals a year would be better to live and work with than these daily side effects, but I must keep my driver's license to work and live and I  guess I'll have to find strength to live through the side effects.  Must follow the rules of the world even if it hurts my body to do it.	F	46	3  months	2/12/2009Email
5	seizure disorder	I have taken 300 mg of Dilantin nightly for 36 years and been seizure free except for 1 seizure in the hospital after the birth of my first child; (I wasn't taking the Dilantin properly at the time because of my concerns about its possible effects on the baby...there were none.)I have had surgery on my upper gums twice in the past 12 years which was virtually painless thanks to my wonderful periodontist. I have short term memory problems and have recently started to have  occasional tingling in my arms and hands. My neurologist has mentioned other, newer drugs that I could switch to but my attitude has been "if its not broken, don't fix it!" I also have refused to switch to the generic form of Dilantin despite having to pay more for the brand name.I believe I've lived a completely normal life thanks to this drug.

1	Gran Mals	I had the side effect within 2 weeks of a rash all over my legs and arms.  I was taken off it and given prednisone.  That was awful.  From what I remember about those 2 weeks, I was nervous, tired or just out of it.  Was in a store calm and then had this overwhelming anxiety. I had to leave the store.	Obviously not for me.  The rash and borderline Psychotic behavior was enough to convince.  I am on Depakote and although tired at some times, no seizures.	M	27	2  weeks	1/10/2009
1	bullet in brain grand mal seziours	sex drive whats that...is what i would say the first few years i was on it,memory loss,at times i cant sleep to save my life sometimes days at a time,for lack of a better way to put it my hands twitch out on me at random,i had all mt teeth pulled for two reasons 1 no more bloody toung and not eating for a week because of it and 2 pain, fall over for no reason people think im drunk at times, lets see i know theres more but the memory loss is kicking in	dont have as many seziours but for all the down sids im gitting off thees pills i shouldnt have any i still from time to time wake up in the E.R idk there has to be something else i can be taking if any1 has any info i would love to hear it btw i also heard it can make it harder to have kids i hope this is not the case we are trying to start a family with no luck so far like i said any info will help	M	28	10  years	12/20/2008Email

5	skull fracture at age 10	At age 66 I only have a very small amount of memory loss, names and this just may be old age.	At age 10 the specialist put me on 400 mg/day dialntin & 60 mg/ day phenobarbatol, 1/2 morning and 1/2 at bed time. He also told me that I would have to avoid cafine, nicotine,alcohol, & later I found aspertaine to be included. Very important.	M	66	55  years	11/22/2008
4	Motorcycle wreck	Trouble focusing eyes, cloudy thoughts sometimes, serious loss of appetite, Hair growth on eyebrows and nose.	I didnt have a seizure until over a year after the wreck which happened to be a grandmal. I havnt had any problems unable to be over looked other than trouble focusing my eyes. I have hazy thoughts. I have to force myself to eat more than a bowl of cereal some days. My eyebrows are thicker and my nose hairs have grown in length.I had to read on the internet about possible bone problems from this and the generic version so even if I havent had a noticable seizure since taking this medication I will be looking into finding an alternative drug. I took Dilantin and had to switch to the generic, Phenytoin, for the cost.	M	31	2  years	11/11/2008
3	I have had brain surgery for an avm	I experience many of the same things others have listed such as the tiredness, trouble expressing myself, vivid dreams etc.	I am unsure if it really works as from time to time i have had seizures while on the Dilantin.  Thankfully, though I think I have been seizure free for a while now, although i recently awoke with my mouth and tongue bitten.  I m curious to see if any one has rapid arm movements during there sleep.  At times I m good while other times one of my arms moves rapidly back and forth almost waking me.  Sometimes I think it s a dream while other times Im sure it occured.	M	42	3  years	11/1/2008Email
5	Epilepsy	Memory loss,can't find the right word, tired in the afternoon, hair growth, Eye floaters.I am not sure but after 38 years of taking Dilantin I have progressively bad eye floaters, in the last 10 years I have develope atrial fibrillation an lately tremors. I wonder if these are connected with the extended use?	In talking to my doctor he has told me that dilantin was used to deal with A Fib for many years. I wonder if there is any connection with onset from prolong use in people who never had it? I will add that Dilantin has kept me seizure free for 38 years though I still get aors from time to time. I am greatful for the drug despite the after affects.	M	53	38  years	10/23/2008Email
4	Seizure Condition	Fatigue or drowsiness (at times extreme) particularly in the early evening, increased difficulty finding the right words and/or remembering names, difficulty concentrating, irritability, sense of loss or feeling lost, lack of ambition, etc  I have listed my symptoms in order of prevalence and while Im not certain all are side effects of Dilantin, they seem to be shared by many.  The fact that I suffer from Sleep Apnea seems to amplify the drowsiness to the point that I often find it nearly impossible to watch a TV program or movie in the evening without falling asleep.  Once I have passed out cold on the couch (around 8:00 p.m.), my wife finds it nearly impossible to wake me and I often feel that coming out of sleep is very hard as if Im drunk, as one writer states below.  Once I finally wake up (around 11:00 p.m.), I find myself wide awake soon afterwards and unable to sleep again until the wee hours of the morning.  This frustrates my wife to no end	I have read all of the comments on this page and I understand, to some degree, how difficult many of your experiences have been.  I am grateful to have a fairly normal, seizure free life and realize that things could be much worse than having to deal with the side-effects of Dilantin.  Nonetheless, I know that it can be challenging and I try to take comfort in the hope that someday soon progress will be made towards understanding, preventing and perhaps even curing seizure disorders currently regarded as idiopathic.  In the meantime, I recommend that you send those near to you to this webpage so that they may read and gain a better understanding of what youre experiencing.  Good luck to all.

4	seizures	Only been taking drug three weeks, some slowing of my thought process.  3 seizures in sleep.  Crushed my L1 vertebrea during seizure.  Anyone ever heard of that?	Only seems to be slowing my thought process at this point.  Does that get better with time?	M	46	3  weeks	9/29/2008Email
5	grand-mal seizure	Totally lost my sense of balance, slow growths in mouth may eventually take over where my tongue is supposed to be, bone density is "compromised."	Only had two break-through seizures -- once when I forgot medicine for three days (teenager!) and once during reduced dose after pregnancy.  Yes, I went through two pregnancies and nursing for months afterward while on 2mg of dilantin.  Hard to attribute some things to side-effect of medicine -- but very easy to note that seizures are gone!	F	60	43  years	9/14/2008
4	Temporal lobe epilepsy head injury	Fatigue in the afternoons and concentration loss. Twitchiness as I am about to fall asleep. Drink coffee to counteract this. I sleep like a baby at night.  I have been taking 300mg every night for the last 15 years and have not had a single seizure during this time.  I am competative skydiver and have done long distance swimming too. I battle with conversations at times and as I often forget what I wanted to say. I have very vivid dreams.  I wondering if it is time reduce the dosage or experiment with other anti-epileptic drugs?	Been using dilantin for 15 years.	M	31	 	9/14/2008Email
4	Complex partial seizures	Swelling of the gums, fatigue	While having video monitor EEG done prior to temporal lobectomy, it was cut back. Frequency/severity of seizures increased. After surgery, seizures were controlled. Pharmacist switched to generic and THE GENERIC VERSION FAILED. Went back on brand and it is working.	M	46	40  days	8/27/2008
3	Sleep Seizures	I have taken what seems like em all. Dilantin, Keppra, tegretol, trileptal, the list goes on on and on. Dilantin is the only one that seems to work. But only when its at a good level. For some reason my levels go way up and down we think it was because of a couple thing DO NOT DRINK DIET POP while taking this medicine. It will cause your levels to drop. Side effects definately get the memory loss and dizzyness. I also have very VIVID dreams anyone else get that? I got some nasty teeth too	Like I said the only one that works for me too bad the side effects suck	M	29	17  years	8/22/2008Email
5	seizures	Only side effect seems to be growths on my skin especially on my face.  I have been on Dilantin for 32 years!  Tried others but others caused bad side effects.		F	50	32  years	8/16/2008Email
4	Bad accident - seizure	I do get tired in the afternoons and usually take a nap.  I have been that way ever since the accident.  I was put on Dilantin about 2 months after the accident when I had a grand mal.  I have been on it for about 3 years.  The only other side effect is that my gums swell, which sucks lots because the accident bought me some braces and it looks funny.  No big deal when I was originally a write off but things have gone amazingly well anyway.	I'm 27 and don't have any kids.  I guess Dilantin is one of the best seizure medications to be on if you are pregnant, so I'll stay on it.  Very few side effects on unborn babies.  Side effects on me aren't too bad but my gums are quite swollen.  I haven't had surgury to fix that yet.	F	27	3  years	8/10/2008Email
4	Idiopathic Epilepsy	Years ago at age 39, I experienced 2 gran mal seizures while asleep - 30 days apart. I was diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy and Dilantin was the best of the anti-convulsants I tried. I had petit mal seizures for a few years, but none after that. I've been taking 300 mg daily for 34 years. I had severe gum problems requiring sugery almost quarterly, which stopped completely after the first 10 years. I've had a slow developing neuropathy in my feet, and I know that Dilantin contributed to my osteoperosis (hip fracture 6 years ago). I was on Fosamax for 6 years with good results until recently. I was switched to Boniva with terrible side effecdts. My problem now is the possibility of coming off Dilantin to one of the newer drugs to better control the progress of the osteoperosis. Dilantin has been a great "work horse" drug for me despite the side effects. If changing causes me to lapse into a seizue, I may no longer be able to drive - or worse.	Younger women should clearly be aware of the need for conscientious dental health to control gum disease, as well as the risk for osteoperosis and drug-induced neuropathy with Dilantin. Otherwise, it's been a God-send for controlling seizures.	F	63	34  years	7/30/2008
1	Epilepsy	My IQ managed to drop ten points and I found problems with abstract thinking. My reading comprehension fell and my word usage became confused. My teeth hurt, and my eyes were twitching constantly.		M	20	2  years	6/28/2008
3	1 unexplained grand mal seizure	On 300 mg daily.  Just was reduced from 400 (2) 100 mg twice daily.  Trouble finding words, shaky hands, unable to focus, reading was a joke, dizzy, stumbled and lost balance, headache and not sure if this is from it but a lot more gas!  Also my tongue and gums are itchy.	I don't like it at all, but it stopped the seizure in the hospital.  I passed out while driving and was in and out of it in the ER when I had a grand mal seizure.  Was given Dilantin in the IV and it stopped it.  Have my first appt with a neurologist next week and would like to switch.  Still waiting on first blood levels to come back.	F	33	2  weeks	5/23/2008Email
4	gran tonic mal clonic epilepsy	chronic and often severe constipation, short term/ long term memory loss, reduced ability to concentrate, and tingling in the extremeties. no more writhing around on floors biting my tongue to a bloody pulp and waking up, injured, to voices of EMS people asking, "who is the president of the united states?" who take me to the hospital and charge me $2000 for the ride.	i forgot what i was going to say.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present.

I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor.

It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.	F	36	7  days2 MG 1X D	7/15/2010Email
2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
