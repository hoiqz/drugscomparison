2	Bipolar 1	Memory loss, insomnia depression/lack of motivation causing life events, anxiety	Pretty much was ok with a DepakoteER/Lamictal combo for Tx but I have come very concerned about memory retention through the last several years, general sadness and depression.  If I miss a couple doses, severe agitation kicks in.Marked negativity the last several months.  Doc seemed ok with "flat" mood most of the time during followups. Last appt. he recommended therapy for the depression but increased Lamictal. I just lost my 2nd job of 6 years, this last one due to oversleeping 2X (company policy -- termination). Brain fog with the job and performance, but have been concerned for a long time.  I really don't want to increase Depakote, caused brain fog before, or add a drug, have had it with this. I feel like I have lost a decade off my life, cannot even remember events where kids were growing up due to memory. Sometimes wife says "don't you remember that" I don't , it just makes me feel awful. Never had issues with the hair loss, just a little weight gain. God bless to everyone with mental health issues, there will be a special place in heaven for all of us, I am positive of that.	M	52	15  years1500 1X D	2/25/2013Email
4	Bipolar II + Borderline	Weight gain, about 10 pounds but that may be my own fault. Tiredness the first few weeks.	Mood seems much more stable, I was manic when it was prescribed. Titrated from 500mg to 1500mg over 3 days. I was initially reluctant to take any meds, but I feel much calmer and yet energetic at the same time, rather than agitated as usual in a hypomanic mood.	F	39	30  days1500mg 1X D	2/5/2013Email
4	Bipolar	initially spaciness and sleepiness as well as difficulty concentrating.  Weight gain and extreme hunger as well as some hair loss-this can be controlled with a multivitamin!  The weight gain and hunger are slowing down and after a couple of weeks, the thinking improved greatly.  Still get weird dreams, but I  have had much worse side effects than this from other meds, so I handle it well.	This is a good drug; anyone who says take lithium or another drug before this doesn't know what they are talking about,  everyone is different! Don't make general accusations about medicines and scare people away from something that may help them. Research is showing that people with different genes respond differently to bipolar medications, in fact lithium made me much worse, and there is new research that supports that apoptosis may increase in people who don't do well on lithium.  My mood is much more stable, irritability, jealousy and anger are all but gone, and I exercise to keep the depression at bay.  This is my second time on the drug, it worked wonders the first time too, but my liver enzymes shot up, not happening this time though, and God willing, it won't.  Do I like taking medicine? No. Do I have a choice. No. So I will go with the one that works best, and no drug is perfect.  Realize that now and you will be better off.  As long as they are tolerable.Thank you God for letting me be successful on this!	M		3  months1500 mg 1X D	11/26/2012
3	Bipolar Disorder		Update: The tremors have lessened, but the heartburn is worse and I have now developed scalp pain and hair loss. I will be discontinuing the med and will have to hope that Seroquel will do the trick for mania.	F	41	 2250 1X D	11/25/2012EmailHistory
4	Seizure (convulsions)	Weight Gain and that's with dieting and exercise. Always feel hungry and can eat larger amounts than ever been able too! Lazy/Tiredness.. But stop convulsion..		F	32	4  months1000	10/9/2012
1	Bi-Polar	weight gain, tremors in hands, menstrual irregularities, short term memory loss, tingling in arms, swelling of lower legs and ankles, heat sensitivity.	I was tapered of Depakote and have been off this medication for 3 weeks.  I feel clearer mentally and the adverse symptoms have lessened or ceased altogether.	F	49	8  months750 mg 1X D	9/6/2012Email
5	BiPolar I	The first month I was doing 500mg/day and felt no side effects. I researched the heck out them, so I knew that weight gain was very possible. I immediately quit soda! lol I love soda. I did not lose nor gain the first month, so I think that I counteracted the weight gain. The last 2 weeks, I have been increased to 750mg per day at bedtime, and I have experienced some quickness of the digestive system. No problem, though. Makes me feel detoxified! I do not feel sleepy, rather more energetic. Sometimes mildly manic. For the increase these last 2 weeks, I have started running again (well, it is 1/2 run and 1/2 walk right now). Still, no weight gain, but I am ready with more ammunition if I see any creepers.	I was on Lithium 750mg for over 2 years, from when I was first diagnosed, but my blood tests showed that my thyroid went haywire (hypo) and my kidney(s?) started struggling, so we switched me to Depakote. I was nervous because I FEAR change, but I honestly feel better! I feel like there was a fog (maybe from the Lithium) has cleared and I am happier. I went through a few different antidepressants the last 2 years because I think the Lithium had me a little smothered. When I first switched, I went through a couple of weeks where I was EXTREMELY agitated and irritable...over-sensitive and over-reacting. I think that was the withdrawal from the Lithium. I feel better now, although I will admit to some excited anxiety...another scary way to say mania. My biggest fear of all of the side effects was weight gain, but I hope to be able to control it. Most of the other side effects were the same as Lithium, so I have already been dealing with swollen hands and feet, hair loss, and tremors for over 2 years. My hair fell OUT with Lithium. I lost half my density...but I got a shorter style and did a Keratin strength treatment and my hair has not felt better in 10 years. The Depakote is better than Lithium for me, so far. Should have tried it sooner, but the weight gain scared me away.	F	36	1.5  months750mg 1X D	5/26/2012Email
3	Bipolar II, GAD	Loss of appetite, tired heavy feeling that comes in waves, nausea, dizziness, sexual function is actually better... But I'm also on wellbutrin and vyvanse, which increase libido, foggy/distant feeling... But I had some of that before.		F	24	1  weeks500 mg	4/29/2012
3	Bipolar	Severe tremor/shakiness, bad constipation, extreme nausea throughout the day.	Worked wonderful for mood stabilization but the side effects outweigh the positives. Was sad to have to get off of it since it was working for my bipolar.	F	26	3  months1500 2X D	4/23/2012
3	Epilepsy	Stomach Pain, Nausea, GERD, Foggy Brain, Memory Problems, Verbal Problems, Slowed Speech, Extreme Fatigue, Tremors, Bone Loss, Mild Hair Loss, Loss of Sex Drive and life in general.	Prior to taking Depakote I did not have any of the symptoms stated in side-effects.  I was a very active, hard working young career woman.  I was diagnosed w/epilepsy after having a grand mal seizure at 32 yrs old.  After bad experiences w/tegretol and mysoline it was determined Depakote was the best drug for me.  After all these years I am still having these "side effects" which some have turned into real health problems.  Such as:  I have severe osteoporosis - broke 3 ribs and my foot getting out of bed 2 yrs ago.  I struggle with major stomach pain, nausea and GERD on a daily basis.  I literally shake now.  And last but not least I feel like I have early onset Alzheimers because of the brain fog and memory problems.  Seems like I can't put 2 words together.  I have an appointment w/ my neurologist next week to discuss going off the medication.  I have not had a seizure since 1988 and most of my EEGs have been good.  Don't get me wrong, I think Depakote does a great job, but for me the side effects just don't seem worth it.  I can't work.  I want more out of life.	F	56	22  years500 MG 2X D	3/14/2012Email
4	Bipolar disorder	I found with this medication I gained 15 lbs. Also my orgasms seem to take a longer amount of time to be reached. Other than that I am very please with this medication. It serves it's purpose in keeping my moods stable.		F	32	2  years500 mg	12/10/2011
5	Bipolar Disorder	Very mild sexual dysfunction (slightly delayed orgasm), mild nausea if taken with no food, otherwise no nausea.	So far my side effects have been far fewer with Depakote than with many of the other mood-stabilizing drugs I have been tried on.  Some sedated me, others put 40 pounds on me, one gave me tremors.  I've experienced none of that with Depakote.  Not every drug is for every person, but this one has worked very well for me.	M	30	6  weeks500 2X D	10/28/2011
2	Seizure control	My daughter began taking Depakote for years, ages 3-7 on a high dosages due to seizures. It controlled seizures.  Her mood swings where terrible, anger, could not learn in school. Kicking biting, hitting and self injurious behavior. Again it controlled her seizures but the behaviors are not acceptable. We are now on Lamictal doing better for about 2 years now.	Never give up on your kids. They ONLY have us, no one else cares like you do....That is why you are on this site.	F	3	4  years300mg 3X D	9/7/2011Email
5	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Insomnia, reflux, diarrhea, bloating, dry skin, hair loss, achy teeth, teeth clenching, seeing things that aren't there, sore breasts, weight gain, short-term memory loss, mental fogginess.	You get used to the side effects.  I now have to drug myself with Restoril to get to sleep.  Despite all of the side effects, I still give Depakote a "5".  I'm hoping my hair will eventually grow back.  I gained 11 lbs in less than 3 weeks.  At least I'm happy!	F	44	3  months1000 MG 1X D	9/1/2011Email
3	Severe Migraines/Clusters	I started at 250mg Depakote ER 1x/night.  After a week I took myself off of it due sleeping 10-13 hrs. a night and still feeling extremely tired/drowsy during the day.  Due to the severity of the daily pain and migraines I was having and at the recommendation of my Dr. I went back on it w/in 2 weeks. I increased the dose from 250mg to 500mg after a week. I figured that since I was incapacitated by pain every day maybe the Depakote would help, and that even if I was sleeping all day/night, at least I wouldn't be in pain.  Besides extremely vivid dreams, the extreme tiredness is the only side effect that I've experienced.	I've been on Depekote for 4 weeks now and went from having daily migraines/moderate to extreme pain every day to having none/dull headache after 10 days on the med. Been mostly pain free since.  HOWEVER, the side effect of sleeping 10-13 hrs every day and still feeling like I could sleep all day is making me consider whether or not to continuing taking this med.  Dr. said these side effects would mitigate but they have not.  My main goal is to get back to work, but cannot do so if in pain everyday or unable to function due to extreme drowsiness - catch 22.Background:  I've suffered from migraines for 10 years with increasing frequency/pain within the past five years averaging 8-15 a month.  This fall and last fall have been especially bad.  Over the years, I had tried every preventative and they have either not been effective or the side effects were too extreme. This fall I suffered from especially severe migraines/possible clusters that led me to the brink.  My neurologist is prescribing Botox injections which ins. just approved but am hesistant about this tx.	M	31	4  weeks500mg 1X D	11/27/2010Email
5	Anxiety & Mood Swings	I'm a lean guy, in shape. I just think I got used to any of the side effects years ago. Blood work/cholesterol/BP always good.	I have stuck with this drug.  I tried changing once & realized how much it helps me. My life is far from perfect but I never get too 'high' or 'low'. I depend on it. Full head of hair too.	M	38	10  years500 2X D	10/31/2010
1	Bipolar / depression	Severe tremoring in hands, insomnia, memory loss, increased saliva	Severe tremors/shaking in hands. Also taking lithium & abilfy, so completely unsure which drug is causing this. My short term memory is horrible and I find myself pausing to think about what I'm talking about. Severe saliva which is completely embarrassing if you're talking to someone. I was told to give everything at least 4 weeks but from these comments it doesnt sound like it will get better. I havent experienced any hair loss thankfully and I have no appettie (and I can't spell either anymore). Total insomnia.	F	35	14  days1500 1X D	9/7/2010Email
5	Migraines and Anxiety	Wow, what a difference!  I am so happy I have maintained this drug.  I quit once and was quickly reminded how it is without it.	It really does work.	F	39	3  years500mg 2X D	6/1/2010
3	mipolar, mood stabilization	unsure yet. acne, diarrhea, EXTREME irritability and tearfulness, dnagerouse thoughyts....	just went off lithium that i had been on for 4 years...not sure if these changes are from this, b/c they kinda came on before  or b/c my hormone levels are severally out of whack. I take progesterone and have for years as well...but was off it , then back on etc...when i first began depakote it was good, these recent abnormal things have occurred in last month, around my cyle	F	37	4  weeks1500mg 1X D	5/30/2010Email
1	schizoaffective disorder	I literally slept 2 1/2 yrs of my life away and gained 135lbs i could not get out of bed	this medicine was not for me i didnt benefit from it i had no life behind my eyes my family said i didnt laugh cry or get angry no matter what that was when i was awake usually i took my morning dose at 8am slept 12 hours then took the night dose and there went all my hope until one day i missed my morning dose and sat on the couch i sat there till bedtime and realized it was the medicine and not my mental diagnosis i begged my doc to lower the dose she did after 8 months she put me on 500mg a day down from 1000mg i was able to bath again and watch tv and enjoy it do laundry cook badly and all kinds of stuff i told her this and she said looks like were gonna have to raise it again but by that time i was down to 125mg i said ok to her but went home and split the 125mg tab in half took it for a month and split half a tablet in half took that 4 a month and i havent been on it in a year but this medicine is dangerous it can make you convulse if you quit cold turkey so do it slowly if you decide to well thats my story good luck and bless you	F	31	3  years500mg 2X D	5/2/2010Email
5	Epilepsy from car accident	This drug is very good for epilepsy. i've tried so many others like Tegretal, Keppra, Trileptal they all caused chest pains but this drug does not. Depakote does have tolerable side effects compared to chest pains. Causes weight gain, everything tastes like a gourmet meal, hair loss is very thin and wispy. So fatigued in the afternoon. a lot of stomach issues, gas, bloating, diarrhea then constipaion. Ugghh !But I'm seizure free! You must do some kind of exercise on this drug to keep the weight down.	Was on regular Depakote for 20 years and had more weight gain.	F	49	3  years500 mg 1X D	3/19/2010
5	Migraines	15-20 lbs of weight gain, extreme tiredness in the mornings, seems like you never get enough sleep.  Calms your nerves however, makes me more relaxed during the day, helps me speaking in public.  Prevents the daily headaches I was experiencing and reduces the severity of my migraines.	Only migraine preventative medicine that worked for me, I have managed to decrease dosage down from 1000 mg per day and the medicine is still effective. I've experienced withdrawal symptoms coming down on dosage, takes weeks to taper down, very edgy during this period.	M	39	3  years250 mg 1X D	3/5/2010
3	Migraine prevention	Lost a lot of my hair, gained 20 lbs, hands shake.		F	48	9  months1000 mg 1X D	2/24/2010
1	bipolar	Memory problems (left food cooking on high and left the house to go shopping), constipation, muscle and joint pain, painful inflamed rash on lower abdomen and itchy over entire body, hair & eye lashes falling out.	My mind felt calm and ok but my body was reacting strongly negatively to the medication.	F	57	7  days250 mg 1X D	2/21/2010
1	mania	I was prescribed 500 mg ER in the a.m. and 1,000 mg at bedtime. The night dose really made me tired. I could barley function at night to get up with up with my one year old son. So his father stayed up all night and took care of him while I slept. She lowered the dose at bedtime to 500 mg. I really like that they help threwout the whole day. Certain times of the early afternoon or night I get worked up. I dont like that it causes weight gain though. I will see if there is another medicine that I can take for mania that doesnt do that. I also take Buspar 20 mg twice daily and 300 mg of Wellbutrin Xl. The combination is helping so far.	My mother took Depakote and Serequol and Lithium for Bipolar Disorder. It helped her with the racing thoughts and frequent outburts of rage.	F	22	1  weeks	2/3/2010
1	Bipolar/Severe Anxiety Disorder	Going against my better judgement, I agreed to start Depakote from my new psych. even after I had heard countless of horror stories, thinking maybe it would be my "miracle" drug....and I was dead wrong. I was started on a medium doseage of 1500mg and within a week I couldn't leave my house. I was so detached from the world. I had no emotion, no connection to reality. And even worse, it didn't treat my anxiety. So I was trying to function in a zombie-like-state with a constant high-anxiety. I didn't even want to talk. And I'm one of those annoying girls who can't keep her mouth shut. My friends were literally scared of me. I called my Dr. crying at the end of the week before I was supposed to get my blood levels drawn, crying, the only emotion I had, telling them that they either medically had to take me off of it or I was just going to flush the pills dow the toilet myself. PLEASE STAY AWAY!!!!	PLEASE, I BEG YOU DO NOT TAKE IT!	F	19	1  weeks	1/29/2010
3	JME/Epilepsy	Hair loss, insomnia, constipation	I started taking it when diagnosed with JME (turns out it was permanent) and have had chronic constipation and insomnia since (on Ambien for sleep).  When my MD decided, without informing me) to up my dose from 750 mg of regular Depakote to 1000 mg Depakote ER I started to experience constant, abnormal hair loss.  I'm seeing the MD soon to get switched to something else and hopefully get rid of some of these symptoms.	F	27	15  years	1/4/2010
5	Anxiety	Some initial heartburn, mostly minor stuff that passed.	I am an executive that needs to make quick decisions and remain calm.  I have been taking 750mg of Depakote ER since the year 2000 (when it was introduced).  It has saved my career.  I work out and remain active and have gained no weight.  I also have a full head of hair.	M	37	10  years	12/29/2009
1	Bipolar	INCREASED HUNGER, Lethargy, Drowsiness, CLOUDY THINKING, Irritated	I work in a job that requires quick accurate thinking and deals with finance numbers. On this drug not only am I ready to sleep all day, I am more irritated and can't think straight. my doctor is taking me off of depakote and starting zyprexa which based off of everything i have read is not good either. I was diagnosed as bipolar at 16 but have not been on meds for the past 7 years. I was stable until 12 weeks ago when I decided to quit smoking. since then I have had uncontrolable rage and my mood swings are changing within hours. My husband actually left for 3 days to force me to get help. I need a medication that will not impair my thinking or I am going to lose my job.	F	31	7  days	12/9/2009Email
1	Depression/Anxiety	SEVERE Fatigue! Flattened me like a mack truck! 1000 mg dose for two weeks then weaned off to 500 mg for a week.  Took another week to start feeling more normal.  Withdrawal headaches, shakiness and felt like crap for a few days.	Don't know why the doctor put me on this for depression after a suicide attempt.  It made me miss 3 more weeks of school. I usually work out twice a day (athlete) but couldn't do more than flop on the couch or sleep the 3 weeks I was on it.  Currently on 10 mg Lexapro and 2 mg Abilify which is working GREAT!	M	17	21  days	11/2/2009
1	BiPolar Disorder	The major side effect I was experiencing constantly was insomnia.  Not a very good issue when you are a BiPolar patient.		F	30	 	10/15/2009Email
5	Bipolar II	Some sleepiness at about the 4-5 hr mark, some gastro effects (i.e. constipation, diarrhea, mild).  Vivid dreams, though not bad.  Just, well, animated at times.	A great drug when the right dose is found.  I'm currently on 2000mg/day at bedtime, and this is the first time in years I've been able to sleep pretty well.  Very helpful with the mania.  I am much more relaxed and in control of myself.  Can think more clearly without all of the "mental clutter" that I had before. Overall a very good drug.	F	37	2  months	9/24/2009
2	Migraine	Increased sensitivity to my nerves! Anyone else feel like nails on a chalkboard after taking this for a while?! Or sensitivity to touching paper? Also, very tired in the morning. When I first started taking it, I got severe stomach cramps for a few days, but then it subsided. Some hair loss, and probably no weight gain only because I've been very careful to keep it off.	Didn't work for my migraines. Onto the next med...	F	25	3  months	9/22/2009
5	Anxiety/Mood Swings	When I switched to the Extended Release version none	There is no question this medicine helps me a lot.  It's effects on anxiety are hard to explain.  I just know I will be stable regardless of what the situation is.  It stabilizes my mood, which is what I want.  I take 750mg per day.	M	28	4  years	9/19/2009
5	Seizure disorder	weight gain	The only seizures I've had were when I was off Depakote.  Battling weight gain and paying its steep price (until it went generic recently) are decent trade-offs.	M	50	21  years	9/7/2009
1	Bipolar I	Obsessive suicidal thoughts	I was fine until I reached the low therapeutic level. My thoughts ALWAYS involved suicide after that.	M	32	1  months	8/17/2009
5	anxiety	While reportings of hair loss, weight gain and memory loss are prevalent, I have little. I'm on 250mg/day. I've noticed a slight headache about 5-6 hrs after dosage, making me sleepy, but relaxed. Due to my work schedule, I take at 11:30 am my headhache occurs at 5-6 pm and by 7pm I'm just relaxed. I've been watching for weight gain but in fact have lost weight, I just don't feel hungry. Because I'm hypoglycemic, I used to eat every 2 hrs to control by blood sugar, but I don't have this problem anymore. Thank God for my habit of eating because with Depakote I wouldn't think to eat at all. I have notice some hair loss. Minor. Memeory, it may take me minute to remember the lastest but I still remember all of the old. I'm not aware of what day it is, but that's okay. Life is alltogether better and living one day at a time, like it should be. I'm 100% more focused and getting more things done without feeling stressed to get it all done. I wish I would of been on this 10 yrs ago, but everyt		F	39	 	8/14/2009
4	bi-polar	I did gain 10 pounds and have hand tremors sometimes. Other than that, it has helped me to focus better. I still have some manic episodes but not as many.		F	52	4  years	7/23/2009
5	Mood Swings & Anxiety	Some tiredness at times and occassional indigestion but it has really worked great for me.		M	28	3  years	7/2/2009
3	Bipolar II	hair loss, fatigue, very vivid dreams/nightmares (I sometimes confused dreams with memories), impaired memory., fatigue, hard time focusing, hard time communicating efficiently, made some of my gastrointestinal issues worse, sexual side effects	Have been taking 1250mg each night for several years for my bipolar disorder. It's hard to differentiate between side effects of this medication and the symptoms of all my other disorders because of the way things happened when I went on the meds, and ever since then. I could have more than this but I'm fairy certian the stated effects are in fact due to this medication.It HAS helped curve my mood swings but I don't feel that it is doing enough. I'm going to go to my doctor to try and find a med that works better for me. After all, there are plenty I haven't tried.	F	20	2  years	7/2/2009
4	Seizures due to car accident	Daily fatigue, lots of gas, constipation then diarrhea after meals, belly weight gain, poor vision.	Losing a 1/3 of my hair, gained 40 lbs in 5 months. Enough explosive gas to power a small outboard boat motor,constipation, diarrhea and fatigue, no sex drive,poor eyesight, this drug makes me feel like I am 90. But NO seizures! Keppra, Lamictal, Trileptal all gave me chest pains and break through petite Mal seizures.:^)	F	49	3  years	6/26/2009
4	Bipolar / Mood Disorders	Weight gain (50 lbs in 2.5 years), increased appetite, difficulty waking in the morning, markedly decreased libido.	I stopped taking this drug at the recommendation of my therapist after two years of therapy. I had been diagnosed as bipolar following a period of drug abuse, and didn't exhibit the signs after being clean for a while. After coming off of this drug, I did notice that I had to make a more conscious effort to concentrate for a while. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. As I wasn't taking it for seizures, I didn't taper off, I just stopped taking it. I had no withdrawal symptoms other than the one mentioned above. Within one month of stopping this drug, I lost 15 pounds and my appetite was more normal. My libido remained diminished due to other medications.	M	31	2.5  years	6/14/2009
3	MIgraine prevention/Type II Bipolar	depression, anxiety,stomach pains. Felt like I was 'losing it'.	Did prevent migraines, but at the cost of me crying my eyes out on the floor. When that passed I just felt like I was 'blah' all day. Not happy, not sad. Just in limbo. Angry outbursts too.	F	35	2  years	6/7/2009
4	migraine	none so far		M	62	2  months	3/27/2009
3	Type II Bipolar	I've been taking it for 14 days. Initially I was very euphoric, it seemed like a wonder drug, but then the side effects kicked in. So far I am experiencing an increased appetite, very vivid dreaming and recall, memory loss, and I THINK I have confused a dream with reality at least once, and I KNOW I have completely forgotten a whole conversation, plus the depression has gotten worse. I'm hoping that increasing my anti-depressant will improve that. I take Depakote ER in conjunction with Wellbutrin XL and Buspar for anxiety.	I'm going to give it about 5 more weeks for the sides to level off and if not I'll switch meds (again!) I was on Lithium before but it was ruining my skin. I think I'll try Topomax next if this doesn't work	F	32	14  days	3/27/2009Email
2	Possibly bipolar, "drug withdrawls"	Hair loss, visual hallucinations, spacey-feeling, weight gain, acne, constipation, high liver enzyme count. I also get horrible stomach pains every few days since i started taking it, but I'm not sure if that's from the meds or not.	At 1000mg I experienced weight gain, hair loss, zombie like feeling, constipation, trails in my vision, and a high liver enzyme count. At 1250mg I felt completely out of it, with all of the symptoms enhanced. Now at 500mg there's constipation, acne,  and still losing some hair. I guess my mood is stable, but my doctor isn't all that great and gives me the runaround like no other.	M	20	11  months	3/22/2009
3	MOOD DISORDER POSSIBLY BIPOLAR	So Far I am just really tired.. I notice it leaves me feeling high after taking it, but my doctor said that will go away with time and so will the tiredness. I havent noticed any weight gain but it has only been a week. I was on 250 mg for 4 days (accidently missed a dose) and 500 for the past 3 days (accidently missed a dose on that too)	It has helped me slightly so far. I feel sort of dazed but dont feel like punching someone in the face in the last couple of days	F	21	8  days	1/21/2009Email
5	Partial Szr/Bipolar	At first some weight gain, about 10 pounds.  Like the person below I used to take the regular and now take the extended release version.  Less side effects, weight back to normal.	Where do I start?  I used to have 7-10 partial seizures a year.  One limb shaking uncontrollably and I never knew when it would happen.  On top of that I have Bipolar disorder.  I had side effects with Lamictal, Tegretol, and Dilantin and still had seizures.  Dilantin was before the BP diagnosis.  Like the person below, I have NEVER had a seizure on Depakote/Depakote ER.  I have confidence and don't worry anymore.  I have my good and bad days like everyone but my moods are better and I this med slams the door on any seizure activity.	M	36	9  years	1/10/2009
5	Seizure disorder-JME	Weight gain, hair loss	I took regular Depakote for years before ER was available.  Both have been great for my seizure disorder (Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy, or JME).  Weight gain is the big downside, and as I got over age 40 I have gained weight.  Am now really focusing on diet and exercise, but have never had a seizure while on Depakote - can't say that for any other of the meds I've tried other than Keppra which is also a good one for me.  I tried Lamictal (couldn't get seizure free on it without feeling really dizzy all the time) and Topamax (bad digestive side effects and double vision), so for me Depakote is a life-saver.

5	Bipolar	Compared to other meds I have taken not many and they did eventually go away.  My body must have ajusted.	At least I am never nervous anymore and focus is fine.  I love this medicine.	M	31	4  years	1/3/2009
5	Chronic daily headache	Slight,but not noticeable hair loss in the beginning, weight gain of about 40lbs in 3 years I've been on the medication. I have also experienced a little bit of lethargy.. seems I don't quite have the energy that I used to.	After having one headache that lasted 2 years, I feel like Depakote ER gave me my life back.  Within two weeks after starting it, my headache was all but gone. I am now using it for prevention. I love this med, inspite of the weight gain, which I am now trying very hard to control through diet and exercise.  Being pain free is so wonderful.  I still have an occasional headache that I control with Fiorinal.  I can function/work/enjoy life again.  I would like to get off this drug eventually, but it does seem like everytime I try to scale back the dosage and get off of it, the headaches return.  .. hopefully that will change in time.

2		Very hard time focusing, it was ADHd all over again. Amnesia!!!!! Amnesia!!!!! I couldn't remember a thing!! And a little weight gain.	I'm a college student, so all I care about is focusing. Some people call this drug the gold standard. This drug works miracles for people and I hope it does for you. But as for me, well it caused more problems then it was set out to cure.	M	19	3  weeks	12/4/2008Email
5	Bipolar	Not many at all and they went away.	I can't believe some of the things people say about this drug on this board.  It has helped me big time and it's not a 'zombie med to be avoided'.  That's just stupid.  I am 5'11 and work out every day.  I weigh 172 pounds and have all of my hair.  I take 750mg a day and am an executive who interacts with people every day.  It's helpful, not hurtful.	M	29	4  years	9/14/2008
5	Mania/Migraines	Everything tastes like a gourmet meal, slight weight gain (though necessary as I suffer from anorexia), vivid dreams, sociopathic tendencies, insomnia	I have gained weight since taking Depkote, but since I was 90 pounds before, this is a good thing.  I'm much more clever and well-liked now (probably because I went off Topamax).  I feel very balanced in moods.  However, I'm extremely sociopathic now (even if people are drawn to me).  I care nothing about the feelings of others, I indirectly hurt others if I think it will benefit me, I don't care what people say about me, I tell people whatever I want (bad in customer service), and I cut out many people in my life because I stopped caring about them.  I feel no guilt about anything anymore and I don't care about others.  This is likely unhealthy, but honestly, I don't care as only others seem to get hurt by this.	F	26	3  months	8/15/2008Email

1	Bipolar 1 disorder	Horrible, crippling nausea	This was the 2nd of 3 meds the dr. has prescribed 4 me since being diagnosed 10 mos. ago w/ bipolar 1. I was given Lamictal 1st & it absolutely saved my life by very nearly eliminating the depression I had suffered thru for 3 yrs. The mania, however, began affecting me agn in Jan which is when I was given Depakote ER. The 1st 2 days were fine, no side effects. The next 3 wks, however, were hell. I was doubled over w/ debilitating nausea. I cld not get out of bed & was unable 2 do anything but lay there & try not 2 vomit. I felt horrible & was in agonizing pain. Finally, I talked 2 the dr. who said 2 immediately stop taking it & go back 2 Lamictal exclusively. I am not saying this is a bad medicine just that, 4 some ppl, this meds side effects are far 2 harsh 2 deal with. It was not even possible 4 me 2 function while on this med. I do not know how it effected my mania because I was not on it 4 long & felt only pain while on it. Luckily 4 me, though, my dr. put m	F	26	3  weeks	7/19/2008
5	Anxiety	None at a low dose.	I love these people that say DO NO TAKE IT!!  That's the worst advice ever.  It has worked for me, calmed me down.  It may or may not work for you but try some of the other meds and see how you react to them compared to Depakote ER.	F	28	4  years	6/16/2008
5	Anxiety / Mood Swings		I have taken this drug since it was introduced as an extended release in 2000 and it has been great. I take 750mg and I can depend on it.  It has eliminated my anxiety and helped my moods.  I do take a multi-vitamin with it, always have.  I trust this drug.	M	36	8  years	6/16/2008

Depakote (1400mg a day) dramatically improved the mixed manic states with zero side effects. It also really improved the depression aspect even though its not known to do that. Not that I am complaining	M	28	2  months	5/22/2008

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself.

4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me.

Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite.

1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010

I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
