1	Allergies	Have been treated for high eye pressure for over 30 years.  Both my allergist and eye doctor were aware of this.   I had looked at the side effects of this when I first started using and hever noticed any side effects for high eye pressure. Pressure went very high after cataract surgery, they then discovered glaucoma.  Several months later I looked at the precautions section for Beconase AQ and noticed that this should not be used if you have uncontrolled Glaucoma.  So I was advised to stop...    5 years later and numerous eye surgeries later, my Glaucoma is still not under control, and I have not used Beconase AQ since.  I am now wondering if my extended use of Beconase AQ contributed to the uncontrolled Glaucoma.   REMEMBER TO READ THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS YOURSELF, DO NOT RELY ON YOUR DOCTOR...

1	nasal congestion and runny nose	My first side effect from Beconase was grogginess, which passed by the third day.  I also experienced severe insomnia while on this medication beginning on the second or third day.  By the fourth or fifth day, my knees had begun to ache.  After seven or eight days, the pain in my shoulders, arms, hips, groin, and legs was so severe that 50 mg. of Tramadol did not stop it.  I have discontinued the Beconase.  It isn't worth it.  I'll take Sudafed with my Claritin.  Not only will I not suffer the above side effects, but I won't have to worry about the side effects of steroids, either.		F	59	8  days	2/4/2006
