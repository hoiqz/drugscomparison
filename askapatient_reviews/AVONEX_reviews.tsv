4	RRMS	Flu like symptoms for a couple of injections. Serious depression, anxiety, achiness, and "the blues" after about 6 to 8 months.	I loved the convenience of the medication. I had to get regular bloodwork. I didn't want to believe the blues was caused by the medication, but I have been off of it for about 6 weeks now and I feel like a new person. No blues or depression, greater energy level, clearer thought process.	F	40	1  years30 MG 1X W	8/13/2012Email
5	MS	Flu like symptoms Mostly chills fever aches  Some depression Increased numbness in feet and legs for day or so that goes away		F	55	4  years30 mcg	3/14/2012
2	Multiple Sclerosis	Pain down my spine, severe chills, flu like symptoms, major depression, nausea, headaches, muscle spasm, joint pain.	The twitching and numbing came and went as if I was never on any medication. I just got diagnosed a few months ago, so I really can't tell what's normal for me and what isn't. I don't feel it helped me at all with the twitching/numbness as these ocurred on/off all the time. It made me moody and I lost a few pounds, which was probably the only positive thing out of this.

4	MS	In the beginning I was having flu like symptoms (chills/sweats, headache, achey muscles, etc).  But after about 3 months these symptoms completely stopped and now I have no problems.  Sometimes I bruise at injection site, just depends it seems pretty random.	I like avonex a lot, I have been on it for 2 years and have only had one relapse and 1 small new lesion.  My husband gives me my weekly injection (I was doing it myself but all of a sudden developed anxiety about it and since he has taken over I have no anxiety about the actual injection). When I was having side effects I found it helpful to drink LOTS of water the day of injection and take alieve every six hours the day of and the day after.  I no longer take the alieve but I make sure to be really hydrated and it seems to work.	F	25	2  years 1X W	8/30/2010
