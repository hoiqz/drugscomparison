ACCOLATE	1	Adult onset Severe Asthma COPD	Ear aches with loss of hearing in left ear, colitis, weight gain, sinus infections, lack of concentration	Quit taking accolade 4 months ago, breathing actually got better.  My peak flows increased 50-75 points.  I have not had an earache since although my ear is still stopped up.  Have lost around 10 lbs effortlessly.  Am still on Advair and would like to be able to discontinue it but my throat tightens when I skip a dose.   Had severe analypic shock with throat swelling when taking Prednisone. Was able to get off that after 15 yrs of heavy doses.  The cure was the cause.	F	69	10  years	11/22/2008Email
