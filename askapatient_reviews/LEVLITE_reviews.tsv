1	birth control	Extremely moody, more emotional than I've ever been in my life, swollen/tender breast (even after 3mo) & bad acne. Periods are also longer & heavier. Used to last 3 days, now about 7.	I have never been the person to get break outs, even in high school, but ever since I have been on this BC I have had the WORST acne I've ever had! I snap at my husband on a daily basis & I get emotional & tear up/cry over little things. I NEVER used to be a cryer. I like the bigger boobs, but not the pain. Its comforting to see Im not alone here.	F	28	3  months0.1/0.02 1X D	2/24/2011
3	To regulate my period/	I just ended my period and it was the worst 7 days of my life. I layed on the couch in the worst pain i've ever been in in my entire life. The cramps were unbearable, huge blood clots, going through at least 15 tampons a day. Craziness. My breasts are so sore, I get very irritated easily, freaking out on my boyfriend for no reason...getting upset when he would touch me...let alone try and have sex.

3	birth control	I've gained 10lbs, periods supposed to be lighter, are heavier than my normal ones, and last longer. About 7 days now, compared to before my norm was 3 days. Breasts enlarged, the only side effect I like. Mood swings seem worse now too.		F	20	4  months 1X D	9/14/2010
4	Regulate cycle	Heavy cycles but regulated cycles. Mood balanced, mellow and calm attitude, less irritated more emotional.	So far so good for me. Before taking Levlite, I had horrible mood swings. I would wake up angry and typically anything would make me angry. I started taking Levlite after talking to my doctor about my ridiculously irregular cycle (1 cycle every 5-6 months). The only things I am concerned about are my extremely heavy cycles, they last for nearly two weeks, so it seems like the are frequent. During the cycles I feel extreme fatigue. But I would recommend this to anyone that has mood swings, irregular cycles...	F	26	4  months0.02 1X D	6/6/2010Email
2	BC/Regulate Cycle	Extreme psychotic depression and some initial spotting	I'm so glad I found this page of reviews. For the past week I have been extremely depressed & psychotic: ie, freaking out over NOTHING and recognizing that fact but NOT being able to control the rage I felt b/c of it...on top of crying every single day-a lot. I've NEVER been this way, so I figured it was a combo of quitting smoking and pms, b/c normally I'm not THIS bad; However after reading others' comments, I believe it could be due to this new pill and I'm going to ask my dr to change.

1	birth control	i didnt relize that this bc did this to me untill i read everyones side effects from this site, i got these side effects during and after taking levlite28 it gave me depression and when people on here r talking about being psychotic i think they mean it makes them do or say things u wouldnt do cuz i freaked out on my bf on the littlest thing and i knew it when i was doing it but i was taking things way beyond and it was hard to controll but it also gave me back pains, it made me very sensitive w/ emotions & pyshically being touched even sexually, it also gave me lack of energy and even motivation, i got off of this bc a yr and 1 month in cuz i was getting these pains in my uterus then after 6 months of being off i was still getting the pains, i found i have mini sists that i get cuz my body is producing to many hormones which never happend be4 taking this bc	i would'nt recomend this to any1, i didnt even relize that this was the reason for my problems, i thought it was just me but i found more people with the same side effects and thanks to this page im not going back to LEVLITE its good to look up any medicine u get cuz i was making sure i wanted to go back on this bc but now im not	F	18	1  years	10/6/2008Email
2	birth control	migraines, terrible mood swings, discharge, spotting, high blood pressure, hard to lose weight, lack of sex drive	been on lessina since shortly after the birth of my second child...2yrs.  I started paying attention to what my body was going thru and it finally dawned on me that it was the bc.  Going to be "fixed" thru the essure process, so will never have to be on bc again...and hopefully all this stuff will end.	F	40	2  years	5/4/2008
1	Too control heavy bleeding	Heart attack, blood clots in legs and lungs, hospitalized twice.Must use blood thinners permanently. Doctor was careless and issued my wife 30 day samples without regarding her age and medical history. This product left permanent damage after 3 wks use.	After exhaustive research of this product and birth control in general. I want everyone to imagine being slowly poisoned over years. I hear women claim that they receive excellent benefits from birth control with no side effects except when they are diagnosed with ovarian cancers, breast problems, pelvic disorder's, etc. their doctors will cover all the possible scenarios that contributed to the problems, but are silent about may have been the culprit for the deaths of so many women: Birth Control pills.  Some doctors and medical scientist are stepping up to the plate now and sounding the alarm. But others in the medical, pharmaceutical and legal professions will only look out for one factor: The Mighty Dollar.  Fact: Any food or drug that alters the natural function of the human body or counters from what it was designed to do, will cause adverse effects. That is what Birth Control does.  You can trust the hype and play games with your health. Or get serious and educate yourselves. Th	F	53	3  weeks	4/19/2008Email
5	all other BC's made me SICK!!	With the NAME brand Levlite I have experienced no side effects. With the GENERIC form I became psychotic, emotional, and extremely moody.	I would suggest anyone that uses the GENERIC form and has had bad side effects try the NAME brand. The name brand makes my periods light, last maybe a day or two, no emotionally mood swings or PMS or cramps AT ALL. However, the GENERIC was horribly awful. Wish my insurance covered the name brand because it is expensive but worth it in many ways.	F	27	6  years	4/1/2008Email
2		First month I bled for 2 weeks, second month I had the most awful cramps I've ever had, third month I still had awful cramps, to the point of almost fainting, and some breakthrough bleeding.  Also, my stomach is always bothering me, I don't have a day without nausea.  Additionally, I have lost weight but so much so that I don't have hips or breasts too much anymore and my skin has an acne problem I haven't had since I was a teenager.	I don't recommend this one - I was on Lo-Ovral 28 some years ago and had few if any of these problems	F	28	3  months	4/1/2008
3	birth control, cyst control	MOODINESS during third week, nausea during mid cycle	This pill has helped with IBS symptoms and has prevented pregnancy, but during the third week of the pills I am depressed and irritable.  I also get flu-like nausea during the second week of pills.  Called Dr. to switch.	F	37	4  months	3/13/2008
1	contraceptive	Weight gain, mood swings, and it didn't work	I had switched from Yasmin because it made me absolutely numb... emotionally, sexually, etc.  I switched to levelite (generic lessina) and it seemed a little wierd at first.  My first cycle after the first month took DAYS to show up.  After month number 2... got pregnant while on it.  I'm on no medications, and completely healthy, and also took them like clockwork everyday.  So I assume it just wasn't strong enough.  I never had a problem with Alesse but they stopped making it due to a packaging problem and I never found it again.  They're supposed to be the same... apparently NOT!	F	31	2  months	2/8/2008
4	birth control	swollen breasts (but bigger!), back aches, slight depression & more emotional week of period. some cramping day before period, but definately less then before.	overall, very satisfied. periods are 4 days, max. & extremely light flow. breakthrough bleeding first 2 weeks on pill, but regulated with second pack. skin oil increased. a little weight gain, nothing drastic. a little more emotional week of period.	F	18	7  months	11/7/2007
1	prevent pregnancy	I was on Levlite almost 10 years ago.  I developed an anxiety disorder and had panic attacks.  Both of which completely disappeared when a new gyno recommened I stop taking Levlite.  She had seen that happen before with some pills.  Also, I lost my sex drive. I didn't even want to be touched, let alone have sex.  Again, when I stopped taking it, things got better and the sex drive came back very quickly.	I was taking Levlite because I was a smoker at the time.  The low estrogen was great for me in that regard, but this particular pill didn't work for me.	F	32	2  years	9/25/2007
4	severe cramping	I have experienced quite a lot of headaches in the last 4 years I have been taking Levlite.  4 years ago I was hospitalized for a subdurral bleed in my brain, Dr.'s were puzzled as to why this happened, but a later test showed it was gone.  3 weeks ago I was hospitalized with a 6 inch blood clot in my brain, again Dr.'s are puzzled.  They said this probably happened because of the use  of oral contraceptives.   God has been watching over me, because death could have been the result.  Please use oral contrceptives with caution and if something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't.  Call your Dr.	levlite did help with my severe cramping and my story is rare, this is not going to happen to everyone.	F	33	10  years	7/7/2007
5	Birth control	None....works great, hardly any period at all.		F	32	4  years	6/15/2007
2	bc, treating migraines	Breakthrough bleeding every day for 6 weeks, much more frequent and severe migraines.	Do not recommend, at all	F	25	2  months	5/23/2007
3	to replace ortho tri cyclen lo	one month= constipation, weight gain, first 2 weeks had nausea and vomiting.		F	20	1  months	5/7/2007
2	Birth control	Mild depression, significant increase in acne, no sex drive.  Did not like this BC overall.  I am still trying to get my skin to clear up, and when stopped taking med, depression improved dramatically.	Be cognizant of acne problems, reduced sex drive, or mood fluctuations.  My doctor did not advise me to watch out for this.	F	28	3  months	5/7/2007
5	birthcontrol	mild moodiness at first, changed acne pattern, greatly reduced menstrual pains/nausea, lighted/shortened period, some headaches around period, made  me a little less coordinated (physical motion, when dancing).	from all the good and bad things I've heard here and from friends about birth control, I really think this one has worked out well for me.	F	23	3  months	4/30/2007
2	BC	Depression, bloating, backpain, lethargy, headaches		F	18	2  months	4/18/2007
3	birth control, menstrual regulation	breakthrough bleeding	minimized pain associated with period, however, too much breakthrough bleeding	F	20	4  months	4/17/2007
4	birth control	i have some break though bleeding its discolored...i wish i experienced weight gain and swollen breasts...but nothing just a little spotting very short periods, i was taking aleese i gained weight off it the first time i took it when i was 18 but when i started it again when i was 23 it didnt do anything. i lke it tho it works		F	24	4  days	4/11/2007
3	Birth Control	Breakthrough bleeding	My doctor prescribed this to me because of the low dosage, but I think I'm going to have to switch to something higher. I have experienced a lot of breakthrough bleeding in the past two months (I have been taking Levlite for 6 months now), to the point where I am bleeding 2 out of the four weeks each month. I like the fact that there are basically no other side effects that I've experienced, but I can't deal with the seemingly constant bleeding.	F	25	6  months	4/6/2007
1	Pregnancy Prevention	Extreme moodiness, especially around the time of my period.  Depression. I am always irritable.  Things bother me that normally do not. Headaches and weight gain.  Light periods but discolored.	I started off with Alesse and the doctor switched me to Levlite and said they are the same.  I think my symptons have worsened with Levalite	F	22	3  months	4/4/2007Email
2	Regualte cycle and cysts	I used to take Alesse about 2 years back.  I got off it due to not being sexually active.  Went to the doctor to regulate cycles and told her I wanted to take Alesse again.  Pharmasists handed me Levlite and told me it was the same kind.  I have been taking it for 2 weeks and I find myself getting severally depressed and emotional.  I am not sure I can handle this much longer since it is affecting those around me as well.		F	25	2  weeks	3/31/2007
4	Birth Control	The only side effects that i experienced was spotting in between periods. To the point where it disrupted daily activites. I used to have horrible cramps while on my period, and i no longer have any. Helped alot with regualting period and pain during periods.		F	16	2  months	3/1/2007
3	Long, heavy periods; severe cramps	Mostly positive ones! Lost weight, bigger boobs (they were sore for the first 2 weeks, but that went away), clearer skin, no more cysts popping and bleeding between periods, PMS doesn't start as early, no more extreme food cravings, and my mood feels more even. The pills make me nauseus, so I take them right before I go to bed, and I'm fine.	I've been on Levlite for 7 weeks. The first month, my period was much lighter and noticeably less painful, but the second month it was almost as bad as before I went on the pill. My ob/gyn recommended switching to Levora (same meds, higher dose) to see if that helps.	F	27	7  weeks	2/28/2007
4	Cramps, birth control	Decreased appetite for first few weeks of use.  Swollen breasts.	I've been on levlite (and all generics made) since the year 2000.  I've been taking it for nearly 7 years now, and love it.  Little to no cramps when that time of month rolls around.  Low bleeding, for only a few days, and very regulating.	F	20	7  years	2/15/2007
3	birth control	swollen breasts, weight gain, spotty and longer periods, acne	My face actually broke out a little more than normal when I was PMSing,  I have gained a little weight and my breasts definitely got bigger (which I actually don't like).  I noticed two to three days before my period I started spotting, it took me a few days to actually get a full blown period.  I'm just not starting my 2nd month, so we'll see how it goes.	M	23	1  months	12/19/2006
2	Pregnancy-prevention	Bad: Acne, unordinary facial hair growth, loss of sex drive, mood swings before periodGood: No weight gain, light flow, shortened days on period	I took Levlite for 1.5 years and didn't start to see acne and unusual facial hair growth until 6 months into my prescription. I originally switched from Ortho Low to Levlite because of weight gain issues.  Weight gain issues were solved with Levlite, but am now battling with constant acne breakouts and monthly visits to the spa to wax facial hair. Getting costly and looking to switch to a pill that does not cause weight gain, acne or facial hair!	F	25	1.5  years	12/19/2006
3	Pregnancy prevention	Spells of depression, no sex drive, migraine headaches,	my period has been consistent though compared to Ortho Tri and Lo.	F	24	3  months	10/17/2006
3	Pregnancy prevention	Spells of depression, no sex drive, migraine headaches,	my period has been consistent though compared to Ortho Tri and Lo.	F	24	3  months	10/17/2006
3	Regulate Monthly Cycles	I've barely been on it for a month, but I've been experiencing extra bleeding. My doctor calls it spotting, but when it's so much blood that I have to use a tampon,that's serious. So far, my period has lasted for three weeks,vs. my 3 day periods. And no,it doesn't clear up your face.It kind of broke me out.		F	19	1  months	9/12/2006
1	dysmennoreah	I had headaches the first week with morning nasea and a general decrease in appetite.  The second week I exprienced heavy bleeding and cramps with swelling in my throat.  The worst was the extreme depression from about the second or third day.  I quit after only 14 days and the side effects went away almost immediately.		F	27	14  days	8/24/2006
5	Birth Control	Swollen boobs first two months but boobs got bigger :)	I love it!	F	20	4  months	8/23/2006
2	Birth control	Break through bleeding every 2 days, horrible cramps, headaches, feeling like I had the Flu.	The 1st month was fine, the 2nd month/2nd pack is when all the side effects started to happen. I bleed evry 2 days or so and it's not light, so I don't even know when I might bleed next. I'm thinking about switching.	F	21	3  months	7/18/2006Email
5	mood control	Levlite has been great. No bad side effects at all. It feels like I am not taking a bc pill. If anything I feel my mood is a lot better! I am bipolar so that is why I turned to bc pills for some help with mood swings. so far so good;)	I have only been on levlite 2 weeks so I'll update you all.GREAT FOR BIPOLAR WOMEN SO FAR. I heard it was good for bipolar women to start on a low dose pill. But if you are bipolar please stay away from Yasmin with drsp and any of the tri-cyclics-trust me!! I was a weeping fool on Yasmin and my hair started falling out and then I couldn't sleep when I went off of it so that was back in February. I haven't been on another pill since until now. and I was on a tri-cyclic in 2001 and just remember the varying levels of estrogen playing havoc with my mood...yuck.. Good luck. Levlite's a winner!	F	31	15  days	7/2/2006
5	help with severe cramps	weight gain	i used to get SEVERE cramps during my period, and my period would last for weeks or even months at a time. finally i went to a doctor and they suggested i try levlite.  i was skeptical and against the idea at first but i noticed a huge improvement immediately after i started taking it and by my next period everything completely leveled out and i can pinpoint EXACTLY what day i will start and end my period. i did gain weight at an alarming rate at first, but that eventually leveled out as well.	F	18	4  years	6/29/2006
3	Birth control	Horrible PMS, I get almost suicidal a couple of days before I get my period.	My periods are almost non existent and the cramps are almost all gone. It hasn't done much for my skin, and it has afected my moods a lot, I get deadly PMS and just go psycho. Will try skipping the break weeks to see if I can skip PMS all together. I haven't experienced any weight gain, but been able to loose 25 pounds while on it.	F	21	2  months	4/21/2006
3	birth control	The first pack, I started to have breakthrough bleeding the 2nd week, which cont'd till I started my proper period on the white pills. I started the 2nd pack and the exact same thing happened again. The only good thing so far about this pill is that I've lost 11lbs. I have absolutely no appetite whatsoever. I was 120lbs and now weigh 109lbs.		F	33	60  days	4/18/2006
3	birth control	Two periods a month, or periods lasting 2 weeks.	After 2.5 or 3 years of taking Levlite (and, occasionally, the generic version, Lessina)I started to have weird, sometimes heavy bleeding between periods, or a period lasting 2 weeks. Some months I would just have a regular period, and I would think things had returned to normal, but then the next month my cycle would be weird again. This has been going on for over a year. I didn't have any other side effects, so my doctor told me I should stay on Levlite if the bleeding wasn't bothering me. Because Levlite is such a light dose, it may not be strong enough to regulate my period, but, in general, she said it's better to stay on the lightest pill possible. However, the whole point of being on the pill was to have sex without getting pregnant and with the bleeding all the time, I was having way too little sex. The doctor gave me an rx for ovcom 35 and I will try that for a few months to see what happens.	F	23	4  years	4/6/2006
3	help w/ovarian cysts	breast tenderness.  Breakthough bleeding w/in 2nd wk of starting. longer than usual periods.  Mood swings, makes me feel very angry and depressed.  going to give it another month If no change going to try something else hate feeling this way		F	25	50  days	1/18/2006Email
1	Birth Control	Extreme mood-swings, irritability, depression, weight gain, loss in sex drive, heavy bleeding during period, very bad cramps and pms, breast soreness, nipple discomfort and soreness,	I really don't like this pill.  If I'm going to be angry (sometimes violent) and depressed all the time, then I really need to switch.  Before taking this pill (and another one that i tried), I was happy and never sad or angry and I was never really self-conscious about my body.  I've actually had thoughts of suicide while on this pill.  I really don't recommend this pill to anyone.	F	19	3  months	10/28/2005Email
2	birth Control	I have had break through bleeding, headaches, morning sickness, and my stomach hurts every morning no matter what.	It did help my IBS though.	F	18	90  days	8/20/2005
3	Regulate Monthly Cycles	Break through bleeding two weeks into the 1st pill pack that lasted for 10 days.  Break through bleeding begining again with 2nd pill pack but this time closer to the end of the pink pills, so within 5 days of starting the white pills.  Hoping that with the next pill pack the cycles will be regulated and in timing with the pill packs.I have also developed a yeast infection that I am having problems getting rid of, I hope this passes.	I was on Levlite about 5 yrs ago and had to get off them due to high blood pressure.  Before they were a life saver, and eventually my cycles were non=existant.  I am hoping for this again.  Now I am 70 lbs down, and my blood pressure is now normal and I am on no meds.  So I hope it will do what I need now 5 yrs later.	F	47	2  months	5/17/2005
2	Doctor recommended	Headaches, light bleeding 1 month, heavy the next, weight gain and mood swings		F	25	1  years	5/15/2005
5		No side effects.	I've taken Levite for over three years and love it. No weight gain, no pain, my periods are basically non-exsistant--what more could you ask for?!?	F	27	3  years	4/22/2005
1	birth control	By the end of the first week, I noticed feelings of depression, tiredness, breast soreness, loss of nipple sensitivity, and loss of libido.		F	36	1  weeks	4/20/2005
3	prevent pregnancy	This is my second month of using Levlite. My PMS discomfort (bloating, cramps, breast tenderness) is gone. HOWEVER, I have experienced extreme mood swings during the third week of the pack. UGH! I don't know if I can take this every month!		F	29	2  months	12/31/2004
2	birth control	Terrible mood swings.  Angry, crying, out of control--it's horrible and I want to switch		F	28	3  months	11/19/2004
4						 	11/17/2004
1	birth control	bloating, headaches, you name it. Happier in ortho tri lo		F	25	3  months	11/8/2004
3	birth control	I experienced breakthrough bleeding during first week of pillpack and this only started happening after I'd been on Levlite for 9 months. I had headaches (period migraines) during my period, and longer periods.  I also gained about 5-7 pounds and my breasts got bigger in first 3 months.  One month my period would be very light and the next month it would be very heavy and last 7-9 days.	Levlite is a great low-dosage birth control pill, however, I was much happier with other low-dosage pills such as Mircette, LoEstrin 1/20 and Alesse, which had fewer side effects.	F	26	1  years	10/21/2004
5	birth control	Some breath-through bleeding in the first 2 months of use; I think it's because it is so low dosage.	I gained no weight, no emotional side effects.  These are not good at improving your complexion, however.  Overall, very good pills!	F	30	4  months	9/15/2004
4	Contraceptive	Some minor breast swelling and tenderness	these are great! I have experienced no weight gain and I am not on an emotional roller coaster. My mestratual cramps are normally unbearable, however on the Levlite they have all but dissapeared. They are expensive on my plan though so thinking of switching.	M	28	2  months	6/12/2001
