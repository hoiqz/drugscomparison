4	Contraception	Stopped period, mood swings (at first), headaches (at first), acne	I love Camila. I have been on this pill for a little over a year. At the beginning, it was awful. I had mood swings that were out of control. I had constant headaches. I stuck with it because I cannot take any contraception with estrogen. After 3-4 weeks the moodiness and headaches went away! The first period I had on Camila was the heaviest and most painful of my life. After that, I did not get my period for over a year, which I think is AWESOME. I actually just got my first period in over a year, and it was extremely light and only lasted 3 days. It does increase acne a little, but providing some extra attention to your skin care regimen will keep it totally under control. I have noticed my hair is thinning a little at the top of my head, which I never thought was related to Camila, but now that I read someone else's comment about hair loss, I'm definitely going to bring it up to my gyn. The hair loss is not too bad, I've just noticed that it's a little more thin than it used to be. I am hoping that the loss isn't irreversible. Anyway, if the hair loss is unrelated/fixable/reversible, I would definitely reccomend this birth control to anyway who can "tough it out" for a couple weeks.	F	21	1  years1 pill 1X D	2/25/2013Email
1	Birth Control	Acne, hair loss, weight gain, two weeks straight of headaches, increased migraines, vivid dreams, unable to sleep well	This is truly the worst birth control pill that I have taken.  I have been on several types over the past 20 years, most recently Yaz and Yasmin.  My Gyn wanted me off of Yaz because they have estrogen and it apparently became a risk after I turned 40.  They worked very well for me.  This is a nightmare.	F	40	2  months 1X D	10/30/2012Email
1	Birth Control	depression, anxiety, no AF, acne, mood swings, stalled weight loss	I didn't notice it at first but, over time this stuff made me feel as if I was losing my mind.  LITERALLY.  Unexplained crying, bad moods, I have never felt like this in my life. I hope others have a better experience than I did.  This was prescribed to me due to I had high BP on my last check up so I had to abandon an estrogen based pill which was not much better.	F	42	11  months 1X D	9/13/2012
