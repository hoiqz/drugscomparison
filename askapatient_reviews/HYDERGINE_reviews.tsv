5	Apnoea and life-extension	Very slight side-effects. Mainly being aware of one's dreams while asleep.	Taking it at 2.25 mgs controls my apnoea (snoring). Have been taking it for 16 years and aged 79 I do not suffer from signs of senility. Gave some, with parents permission to a highly destructive ADHD 9 year old boy (4.5 mgs) and it made him normal for 4 hours thereafter it began to wear off and by the 6th hour his ADHD symptoms had returned. Hydergine may have other off-label uses not yet discovered.	M	79	16  years	12/30/2009Email
5	cognitive deficits	None, after some mild dizziness upon initiating a very high dose.	After about a month, my attention and concentration improved significantly.  Incremental improvements seem to continue over time.	F	50	6  months	3/24/2005
