				F M	 	 	    
1	shoulder arthritis	Took three pills in a day and a half and it put me in the er twice.  Once for elevated bloodb pressure and dizziness...  other for severe gastritis.  Do not take this pill if you have stomach or blood pressure problems.  Scary pill!		M	39	2  days	6/14/2013
1	inflammation in lower back.	Stomach cramps, diarrhea, fatigue		F	54	7  days75mg	5/18/2013
2	lupus joint & hand pain	Made me very very tired, wanted to vomit but couldn't. Was to take one morning and night, couldn't take one in the morning or i was back in bed! My hands and hip pain remain.		F	40	4  weeks75mg	5/5/2013
5	spinal stenosis,muscle cramps	none	Stopped pain and muscle spasms the next day! I now take it as necessary. I also take a buffer with this.  It is misoprostol 200MG.	M	66	5  years75MG 2X D	5/4/2013
4	Osteoarthritis of the hip	It helps relieve chronic pain but over time, causes intestinal pain and bleeding. I had symptoms similar to diverticulitis: blood in stool, pain.	I would be cautious about paying attention to cramping, intestinal/stomach pain which can lead to very serious conditions.	M	63	1.5  years100MG  ER 1X D	4/12/2013Email
1	Anti inflammation	I was on Voltaren to work as an anti-inflammatory for my infection. The drug was horrible. On second day of my medication, I experience an excruciating pain in my stomach, like gastric - but much worse. Along with that I also had a sharp pain on my shoulder and couldnt sit straight. I was admitted to hospital after 20 min of the pain and given MORPHINE when my doc knew that I was on Voltaren. It was acute gastritis. Worst adverse reaction I have ever experience. Doc told me to opt for non-NSAIDs such as aspirin next time.		F	23	2  days40 2X D	3/2/2013
2	bicep muscle tear/cubital tunnel sy	no side effects whatsoever. after 12 days on voltaren (75mg twice daily) i am still bruising and having inflammation especially around my elbow where the ulner nerve is compressed. haven't noticed any difference/relief from this drug. i don't have anything bad to say about this drug...it just didn't work for me.		F	21	2  weeks75mg dr	1/15/2013Email
3	Muscle pain/weakness and back pain	I did not experience any, but only took 1 tab once a day for two days.	I found that Voltaren took away all my pain, i rarely use pain relief because i find it never helps or takes too long to take affect and just "soldier on".As i am only young and relatively healthy i did not experience any side effects... HOWEVER my parents both have had bad side effects.... so i dont recommend it if you suffer from High blood pressure, IBS, are prone to stomache ulcers, prone to reflux, heart burn or are an asthmatic.Otherwise if like me you are healthy and just need pain relief when nothing else will cut it just take one a day, and dont stay on them.. the chances of getting side effects seem to increase according to the length of time you continue using them (like most drugs) and the effectiveness of the pain relief can also wear off over time.	F	28	2  days25 MG 2X D	1/10/2013
3	Gout	8 hours after taken voltaren, I had a severe allergic reaction.  My skin felt like it was moving, and the itch on my head, genitals and lips was excruciating.  My lips started to swell, then my tongue.  Luckily I had an epipen in the medicine cupboard, and that saved me.	I had taken this medication many times before for gout and a bit of arthritis.  This was the first time I had the reaction. I am now severely allergic to NSAIDs.	M	48	1  days50mg 2X D	11/29/2012Email
1	Fever and back pains	Severe stomach cramps and diarrhea	I will never use it again, worst drug ever	M	21	2  days75 2X D	11/2/2012Email
1	degenerative arthritis of spine	After 3 doses of this med over 24 hour period, my pain was better; however, I experienced severe stomach cramping and diarrhea.  IBS, which had been under control, seems to have returned with a vengeance!		F	70	1  days75mg tab	10/4/2012
5	degenerative disc disease in neck	none whatsoever	I started taking voltaren twice a day and then switched to once a day which pretty much takes away all my pain.  However, I have read so much on the side effects that I now only take it once or twice a week.  I am 68 and if I take it every day I feel like a 25 yr old.  It also takes care of all my arthritis pain as well.  I love it and wish it didn't have so many side effects.	F	68	3  years75mg 1X D	8/22/2012
1	Severe sciatica/disc bulge	Taken for excruciating disc related shooting pains through my hips and down both legs. Was fine for the first 2 days, didn't feel much change in the pain but started feeling nauseous all the time which makes it hard to take because I need to take them with food. Havent had any for 2 days and still feel sick all the time, I'm supposed to take them for 3 weeks but I think I'll just go back to the dr and ask for the cortisone injection.		F	26	7  days50mg 3XD	4/28/2012
1	Shin splints/tendonitis	Severe stomach cramps and diarea. Headache and drowsiness. Only took two pills. Will never take again due to the severity of the side effects. Cramps so bad that I felt like removing my intestines. Very scary pills... I'm done with pills...forever.		M	33	1  days75 mg	3/22/2012
2	Sesamoiditis	my feet would turn red or purple, but otherwise no side effects	It didn't seem to help my feet at all. Didn't even decrease the pain a little bit and by the 8th it seemed to make it worse. I'm taking a break for a couple days and then might try it again.	F	27	9  days4 mg 4X D	12/22/2011Email
1	Lower Back injury	Eye problem, noticed after 1 day my vision was not the same, seem to be harder to focus,After putting 2 an 2 together I stopped taken the Voltaren Rapid 50mg,It has been 5 days sens I stopped taken them and my left eye is getting bad, loss of colour depth and everything is smaller and takes longer to focus then other eye, 	dont take them,	M	41	1  weeks50mg 2X D	12/17/2011
5	pain in foot and arthritis	occasionally some leg cramps (in lower left leg only) if taken too late in the day.  No side effects if taken before noon.	This drug has helped tremendously with aches and discomfort from the arthritis.  Totally cured the pain in my foot from tendonitis and plantar fasciitis.	F	65	30  days75mg 1X D	11/20/2011
1	tendonitis, arthritis	This drug makes me so agitated--insomnia, hideously increased muscle tension, short tempered, impatient.	It really helped with pain in hand & arm, but the agitation is unbearable.  I got spasms in my back from it and had to get therapy for those.  I know it doesn't make sense with the tiny dose I'm taking, & they say no systemic effects from the topical gel, but I've gone on & off it 4 or 5 times now and the effects when using it are unmistakeable.	F	55	30  daystiny dab 1X D	6/18/2011
2	For RA and OA joint pain	Very rough on my stomach. It does not matter if I take it with food or not.	Voltaren Gel rub is great though!	F	45	3  months75mg 3X D	12/7/2010
5	Plantar Fascitis and Back Pain	Mild sedation.	This is a GREAT drug for me. I am usually VERY affected negatively with most meds. Voltaren totally relieves my pain when nothing else worked. I take it with a meal so I don't have any stomach problems with it. It mellows me out a little but not too much.	M	47	15  days75mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	arthritis	Horrific medication - Suffered an acute pancreatic attack with critical blood levels that almost caused my death. My entire body was "shutting" down.  My blood reports were at critical levels, BP was very low 98/60, fever for over 6 weeks, weight loss of 10 lbs.,yellow color to my skin, couldn't walk straight,prostate infection, sweating, nausea, pain in stomach & back, urination effected, hoarseness/coughing, heart racing, disoriented. Then the doctor in charge left us floundering on our own, going from one specialist after another to counter what was happening. My children did some research on the web about my drugs that I was taking, which included Voltaren,and learned about the adverse reactions to this drug and I stopped Voltaren. The specialists agreed with this conclusion, since they were exact to my problems. My body reacted and I recovered gradually.  My advice to all - STOP - Find something else. I lost 2 months of my life and I still don't remember the entire e	If you are taking this drug - Make absolutely sure that you get blood work done every 6 months, in order to catch any critical levels in your blood. Then - STOP - the drug.	M	64	6  months75 1X D	8/9/2010
3	Knee and elbow pain	Possibly diarrhea and stomach pain, but most likely none because I am taking this with a nasty antibiotic for a sinus infection that definitely causes diarrhea and nausea.	I was supposed to take it 2x/day for 7 days and then 2x/day as needed.  I completed the 7 days and then did not take it on the 8th day.  The pain was immediately worse than before taking Voltaren.  It does help the pain in my knee, which is a strained meniscus, but I'm afraid that the drug is masking the pain which enables me to overexert my joints and cause more injury.  This really makes me nervous.  I am going to speak with my doctor about this possibility.	F	28	9  days75mg 2X D	6/30/2010
1	Arthritis in the knee	I had no side effects the first two days. The doctor prescribed for me to take 2 per day and I'm very glad I didn't. I took one per day and this is the third day. My face has felt numb most of the day and I feel light headed. I've had to get up and walk this feeling off, which has not been fun on the knee.	I wouldn't suggest voltaren because it did nothing for the inflammation in the knee and has me in a panic until I can get this stuff out of my system.	F	40	3  days75mg 1X D	6/9/2010
4	Back Ache / Spondlylolisthesis	No side effects at all in first 24 hours.	First day. Immediate and absolute relief.  I don't get immediate and lasting relief from panadeine or Ibuprofen plus.  Codeine medications aren't as effective and upset my stomach on occasions.  So far this voltaren rapid 25 hasn't.  First time in years my back ache has gone away so effectively.  Really hope it last and i can wake up still feeling completely pain free.	F	35	1  days25 2X D	5/15/2010Email

3	shoulder pain from spondylarthropy	dry mouth (also taking cymbalta)	when i first took voltaren, i didn't feel it helped me at all.  however when i stopped, i was in a great deal more pain the following day.  when i restarted it, i started feeling better.  so it doesn't get rid of my pain, but does seem to make it more bearable.	F	39	2  months75mg 2X D	2/26/2010
4	Fibromyalgia	Extreme upset stomach...couldn't eat or drink anything	It did take away all of my pain and I was able to sleep very well through the night. It's just too bad that it upset my stomach so much. I didn't have any other side effects than this one.	F	47	5  daysnot sure 2X D	2/19/2010
1	possible Bursitis upper butt pain	I took one dose and 15 minutes later i felt dizzy and had chest pain and felt like my life was gonna slip away and die	i called my Dr and he is an idiot ..he told me that this medicine does not cause these symptoms I hate when Pharmecitical company push these and have DR's advertise and experiment on us like animals they jsut make us sicker	F	34	1  days	2/1/2010Email
4	Scoliosis - severe arthritic pain	Heartburn and stomach upset.	It seems to be working pretty well.  I still have pain but less severe.  I have been somewhat concerned about taking this drug for so long due to the possible side effects, but my Dr. checks me out (blood work, etc.)every four months and I seem to be doing allright.  I don't want to get started on stronger, possibly habit forming drugs.	M	70	4  years	1/27/2010Email
3	osteoarthritis	This drug MAY have caused edema of fingers and face after taking for 4 days. Also may have caused shortness of breath. Also some crabbiness and cramping (as in menstrual) and spotting. Timing off for a true period, so suspect Voltaren is the culprit.	Took one 50 mg pill each day for 5 days. The first day it seemed to make all the pain of a muscle spasm in shoulder go away. It almost seemed like a miracle. The effects diminished each day (I have pain almost all the time) and now my face and fingers are swollen and I am short of breath, cramping and bloated. Interesting to see females posting similar troubles. I will NEVER take another one of these.	F	55	5  days	10/17/2009
1	Hip Joint, knee joint pain	Extreme diarrhea, vomiting, extreme sweating, dizzyness, very weak, powerful chills but no fever, bloody discharge.	Very bad reaction by my body.	M	63	1  days	5/18/2009Email
5	severe knee pain, torn meniscus?	It's not clear that there were any.  I'm concerned that I'm imagining them because of the long list of potential side effects.  Medicine is scary, but it's sure working...	This drug was prescribed to help with severe knee pain while I wait for additional diagnostics and possibly surgery after 1/1 (due to high deductible on health insurance).  Pain was bad enough that I had trouble standing up from sitting position.  After about 24 hours, the pain was essentially gone and has stayed gone so far.	M	57	10  days	12/29/2008
1	pulled a thigh muscle	cramps ,diarreah  dont take this stuff		M	30	2  days	12/29/2008
1	severe degenerative osteoarthritis	I was on celebrex till the SCARE of death took me off.  Went on voltaren.  Had wild dreams,gurgling stomach,tired, moody. 4 months ago my heart stopped and they said I have high blood press.  I never had it before.  I find out on the net that voltaren over long times can actually cause hypertension.  I  now use tylenol extra for arthritis. Voltaren should in my opinion be given rectally to the mfg.	It did alleviate the arthritis pain.  It also made me dependent on tagamet after a few years. ThenI find out they two are not to be taken together. I was on voltaren for over 3 years.	M	63	 	12/6/2008Email
4	ankylosing spondyltits	dizziness first few days, mild nausea		F	29	2  months	11/8/2008
3	back pain, arthritis	I was taking 75mg only once every three or four days.  At first it was miraculous, no pain...I felt fabulous, except I did notice mild headache..  Then the side effects kicked in.  Now , if I take only one pill, I have abdominal cramps, followed by diarrhea, lots of it!  Also, LOTS of gas, gurgling, mild cramping all day.  I tried one more today, immediately got a bad headache, and cramping, nausea, and heartburn. That does it.. I'm going back to iubrofen!	I took this the first time in February 2008, and have taken it occasionally since.Basically it works great for my pain, but I can't live with the side effects.	F	63	 	8/7/2008
1	shoulder injury	Took for 2 weeks. Towards the end, began getting tightness in my throat, tingling eyes and lips. These symptoms worsened over the following two weeks, especially the tightness in my throat until a severe case resulted in me colapsing from a heart attack and hospitalised for a week.	Would never use it again or reccommend it.	M	41	2  weeks	1/9/2008Email
3	Lower back pain	Stomach cramps	When taken infrequently worked fine. No side effects When taking it twice daily side effects kicked in after one week.	M	59	2  years	10/2/2007Email
4	chronic joint pain	Lots of stomach gurgling after eating, which has been consistent even after adjusting to the medication, and initial doses gave diarrhea for a few days.  I have switched to taking it with a snack before bedtime with good results.	For me, it has been very effective pain relief for my chronic bone/joint pain from a broken elbow.  So effective that I was able to substantially reduce the amount of narcotic pain reliever I was using once the Voltaren kicked in after about 2 days.	F	36	2  weeks	8/3/2007
5	spondlylolisthesis/degen. disk	None	I have a slipped vertabrae and a degenerative disk.  This medicine has been extrememly helpful.  I don't take it daily, but at the first sign of a flare and it helps almost immediately.  I tried Relafen, vicodine, flexeril and OTC pain relief and nothing has helped like this.

1	torn muscle in arm	It only took three pills only one a day to realize that the side effects can be quite dangerous. On the first night my heart was thumping pretty hard all night and weird chest pains. On second night same thing plus pain in my kidney area as well as stomach. The third night was all of the night before plus nausea and skin irritation. The side effects quit after 4rth night. Volteren did nothing to help my arm.	Even with a full stomach, this pill can be very hard to handle. Side effects can easily bring you closer to the grave.	M	34	3  days	12/13/2006Email
4	adhesive capsulitis.	         stomach upset and  notable  dehydration.	         i would recommend plenty of food and water with this medicene.	M	50	21  days	11/5/2006
1	tendinitis of the hand	unbearable stomach cramps on the fifth day -- vomiting for about 7 hours straight until I went to the Emergency Room.  They ended up cutting out my appendix -- I think it was inflamed due to the medicine.		M	24	5  days	10/30/2006
1	heel spur and plantar fasciatis	I have vaginal bleeding and cramping. . . it's taken me almost a week to realize this bleeding is due to the medication.  The bleeding started almost immediately after taking the first dose.  I initially thought I was having my period (even though it was not time).  If anyone can give me info regarding how long this bleeding and cramping lasts, I would appreciate it.		F	46	6  days	8/30/2006Email
1	frozen shoulder	I have vaginal bleeding and my vaginal skin burns a lot, my cycle was back (I'm menopausal ), breast painOther symptoms I have: erithema, my skin is so dry I have little cuts on my hands, I 'm sweating a lot (usually I don't), pruritus ani etc.	I took it 3 times: the first for 3 days, then I stopped because it didn't make  great improvements and I had diarrhea. My doctor told me the symptoms had to go away after taking few moreSecond time: I took other 3 pills in 3 days. little improvement with the pain. I had the first vaginal bleeding, a lot of pruritus and my skin was all red but I didn't know it was diclofenac. My doctor prescribed me a topical cream , did some vaginal testto exclude infections. I had my cycleThe last one for 4 days. More problems and this time I had the idea to go on Internet and I discovered I had a lot of the side effects by taking  it	F	50	10  days	2/3/2006

1	For encapsulitis of a toe	On day 8, starting wheezing at night.  During the next 3 days the wheezing became a 24/7 side effect, with it being so bad at night, I couldn't sleep for more than 45 minutes.  The wheezing literally woke me up, it was so loud. I also got a severe skin rash on the back of my neck, and on the back of one hand.	Doc said I was the first person in his practice who ever had an allergic reaction to this drug, and	F	52	11  days	3/27/2005Email
