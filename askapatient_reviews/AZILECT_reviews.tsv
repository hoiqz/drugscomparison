5	Young Onset Parkinson's	Dry mouth, some dizziness.	Since taking Azilect my tremors and muscle stiffness have not worsened. It's set a floor under the progress of the disease for now. My biggest concerns with this drug focus on the interaction risks (see drugs.com for the lengthy list), including mandatory avoidance of pseudoephedrine, other cold medicines, and general anesthesia.	M	46	2  years1 mg 1X D	8/24/2011Email
2	Parkinsons	None	I'm taking Azilect with Mirapex and Sinemet so don't know if it works or not. My insurance changed and now this drug costs over $300 a month. Just can't afford it since there is no generic.	M	59	6  months0.5 mg 1X D	2/19/2011
2	Young Onset Parkinson's	No side effects	It just didn't work for me. No relief from sympyoms. My PD symptoms have continued to worsen, albeit at a very slow pace.	M	45	12  months1 mg 1X D	11/21/2010
