5	Insomnia for 9 years	I had insomnia for years after working night shift. I had finally switched to day shift and my normal cocktail of Benadryl, melatonin, ambien, and Xanax were no longer working. After not sleeping for 5 days straight I finally got put on trazodone. With the first couple of doses I did feel like I was short of breath with a racing pulse. I also had and still do have increased thirst. I am finally able to sleep! I now get 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep every night. I feel amazing and I feel that this medicine has given me my life back!!!		F	30	2  months100mg	5/12/2013
4	Insomina & Anxiety	No side effects.	This drug has been a miracle drug for me. I fall asleep quickly and the am less anxious overall. Nonetheless, I am considering discontinuing trazodone. In Dec 2012 I started to have some GI issues (not related to trazodone) and my doctor asked me to have a CAT scan. Results show that I now have a fatty liver (it was normal a year before). My liver enzymes are NOT elevated, so my doctor is not concerned. He says fatty liver is very common among Hispanics (I am Cuban American) and not to worry.  I have read reports about trazodone and liver toxicity and wonder if anyone else has been diagnosed with fatty liver. My brother has been on trazodone for over 20 years and also has a fatty liver (and is diabetic). Anyone believe trazodone can cause liver toxicity?	F	47	2  years.25 - .50 1X D	4/21/2013Email
3	Insomnia	None	I was prescribed Trazodone after dealing with a bout of insomnia that required some medical attention. The first few months of taking it, it did help me fall asleep faster, but I am not convinced it was just the medication. I think some of it could have been psychological. It never made me feel overly sedated and I could stay up for hours after taking it if I wanted to. A month ago, I decided I would try to stop using it since I debated whether it actually did much of anything, and I quit cold turkey. Do not ever do this. The second night without it, I had what I can only describe as severe panic attacks and sweating, nausea, shakes, etc. I quickly realized it was withdrawal. All the literature I'd read on it said it should not be this severe. Well, it was. I also did not sleep for four days and would sweat profusely throughout the day. I finally gave in on the fifth day and took it at night and slept for 12 hours. I know to wean off it slowly next time (but for now I am just going to keep taking it).

3	Insomnia	I was prescribed to this for insomnia... after taking 50mg at night, I was so dizzy the next mornings and it dragged on to the afternoon. I couldn't maintain my normal work-out routine without giving up in the middle of it because I was mentally and physically drained for no reason.	The biggest difference in me is my loss of appetite. I usually eat everything in sight but now I'm only eating about 1000 cals a day which is causing me to be even more dizzy. I am going to start cutting the pills in half to see if this helps.

5		I requested this because after years on Ambien, then Ambien CR the past 2 years, I wanted something that would not need to be increased due to tolerance, and did not WANT to take Ambien for the addictive reasons which I've had.  I do get a stuffy nose, and dry mouth, red eyes, and have the detailed dreams, but once I wake up and have my first cup of coffee, I do feel better!  I definitely helps me sleep better than the Ambien did-although Ambien helped me "fall asleep" faster.  My eye doctor put me on Restasis eye drops for the redness (he said he HAD heard of the redness from the Traz) and it helps a little.  All in all I can live with these symptoms knowing that the alternative (and I literally have pretty much tried EVERyTHING for insomnia) is not something I want to live with!  I feel "free" for the first time in years not being a slave to Ambien!!!	My Dr told me I could take 1/2 (25 MG) up to 2 (100 MG).  The 100 mg dose cused worse dreams-so I cut it back to 75, then 50 and even cut a tablet so I was taking 3/4 of a 50 mg tablet.  I get sleep with the smaller dose, and my dreams are not as bad.  Best of all, I tell myself in the morning that I DID sleep obviously because I had dreams!   That really helps me mentally to know I got sleep--which I will take over not sleeping at all any day!!!

3	Insomnia	None	My doctor prescribed this for insomnia and while I guess it helped somewhat, it wasn't something I'd rave about, either. I thought it was the dosage, as 50 MG seems like a small amount and my sister used to take 300 MG for her insomnia. The good news is that I had no side effects. Eventually, due to its lack of effectiveness on me, I asked my doctor to switch me to something with a bit more "kick" and he put me on another medication. Maybe it would have worked better at a higher dosage.	M	27	5  months50 MG 1X D	9/13/2012Email
1	insomnia	I guess what i had would be called a paradoxical effect.  Four hours later I  was wide awake an slightly agitated ( though not a panic attack). The only way I got to sleep ( after taking 1 mg melatonin to add to the Trazadone) was to take 0.5 mg Ativan, which I had successfully tapered from and gotten off  7 weeks earlier.	I know many people who swear by Trazadone.  There really are individual differences.  I had tried this drug a few years ago ( for 3 weeks with varying doses  up to 100 mg) with equally horrible results but thought I'd give it another try.	F	72	1  days50 mg 1X D	9/13/2012
1	Stress during flight turbulances	I passed out in the flight and the flight had to be aborted. Apparently 3 Drs on board could not locate my pulse and they had revert back to port for EMT. Woke up in ER. Would not recommend this to my worst enemy!		M	57	1  days50 2X D	8/16/2012Email
2	Insomnia	Increased libido, arrousal, and erections during the morning after. Loss of orgasm. Frequent sleep paralysis, night terrors, death like panic attacks.	Although my libido and such increased, I was unable to orgasm through manual stimulation or sex with my wife. She complained that my penis was harder then usual when engaging in sex, I had noticed this as well and it became uncomfortable for the both of us. The frequency of sleep paralysis and night terrors was negating the effects of falling asleep and soundly. I have had sleep paralysis since I was a kid and this really took it to the edge. Ever have a conversation with the devil, with him asking you to turn around and look at him? It's an awful state to be in, body is dead, but the mind is working wonders with your imagination, and the thought of death coming over you as one of them. Needless to say, I gave it a chance but it was to much to handle. I am now on low dose (5MG) Lunesta and sleeping soundly!	M	29	2  weeks50 MG 1X D	8/7/2012Email
1	Insomnia	Severe leg cramps	This was prescribed for my insomnia. It put me right to sleep. What was not nice was waking up my roommate in the middle of the night screaming my heading off as I sat bolt upright with the worst leg cramps I had ever felt. I ate banana's. Same thing happened the next night. Took potassium supplements. Same thing happened the 3rd, 4th, and 5th night. Never will take them again!	M	34	5  days50mg 1X D	7/25/2012Email

2	insomnia due to abdominal pain	Throbbing in head, some drowsiness, but no sleep	Yet another weird antidepressant pushed on me by dr. reluctant to prescribe a benzo. My first experience  was in ER. I was in a holding room in a the ER walk-in area & it was COLD. The night nurse gave me Trazodone; it only made my head throb (tho not ache); the nurse said it might help my IBS pain too...well it didn't & I still cldnt sleep until she broke down & gave me Ativan (yay!)I will say this for trazodone: at least it didn't drive me nuts like paxil or zomb me out like remeron; it was merely ineffective.

4	insomnia	odd dreams, notice that with the higher dose, 50mg vs 25mg, i feel much more awake in the am and don't have the  "hangover" feeling........any insight to this?	Only takes a half hour to go to sleep versus well over an hour. Only wake 1-2 times and can fall back asleep more easily. Also, find more clarity of thought in the daytime hours. This is life changing for me...........difficulty getting to sleep and would wake 3-4 times a night with great difficulty in falling back asleep. I am taking Fluoxetine (prozac) and find no trouble in adding this to my routine.	F	52	 50mg 1X D	3/31/2012Email

1	Insomnia	Had the worst headache of my life for three days straight after taking this. Lost peripheral vision in my left eye for two hours before immediately stopping and calling the doctor.	The "hangover" feeling is a lot more awful than you realize: my mouth and throat were so dry, I started choking. Ambien was far more gentle to me.	F	27	3  days50mg 1X D	2/7/2012Email
3	Insomnia	Dry mouth, congestion and sometimes crazy dreams or nightmares, sometimes nausea, and a few other things. Oh, sometimes made me sleepy very, very quickly!  Different generics though had way different side effects, see my additional comments	Ok, PLIVA generic trazodone acted totally different for me than all the other generic trazodones I took in the past. Pliva trazodone acted more like a stimulating anti-depressant and kept me awake, instead of a sedating anti-depressant used for sleep which is the main use for trazodone. I think Pliva may be the same as Teva, I am not sure......but I am looking for a generic manufacturer that makes a trazodone that is actually sedating. I wish I knew what ones I took years ago that worked for sleep. Anyone have any input?	F	30	3  years50 1X D	12/30/2011
1	Insomnia	Severe Allergic Reaction that started with a stuffy nose and progressed to hives, reddened skin, increased pulse rate, increased blood pressure and a major crisis which required medical intervention. The first time I took the medicine, I noticed my pulse rate increasing. I decided that maybe I took it too long before going to bed. The 2nd time I took it, my nasal passages immediately closed up, and I got up and took a dose of Benadryl so that I could breathe. By that evening, I had raised lesions on my thighs and my entire trunk was becoming red and hot. I contacted a dermatologist online who instructed me to stop the Trazadone, as I had experienced a severe drug reaction. My attending physician did a follow-up and confirmed the same. It has been 2 weeks, and my skin is now peeling, but not fully healed.		F	56	2  days50mg 1X D	10/25/2011Email
5	insomnia due to bupropion	drowsiness, dizziness	This drug worked TOO well. It was wonderful for sleep, but the two times I took it, the next day I felt like a zombie.

5	Insomnia	I am always tired but unfortunately some of that is just me.	Even though I am always tired, it beats the heck out of laying awake all night for years worry about things.  I was a complete wreck because of no sleep.  I really wish that I didnt experience the fatigue like I do but Ambien was worse and talk about crazy dreams.	F	47	4  years25 1X D	6/6/2011
5	Insomnia, Anxiety, Depression	dry mouth, difficulty waking up if less than six hours have passed since taking	This has been a fantastic drug for me!  Before, it would take me over an hour to fall asleep, and now I'm out like a light in half an hour.  On the down side, I can't take it if I'm going to be getting less than six hours of sleep, otherwise I won't be able to wake up as fast, and often I'll fall right back asleep and not remember conversations.  Otherwise, it's fantastic!	F	20	5  months150 1X D	5/20/2011

1	Insomnia	My experience was horrible.  It was like the drug took over my body from the neck down, but did nothing to shut my brain off for sleep.   I didn't sleep a wink!   For a couple of hours after taking it, It was like my body would not breath on it's own.   Like I was having to remember to breath in every time.   Will never take again.		M	50	1  days50 1X D	4/13/2011
4	Insomnia	Dizzy about 15-20 minutes after taking the pill.  Sometimes still very sleepy from the medication the next morning.	Very good sleeping pill.  Knocks me out in about 25 min.  I take it most nights but it's especially helpful for the insomnia I get starting a few days before and during my period.	F	31	2  months150 MG 1X D	3/7/2011Email
1	Insomnia		I loved this medication for the longest time --but this was before I made the connection to all of these side effects:1. Weight gain (gained 50 pounds over the year I was taking it. Have lost 30 in the last 6 months of being off of it!)  2. CHRONIC constipation. (I was considering getting a colonoscopy to check for cancer --I'm only 25)  3. Swelling/Water retention (my sister -who is a nurse- used to say I looked as puffy as her edema patients)I cannot believe how long it took me to connect these symptoms with this medication but I feel like a new person since stopping it.	F	25	1  years150 MG 1X D	2/7/2011Email
4	Depression	This medication certainly isn't without side effects (but it's been said that any medication that does not have side effects, likely will not work)! Here we go: dry mouth, sedation, improved quality of sleep, constipation, increased appetite, feeling out of it all the next day, increased libido, increased frequency and quality of erections and ability to reach orgasm (no complaints about that one), dry eyes and occasional minor visual disturbances.  As with most medications, the side effects are most noticeable at first and when the dose is increased.  The good news is that if you take it easy and go up relatively slowly, most of these side effects will diminish with the passage of time (although I'm still going up to a max of 600 so I will likely have to deal with them for a while longer every time I increase the dose).	I'm writing this primarily for those that might be researching this drug and are just starting or are considering trying it for depression related conditions.  I asked my doctor to consider it since through my reasearch I learned that it was related to Nefazodone (which I did very well on for years before it was pulled from the Canadian market).  This drug is classified as an SARI (serotonin antagonist reuptake inhibitor), which is to say that it is both a serotonin antagonist (a lower doses) and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor at high enough doses.  This makes the way it works different from any other available antidepressant (except for Nefazadone, which is essentially an improved version of Trazodone that is still available generically in the States (wish it was available in Canada).  It's brand name (Serzone) was discontinued after several less than convicing reports of liver failures requiring transplants ( the risk is something like 1 in 250 000 and I would take it again in a heartbeat). Some of the advantages of Trazodone over much more popular drugs such a Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor ect... are that it actuall has no detrimental effect on the quality of sleep (something which the SSRI's and SNRI's definetly mess with).  It has a strong calming feeling so it could be good for certain people who struggle with anxiety and have trouble sleeping (it is not addictive or habit forming).  Most importantly for me anyway, it has considerably less sexual side effects as compared to m	M	42	5  weeks400mgs 1X D	1/21/2011

1	Sleep Trouble - Wake in 3-4 hrs	Within half hour of taking shortness of breath - like an elephant on my chest.

5	To help me sleep	I can feel a little bit of a hangover in the morning but I think some of that is just the way I am. I always have a tired feeling inside.	It works for me. Makes me weary within 15 or 20 minutes of taking it. I've used other sleep medications in the past and those tended to stay with me on into the daylight morning hours which was not desirable. It still happens with this one to some degree but not nearly as much.	M	60	4  years150 MG 1X D	9/19/2010Email
3	Insomnia, Depression.	Dependent, dizzy, very vivid nightmares.	This drug deffinently does help me fall asleep, but almost every night I have an extremely vivid nightmare that leaves me in a bad mood the next day. I stopped cold turkey for 2 days and didn't have any nightmares...because I didn't sleep. I was rolling around all night trying to get comfortable and it just seemed impossible to fall asleep. I feel very dependent and it's kind of scary, But I am satisfied with how well it puts you to sleep. It really knocks me right out and I usually feel refreshed every morning and not tired during the day.	F	18	11  months50mg 1X D	7/25/2010
2	Insomnia	It left me very, very relaxed which in many people would put them to sleep, but not me.  It causes night sweats, which I never get when I sleep.  Left me extremely sluggish all day the next day.	I was prescribed 50mg for insomnia in attempt to get me off of Ambien 10mg at my request.  I also tried Vistaril for sleep, but it was like taking Benadryl and didn't do anything.  So needless to say, I'm back on good old Ambien again.	F	25	 50mg 1X D	7/13/2010

Since then, I break my pill in half and take it twenty minutes before i want to sleep. Trazodone works great, I fall asleep easy and comfortably. Make sure you take this routinely, if I miss a dose I'm a wreck the next day. This drug is also intended anxiety and depression.  I've seen minor improvements with that, possibly because of my 6-8 hours of sleep..  :)	F	26	7  months50 mg 1X D	2/28/2010Email

5	Inability to fall asleep; anxiety	None, that I'm aware of, but am wondering (after reading these reviews) if weight gain is one.  Am taking other meds, so could be a combination.	Have been taking depression meds for years, but started having trouble sleeping following a family tragedy.  Have taken different anti-depressants, but stick to one 50 mg. Trazodone tablet nightly, and continue to have good results.  I haven't needed to increase the dosage for the same results.  I agree with whomever wrote that you need to go to bed within one hour of taking it, though.  After that, the effects seem to wear off, and it becomes more difficult to go to sleep.

1	With Prozac, for sleep	I suffered a terrible sleep paralysis incident after taking ONE 50 mg dose of Pliva Trazodone. Been taking Prozac and Trazodone for 12 years and never had this reaction before. Lowered the dose to about 1/4 pill, kept lowering the Prozac, finally had to go off both because I needed them both for either to work. The combination was completely unworkable, I felt like garbage. HOWEVER!!!! The debilitating fibromyalgia I've had disappeared with hardly a trace. I switched to a tricyclic (Watson nortriptyline) and the relief continues.	Pliva Trazodone is apparently a whole new drug, and acts entirely different from each of the other generic Trazodone brands I used in the past.	F	58	12  years	11/9/2009

I am still kind of new to Trazodone. It's mixed with my cocktail of depression drugs, rls medicine, and an anti-arrhythmic (Wellbutrin XL, Cymbalta, Klonopin, Sotalol). If I don't get to bed within an hour of taking the 50mg pill I pass out on the couch. I'm still trying to train myself to get to bed by 11pm or midnight but I have a lifetime of anxiety around trying to fall asleep and failing. I also have a CPAP machine for sleep apnea that was added just after I started the Trazodone. I wake up several times during the night still and I don't know why.	M	39	2  months	9/24/2009
5	insomnia	No side effects	I began taking it about a month ago at 50mg. It has aided in helping me fall asleep and stay asleep. I awake feeling refreshed and well rested. I have tried other sleep aids and this one is the best out of Ambien and the others. I feel no addiction to it and haven't any undesired effects.	F	39	30  days	9/16/2009
4	depression, insomnia	Temporarily stuffed-up nose (occasional); as someone else mentioned, go to bed right after taking or the window will close and you'll be wide awake. Make sure you have a good 9 hours to sleep or you wake up groggy.	One interesting side effect: completely killed tolerance for alcohol. As a formerly heavy drinker, this doesn't bother me one bit--tho it would be nice to enjoy a glass of wine once in awhile. Can't do it anymore! Any alcohol causes splitting headache and indigestion.

5	Took to help fall asleep	Hard to say; I am taking other drugs as well and not sure which drug causes what.	I've been taking 50mg of Trazodone before going to bed for many years. It really puts me out quickly but wears off during the night. My problem is falling asleep, not staying asleep; I'm not sure if it would help with waking up in the early morning. I've generally felt awake in the a.m.	F	60	11  years	7/11/2009

4	Insomnia		It seems to work well for me I rarely have trouble sleeping when I take it.  My doctor and I have recently decided to up my dosage to a point where it may be useful for my depression.  I will likely have a whole new view on the drug after using it for 2 years as purely a sleep medicine.	M	25	2  years	1/12/2009

While my mood is better and my anger issues are nearly non-existent now, I'm finding I'm still a bit hypomanic and the Abilify creates extreme restlessness in me.  While my house has never looked better and I'm getting lots of project done, I find I can't sit still for longer than 10 minutes and by the end of the day my feet ache for being on them so long running around in the house and doing all my projects.	Together with Depakote.  Doc now prescribing propranolol for agitation/restlessness/irritability - would rather prescribe additional med for side effect than change primary meds...and I agree with his decision.  Doc now bumping me up to 10mg 1xday and propranolol 10mg 1xday.	F	36	7  weeks5mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email
1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email

Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!
