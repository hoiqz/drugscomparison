1	Status Migrainosus	None	I tried taking this medication to help reduce the pain from having severe, ongoing migraines and it did absolutely nothing to help me.  A placebo may have yielded a better effect.	F	33	3  days 1X AN	12/18/2010
5	Migraine	None	This has been a lifesaver for me.  If taken at the early signs of a migraine it usually stops it.  If taken later it dulls the pain enough to let me sleep off the migraine.  As I only have 1 or 2 migraines per month I've never had to worry about its addictive properties.	M	53	25  years	1/27/2009
