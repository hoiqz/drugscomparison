4	Normal Tension Glaucoma	Fatigue, light-headedness, redness, dryness in eyes.	I was diagnosed with Normal Tension Glaucoma a year ago.  I had serious side effects on Cosopt and Xylatan, so the Docs switch me to this one.  So far this drug has helped me keep the pressure down to 10 in my eyes and my Visual Field Tests have not changed.  I don't appreciate the side effects but in light of the alternatives, I can grin and bear them.	M	40	9  months10 ml 2X D	12/5/2012Email
3	control symptoms of corneal dystrop	Possibly sleepiness and more eye dryness than without.	It's done fairly well against symptoms of Fuch's endothelial corneal dystrophy, but for several weeks lately I've felt like an eyelash has been in my eye.  An optometrist suspects allergy to ragweed, but I am beginning to suspect the Alphagan-p even though it's better for me than regular Alphagan.  This is because the Alaway allergy drops the O.D. gave me a sample of are not really controlling the foreign body sensation in my eye.	M	67	4  years1 drop 2X D	10/2/2011
3	reduce eye pressure	irritation, itching, pretty bothersome	I'll try to tough itout. I had such a bad reaction to Xalatan, that I'm willing to try this one for a while.	M	71	3  daysone drop 2X D	7/23/2011Email
