2	Cervical Dystonia	I was taking this for Cervical Dystonia, but it didn't really work.	I stopped taking it since it didn't help out the Cervical Dystonia.	M	49	1  daysUnknown 1X D	10/26/2011
3	Shaking hands, body, and memory los	Nightmares, words see different possibly caused by medicine or chemical imbalance as I am on a lot of prescription medicine. Found myself clumsy at times intermittent as it does not happen all the time. Delusions caused by my mental illness that are difficult to deal with. Emotion problems, pimples even at my age, and loss of interesting in this I like and lack of interest in sex and feel like I cannot do anything right and loss of confidence and unable to drive a car.	Every medicine has side effects, even food. Each person has a different body and brain chemistry. What I have as side-effects others may or may not. But I am surving this as even if I am disabled and very sick I am there for my family and friends even if it means I suffer side-effects and am in pain. I studied many methods in prayers and mediation to develop a positive attitude instead of negative attitude and thinking caused by my mental illness and if not then the other prescription medicine I take.Sometimes I am doing great and the slightest distraction or noise or whatever slips my mind out of a positive state and into another one that has me suffer more and in pain. While I need to go to a hospital I am sacrificing my own needs to help my family and friends. But not everyone understands my mental and physical illnesses make me this way and it is not the real me. The real me is kind, gentle, compassionate, but the me with these medicines and illnesses has created delusions that I am other people and many things I say I am sorry for and apologize. I am not making excuses or faking I am surviving it as best I could. Even if the medicine I am taking as directed or suggested (I cannot remember what) by my doctors who are the best in their area I have faith and believe I can get better if I am wrong and I die or get very sick and unable to function at least I did what I could to help others and not sure what will happen to me.

DO YOU REALIZE THE TOXCITY RATE OF ANY DRUG? DO YOU REALIZE THE DRUG COMPANIES MAKE THE MOST MONEY IN THE WORLD?	F	52	25  years	1/14/2009
1	Muscle spasms in my neck	Each time I took an Artane tablet I would feel some tightness in my abdominal region.  I also had some irritation in the lungs, dryness in my sinuses and nostrils, and dry mouth the next day.  I read where Artane dries the mucous membranes, so I think that is one reason I had some lung irritation and dryness in my sinuses.  About two hours after taking my third tablet of the day, I felt extremely spaced out (disoriented, mental fogginess, etc.).  I decided to lay off of any Artane and I felt better within 24 hours.  I don't plan on taking this drug again due to these side effects.		M	46	2  days	9/29/2008

3	To go with blankity-blank Navane	My guess is that I would have experienced plenty more side-effects without it (see my dim view of both Navane & Thorazine).	Prescribed to cut down on side-effects of the unnecessary Navane I was given on an out-patient basis starting in fall of 1977.  1 pt. just for being part of the pill program.  5 pts. for any help it might have given me and for being cute.  Average is 3.	F	52	3  months	7/11/2005
