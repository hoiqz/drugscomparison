1	sinus infection	abdominal cramps, severe diarrhea, heart palpations, joint pain and anxiety	Still have side effects three weeks after taking medication.

1	chronic tonsillitis/sinus infection	The second I took it I felt like my tongue and throat became numb...it was scary! I had trouble breathing and  felt like I was gonna faint! The discomfort and weird/tingly feeling in my throat lasted for a good 2-3 hours. I contacted my doctor and she told me that's an allergic response to this med so no more of this antibiotic for me! I've never been allergic to any antibiotics before this one!		F	32	5  days 1X D	5/16/2012Email
1	sinus infection/flu like symptoms	Excruciating burning in stomach. Will never take this medication again.		M	55	5  days250 mg 1X D	4/26/2012
1	sinus infection	Increased number of bowel movements and change in consistency of stool.  This started with the very first dose, three large stools early in the day as opposed to my normal one a day.  The stool became very soft.  This has been continuing for over a year now and after going through a colonoscopy to rule out other problems my GI doc says that it is cuased by the drug and I may be stuck with these bowel changes for a long time, possibly for life.  Also, the drug removed all of the helpful bacteria from my stomach at the same time it killed the bad bacteria, leaving my gut unprotected which caused me to have a case of c. difficele which had to be treated with another drug, metronidazole (brand name Flagyl).  The metronidazole was the worst experience with multiple side effects and then my liver functions tests were found to be elevated.  I had an abdominal ultrasound, MRI, endoscopic ultrasound, and finally liver biopsy.  My liver is sick (intrahepatic ductopenia) and the pathologist and l	I will never take either azithromycin or metronidazole again as I believe another round could kill me.   Incidentially, both the azithromycin and metronidazole were generic and one has to wonder if that isn't a factor in the quality.  Supposedly generics are the same recipe as the brand name but I know from personal experience that the generic is not always the same as the brand name.  I will never get generic again.  Interestingly, both the azithromycin and metronidazole that I used where from the same generic manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceutical.  As a personal opinion, I will never buy one of their products ever again and will also make sure that any drug I take is manufactured here in the U.S. by a U.S. company.

1	Infection	Also, see the side effects for ZITHROMAX. AZITHROMYCIN this is the generic.		M	24	2  days500 1X D	4/22/2012Email
1	Asthematic Bronchitis	HeadacheDizzinessNauseaDiarrheaYeast InfectionUrinary Tract Infection	I will never take his again.  I'm not a big antibiotic taker anyway, but this chest cold turned into a very serious form of bronchitis in which I needed an antibiotic.  My Doctor said it was MILD and that he had given me the lower dose at 250mg.  I was fine for the duration of actually taking the pill (5 Days) no real side affects except for horrible headaches, but I was so sick anyway I probably wouldn't have noticed.  After the last day dose (day 5) I started with horrible diarrhea and nausea which lasted another 5 or 6 days. It was awefull.  Then after the diarrhea I started with the WORST yeast infection I have ever had followed by a urinary tract infection.  It was almost like this MILD antibiotic was so STRONG that it removed EVERY bacteria in my body leaving me defenseless.  This scares me about antibiotics and how strong they have become to people who don't just use them for every sniffle.	F	33	5  days250mg 1X D	8/23/2011Email
5	Prostatitis	Slight Diarhea	I'm taking 3 three pack for prostatitis. 5 weeks, 3 pills a week.  So far so good.	M	48	7  days500 1X D	8/17/2011
5	Potential strep throat	Nausea and fatigue the first day (with the double dose), lingering nausea and severe diarrhea remaining days. However, this happens to me with any antibiotics, and this is one of the few I'm not allergic to.	No energy issues after the first day, or any mood alterations. I think it's ridiculous to read on here that some people are seeking legal advice because this drug interacts badly for them. My advice: if a drug causes severe side effects for you, don't take it. Seems pretty simple to me. If you're lactose intolerant are you going to try to sue dairy farmers or get milk taken off the market?  No. That's dumb. Just avoid products that don't work for you. Ask your doctor for a different antibiotic. I'm allergic to several antibiotics. I discovered these by taking them and having adverse reactions. Common sense told me I should not take them again. Pretty cut and dry.  If you're not allergic to the z pack it works just fine and it's nice to have 5 days instead of 10 as you would with other medications.	F	40	5  daysZ pack 1X D	8/3/2011
1	preventative (son has pertussis)	increasing tightness in ribcage radiating thru back~ hard to inhale deeply	NEVER AGAIN! Ended up in ER with a doctor who said I couldn't prove it was a side effect...	F	42	2  days250mg 1X D	6/29/2011Email
1	Ear infection; Upper respiratory	Ringing, static noise in both ears. Very weird!!! Hearing diminished.	For others who experienced these symptoms, does it go away?I have taken Z-pack brand product before without a problem. Will stick to brand product or Augmentin in future and avoid generic; especially TEVA manufactured product.	F	54	3  days500 MG 1X D	6/24/2011Email
1	middle ear infection	lower back pain, shoulder pain, weakness, headache dizziness, anxity, feeling of goin crazy, panic, muscle weakness, cramps in stomach, nausia.	i already have took med before an all i remeber was getting dizzy from it. my doctor tried to tell me it was jus because i had an ear infection. so this time years later i got another ear infectin an was told to take it again very anxious bout taking i waited a month to see if my ear infection cleared up on its own. it didnt its still here so i decided to try the zpac took the first to pills. first it was the cramps, felt lik throwing up then dirrea once. started having crazzzy thoughts lik i was losing my mind, jus couldnt think strait an feeling lik i couldnt make a decion about anything. day to i didnt even take the next dose cuz the first was to much for me to handle. so i guess i am goin to have to call me doctor on monday an see what she says. i will never take this again. i am highly allergic to a few other antibiotics so this could be tricky i jus hope an pry my ear infection gos away by it self i so dont want to go thru this again... please if u have any advice on any meds i should take please email me at cortneyjohnson93@yahoo.com.. i am allergic to agmentain, pennicillin, an 2 others but cant remeber the name.
