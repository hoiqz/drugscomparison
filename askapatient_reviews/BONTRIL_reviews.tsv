4	to lose weight	Increased heart rate and increased blood pressure. I need to take it even only after 6 days.	It is a GREAT appetite suppressant and gives good energy. In 6 days I lost 6 pounds. It is not giving me extra anxiety or panic attacks like so many other weight loss products have. I recommend it!! It works!!	F	35	6  days35 mg 4X D	9/6/2010
3	weight	headache		F	24	2  days	2/25/2009
4	Weigh Loss	Sleep disturbances if taken late at night	I was using this along with phentermine.  It was prescribed to me after I started to slowly regain my appitite back once I grew a tollerance to the phentermine.  It helps somewhat when I feel a strong urge to eat sweets in the evenings, but if I take it past noon, I toss and turn all night. Its a very mild appetite suppresant for those who may get too jittery on other diet medications.	F	30	20  days	9/13/2007

5	obesity	The only side effect if any is slight constipation which is remedied by drinking more water and or adding more fiber to an already sensible diet.  NO jitters, or sickness, as with some.	Jan 1,2005  wt.239    March 21,2005  wt.218	F	45	2.5  months	3/22/2005
