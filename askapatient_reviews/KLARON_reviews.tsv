5	Acne, dry skin, oily skin, redness.	no side effects as of yet.	I'm shocked at how fast it started to work. The first day, I put it on in the morning, and by night time my acne was less swollen. In the morning of the next day a few zits were already gone! I'm on the 4th day and my blackheads are starting to fade. I'm so excited!!!!	F	17	4  daysNot sure 1X D	5/27/2011Email
5	Acne, Rosacia	none	I absolutely do not leave the house without this stuff. I tried everything with the exception of Acutane. I have the most sensitive skin and this works miracles for my zits and rosacia.I have not had any resistance to it and have used it for about 11 years, I have tried a couple of times to stop using it and breakouts return within about 2-3 weeks, so it lasts a while in your system.

3	acne	alittle dryness	i was using it a week but it started breaking me out is that normal at first? when can i see results?	M	29	7  days	7/21/2009
5	Acne	None	This is the first treatment i have used that did not make my skin dry out and also work.  Plexion was good but quite working.  If you use as directed, shake and only a small thin layer you get a nice smooth surface once it dries.  Great for then appling my mineral makeup.  Only been on it a week and finally have stopped getting new pimples.  So far So good!!	F	22	1  weeks	8/24/2008
5	acne control	none	Other than Accutane (which has such horrible side effects), Klaron is the only treatment which has ever kept me virtually breakout-free.	F	41	2  years	4/17/2008
5	Adult Acne	Slight skin dryness during the first 2 weeks of use, but none since then	It worked like a charm. I began using Klaron (now the generic) almost 3 years ago, and haven't had a major breakout since. The smell took some getting used to the first time, but after the first week or so, I didn't even notice it anymore. As far as leaving your skin shiny, it won't do this if you follow the directions. Shake the bottle, and put a small drop in your hand. Cover your face with a THIN layer, and gently assage it into your skin. Your skin will be a little sticky/tacky for a few minutes, but that should be it. If you're noticing a long lasting shine, you're probably using too much.	M	26	3  years	3/20/2008
5	acne	I did not experience any side effects.	I had clogged pores and my doctor put me on oral antibiotics and Metrolotion - I became worse.  Then we switched to Metrogel - even worse.  Turns out, I had excess yeast on my face and the antibiotics were causing the problem to worsen.  We switched to Klaron and then a thin layer of FInacea.  Worked like a charm!  I have one or two bumps occasionally now and most of the clogged pores are gone.  No stinging or burning for me.	F	41	30  days	1/28/2008
2	adult acne	greasy face all day and no give on the acne just more and more of it	i have been using klaron 2x daily and tazacor at night for the past 5 weeks and all i get is a shiny mess of a face and more pimples my face is a disaster area	F	26	5  weeks	12/14/2007
4	Acne & Rosacea	No side effects. Very mild.	I had to ASK my doctor to put me on Klaron. He agreed, thankfully, because nothing else was working. My skin looks the best it has looked since I started prescription topicals (Jan '07). My skin certainly isn't 100% yet, but is better than before!! I would definitely recommend this product. I am looking forward to it getting better and better!!	F	33	1  weeks	10/2/2007
5	adult acne	none	I'd just like to join the chorus of Klaron fans.  This is a really effective and gentle product.  I rarely need to use it now, but when I do I get results within two days.  For those of you just starting the product with more severe acne, be patient.  It actually took me almost 4 weeks to get results the first time.  After that, my skin somehow seemed to magically come into balance and I only need to use it rarely now.  I think the years of stronger products had my skin see-sawing between overly dry and oily.  Klaron finally balanced it all.	F	44	2  days	5/17/2007
5	acne	good and none !	it works for me and thank you !	M	22	3  months	4/29/2007
5	Acne	None.	Love this product. It's great. Doesn't sting or burn or have an terrible smell. Great product!	F	28	3  months	4/26/2007
4	Adult Acne	Nothing serious.  The first week using Klaron, my face did break out considerably, but it completely cleared up within the second week.	Within the past year, I started getting really bad breakouts on my cheeks (blackheads).  I was never someone that had had acne in the past.  I have  been using Klaron for a month now and I am breakout free.  Great Product!	F	28	30  days	4/22/2007
5	acne	None.  It does leave a little shine on your face when you use it.	I suffered from Acne from the age of 15-22.  I tried everything on the market and at the age of 22, a doctor recommended Klaron and I've been acne free since!  NO side effects!  No burn! No dryness!  No redness!  I' dont know why this medicine is not prescribed over antibiotics or Retin A.	M	26	4  years	4/6/2007
5	rosecea		This is the most amazing topical gel. Within 72 hours, my skin was much improved and after two weeks, there is no trace of the roseceawhich developed very quickly and was unsightly. I recommend Klaronwith no reservations.	F	50	2  weeks	3/1/2007
3	Acne, rosacea.	While it worked wonderfully to clear my acne, it seemed to intensify the redness. It did not alieviate the redness or the dryness in the areas where I experience rosacea.	Klaron is great for acne sufferers with delicate skin. However, I'm not sold on it's effects on rosacea.	F	27	2  months	12/19/2006
2	acne	redness, itchy	I started using Klaron about a month ago, I apply it every morning and every night. Since I have started using the product my face has broken out more and has become more red.	F	26	1  days	11/5/2006
4	Acne	Acne comes back with a vengeance when you stop taking the medication.	This product worked very well on reducing acne in the nose area.  But it seems like over time the acne starts becoming resistant to the Klaron. However, the product is extremely effective against pimples when you first start taking it.	M	30	6  months	10/31/2006

2	Adult Cystic Acne	I used it for only three days; but in that time, there was no benefit whatsoever.  In fact, I put it on a small pimple above my lip and it became a huge cyst by morning.  Ill keep it around, though, and perhaps try it again, because the soap and moisturizer used before and after play a big part in how well anything works.  (Im changing those now.)	Glad my insurance covered it, unlike Differin!	M	34	3  days	6/14/2006
4	acne	none	Really great stuff, doesn't bleach like many other meds. I highly recommend it.	F	20	1  years	4/18/2006
5	adult acne	slight itching on neck during the 1st week	I am using Klaron with amoxycillin antibiotic.  I have had adult acne for two years.  I have tried everything else and this has worked the best for me.  I have been using it for almost 2 weeks and I now only have one small zit on my chin.  I use to get a lot of cystic acne.  I now just have some red spots from past break outs.  I have been using a facial brush and tea tree soap to wash my face also.  The exfoliation helps speed up the slight peeling and fading of old acne marks.	F	26	2  weeks	3/20/2006
3	Rosacea	none	I have been applying it twice a day for 4 months. During this time, it definitely got rid of my adult acne and outbreaks but redness still persists. I also keep getting the feeling of itchiness (like a sunburn) and stiffness.	F	32	4  months	3/8/2006
4	Allergies and acne	On my neck, there is a slight burning sensation, I have found that putting aloe vera on before applying medications reduces or elimintes the irration.	Was using Retin A Micro and it really broke my skin out.  I have been using Klaron for a few weeks on and my skin is almost back to its' pre-acne conditon.  I love it.  The only problem is shine that occurs while wearing during the day.	M	33	4  weeks	2/26/2006
1	acne	also, took for about six or seven days then my face started to itch and burn. No help, just red spots and more acne		F	23	7  days	2/10/2006
5	sebacious cysts and general acne	No side effects	I have used just about everything to try to control this frustrating acne...I started this Klaron every morning and differin cream at night for the last six weeks and literally the first time in 9 years NOT ONE BREAKOUT!!!I have very sensitive skin  and this does not burn etc. It actually feels great!!!! I am VERY happy!!! THis really works !!!!!FINALLY	F	33	6  weeks	2/8/2006
5	acne	none	This doesn't sting, smell, stain, bleach, nothing.  But it definitely works.  I use it twice a day, with Retin-A Micro 0.04% at night and I haven't had a zit in months.  I love this stuff.  And you only need a drop so the massive bottle has lasted me over 8 months so far.  (If I use any more than a drop I get a little greasy during the day)	F	27	8  months	2/3/2006
5	acne	none	The lotion is easy to apply and does not sting; after two weeks I noticed a significant improvement with acne that has been bad for years.  I have very sensitive skin and had no problems.  The only downside is that the lotion leaves a little shine on your skin - put some gentle moisturizer on and you'd get the same result.	F	26	20  days	1/15/2006
5	acne	Definately keep this lotion away from your nose and eyes. I've experienced wheezing a few times when it got close to /in my nose.	LOVE this stuff!  I have not been able to use anythin else without excessive dryness, rashes, bumps or breaking out once I stop. I found that I have been able to reduce usage now that my skin has cleared up and it works for cysts!!! 2 days, a dab of Klaron et voila!  I'm so glad I haven't had to take antibiotics.	F	38	3  months	12/5/2005
5	Acne	N/A	Suffered from cystic acne from 14-18 with bouts here and there. Within the first 3 days skin was cleared. Comments on perfect skin since...	M	25	2  weeks	11/21/2005Email
5	acne	none	this stuff is great! the doctor gave me a sample to treat an ugly zit i just happened to have when i visited him. the very next day it was all but gone. also worked on my rosacea-related zits in one day. unbelievable. and i was just about to go on accutane...	F	38	4  days	9/4/2005
1	rosacea	Used topically for 6 days.  Saw no improvement. then my face started to itch and burn.  Felt like something was crawling on my face.		F	71	6  days	7/5/2005
5	acne	none	As I was using the Klaron one of my blackheads turned into a painful pimple but as I continued with the klaron it cleared up in only two days, where on other products it would have taken at least a week or two! I love this stuff and I've only been on it for a week!!!	F	17	1  weeks	6/13/2005
5	acne and redness	none	This stuff has changed my life!!! it is absolutley AMAZING! I have tried so many acne products and they all make me either break out more or irritate my skin real bad, BUT NOT KLARON! it cleared up all of my acne in a month! and my face isnt red anymore!! it just took all of my pinples and redness away! and I still haven't had a single pimple!! isn't that AMAZING?? I thought my acne would never go away, and it actually did! I dont know why klaron isn't prescribed as much as other acne medications either?? it's freakin awesome!!!!!!	F	19	2  months	3/26/2005
5	Acne	I have just started it and i feel awesome.......It is really for sensitive skin type people like mine......nothing works for me.Zohra.		F	28	2  days	2/15/2005Email
5	Acne-ver dry skin	NO side Effects!!!!	I love this stuff. Started using it about a month ago after spending hundreds of dollars on other products (Accutane, Benzamycin Pak [try keeping a lover with that disgusting stuff on your face every night]). Finally a wonderful dermatologist has freed me from my 30 plus year old struggle with acne. Try this one right away, you will be pleasantly pleased.	F	42	30  days	11/27/2004Email
5	breakouts w/ very dry skin	nothing negative	I LOVE this product.  It works extremely well in my case.  I was having breakouts, but also had extremely dry skin when ever i tried to treat the breakouts!  This stuff is a miracle.  Now, I don't use it every day, just once in a while when I need moisturization	M	29	2  years	11/12/2004
5	acne	nothing bad, just better looking skin	Great product! I don't know why it isn't prescribed more.  My skin -no lie- looks better overnight.	F	50	2  days	10/8/2004
5	acne	none	I love it.  I have sensitive skin, and I can rarely take anything without my face feeling like it could burn and peel off. This is the only medication I can take, and everyone has noticed a huge difference.	F	26	30  days	10/6/2004
4	adult acne/rosacea	No major physical effects...felt scared because of some website info, on very rare fatalities.(at least from the old world warII days)	I have tried everything else, one can do nerve damage, one makes facial hair. This one, so far is non-stinging and seems to get to the source of the acne- faster than tea tree oil(which also is great natural antibiotic).	F	35	1  weeks	9/27/2004
4	black heads/acne/pores		I started using Klaron for the blackheads and pores I have on my nose and I've seen an improvement on my pores on my nose and cheeks and I've only been using it for a short time.	F	23	1  days	8/27/2004
5	Acne	A very slight smell of chicken soup on my skin (I kinda like it, completely unnoticeable unless you rub your finger on your face and then put it to your nose)	I can't believe this lotion isn't more popular. I have been on everything under the sun. Accutane (which worked while on it, but is terrible for you), Tazorac, Differin, Benzoyl Peroxide, Minocycline, Tetracycline, Benzamycin, and a few other oral antibiotics. Simply put: the dermatoligist said the words	M	21	1  years	4/17/2004
4	adult acne	No side effects	I did not have any adverse reactions.  Did not dry out my skin and I have very sensitive skin.  Tried many other prescription lotions, but Klaron was the only lotion that helped.	F	46	5  months	3/16/2004
3	acne	very shiny complexion, could not use during the day		F	34	2  months	12/3/2002
4	acne		Helped clear my acne and reduce redness	F	21	1  months	11/21/2002
5	Acne	Dryness - mild	It's great to prevent some of the severe drying that comes along with acne therapy, yet works effectively	F	20	2  months	7/12/2002
