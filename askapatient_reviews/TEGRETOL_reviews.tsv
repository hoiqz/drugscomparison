				F M	 	 	    
4	sezuries	Memory loss, dizziness fatigue and no sex drive at all sense I've been on tegretol. I thought maybe I was just getting up in age my wife started doing research because it was affecting  us sexually frustration. So if anyone has any suggestion to another med without any sexual issues but also still does the job for my sezuries im open to new suggestions.  I would not recommend because this affects a great deal of a mans man hood.		M	42	3  years200x2 dly	7/1/2013
2	Epilesy	Foggy, tried, memory lose, weight gain.  It also made life very difficult as you can't seem to remember things to keep organised. Sex drive also decreases. For me it also numbed allot of emotions which is the worse thing. I spent 2 years slowly coming off the drug and my emotions seem exaggerated as allot have been suppressed for so many years. I now don't take any medication and feel much happier and have more empathy for everyone.		F	36	10  years800mg	6/30/2013
5	Trigeminal neuralgia	No bad side effects other than the occasional loss of words and stuttering at times. Get tired easily and at the beginning, had slight blurred vision		F	37	5  days500mg	6/11/2013
1	post herpetic pain	Emhanced sideeffects like difficulty in breathing joint pain abdominal problems		F	65	2  days200mg	6/3/2013
3	Seizures	Very sedated, confused, lack of emotion, nausea. Change in hearing noticed right away, everything sounded slightly off and increased hearing. Painful swollen gland on neck. Hangover like feeling upon awakening.	Honestly this drug did its job very well to stop my seizures. I am only taking 400 mgs, which I was told was a pretty low dose. Either way I have been feeling mentally and physically more sick on this AED. I have no idea why but I am giving the med another month and if I still feel as mentally off im dropping it. Keppra was far less harsh for side affects so if your looking for a decent drug I would assure you to try Keppra first.	M	25	1  months200 MG 2X D	4/9/2013
5	status epilepsy	No sex drive whatsoever		M	43	2  years1000 mg	3/9/2013Email
5	seizures and bi-polar	I have no side effects. I guess if you fell 20 feet hit a 10 foot fence and rim of a concrete pool and suffer from seizures and physcilogical depression this drug will certainly work for you. This drug works wonders if you have a multi issue.	This drug works if you have a multi issue. Like Seizures, Physcilogical Depression and Nerve damage.	M	40	6  years400 mg 2X D	2/8/2013Email
3	Bipolar II Disorder	It is nearly impossible to focus on reading, and I have difficulty calling to mind the words I want. I am a law student, so this is detrimental. Basically, my brain just feels slower and foggy. I am also tired ALL the time, but I was fatigued before so it may not be from the medicine.	The medicine helps significantly with my depression! This is the first medicine that has controlled my debilitating depression. I went from constant suicidal bouts to almost no sadness ever. However, there is a huge tradeoff. I feel like I lost a huge chunk of my IQ. I was actually more productive and successful when battling mood swings than I am walking around with a foggy and unfocused mind.	F	23	8  weeks200mg 4X D	1/29/2013
3	Seizure	Have very bad tension headache and anxiety initially while on 400mg. Bad back  paresthesia after 2 months. Headaches got better after adjusting dosage. Taking benzo to help reduce anxiety. Seizure is well controlled.		F	37	10  months200mg	11/26/2012
5	Trigeminal Neuralgia	Metallic taste in mouth, diarrhea	This drug has completely stopped the TN attacks and did so practically immediately upon starting on it.  Initially I was on a combination of Neurontin and Tegretol, but that caused a lot of dizziness, so I was taken off the Neurontin.  The side effects did not start until I was on Tegretol for a month and a half.  The dizziness is gone.  Sidenote:  I also have MS, which was diagnosed 8 years ago. TN did not start until last year, at age 53. I currently have no other functional problems with MS. I don't know if the TN is associated with my MS.	F	54	2  months200mg 3X D	10/13/2012Email
1	trigeminal neuralgia	Extremely tired, drowsy, severe headaches, confusion, blurred vision, red blotches on face, chest, back, (these went and then came back), flu-like symptoms - fever, aches, shivers and loss of taste.   Could not work or function normally.  Blood tests revealed lowered white cell count and raised liver functions!	Pain from TN which was not continuous stopped completely after 12 days on medication - 1 week on 100 mg once a day, next week 200mg once a day, then to 200 mg two times a day.  However after 3 weeks the headaches were constant, flu symptoms began.  GP immediately sent me for blood tests and stopped meds on receipt of results.  Been off med for 9 days now, TN pain not returned so far.  Further blood test shows white cell count normal, liver function improving but still severe lack of taste which is extremely unpleasant and depressing.	F	54	25  days200 mg 2X D	10/10/2012Email
4	trigeminal neuralgia	Like many others I have the feeling that I am a space cadet.  So far, I have not been too aggravating to my family, friends and co-workers with it.  I try to make a joke of it.  I am seriously bothered by any lighting.  I feel like living in a cave is the answer, but not very practical.  When I first began in January, 2012, the pain from the cold was unbearable. I could quickly understand why it is called the  suicide disease. I have studied about the different procedures to relax the pressure of the blood vessel on the nerve and decided that taking the medication and being a space cadet was the better option.  The condition is disabling and you just have the accept the lifetime condition.  I still work, drive my car and have a social life, but none of them are the same.  I have had to cut back on work (took my social security to cut back my hours), don't drive too much after dark because of the lights, and tire out a bit earlier (still can sing karaoke but not in extreme heat or cold)	I find that if I do not take my afternoon dosage I experience a more difficult time in the evening (more numbness and pain).  Not much issue with the burning at all now.  I hope to not have to increase my dosage.  And I pray that my friends, family and coworkers will continue to understand the trigeminal neuralgia and not keep saying I am developing dementia or Alzheimers because the effect of not being able to think of words and repeating myself give them plenty to cause them to think I am at age 64.

1	possible trigeminal neuralga	day after didn't feel as if I was awake all day and kept falling asleep,no energy, very slow,had no strength in lower arms and legs felt almost tingly, had to really think about what I was wanting to say, had strange type of headache over forhead, temples and upper face-pressures and strange sensations which moved about, felt like I wanted to vomit-the feeling you get in your mouth just before you are sick,not nausea though. After 5 days ended up at on-call drs in evening with bad head pains, violent shaking-not shivering-sweating and really hot and sweaty but with a normal temperature and vomited several times. Have not been able to go to work. A week later am feeling a bit better-still have all the same symptoms but to a lesser degree. All this from only 2 tablets. Had blood tests 2 days ago and awaiting MRI. GP and on-call dr don't think its due to the Tegretol as it should be out of my system by now, but having read  your posts am not so sure, am seeing GP again tomorrow for blood		F	43	1  days100mg 2X D	7/1/2012
3	Severe migraines 3-4 days a week	I've only been taken them twice a day for past 4 days but thinking about stopping them against my doctors advice to help stop severe migraines,in this time I've become a zombie,foggy,memory loss,extremely tired can't answer people straight away,feel stoned all day n wonky on my feet,I'm constantly apologizing and explaining to people to just have some understanding n bare with me until I'm over side effects. Doctor told me it gets easier but I feel do you get over the effects or do you get that use to them that you think it's normal?		F	26	4  days200mg	6/28/2012Email
1	Trigeminal Neuralgia	Rash, Breathing Problems, Disoriented	This drug almost killed me.  Thank god I went into my doctor as soon as the rash started.  I had an allergic reaction and developed Steven-Johnson Syndrome and am now being treated for that. Please be careful with the med.	F	58	14  days200 mg 2X D	6/22/2012Email
1	Bipolar disorder, BPD	MAJOR issues getting used to this medicine. almost got put in the hospital	on the 4-5 day of this med, I started feeling like I had overdosed on speed and also having the worst manic episode of my life, racing heart, blood pressure through the roof, I felt like I was going to die, but honestly I couldn't sit still or lie down. Also either took another week or so for the side effects to wear off or it pushed me into a manic stage. Also gave me an uncontrollable twitch in either of my hands that took a week or so to wear off.	F	21	6  days200 2X D	6/17/2012Email
4	Borderline Personality Disorder	It makes me feel like a zombie (not sleepy though, just out of it completely), and causes my Depersonalization symptoms to get a lot worse.	So far, its the best medication I've had for mood swings! Works great for that.	F	21	7  months100MG 1X D	5/13/2012Email
2	seizure disorder	psoriasis from rash; photo sensitivity; weight gain of 5 to 8 pounds; very mellow; reduced sexual responsiveness;finally, low white and red blood count, increased liver enzymes	prescribed after one seizure, feel it was over-kill.  It works though.	F	54	16  months300 MG 2X D	4/2/2012
2	Single seizure	- Weight gain (originally 66kg, now 80kg)- Tiredness- Increased appetite (constantly hungry), having more snacks		M	23	16  months100mg 2X D	3/26/2012Email
4	Epilepsy	After reading so many negative reviews of this drug I was very hesitant to use it..I have been on it a month and only really experienced some short term memory problems  (forgetting words) and some mild tiredness. So far On the good side of things i sleep like a log now, seem happier and contray to many other people my sex drive has sky rocketed lol i think the drug has a bad rep but is very tolerable :)		M	26	1  months200mg BD	2/8/2012Email
4	Bipolar II	Nausea, drowsiness (both only lasted around 7-10 days)	I started with 2x200mg and noticed a noticeable effect after a week but shortly after the hypomanic episodes came back. Raised the dosage to 3x200mg for another 2 weeks, and the positive effects wained again. Now, I'm up to 4x200mg and I've just finished the side effect hump (which seems to last 7-10 days after taking the meds), and I'm hoping to have a more consistent positive feeling with the higher dose. I was on Lithium before this (which had no beneficial effect on me), and I have to recommend Tegretol for its less severe side effects. On the negative side, the positive effects seem to be hard to sustain a lower dose.	M	37	6  weeks200 mg 4X D	1/25/2012Email
1	Trigeminal Neuralgia	Immediately noticed a change in my hearing. Everything sounds as if I'm listening to a recording that has been slightly slowed down. Also experiencing excessive tiredness and fatigue.	The change in my hearing was the reason I started to research side effects of the drug. I figured such an extreme side effect after only 2 doses warranted concern. My prescription calls for 200mg 3x a day. I will experiment with 2x a day for the next few days and see how it goes. At this point, I have experienced zero relief from my TN pain.	M	43	2  days200 2X D	12/19/2011Email
1	Nocturnal Epilepsy	Initially short term memory loss, becoming more severe with time, and stomach acid. In year six and over a 6 week period I developed severe symptoms i.e. breathing became very difficult, pains in the calfs and arm muscles, followed some days later by drunkeness feeling, unable to walk in a straight line, and rapid onset of deilirium and feeling like I was losing my mind!. Extreme stomach acid.	Now off tegretol although some symptoms have persisted and are being investigated. SIADH suspected.	M	51	10  years600mg 1X D	12/13/2011EmailHistory
2	CRPS	Decreased libido, headaches, mouth sores, weight gain, decreased appetite, joint and muscle pain, muscle twitches, menstrual cycle gone, constipation, sleepiness, short-term memory loss. Be very careful you don't drink GRAPEFRUIT JUICE - very bad side effect.	The nerve pain did decrease but the side effects are overwhelming. Would not recommend for nerve pain but suggest you look at amytriptaline or topamax, all are bad. Do your homework and trust yourself - doctors are wrong 50% of the time!	F	36	1  months200mg 2X D	12/5/2011Email
4	Hypomania	Pitch change -- my perfect pitch became slightly off, I would hear notes half a step differently(lower) than before. Wouldn't bug some people but I noticed it very quickly.	None	M	26	3  monthsUnsure 2X D	11/30/2011Email
5	myo-facial pain	major hair loss, cold hands	finally, pain in face and neck has gone away.  major  pain kept me awake at night.  tried pain relieving cream (prescription) and narcotics to no avail.  tried land therapy also.  aqua therapy has helped, but nothing like the tegretol (brand name).

4	Bi-Polar	numbness in left hand, tightness in chest, tired after taking in morning, body feels strange all over after taking in morning, skin is sensitive.	Around April or May I was diagnosed with Bi-Polar and Anxiety Disorder. I have always had a problem with depression but it wasn't until I moved away from my home at 18, 4 years ago, that I started having real problems with the mood swings and these past 2 years with memory and focusing problems. My memory was so bad that I have many notebooks filled with lists and notes just to keep track of simple things. My anxiety was bad enough that after a few days on a new job I had to quit. With Tegretol I have noticed a huge improvement in my mood, motivation, and overall well-being. I can focus on projects again and remember things easier. The only problem I have with it is that my left hand is numb a lot and my chest is tight. I'll mention those to my doctor soon.	F	22	4  days100 MG 3X D	10/8/2011Email
4	TN	1stone weight gain so far, water retention mouth ulcers, bruises all over woke with black eye last night, urge for apples, flushed face in the evenings breasts gone up two cup sizes and constant bv felt like iv had a cold since been on them.	my whole head would go in to spasm and last for few mins about 15 times a day where i would drool and not able to talk i would look like i was avin a stroke these tabs have controlled it so much better only have a mild couple now and the feeling where i feel like im about to av one then it goes away also noticed that my back pains av considerably decreased but skin still numb to touch ps my whole back was in spasm. i dont feel as afraid to go out on my own now xx	F	29	4  months200MG 2X D	9/22/2011Email
3	PHN after shingles	felt absolutlely drugged up to the eyeballs on this!! lost all capacity to function! slept all day..couldnt go to work,couldnt speak properly, couldnt find the words i needed, loss of memory..loss of balance,no way could i even atempt to drive, i was so confused, i put my glasses in the fridge, kept repeating myself..it was horrible!!	it did take away the pain instantly mind...but im going back to the doctor to see if i can change to another drug as this one is way to trippy for me!!	F	37	1  weeks200 3X D	9/14/2011Email
4	trigeminal neuralgia	Dizziness, NAUSEA, weight gain, memory loss, lose train of though easily, tired	I was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia back in 2004 .This was the first drug I was placed on & it was like a miracle. I guess I didn't pay as much attention to the side effects b/c I was so grateful this got rid of the pain. My dose kept increasing until it just didn't work for me anymore. Tried on another 5 medications and finally in 10/2009 I had microvascular decompression at Univ of Pittsburgh as they are supposed to be one of the best. Surgery was not a success. Left me deaf in one ear, with a constant sour taste on the side of the surgery, & weakened swallowing. Resorted to Botox injections from my neurologist, which decreased amount of attacks but not intensity. I take dilaudid for bad attacks which I just hate everything about. My neurologist (he is also head of the pain clinic) suggested I try tegretol again. He said stranger things have happened & sometimes it can work again. It has been 7 years so I figured why not. Even 6 months of reprieve would be worth it. I cannot believe how sick I am the 2nd time around. Still nauseous after 6 wks & only on 200mg bid. I did have 2 bad attacks in this time, but that is way less than usual. I want to eat everything in sight. I think it is b/c the type of nausea it causes is like the nausea that comes from being hungry. You think if you eat something the nausea will go away. I started taking 6.25mg-12.5mg of phenergan bid for nausea & it helps somewhat.	F	40	6  weeks200 2X D	8/13/2011Email
1	Epillepsy	Extreme exhaustion. I have to pump myself full of dangerous levels of caffiene just to barely make it through an 8 hour work day. I've been on it so long that it is hard to tell what is a side effect and what it just the way I am (been on it since I was 5 or so), but I've noticed on here that I'm not the only tegretol user suffering from memory, concentration and depression issues. Also, no pain meds work on me- not even prescription ones.		F	26	21  years 2X D	8/11/2011Email
5	epilepsy	Loss of libido.	When I was changed from Lamictal to Tegretol I felt deeply depressed in different moments of the day without any cause. This mood disorder lasted some days. I felt so bad that I thought I couldn't stand it and should go to my doctor again to change the drug. I kept taking it and I must say that, in my case, I got better results, with one exception: I have almost no libido now.	F	30	2  years200 2X D	7/31/2011
2	Nocturnal Epilepsy	For the first week or two; itchiness and problems balancing. Since largely increasing the dose; difficulty concentrating, fogginess of the mind, every now and again the sensation of my skin crawling on the back and shoulders. Sometimes I still get the difficultly with balance.	I hate that I can't concentrate. It got more and more difficult as my dose increased and just as school assignments and exams were getting more and more complex. The time it would take me to make decisions got longer. Some days I get bad speech days through which I have difficulty ordering and pronouncing the syllables of each word i say. This could very well be attributed to the difficulty concentrating as I have not previously had a speech disorder or defect.	F	19	7  years1600 3X D	7/29/2011Email

3	Grandmal seizures	Foggy mind, feel stoned, can't concentrate, unsteady gait, clumsy, imbalanced, muscle twitching, confusion, sleepy	I was only diagnosed with epilepsy 2 weeks ago. I have never taken epilepsy medication before. I have suffered migraines and depression and have taken medication for both of those (sandomigran and prozac) and did not have reactions. As it is only day 4 for me it has not decreased the seizures, the initial effects are very similar to being stoned, I just feel so out of it, on another planet. The other problem I've noticed so far is when I lean to get something I'll almost fall over, or difficult to walk in a straight line. I also feel a bit down in my mood, so maybe all this is my body saying "what the hell are you putting in me!!!" and hopefully it settles in time. I will come back in a few months and update how I react to tegretol	F	21	4  days200mg 2X D	6/18/2011Email
5	Bipolar Type I	"fuzzy" memory, but otherwise none	LOVE it!!! Best mood stabilizer I have ever been on (and trust me, I've been on a lot). This is making my life so much easier. I don't think I'd be able to be in college or have a job or focus/concentrate/relax enough to just be myself. This helps me out of my depression and gives me back my personality without making me manic. It's a great medicine. If nothing else works, talk to your doctor about Tegretol (Equetro).

1	TBI	Decrease in brain abilities and lump on lymph node on neck	Wow. looking to increase my brain abilities and decrease the threat of seizures. Now I feel stupid and have a lump on my neck.	M	43	3  months200 2X D	6/1/2011
4	Seizure disorder	Some weight gain depression lack of motivation occasional mood swings between anger and depression loss of sexual deisre		M	21	8  months100 2X D	5/4/2011
5	Epilepsy	None - maybe memory issues but I've had those so long it could just be me:)	I was on Tegretol for 12 years and it controlled my simple partial seizures completely with no side effects that I could tell.  I eventually had to be taken off of it though because I started having low white blood cell counts and this is definitely a side effect of LONG TERM use. I have since been on Keppra, Vimpat, Lamictal, and Zonegran ALL to the detriment of awful side effects.  I am now on Depakote 500 mg x 1/day.  They wanted to start me at 1000 per day but I told the doc that I wanted to start low and dose up if needed.  So far 500 mg. is working (maybe with a little weight gain). The point I want to make is that if you go look at ratings of all of the other drugs I have taken, everyone reacts differently!  What may work for one doesn't work for another.  My goal was seizure control without side effects.  This is a great resource because I was having some side effects that my doctor said were not "listed" in his journals but that I saw on websites like these that other people were experiencing.	F	48	12  years200 1X D	4/23/2011
1	Bipolar Disorder - Rapid Cycling	extreme difficulty putting thoughts together or finding the correct words for things. My 5 year old son has to finish my sentences for me!  Weight gain 10 pounds/3 months. Itchy/twitchy skin. A number of large swollen lymph nodes in my neck and severe join pain	I have been on meds for 20 years and I have tried a lot of them. Tegretol and Lithium are the worst meds I have tried. I can't wait to get off this drug!	F	40	3  months200MG 1X D	4/4/2011
4	Epilepsy	Foggy headedness, inability to think straight, inability to think on the spot, lots of difficulty remembering things, feeling confused easily.	I started taking Tegretol for seizures in December 2006, after being on Dilantin and Valpro. I found that Tegretol made me feel very foggy headed and dazed. I found it difficult to think straight, I had trouble remembering things and always had to keep lists and write things down, and I felt more confusedand less able to concentrate and focus on tasks. I was weaned off it slowly between January 1 and January 22 this year, and in the last fortnight or so I have really noticed a difference. I can think I lot more clearly, I have less trouble remembering things, and I am not so confused.	F	22	4  years200mg 2X D	3/23/2011Email

1	enhance phenobarbitol for epilepsy	Only during "blood level theraputic dose", I experienced double vision so severe I couldn't see to dial 911, severe mental confusion as if I was fighting to not pass out, I had no motor control of my legs, often the theraputic dose caused me to pass out suddenly for hours at a time. I guess it kept me in a near coma.	During my last 4 years taking this drug, I moved and saw a new neurologist. He did not understand about taking a low dose, as I had successfully for 12 years to enhance the performance of phenobarbitol, and insisted I take a "blood level" theraputic dose, which sent me into severe overdose every time. Double vision, complete loss of gross motor control - I couldn't get off the floor to call 911, even if I could wake up, even if I could see the phone, I couldn't wake up until the dose had mostly worn off, and my husband would say that often he would come home from work to find me collapsed on the floor. I don't have much memory of that four years. I would take the next lower dose, as recommended by the ER and be fine, and Dr. Quack would require a blood test, and the results would be below theraputic, and he would tell me to take the higher dose. Repeat as above. Being newly on my own and 19 years old, I didn't know better. I trusted the doc. He almost killed me. 24 years later, I wonder at the long term damage of four years of overdose.

4	Trigeminal Neuralgia	Drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, headache on 200mg a day - by 600mg a day blepharospasm, other mild muscle twitching, short term memory loss, exhaustion, mild itchy rash. Can't work due to exhaustion currently.	By the time I had worked my way up to 600mg, pain was mostly stopped. I get dull ache in my face but never the strong burning pain that characterised my neuralgia - side effects are worth avoiding the pain. Tegretol works well on TN but the memory side effects are questionable. Am not sure if muscle twitching is related to Tegretol but the doctor tells me the blepharospasm definitely is. Try this drug for TN nonetheless.	F	23	5  months200mg 3X D	2/14/2011
1	Mood Stabilization	After little effect I developed a severe pyrexia & swelled up to the extent that I could barely open my eyes, wear shoes & on two occasions began to have difficulty in breathing. Once immediately discontinued the pyrexia broke and I began to shed my skin from head to toe. At one stage de-gloving my fingers & toes & also shedding the entire soles of my feet to a depth of 5-8mm.	After further research I discovered that my reaction was either TEN (Toxic epithelial necrosis) or SJS (Stevens-Johnson's Syndrome) though my GP still insists that it was a viral infection despite my blood markers being within "Normal" range	M	36	3  weeks200 1X D	1/14/2011Email

5	Trigeminal Neuralgia	I'm so surprised w/those of you having so many side-effects.The only one I have is occassional trouble retreiving a word,however the word always comes to me within seconds. My dr. started me on 1/4 tab (200mg) 2x day...I know-pharmacist said he never seen such a low dosage-but i feel great now that I'm at 1/2 tab 3-4x day	Couldn't function last 2 yrs w/pain...anxiety of pain returning.Will be having Gamma Knife procedure next month to hopefullyend pain & pills here in Toronto by a wonderful nuerosurgeon atTWH. Sure would love to gulp down something cold or a hot bowlof soup again, or even have a full ngts sleep w/out pain! ps..I,ll never use straws again after my treatment.	F	49	2  months50 mg 4X D	12/31/2010
1	Seizure control	Lack of sensory input from things like fingertips.  I could hold very hot objects & not even notice.  The most disturbing thing is I'm a musician, with perfect pitch & tegretol has ruineed that perfect pitch.  when I first started taking Tegretol I noticed that things in my world had gone 1/2 tone flat, but that only lasted a while & had gone back to normal.  When I got off Tegretol in 2001, my pitch went up 1/2 step & now I perceive things this way all the time!  Concert C is now Dflat.  People say I should've gotten used to this by now after 9 years, but it's just not happening!  If you are a person with perfect pitch who has a seizure disorder!  TEGRETOL ISN'T THE DRUG FOR YOU!  I also had a lack of sexual appitite & function while on that drug & that hasn't fully returned either.		M	52	17  yearsUnsure 2X D	12/19/2010Email
5	MS-related muscle spasms & bipolar	Can't be sure what are side-effects and what are MS symptoms. Missing a dose causes immediate return of spasms.	Able to sleep without additional drugs because spasms are so well controlled.  together w/ risperdal, frequent bipolar-like mood swings are well controlled also.  Good medication for several MS issues when used correctly.  Follow your Dr's instructions to a T, though.	F	43	2.5  years200 mg 3X D	12/15/2010
4	trigeminal neuralgia	dizziness, sleepiness, slurring of words, forgetting words, forgetting conversations, unable to drive, craving sweets like crazy, weight gain, at a higher dose (800mg day) hallucinations, all light indoor and outdoor searing my eyes, a funny smell, feeling out of it, nausea mostly at the beginning of use but also if I move my head around alot, people seem to talk and walk too fast	it helps a great deal and I don't know what I would do without it. I tried lyrica and it doesn't help much but the side effects are less. Only the tegretol works. I am trying to keep my dose low and deal with a certain amount of pain so I don't have to live in a dark room hiding from the light and the hallucinations	F	46	3  months200 mg 2X D	11/16/2010
5	Trigeminal Neuralgia	Exhaustion, confusion, can't think of the word I want to use, slurred speech, joint pain, acne, everything I hear is a lower tone, loss of Vitamin D, short term memory loss, restless legs, canker sores in my mouth, insatiable cravings for food, weight gain, ringing in my ears.	Although the side effects are terrible, this drug saved me from the hell of trigeminal neuralgia.  I hope the side effects go away, they are bad now that I recently increased the dose...I literally shut off my alarm in my sleep and don't hear it, I'm like a zombie.  But I will take all of these side effects and more than be living with the pain I was in for the past three years.	F	25	8  months1200mg 1X D	11/4/2010Email

4	Grand Mal seizures	Memory definitely suffers. It's horrid because I'm a business professional and I constantly find myself making excuses for forgetting names, etc. Weight gain- not much, but it's still an issue. I'm an age group competitive runner/marathoner who runs 40-50 miles a week. I'm not overweight, but not runner slender like you'd  expect and I would hope for in order to compete.	I'm planning on discontinuing under Doctor's supervision. Tegretol was initially prescribed for seizures - there was some brain damage noted on the CAT scans from childhood accidents. However, I used to consume a tremendous amount of alcohol and the seizures stopped years ago with the cessation of drinking.	M	48	15  years200MG 2X D	10/4/2010Email
2		Lethargy, vagueness, sun sensitivity.	It took me a month or so to get over the 'poisoned' feeling. Not too bad for several months, then side effects gradually re-asserted themselves over a period of a month or so. As my seizures were seen as the result of 'over doing' things, I have reduced to 1/2 dose (on my own) to see how that goes. I have started to get my life back a bit, and plan to stop taking altogether - and avoid late nights, heavy drinking etc.	M	60	1  years200 2X D	9/23/2010Email

3	Temporal Lobe Epilepsy	I have not any issues with the Epilepsy since starting on Tegratol. Memory does seem worse than most people around me.  Was diagnosed with osteoporosis a month ago despite being fit, healthy and active my whole life	Trying to get off the drug now so I can get my bones density back in order as a lot of recent research points to this being a side effect of the drug.	M	40	20  years200mg 2X D	8/24/2010
1	Bipolar I	Fortunately no weight gain.  However, extremely lethargic and problems with memory.	Tegretol did nothing at all to help my depression, and I was put on it for that reason when I went into the hospital.  However, my primary care psychiatrist said it is effective at controlling mania.  I am currently tapering off of it.  Lastly, this is just my own personal experience because I know that other people might react to it differently.	M	25	3  months600 MG 1X D	8/14/2010Email

1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011

His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out!

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present.

I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie).

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011

3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed.

I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.

Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache.

The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.
