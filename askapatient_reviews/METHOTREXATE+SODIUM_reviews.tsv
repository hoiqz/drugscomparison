4	PA and Psoriasis	Can not take MTX orally at dose of 20 mg. Started on IM MTX at reduced dose of 17.5 mgm. Had decrease in severe nausea, but still have fatique and weakness starting 3-4 hours after injection, lasting into most of the next day. MTX does work but still have periods of severe pain requiring the use of steroid injections. My psoriasis still still flares but is usually under good control unless I'm sick on antibiotics and miss a week or two of MTX until I'm better. Also on Bextra and have had pain releif but an excessive weight gain. Currently my Rhumatalogist is seeking approval for Remicade from my insurance, I only hope that I can afford the co-pays.	Over the years that I have taken MTX it has been of great help, but now it is losing it's effectiveness and it is time to move on.	F	55	5  years	4/26/2003Email
