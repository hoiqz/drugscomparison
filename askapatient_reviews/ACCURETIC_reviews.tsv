ACCURETIC	1	High Blood Pressure	Irritating ahem cough, aching joints/gout, dehydration, tiredness	I could not work out why I was so tired and sore.I was on an exercise program which was working wonderfully, and then I got extremely sore joints and such tiredness I had to give up. Turned out I was dehydrated. I'm left with an ache in my chest region. Stopped the drug and everything except chest pain has gone.	F	50	12  months	1/9/2009
ACCURETIC	3	For Hypertension	Lots and lots of flushing!  This med did wonders to lower my BP, but this flushing is awful. Everyone keeps asking me if I am sunburned.		F	45	9  months	7/15/2007Email
