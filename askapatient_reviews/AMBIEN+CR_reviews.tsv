4	Depression/anxiety unable to sleep	Memory loss is severe, once I've taken tablet I cannot recall anything that happened after i took the table the next morning, be it social media/phone calls etc. it is extremely disconcerting	Very vivid dreams, can take a while to fully wake up	M	48	12  months12.5 1X D	2/25/2013Email
5	Insomnia	No side effects, excellent drug. I used to take Lunesta after two years I realized it stopped working. This seems to have worn off a bit but I have no "zombie" effect during the day the way I did with regular Ambien. I haven't tried to come off it so I can't say anything to that. My insomnia originally started almost 13 years ago and I got the best sleep with this medication.		F	36	4  years12.5	5/24/2012
4	to help me sleep	I really have not had any severe side effects from this medication which is unusual for me.  I just thought that this medication was not working and then was put on another medication which was absolutely horrible and I never want to take another dose of Doxepin ever again!  If taken correctly under the guidance of a good doctor who knows what they are doing then they can and will help monitor your progress and if they are even concerned about their patients then they will take the time to listen very closely to what the patient is saying and then make the appropriate adjustment on the medication.  I also did not have the heavy hangover feeling the next day and after 8 hrs was ready to get up and did not feel heavy all over which was what I had on Doxepin.  This drug may not be perfect but it is so much better than suffering the other symptoms that I experienced on Doxepin and by the way this drug will never touch my lips again.	Basically I never have had any unusual side effects to this medication like night sweats, swelling of the hands and ankles, dry mouth or cravings for sweets all the time.  If a good doctor who really cares about their patients will listen to the patient and find out just how meds do affect them then they will know what can and cannot be given to the patient.  Because you yourself know your body better than anyone else and that even includes the physician.	F	52	6  months10 MG 1X D	12/7/2011
1	No longer taking it	hallucinations at night, but good sleep.	the bad part of this drug is that I have fibromyalgia and I had an immediate increase in pain that I didn't connect to the drug until we did some online research.  I don't recall any problems for me of getting off of it, but then, I don't have problems w/an addictive personality either.  It does its job, but the side affects aren't worth it.  I quit cold turkey	F	75	2  years 1X D	12/7/2011Email
1	Sleep issues obviously	This drug WILL knock you out. and you sleep a good 8 hours. but now try getting OFF the drug is where you have a problem. Causes Insomnia, anxiety, flu like symptoms, agoraphobia,	RLS, Headaches, nausea, diarrhea, heart pounding and much more, DO NOT EVER TAKE THIS DRUG! Can take up to 2 years!! 2 years to fully recover from taking this drug!! It is one of the worst things I have ever done with my life and regret ever taking one!!

1	Insomnia	Memory loss	I agree with the other person who said this drug should be banned.  I was taking regular Ambien which helped me fall asleep, but I'd still wake up in the middle of the night.  Prescribed this and I will say it worked, big time!  However, you do things and don't remember them while on this which is definitely unsafe.  Stopped taking it when I actually had intercourse with my husband and couldn't remember doing that.  Plus, if I missed even one night of taking this I had horrible insomnia and would not get one bit of sleep.  I only took for about a month, the risks just weren't worth it to me.  But will say if you want something that will help you fall asleep and are desperate, this will work!	F	42	30  days 1X D	8/26/2011Email

4	Chronic Insomnia	I take with Seroquel 100mg and a muscle relaxer due to a spine disability I have; works well. Makes me a bit cranky and feeling a bit weird, but pretty effective. Starts to stop working, no matter what. I then switch to Lunesta.		F	44	2  months12.5mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
2	Insomnia caused by Bipolar Disorder	I found that it didn't help me to get to sleep as well as regular Ambien, and that I had really bizarre dreams while on it. I was also waking up feeling extremely tired and disoriented.	Be careful in the morning when you wake up. You might still have some Ambien on board if you took it too late. I was in a car accident (minor fender bender) because when I wake up after taking Ambien CR I am out of it for awhile.	F	23	2  weeks12mg 1X D	4/30/2011Email
5	Insomnia	Drowsiness, Agitation, Memory Loss	I take this when I absolutley need to get a good nights sleep.  If you don't get in bed immediately after you take it, you will get easily agitated (when spouse tells you to go to sleep) and forget things you do.  With that being said - take it then go straight to bed like you are supposed to.  I only take it as needed, maybe once or twice a month so no need to worry about addiction.  No morning groggy feeling for me as long as I make sure I can sleep a full 8 hours.  Was a lifesaver for me when my mother died.	F	42	  1X D	2/14/2011
1		caused severe depression and i had never been clinically depressed before.		F	59	7  days30mgm 1X D	1/20/2011
5	Inability to fall/stay asleep	Becoming very sleepy and out of it. That's what I wanted, so those are good effects. If I try to stay up, I will do strange things--send rambling emails, eat another meal. No cooking or driving thank goodness.	This drug saved my sanity, no doubt. Take it on an empty stomach for best results. Make sure you are ready for bed. You can feel it within 15 minutes. I sleep soundly, for the first time in my entire memory.	F	43	3  years12.5mg 1X D	1/19/2011
2	insomnia	Helps to sleep but scary memory loss following days...and during 3 months that I took it off and on, I was ridiculously hungry ...woke up from hunger....would eat and not remember.  Gained 30 lbs in 3 months and I have never had a weight problem before. It is coming off now that I am off of Ambien.		F	38	3  months12.5 1X D	1/14/2011
1	ringing in ears making it hard to sleep	Horrid anxiety, abdominal pain, bladder pain, diarrhea, pain in my eyes, head pain, lethargy, weird spacey feelings all day, sleep deprivation because I couldn't sleep for more than 4-5 hours and did I mention anxiety? All of these went away when I quit taking ambien.	This drug should be banned. When I quit taking it, I hardly slept for MONTHS! And the withdrawals were horrid. My doctor told me it would take six months or more to recover from the brain damage this drug does. This drug has made my life hell, I wish I had never taken it.	M	51	18  weeks10 1X D	1/5/2011Email
5	unable to sleep	Memory loss from the night before		F	39	5  days12.5 1X D	8/30/2010
5	Insomnia	Maybe a bit drowsy the next day but feel rested.	I had an awful time getting to sleep and the other drugs I tried either didn't work or only let me fall asleep for a short time.  I think the benefits of this drug are well worth it.	M	51	2  months12.5 MG 1X D	8/2/2010Email
5	insomnia	none  - some shock due to the cost of this drug!!! They need to come up with a generic for the long acting Ambien!	I take Ambien because I cannot fall asleep or stay asleep because of neuropathy - nerve damage - caused from several lumbar & cervical fusions as a result of a car accident. I also suffer from Fibromyalgia. If not for Ambien (and my faith in Jesus, my Lord and Savior!!!), I would not get any sleep at all - I would just stare at the ceiling!
