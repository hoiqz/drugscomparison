1	Glaucoma	I take this along with Azopt. This drug makes my eyes sting and feel very uncomfortable. the skin around my eyes is darker. I suffer with migraine that I take medicine for. The medicine usually helps but my migraine always gets worse after the drops and turns into an agressive thumping. Dizzyness, cough and sickness are always experienced. I have also developed very dry and itchy ear canals. I have a feeling of pressure in my chest all the time and now develop pain in my left shoulder and arm when I am stressed, I also feel that there is nothing to look forward to in my life anymore, I never suffered with depression before.I have explained the problems to my doctor who says there is nothing he can do and I will go blind if I don't take the drops.	Very negatively effect the quality of life.	F	50	6  days1 drop per 1X D	10/14/2012Email
4	glaucoma	Long eyelashes are a plus. However, this is mitigated by whites turning a pale pink color and skin surrounding eyes is dark now as I believe there is considerable bruising of tiny blood vessels where the drug comes in contact with skin. That's okay on top lids where it looks like eye shadow, but underneath my eyes it merely accentuates my bags!	New (2011) lower dosage Lumigan is supposed to eliminate the pink while still doing its work containing glaucoma	F	68	3  years 1X D	1/30/2011
1	possible low pressure glaucoma	After 5 minutes of applying one drop in my left eye I had the following symptoms:  extremely dilated pupil, eye pain, extreme dry eye.  Eye pain has diminished, but still persists after 36 hours of use.  My opthamologist said he'd never heard of these reactions; however, the drug info on the internet says these side affects can be common.  I filed a report on the FDA Medwatch website.  I will be seeking another opinion from a different doctor before I try anything like this again.		F	65	1  days.01 1X D	12/4/2010Email
5	Glaucoma	long eyelashes	Lumigan rules.  It controls Glaucoma, along with Cosopt, AND results in fuller longer lashes!  I was warned that my blue eyes might turn brown but that did not happen.	F	52	10  years 1X D	4/26/2010
