2	Paget's Disease of the spine and sk	About 1 to 2 weeks after infusion I began having pain in all my muscles and most joints.  I feel tired, a little nauseated, pain in creases when I sit down or stand up, I am getting spasms in my hands and feet, and have a slight headache at times.	I told my doctor about my problems after the first infusion and he said it was unusual to have any side effects and it was probably due to something else.  I told him I had never experienced it before and I felt very bad during that time.  He said next time take a Tylenol.	F	68	2  timesunknown 2X AN	11/14/2010
1	Bone Mets from Breast Cancer	Flu like symptoms,kidney pain,fever,bone pain,fatigue,edema in legs and feet.	Recently we discovered that I am now producing kidney stones, which have been attributed to long term use of Aredia and Zometa. This condition is quite painful and I am now having to see a nephrologist and I am concerned that this may have damaged my kidneys.	F	57	9  years 1X M	7/9/2010Email
4	breast cancer w/ damage to spine	I take Aredia once a month for 2 hour injection (I also receive Herceptin every three weeks).  One day after Aredia injection, I have joint pain that will last up to 4 days.  I have fatigue, difficulty getting up after sitting down for awhile, also.  I used to get fever and nauseua until my oncologist lowered the dose of Aredia.  The Aredia is healing the damage to my spine.  My last PET scan showed improvement.	I have been taking Aredia for 2 1/2 years since I finished Chemotherapy.	F	57	2  years	1/23/2009Email

4	Osteogenises Imperfecta	Nausea, vomitting, fever, bone pain and a headache.(All within hours of the infusion).	I took the treatment in 2003 and had a good report after, my bone density increased in the hips and spine the first year.  The second year it stayed the same, and then this years bone density results were down alot.  Therefore my doctor's suggested that I take another 6 weeks of treatment.  I go once a week for a 4 1/2 hour infusion (30mg of Aredia with 500 mg of saline).  I have 4 treatments done and just 2 left.  I guess I'll see if it works this time, but I worry about the effects if will have on me in years to come.	F	29	4  weeks	11/28/2006Email
1	Osteoporosis	The popular Osteoporosis drug Aredia used by millions of Americans has been linked to linked to Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) or "dead jaw."		M	29	 	6/30/2006
2	metastatic breast cancer	flu like symptoms of fever, joint, bone and muscle pain and unrelenting extreme fatigue	Aredia was ramping up my immune system and making me quite ill for 2 or 3 weeks at a stretch.  Oncologist stopped the Aredia and put me on Zometa.	F	59	3  months	5/9/2006
5	osteoporosis	burning feeling in my throat, fast sharp pains in different areas of bone( behind the ear) and lft knee.After I ate, I felt the need to belch& liquid came out w/o warning, no burning as w/ Fosamax. This was my 1st infusion. 30 mg over 2&1/2 hrs..	Although my 1st day, I was told I may get a low grade fever& more bone pain the 1st treatment.It was easier than I expected, altho it slightly burned going in.I did get heart palpitations, altho it may have been from being nervous....

5	Metastatic Breast Cancer	I can't say that I have had any side effects with Aredia because I have been taking either chemo or other meds during the same time as the Aredia which makes it almost impossible to differentiate between what causes side effects. I started taking Aredia in 2003 when I was first diagnosed with breast cancer with bone and bone marrow metastisis. I had fractures in my back & ribs before my diagnosis and after I started on the Aredia the pain in my bones all but disappeared.  I still have some stiffness after sitting a while and getting up to walk, and occassionally get a little achy, but otherwise it has been wonderful.  Without a doubt I would have been and still would be in a lot of pain if not for the Aredia.  I am blessed to still be alive and blessed to be able to lead a quality life without being in constant pain.		F	60	2  years	2/23/2006
3	multiple myeloma	My doctor is taking me off Aredia for a couple of months to see if my joint stiffnes, pain, and imobility might be a result of taking the drug.  It is a constant "sore" pain, not just after treatment. Am to see a rheumotoligist in a couple of weeks but have already been tested for rhemotoid arthritis (negative).	I have been on the drug 4 months prior to BMT and 9 months now while I am in remission.  Do not remember these effects prior to BMT. Anyone with similiar experiences?  Email me.

4	Ostheoporosis	I have been taking Aredia for almost 2 years now.  Every 3 months, for about 4 hours drip, 60 mg with 500 ml saline - I go the clinic for the injection.No side effects so far - My last bone density showed that my spine improved a lot, no more ostheo.  My hips also improved, no more in the danger stage of breaking, but I still need a little bit of improvement.I will have to continue the treatment for another year, and hopefully, after another bone density, I will stop the treatment.I have also to mention that I take everyday, 600 gr of calcium and 1000 units of Vitamin D, and I exercie every day at the YMCA for 1 to 2 hours.	I would like to know in the long run, is there any side effects that could be dangerous to my health ?	F	65	2  years	1/16/2005Email
1	It was to help my bone density	I had a Blood Stem Cell Transplant about 6 months after being diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma.  About a year after I had the transplant and was in remission, I still am, after 7 years, I was given this drug. I read all the side effects I could find on it, and it seemed fairly safe. All the time I was getting it once a month, and about 5 years, I find the Aredia is the cause of all my dental problems.  All my teeth have fallen out in the lower part of my mouth. If you look in my mouth, you can see the jaw bone is completely exposed.  The dentis says there is no treatment for this, just antibiotics and pain pills. Surgery will not work, nor will the hyperbaric chamber. I can't even wear dentures on the bottom, as there isn't enough of the jawbone left for the dentures to		F	60	5  years	6/2/2004Email
3	Osteoporosis	Chills (10 hours after infusion, lasting 8 hours)Queasiness(10 hours after infusion, lasting 8 hours)Traveling joint aches (10 hours after infusion, lasting 8 hours)Chest Pain (32 hours after infusion, lasting 3 hours)Restless leg syndrome (36 hours after infusion, lasting 6 hours until sometime after given Ristoril)	I didn't take Aredia, per se, I received pamidronate via one infusion, 60 mg with 500 ml saline, started at a 2 hour drip, slowed to a 4 hour drip due to some minor tingling in the lips and wrists. Scheduled for another infusion in 6 months. Too early yet to tell what effect, if any, it has had on the osteoporosis.	F	61	2  months	11/29/2003
