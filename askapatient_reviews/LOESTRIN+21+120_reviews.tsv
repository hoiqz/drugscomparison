				F M	 	 	    
1	control cramps, lighten flow	Doc prescribed because I was having heavy flow & severe cramping.  Told me it would lighten both.  Unfortunately it has gotten somewhat worse.  My period now lasts on & off for 3 out of 4 wks in a month.  The cramps aren't as severe but are more frequent since my cycle never seems to end.  I'd rather deal w/the once a month visit than the awful 21+ days of misery.  So I'll be stopping this BC after this pack is finished.  Also have breast tenderness, major mood swings / emotional outbursts that I never had before.  Not to mention lack of sex drive.		F	38	2  months	3/19/2012Email
2	PMS	No period, slight cramping, emotional and crying all the time for no reason.		F	26	6  weeks	2/28/2012Email
3	pregnancy prevention	Acne, lower sex drive	I've never had acne on a regular basis. Before I started taking Junel (the generic of Loestrin) I would only have a couple pimples on my chin right before starting my period. After taking Junel, I have widespread acne. I've also found that I have little to no sex drive. I'm hoping that the next BC I try (Desogen/Apri) will affect me positively.	F	26	6  months 1X D	1/18/2012
2	prevent pregnancy and cramping	Mood swings, breast tenderness, weight gain, and yeast infections.	Ive tried so many different birthcontrol pills, and none of them have worked.  Im not a huge fan of loestrin 21, but its not the worst ive had.  For three months now i havent had my period, normally id be happy, but i fear im pregnant everytime it doesnt come.  Kind of a blessing and a curse.  My mood swings are crazy the week before my placebo pills and i have absolutly no sex drive.  My eating habits have gone haywire.  No appetite until the week before my "period" when i eat everything in sight.  Im already prone to yeast infections, but taking loestrin has just made it worse.  Wouldnt really recommened this pill.	F	19	5  months 1X D	12/11/2011
2	Avoid pregnancy	First month: spotting for a week and a missed period ... thought I was pregnant. Second month: breaking out in horrible spots, seem to be having a period 2 weeks before I'm due. However, nausea has improved.	I'd been feeling nauseous and emotional every day for a year so I thought I'd swap from Microgynon 30 to a new pill - the nurse recommended Loestrin 20. So far, i'm not happy! I've got spots, feel like i'm gaining weight and my period is very irregular. I have to keep worrying about pregnancy because my period isn't coming at the right time. It's very unsettling. I'm off to university next month and I don't want horrific spots or to be fat as well as worrying about being pregnant when my period doesn't come!!	F	19	21  days20mg 1X D	9/13/2011Email
3	Prevention of Pregnancy	missing period, major breast tenderness, spotting weeks before period should of come.	I left Nuvaring after 4 years on it, I became very ill on it so my gyno suggested going on pills, which i hesitated never been good with pills. the first 2 month where amazing light periods, no migraine, no moods wings. about the 3 month i missed a period, the 4 i got my period as usual, now before the 5 month period i went to the gyno for a routine check up and right after a day or 2 i started spotting and my period which was supposed to be 2 weeks later never came. now on my 6 month nothing either. I'm starting to worry cause I haven't missed any pills. As great as it is not to get  a period, I would prefer to at least get some sort of period.	F	32	6  months1mg/20mcg 1X D	9/11/2011Email
1	loestrin 20	weight gain and spots and NO PERIOD	I hate this pill i was on yasmin and had regular periods, lost weight and my skin was amazing. I now have acne, havent had a period and gained 4 ibs in six weeks which isnt normal for me as i go to the gym 5 times a week.I havent had a period since changing and its worrying. I will be coming off the pill once i have finished this packet. Its put me off for a long time.	F	23	6  weeks 1X D	9/7/2011Email
5	Severe Dysmorphea and long periods	breasts are tender, extremely light 3 day periods. Mild cramping and some mood swings.	I actually love this pill. I've had TERRIBLE experiences with birth control PILLS. I used to take the depo shot for many years so I wouldn't have a period because my periods are heavy, they last up to 7 days (my shortest periods lasted 5 days. I've tried Loestrin 24Fe and I forget the name of the other one and they both made me break out with an ugly rash all over my face and chest. This pill hasn't given me any major problems. My first pack I didn't get my period at all. After the pack second I got my period and it was so light all I could wear were panty liners and it only lasted 3 days. This is a miracle for me. I love this pill because it does exactly what I NEED it to do!!!!!!	F	29	3  months 1X D	8/31/2011Email
4	Prevent Pregnancy	No bad side effects yet.  Kind of moody.	Here is my question, During my first month taking it I just spotted throughout but didn't have a period.  I was sexually active during that time and now I am worried.  I am into my second month now.	F	39	1  months30 MG 1X D	11/6/2010Email
1	prevent pregnancy	weight gain, cramping, two weeks so far of bleeding heavy		F	20	2  months 1X D	10/10/2010
3	prevention	Horrible headaches almost daily, severe indigestion, sever water retention, breast tenderness, gained about 5 pounds, trouble sleeping, and acne	i switched to loestrin after being on seasonique for almost 5 years, then i was on ovcan for two months and switched due to heavy bleeding. i have indigestion to the point that it is hard for me to sleep. the headaches are another reason for the lack of sleep. i have a large breast size as it is so now that my boobs basically grew overnight since i started this pill it has been very uncomfortable. I have never been the kid with sever acne i would always have one or two zits every now and then but since being on the pill my face has been horrible oily and breakouts. besides the obvious problems i am having with the side effects from this pill it is actually helping what it is supposed to. i haven't had any sever cramps just mild discomfort and i have very light and short periods.	F	21	5  months 1X D	10/6/2010
5	Heavy, incessant bleeding	Slight water retention	I was wary about going on a BCP for fear of getting nauseated all of the time. Suprisingly I have not had any nausea or any other side effects except for a slight water retention. I am grateful the bleeding stopped at day 2 of taking it, and am looking forward to lighter periods. Before going on Loestrin 21 my periods were irratic and extremely heavy--almost a hemmorage.	F	48	1  weeks 1X D	9/22/2010
2	Contraception & Uteran cysts	Weight gain, constant heavy break-through bleeds, loss of libido, moodiness, crying, 3rd week severe shakiness, exhaustion	The first few months of this pill were great, no PMS, light periods, only slight weight gain. The longer I am on it for the more weight I have put on & the worse I feel, I am now having my 5th "withdrawal bleed" in 7 weeks, this one has lasted 8 days so far & is getting more painful. I'm seeing the doctor on Tuesday & I'm coming off this pill!	F	30	2  years20mg 1X D	8/17/2010
3	To prevent pregnancy	Breast Tenderness, spotting	I have been taking Loestrin 21 for at least 3 month now and I have had spotting in between for some time. If you attempt to skip straight to the next active pill so you may not have a period, you may be disappointed. I would spot anyway. And this month, I was at least 5 days early. I hope it wont last for more than few days because I have not even finished the active hormone pill course. :(	F	26	4  months 1X D	7/15/2010
2		mood swings, no period	I ran out of LoEstrin and didn't make it to the pharmacy for about one week, even though the 'down' days are less than that - at that point I noticed that despite being MORE tired than I when was on Loestrin (due to late nights for work), I was less moody, more patient, and generally happier.  Also - I've lost weight (about 5 lbs) doing nothing special since going off of LoEstrin.  The 'no period' was nice, but I'm going back to Orthocyclin.		37	90  days 1X D	6/25/2010
3	dysmenorrhea	It has been helping with the HORRIBLE cramps that I would experience but it has made me extremely moody. I keep crying for no reason and arguing with my friends. I also keep getting this really big pimples/marks on my arms. I'm going to the doctor in 2 weeks to either switch to a different brand or give up on birth control all together...		F	19	4  months 1X D	6/8/2010
5	My body can't handle hormones well	Slight naseua	Don't take yaz. It works great at first and then slowly makes you depressed without knowing it. Ok to this birthcontrol loestrin 21. So far I like it. I haven't had any problems with gaining weight or bloating. No loss of libido.  I am kind of excited to start my period (well as excited as one can be about something like that) since a lot of people say it's very short and somewhat pain free. So far I am happy with these pill	F	19	3  weeks1mg/20mcg 1X D	3/20/2010Email
4	bad cramps, depression	reduced cramps, lighter period, more stable emotions	I have horrible cramps that usually have me throwing up and unable to do anything for two days straight (including missing work). I've tried other birth control methods before and they actually made my cramps worse, so I gave up a couple years ago. Last year, though, I was having very irregular periods and horrible mood swings/depression, so I decided to give it another try. The first time I filled the prescription, they gave me the generic (microgestin?), and it was as bad as the others I'd tried. I told them to actually give me Loestrin the next time I got the prescription filled, and I've been happy since. My cramps aren't completely gone, but they're significantly reduced and I can go to work. My periods are a lot lighter and very regular, and I haven't had any spotting. Also, my emotions have been much more stable. I've gained weight, but I think that's more due to the fact that I'm eating less healthy and barely working out anymore, so I can't say that it's from the Loestrin.	F	23	9  months20 1X D	3/13/2010
1	To prevent pregnancy	Started taking this pill on the first day of my period and haven't stopped bleeding. For two weeks! My boobs are really sensitive to touch and I get headaches. My friend is also on this pill and her period sometimes skips. Would nbot recommend this pill to ANYONE!		F	20	2  weeks 1X D	2/21/2010
5	irregular cycle	The only side effects I've noticed, are horrible indigestion and maybe slight nausea. These only seem to happen though when I don't eat enough before/after taking my pill;so it's totally fixable. (I hope!) Besides those 2, I can't complain about this pill at all. It's seemed to improve my moods a little and my periods have so far been totally fine,except more painful than usual.		F	17	  1X D	2/13/2010
1	Acne, birth control	Major side effect - in my case, my face broke out like crazy. I had so much acne, I never had anything of the kind before!! And it made me eat like a horse, so I quit it a soon as I can in order not to turn into an elephant!		F	30	30  days	12/1/2009
5	good effects	No negative side effetcs, all positive and ive lost weight!	First off i would like to tell you my history with two other BC, First birth control i ever took was Yaz/Yasmin= mood swings, weight gain especially in breast. After taking that for a year i switched to the nuva ring, and i had no negative side effects except for low sex drive and dryness and was using that method for about 2 years. I recently have started taking Loestrin and let me tell you what i todl the doctor, i had told her how the nuva ring made me dry down there and not able to have a sex drive. and my doctor said i should try loestrin since it is suppose to have less symptoms than the rest, although it really depends on how your body chemicals react to loestrin's chemicals. So far, i havent had any bad side effects and ive only been on this method for 7 days, some good things is that i have lower appeotite and ive actually lost 2 1/2 pounds. i havent had any negative side effects so im super happy. I wonder if anyone else is in this position =) Also im curious is people who have had taken yaz/yasmin and experienced bad side effects like i did and if they switched to loestrin and notice no bad side effects. That would be interesting for all of us to know. I hope this helps!!	F	20	7  days	11/30/2009
5	Depression/mood swings: perimenopau	Mild breakouts. More like red bumps than 'pimples'. Weight gain, but to be fair, I made the mistake of not watching my food intake. So if you go on it, DON'T OVEREAT!	It TOTALLY changed my mood balance within 2-3 weeks. I had been very sad and moody for 8 months (age 46). I now have very mild PMS, like I used to. And my periods are very mild.	F	46	5  months	10/31/2009
2	birth control	cramping first 3 weeks, and bleeding for 2 weeks after I started. And worst of all, NO SEX DRIVE!!		F	31	6  weeks	9/17/2009
5	pcos and birth control	some bloating at the 3rd week.	A 3 day heavy regular period(yay)abnormal hair growth slowed. massive moodswings and cramps dissapeard, one cramp just as flow starts then nothing. loss of hard fat deposits.	F	45	15  years	8/13/2009
4	Regulation/prevent pregnancy	Breast Tenderness which doesn't bother me much and first month no period and second month first day still no period...ill see if i still get it i have three days to go...No spotting and kinda emotional...overall good so far gonna wait and see if i ever get my period tho..		F	18	2  months	7/23/2009
3						 	7/22/2009
2	Low hormone birth control (High BP)	Ridiculous weight gain, horrible cramps, mood swings, break-through bleeding, no period yet :/	My OB/GYN prescribed this for me after I had my daughter three months ago because I developed severe Post Gestational Hypertension. Regular birth control will aggravate my "condition" so I have to take something that is low dose. It was either this or Paraguard, uhhh no thank you! I do not like this pill though. I am planning on switching to Ortho Tri-Cycline Lo next month.	F	19	1  months	7/18/2009
2	Birth control	Have been taking Loestrin for only a month but im hating it already! Very bad mood swings, very emotional, bad acne, migrane by the end of the pack....only advantage is that my period was very very light..Considering taking Yaz now although i should probably stick to loestrin for a few months before switching...body takes a few months to adjust but i cant take all the side effects..		F	28	1  months	7/9/2009
2	bc, help lower bp	Had to get off of awesome ortho novum 1/35 because of high blood pressure.  Did not have a period at end of first pack of loestrin 21 1/20, but did have what felt like early pregnancy cramping and nausea for about a week and a half.  I'm now into the second week of my second pack and have just started to feel nauseous again.  I'm more emotional than usual at the "wrong" time in my cycle (week 2  instead of end of week 3), and sex drive has gone from 10 to 2!  Not cool!		F	33	6  weeks	5/17/2009
4	Contraception, control period	Depression, crazy mood swings (sometimes i just feel like crying unprovoked) I notice i keep snapping on people or copping an unnecessary attitude. Break through bleeding/spotting. for the past almost month I notice i've had a sorta red-brown discharge (like you get when your about to start your period) loss of appetite, breast tenderness when i first started it but not so much now.	even with all the side effects i guess its the best birth control ive been on so i'll just keep on taking it	F	20	5  months	5/11/2009
3	Cramps/Prevent Pregnancy	Breast tenderness and enlargement commencing the 2nd month (which I do not find positive in the least!), severe mood swings and loss of patience the week before my per.	My period was super short and light (HOORAY), I still had cramps but they were far more managable. No noticable change in sex drive. I am on the generic form "Microgestin 1/20"	F	18	1.5  months	4/19/2009
4	Preventing Pregnancy	I have had barely any side effects. The only side effects I have had are breast tenderness and slightly more moody.	This medication has cleared up my acne, made my periods much lighter and no cramps! I tried Loestrin 24 Fe but it was HORRIBLE. I was always depressed and it gave me horrible acne.	F		3  months	3/9/2009
3	Contraception	nausea, dizziness, water retention (around abdomen), acne, heavy breakthrough bleeding	Not sure how I feel about Loestrin after getting off the NuvaRing - which I do NOT recommend for anyone as I had crippling migraines...also led to increased pressure in my corneas causing a great deal of eye pain.  The Loestrin has graciously given me about 10 pounds that refuse to go away regardless of exercise/diet intensity...don't know if I am truly happy with it or not...	F	25	6  months	2/18/2009
4	Contraception	Spotting, Shorter periods, slightly tender but bigger boobs	Overall satisfied	F	18	1  years	12/12/2008
4	ovarian cysts	Severe cramps during the second week. Bleeding during the second week, as well as during the fourth week.  It's like having your period twice a month. Not pleasant.		F	18	8  months	12/9/2008
4	Birth Control, Thin Out Flow, Cyst	Longer than normal periods, spotting, very moody at times, cramping, low sex drive, clotting is unbelievable.	My primary reason for taking it was to control cysts but I still am developing them.  My skin is gorgeous.	F	40	2  years	11/4/2008
4	birth control, hormone regulation	Breast Tenderness and occasional breakthrough bleeding/spotting (twice a year has been the average for me)	Out of many different birth control pills I've taken over the years, I like Loestrin the best.  My period lasts a day and is so light I can just wear a panty liner.  No cramps, No weight gain for me, No acne...although, I do experience breast tenderness, but I can live with that.  About twice a year, I've experienced spotting/breakthrough bleeding...but again, I can live with that, especially since I barely get a period the rest of the time.	F	30	3.5  years	9/29/2008
3	Stop pregnancy help cramps bleeding	Breast enlargement, period every two weeks :P, cramps still there, less bleeding, moodiness (never used to be so emotional) long periods of spotting/cramping following short periods.	I'm halfway through my third month with loestrin, and I'm really getting worried and confused.  This pill has messed up my period, and made me think I've been pregnant twice (I haven't) Again, I am getting a period halfway through the month, this time the cramps are just as bad as before I started the pill and I'm barely spotting, it has lasted almost a week now!  I don't know what to think.  I'm going to stay on it for the fourth month, but if it stays this unpredictable, and I keep having 2 PERIODS A MONTH!  I'm going to try something else.  I didn't go on the pill to have twice as many periods.	F	19	10  weeks	9/7/2008Email
5	bad cramps and depression		Changed my life, couldn't be happier.	F	37	2  years	6/30/2008
3	birth control	no sex drive	periods are light and only last about 2 days with no cramping, but have no sex drive. This is the only reason I'm disappointed.	F	30	1  years	6/12/2008Email
3	birth control	missed period, extreme cramping	i'm into my second pill pack of the generic version, had spotting the whole first month and missed my period, the first week of the second pack i got the worst cramps i've ever had in my life, considered going to the emergency room bc of the pain, not sure about this pill i might give it a couple more months	F	20	1.2  months	6/5/2008
5		Some break outs	Way better than tri-cyclen for me, some spotting but no big deal.	F	34	2  years	5/29/2008
4	Regularity, cramps	None so far	Brilliant. Switched from microgyn30 as i was bleeding constantly. Now on Loestrin20 for 6weeks(no break) and only had two days of bleeding. My breasts are fuller but i've not gained weight. My cramps are easier to deal with but that may be as i'm also on mebeverine as a last resort pain treatment whilei wait for gyno referal-i suffer from terrible as yet unexplained pelvic/abdominal pain	F	17	6  weeks	5/26/2008Email
5	Birth Control	Breast Fullness	I love this pill. I highly recommend it. I have been on it for a year now and my period lasts for about 3 days. It's usually on time and I take my pill at all different times (not good I know) but it has been great so far.	F	21	1  years	4/15/2008
5	Period problems.	Dizziness, nausea, a little mood swings.	I've been on this pill for almost a month after switching from a generic brand of Seasonale, which caused me to spot, lash out at people and made me a horrible person.  Loestrin is amazing, I've had no spotting or cramps, just a little nauesea and dizziness.	F	16	1  weeks	3/24/2008
2	regulate periods	i've had break though bleeding every second week of every new pack. also, bad cramps during the break though bleeding. every time i call my obgyn, he insists i stick it out for another month.	worst pill ever.	F	19	6  months	3/12/2008
5	Regulation, birth control	Light spotting for first 3 weeks,	I haven't had my period since switching from Yasmin to Loestrin, which is definately a good thing in my case. I had some light spotting at first, but it can take up to 3 months for your body to adjust, so it was expected. I haven't had the mood swings and headaches I experienced when on Yasmin. My skin has also stayed clear and my sex drive hasn't been affected at all.	F	21	4  months	2/28/2008
2	birth control	Constant light bleeding	I have had enough of loestrin! I have been taking it for almost a month and have had light bleeding for most of that time. No other side effects. After I get my period I will try another pill.	F	30	1  months	2/4/2008
2	Birth Control	Been taking it for about a week and i just experienced some bleeding. I was taking yaz before, which is great , but recently just started taking loestrin  21. I dont like it too much so im looking forward to going back to yaz. It makes me feel uncofterable and i do not like experiencing occasional bleeding between periods.	I recommend yaz.	F	21	1  weeks	2/2/2008
5	heavy periods & endometriosis	Absolutely no side effects.  Everyone is different so some may have various side effects, but not me.  I've been on BC pills for over 20 years.  This by far is the best one.	I'm on the continual regime.  I have no periods.  LOVE that.  My breast are bigger, Love that.  My sex drive is so/so but I can't relate it to the pill.  I have miagraines which this pill has helped.	F	37	8  years	1/10/2008
3	Birthcontrol	Acne breakouts, bleeding in middle of pill pack.	Have taken for one month (one pill pack).  I had bleeding the second week taking the pills, along with my regular period two weeks later.  Periods were same as normal.	F	20	1  months	12/28/2007
3	Birth control/bad cramps	I am actaully taking the generic version called junel Fe 1.5/30. So far I have been taking these pills for 3 days.  My stomach felt very nauseas, I feel more tired, and I threw up so bad this morning....I don't know if I can take much more of this, I will finish my pack and if it doesn't improve I will take another one.  This pill also made me a bit moody and emotional, and I got some headaches.		F	19	3  days	11/14/2007
3	Doctor Recomended	Occasional Spotting week before Period is supposed to start...if it starts.	I have been on this pill for 4 months...first month, din't get a period, second week I got it and it was very light...only bled first day...3rd month, spotted week before, nothing week of. Fourth month, NOTHING! Very unpredictable!	F	26	4  days	10/15/2007
1	IRREGULAR PERIODS	WEIGHT GAIN, BREAST PAIN, ACNE	Took Lo-Estrin for 8 months, gained 10lbs (weight has never been a problem for me).  Had acne and breast pain.  Took other pills before and never had this problem. Stopped taking Lo-Estrin last week and already lost 5lbs!!!!!!!!!!   Not a good pill at all.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Going back to Alesse.	F	34	8  months	10/11/2007
4	Severe Cramps/Cysts/Pregnancy		I have been on LoEstrin 21 for about 7 years now and really recommend it. After trying many other pills over the years this was the only one that would not make me gain weight or have enlarged breasts. My periods are extremely light and cramps minimized.	F	29	7  years	9/10/2007
5	Endometriosis/Horrible periods	Bigger breasts (yay for me!), breast tenderness, NO MORE HORRIBLE CRAMPS! VERY light 2-day period.	This has worked wonders for me.  I was incapacitated by my cramps every month.  I had tried other BC pills in the past which made me super moody, irritable and just felt "not right".  I was scared to try this, but my cramps were so bad (apparently due to endometriosis) that I had to try something.  The generic pills made my boobs hurt constantly...they were big, yes, but SO painful!  I switched to brand name and have had NO problems whatsoever.  I love these pills!	F	33	9  months	6/19/2007
3	birth control	none as of yet just started.	I've been reading about this pill, and I'm very concerned. I wanted to take Yaz ,but this what they gave me.		33	1  days	6/12/2007
2	Regulate Periods	Bleeding for two continuious weeks, BLOATING, and mood swings		F	17	2  weeks	3/21/2007
5	To control PMS	None, after light breakthrough bleeding first 2 months	It was suggested by my gynaecologist that I took a low dose pill to control my crippling PMS symptoms (tiredness, memory loss, speech/vision blurring and depression). I went for a 20mg estrogen pill as I am over 40.  It has been entirely successful so far.  I am now completely well and with the benefit of 2 day light periods. Just remember to check your breasts regularly.	F	40	4  months	3/8/2007
