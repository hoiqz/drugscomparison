5	yeast infection from antibiotic use	No side effects.	This stuff worked great! I had zero burning or itching. The yeast infection cleared up, as promised. The only downside is that the stuff is a little messy, especially compared to the ease of a diflucan tablet, which is also cheaper than this kit. BUT buying the kit saves me the hassle of going to the Dr.'s and getting a pelivc exam, so I'll take this anyday.	F	23	1  days 1X D	6/9/2012
1	Yeast infection	This stuff is horrible and should be pulled from the shelves, immediately!!! I used the monistat 1 before going to bed. It immediately started burning and itching, but the side effects saying those things may increase. I powered through and eventually fell asleep. I woke up a few hours later with what felt like menstrual cramps, very painful. As I sat up, I realized my vulva hurt immensely!!! Upon inspection, my inner labia were swollen to about 4 or 5 times their normal size and were red and raw. I was also so itchy!! Of course, I was in so much pain and couldn't even touch myself without wincing. I took a shower and tried to get as much off as possible. I cannot express how painful this was!!! I kept an ice pack on for most of the day, which helped with the swelling, a bit. My skin was so raw that it started bleeding. That was yesterday. I took Benadryl last night and slept with an ice pack on. Things are mildly better today, but I will be going to my GYN ASAP! Do not use this product!!! Please, it's so awful. Even if you've used it before, it only takes one time. I can't believe the FDA thinks this is ok for women.		F	34	1  days	12/12/2011Email
1	Vaginal Yeast Infection	Intense horrible unrelenting BURNING.NONSTOP burning.	I've had yeast infections before and have always gone to the Dr. and gotten a prescription. Since it was a weekend and my Dr's office was closed, I decided to use Monistat 1. It was simple to use but that was the only positive. I also used the cooling cream...ha! It started to burn almost immediately and so I rinsed off in the shower. Unfortunately, my insides still felt like they were on fire. It felt like someone had poured acid in my vagina and my skin was melting off. I would have gone to the ER if anyone would have been home to drive me. I didn't think it would ever stop. I took a benedryl hoping that it would help me sleep. I'm writing the FDA next, there is no reason that this product should still be on the market.	F	28	1  days 1X D	10/24/2011
4	Vaginal Yeast Infection	Mild to moderate discomfort from time to time, but that might not have been due to the medication... yeast infections can hurt! Also, I had very thick (although not excessive) discharge that I am assuming was from the ovule.	I have heard so many complaints about this medication, but honestly I did not have any adverse side effects! The process was simple and caused very little discomfort and the external cream did wonders for the itching!	F	18	1  times1200 1X AN	9/26/2011
1	Yeast Infection	BURNING, INTENSE ITCHING, SWELLING, HEAT, SORE	This is horrible!  I have had a yeast infection for about a week.  I use natural methods to rid myself of a yeast infection, and have for years.  I tried my tea tree oil, tried my yogurt, and garlic.  It was certainly getting better, but I was getting tired of waiting for it go away completely.  I figured this one was just worse than normal and I needed an OTC help to knock it out.  I put the medication in and went to bed.  An hour later I wake up it hurts so bad.  It's burning and itching and I feel hot.  I go to the bathroom and the little egg thing falls out.  I figure I just needed a little more of the external cream since I was itching.  BIG mistake, it starts burning and itching more.  I got in the shower and put the hand held shower head on the strongest it will go and power washed it out.  I took some anti-inflammatories the doctor gave me for a muscle injury a few months ago and applied lidocaine to my poor burning skin.  WHY THE HELL are they selling this stuff?  I too considered ER or doctor's office, but what can they do?  Flush it?  Give me an anti-inflammatory?  I used Monistat about 10 years ago...it NEVER did this before.

4	Yeast Infection	Itching, Burning	I have been taking an antibiotic and did not realize that antibiotics can cause yeast infections. Lesson Learned: Always take Acidophilus or a probiotic while taking an antibiotic.	F	20	1  days1 Use 1X AN	9/13/2011Email
1		I am 43 yrs of age and have dealt with vaginal infections much of my life.  In the past, I've used Monistat 7 and had no side effects.  This is the 2nd time I tried Monistat 1 and the 2nd time experiencing intense burning that did not subside after hours.  I am amazed by women on here saying this is normal and the women complaining are wimps... are you serious?  This is a "side effect" to the product.  It is very likely that you might feel a slight tingling or itch when using a cream of any type but if the burning is so bad, you can't sit still or it continues hour upon hour, it is time to seek medical attention or at the very least, wash the area and try to "remove" the cream from the vaginal area.  You should NOT be this uncomfortable.  One woman on here wrote that vomitting when taking any medication is normal... I mean, really, are you serious?  That is an allergic reaction!  Are we women to the point now where we just expect to be in pain and uncomfortable even		F	43	1  days 1X D	4/24/2011Email
2	Yeast Infection	Itching, burning, swelling	I had the first yeast infection I had had for about 3 years.  I remembered the Monistat 7 being effective but very messy for an entire week.  I decided to try the 1 day treatment.  It was awful.  I inserted the ovule a few hours before bed and everything was fine.  However, I woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible itching.  It was much worse than the infection itself.   I burned and itched for about 2 hours, all the while applying ice, a cold wash, anything to make it stop.I considered the ER, but what would the be able to do?  Finally after 2 hours I fell asleep and woke up with a mild itching and the infection seems to be gone.  I will NEVER use this product again.  The cure was not worth the side effects!

1		Burning, swelling of the vulvua & itching.  Feels like I am completely swollen "down there" and plan to put an ice pack on it ASAP (in class right now..lol..not something I would recommend in public forum)	It's bitter sweet to see the comments made..I almost called my OB/GYN with a "NEED TO SEE SOMEONE NOW!!!" introduction.Had to change panties three times, used vagasil wipes and kept the area "aired out", clean and dry..still having a hard time walking across campus and think I may skip the treadmill/gym today.  Will use "feminine wash" and a medicated douche to lessen the "contamination" from this mess.This is some awful stuff..will NOT use it again.

1	yeast infection	Extreme pain and burning sensation.  This product is not appropriate for over-the-counter use as some women (like me) are allergic/hypersensitive.  This is my personal opinion.		F	43	1  days1 ovule 1X D	8/18/2010
1	yeast infection due to antibiotic	severe itching and burning	Just like many other accounts I'm reading here, I'm having the most intense itching and burning sensation I've ever experienced.  It's much worse than the symptoms of the infection itself.  I'm sitting on an ice pack and I'm about to take some Tylenol as suggested by another in the same condition.  Miserable is the only word I can think to describe my situation.  Thank goodness I found these reviews, I was considering going to the ER.	F	29	1  days 1X D	6/16/2010
1	yeast infection	intense burning and itching.	like pp i am in the worst bout of burning and itching, much worse than my original problem and am searching information on the web at 3 am. it woke me up after 2 hours of sleep.	F	41	1  times 1X D	5/26/2010
1	Yeast Infection	SEVERE BURNING AND ITCHING	Inserted ouvle at 12 midnight, tried to go to sleep for 4 hours with no luck. I got up to watch tv and felt pure pain from the itching so I used the wipe given in the pack...well that made it worse. I took a shower to rinse of as much as possible off the outside since that was causing the burning. Now its 5:45 and im searchin online to see if this is normal. I NEED AN ICEPACK TO SIT ON!! The itching is worse than the original itch from the yeast infection plus now i have the unbearable burning. i will never use this product again. Your vagina is very sensitive and i would never use something so harsh on it. The warning label said MILD SIDE EFFECTS this is nowhere near MILD it is SEVERE. I CANT EVEN SLEEP!!!
