3	ocular rosacea	I have not noticed any side effects	Seems to reduce the puffiness of my eyelids, and the scratchy feeling has subsided.   I believe this medication is keeping the condition from getting worse, My eyelids are still swollen and I always look  rather sunburned, though I am careful of exposure.

1	Skin infection	Severe itching after a week		F	27	7  days 2X D	6/19/2010
1	infection	Weak muscles	It took about 5 weeks to finally be back to 100%I couldn't walk very far and my hands were unable to perform any task (write, type get dressed etc) without a lot of rest in between.	F	57	4  days 1X D	4/22/2010
1	Acne	I developed the most severe heartburn I've ever experienced.  I've never had a real problem with heartburn before.  I could probably count on one hand how many times my whole life I've had it.  But this was something beyond heartburn.  I was doubled over in the bathroom floor unable to move it was so bad.  Also, the drug info sheet that came with the prescription did NOT say this (I later found it online after the fact) but antacids only make heartburn worse.  Do not take antacids with this under any circumstances.  I think it was actually more like a chemical burn of the esophagus.  I took it exactly as prescribed, with a whole glass of water and everything.  I was in so much pain I went to the ER over this.  It also made me sick at my stomach for the week leading up to this.  I thought it was due to the combination of my birth control and the tetracycline but I now know it was 100% tetracycline.  I will NEVER use this drug again.	Absolutely not worth it!  I was prescribed amoxicillin as a replacement and it worked faster and without the horrid side effects.  I saw better results from 3 days of amoxicillin than I did with nearly 2 weeks of tetracycline.	F	26	12  days	1/21/2010
2	Acne	Dizziness, sore stomach, vomiting.	I switched to Amoxicillin and haven't had any stomach problems. My skin has also greatly improved with use in conjunction with a benzoyl peroxide wash twice daily.	F	24	2  weeks	8/27/2009
4	Mild/Moderate Acne	Bloating, gas, constipation, fatigue, abdominal pain (doctor says it's my appendix--never had any problems with them before taking this antibiotic)	My skin has cleared up rather well--I was experiencing large cysts, one of which never went away until I lanced it myself with a pin (not recommended though--I now have a huge dent right between my eyebrows!). Following 3 months of Tetracycline 300 (or Lymecycline, as it says on my prescription label--they are the same thing) my skin is much better, I am no longer getting cysts. I still get the odd spot, particularly around menstruation time, which is normal, with or without acne. I have now stopped this antibiotic because of my stomach complaints, I'm clearly not digesting properly and it is putting a strain on my organs. I would however consider doing another 3-mth course of Tetracycline in the future if required. I was taking this in combination with Differin. I am now only using the Differin cream, and so far my skin is relatively clear, just the odd spot, but they tend to clear up quicker than before treatment. I have no problems that I can detect are a result of Differin, other than very light dryness, but not enough to not be able to wear make-up or anything, so I am very satisfied with this cream--Differin 0.1%, once at night. I just use a basic oil-free moisturiser with it, and clean my face at night with either water or sensitive baby wipes.Oh yes, I was also taking the contraceptive Yasmin for 5 months, which is meant to have an anti-androgen effect which can help problem skin. However, I came off Yasmin 3 weeks ago and my skin is still as clear as it was.	F	27	3  months	8/22/2009
2	ACNE	DIAHRREA UPSET STOMACH	CLEARED ACNE BUT STILL HAVE STOMACH PROBLEMS THAT I NEVER HAD BEFORE TAKING THIS DRUG.  I STOPPED TAKING 10 YEARS AGO WHEN STARTED USING PRO-ACTIVE WASHING SOLUTION. WORKS BETTER FOR ME	M	52	5  years	7/18/2009
3	Gum infection	Dizzy, nauseous	I was taking 500mg capsules 4 times per day. This did clear up the infection, but after 5 days I felt horrible.	M	47	5  days	12/3/2008
4	Chalazion	Eye Dr. prescribed as part of treatment to rid recurring chalazions (blocked oil glands in eyelid). The treatment worked. It evidently reduces oil gland output. I was supposed to take it for 4 weeks; after 1 week developed mild thrush; by day 14 had to quit, but by then it had done most of the work.	I had no ill effects other than the fungal infestation in my mouth (also began to spread down throat.) Other improvement: my chronic bloating and overproduction  of gas was greatly improved. Improvement lingered for weeks, but gradually re-developed the chronic feeling of bloat and gas production after quitting the antibiotic.	M	50	14  days	11/24/2008
2	Acne	Stomach upset during first week, rash to the neck and chest during second week. At the start of the third week I still have acne to my face and am reconsidering the usefulness of this drug.		F	27	18  days	5/16/2007
1	For skin problem	Got upper abdominal pain-and subsequently have a liver condition-dont know if it was coincedental that when started taking medicine pain started and then discovered condition-but STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!1		F	16	3  months	9/21/2005
3	H. Pylori	mild diarhea at first, which cleared up. loss of appetite and slight depression also appear to be occuring from this drug.		M	20	7  days	1/12/2005
3	acne	some heart burn when lying down	I switched medication because I hated having to take it on an empty stomach and not lying down.	F	19	6  months	10/19/2004
