1	diabetes	Gave me severe pain in my stomach and upper back	I can't say much more about this drug since I took it only one day but the pain was unbearable so I had to stop ... otherwise I would have taken it longer.	F	60	1  days 2X D	5/12/2012Email
3	type 2 dibetic	Post nasal drip from hell- up to 30 OTC pills to dry me out to sleep and stop spitting up mucous all day. If I take more than 1& 1/2  of a 500 mg tab a day I get head aches. Actos started the mucous, trying to find a type 2 med to take and get the mucous to stop. The spitting -up herniated my belly button, too. I purchase 36 boxes of tissue a month. Mucous is robbing me of energy, cannot go  on any trips.	Blood sugar good. I took regular metformin ( glucopahge ) for 10 years or so but started having headaches. Some weight loss from Actos reversed.	M	68	10  months750 mg 2X D	11/2/2011Email

1	Type II Diabetes	Increased fat around middle, which is what you should avoid with diabetes.  My waist size has increased at lest 2-3 inches, and I now have a big roll around my waist which I never had taking metformin.	The doctor wants me to take twice daily, but my copay is $60 per month and along with other meds I would reach my donut hole mid-year or earlier.	F	71	8  months50-500 mg 1X D	12/1/2010
