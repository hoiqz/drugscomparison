2	diabetes type 2	I have gained some weight but no other side effects.	I use a sliding scale as provided by my doctor.  I don't think it works well.  2 hours after eating, I tested my blood sugar at 210.  I took 20 units of Humalog.  2 hours later, I was at 190.  The drop in sugar was similar to what would happen with no meds.	M	48	3  monthsvaries 3X D	3/14/2011Email
4	Diabetes	My weight grow up a little bit	My history is not so happy. My diabetes happened when I was 29 years old, start true with a insulin resistence and frequently hypoglicemies, so I felt so much sympthoms like vertigos, nervousness, irritability, exhaustion, tremors, cold sweats, headaches, pain muscles, insomnia and so much more. This time my fat body is a little bit high because I taked any medications, like Vallium and fluoxetyne, I used this medicatin about 2 years and my Doctor told me that my precocious diabetes happened so much because my medications that caused so much insulin resistance wich colaborated with my problem. First step was stop with both and low my fat body. This can help that my diabetes didnt evoluted to a Insulin dependents, but was very later, was not possible and this is my words.
