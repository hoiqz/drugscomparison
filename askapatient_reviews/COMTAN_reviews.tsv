1	parkinsons	tremors worsened, had mood changes and became very short tempered and nasty, noticed no real benefits	very, very expensive drug	M	89	120  days	2/19/2009
4	Parkinson's disease	Strong color and smell to my urine. Difficulty in swallowing such a large tablet. Upon occasion, staining inside mouth and on lips due to coating on outside of Comtan tablet. Sometimes my blouse would also become stained with that distinctive orange color of the Comtan coating.	When 4 Comtan were first added to my daily regime of 8 Sinemet and 8 Permax, its benefits were hardly noticeable. However, it did seem to help smooth out my highs and lows throughout the day. Now that I am no longer taking Permax and my daily Sinemet is down to 4 tablets, my 2 Comtan have become critical. Without that Comtan, I sleep most of the day and my tremors return. With it, I am alert at least part of each day, and my tremors remain minimal.	F	95	6  years	9/20/2006
1	Parkinson's	Combined with sinemet and rapidly became a part of an upward spiral for more l-dopa and greater tolerance and addiction to l-dopa. Did not slow the progressive need for more and more drugs with lessening benifits.	Combined with sinemet to extend on time. L-dopa tolerance, addiction, dosage increases, and loss of therapeutic response all raced forward without a noticable effect when comtam was added.	M	55	3  years	12/25/2004
