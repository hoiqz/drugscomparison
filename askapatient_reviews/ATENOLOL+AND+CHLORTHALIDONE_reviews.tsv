5	High Blood Pressure While TTC	Less energy than usual.	The doctor tried me on three medications before we found that Atenolol/Chlor brought my extremely (stroke-level) high blood pressure back to a normal level, while still being a safe medication for me to take while I am trying to conceive.  I've been on it for close to a year now with only slight energy loss and it's still working as designed.	F	25	9  months	7/29/2007
4	high blood pressure and heart palps	Tiredness, lowers heartrate	I am a runner so my heartrate is already in the 40's, I do experience tiredness but I mainly srated taking it due to an arrythmia and it has stopped it almost completely. I am now required to take Diovan 80mg.s due to BP not being low enough with only the atenolol.	M	63	2  years	12/11/2005Email
1	hypertension	Terrible fatigue, lack of interest in anything, slept all of the time, couldn't work out any more (too tired). Wife said I was a complete slug.  I already had a low heart rate in the 40s due to running, and this drove it to nothing.	Now on Diovan HCT. It has no side effects, works great, does not reduce my energy, and I run every day with no effect. Can say none of these things for beta blockers.  No way I could recommend them.
