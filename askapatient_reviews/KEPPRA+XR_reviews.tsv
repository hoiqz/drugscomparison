2	Partial onset seizures	When I started it, I felt really sluggish and tired for a few days, but other than that, I didn't notice anything.	I'm pretty sure I might be a statistical outlier, but it has not had any effect whatsoever.  My neurologist added Vimpat about a month ago, but I still have not noticed any change.  If it wasn't for the side effects of both medications, I could've been taking sugar pills and I wouldn't have been any the wiser.	F	18	7  months2500 1X D	1/31/2012
5	JME Juvenile Myoclonic Seizures	Switched from Depakote to Keppra XR and felt a total 180- like a person not sedated on drugs.  It was amazing!  Instantly too.  Since I am not sedated anymore I have had to deal with anxiety that was an underlying problem, but not side effect.  But, have had no issues or grand mal seizures since I started the RX, and it is more baby-friendly than Depakote.	I love Keppra XR.	F	31	2  years500 MG 2X D	7/24/2011Email
