1	Sinus and ear infection	Although infection cleared up, the augmentin caused horrible gi upset. I had diarrhea and then vomiting for 3 days. I wound up in the emergency room because of it. I am NEVER going to take this again. Doctor told me to discontinue use. So while the antibiotic killed the bad bacteria it also killed the good ones too. I had never been so sick. Awful experience		F	21	6  days	3/8/2013
5	Sinus infection	Mild headache, low back ache and diarrhea on day 9 of tx.  But it was def worth it. I had a horrid sinus inf x a couple months, and after 7 days, I was clear. I am extremely sensitive to things, but this med was fine. I'm eating 1-2 tubs of yogurt a day. This antibiotic seems to have a bad rap, but it really has worked great for me. There's always gonna be side effects, but it seems a lot of people have psycho-somatic reactions.		F	38	10  days875	3/6/2013Email
2	Bronchitis / strep throat	Diarrhea for days, loss of appetite, did I mention diarrhea and ontop of that my throat infection came back 3 days after finishing the course of antibiotics		F	22	10  days875	3/5/2013
1	sinus infection	The loose stools were tolerable. But VERY INTENSE VIVID NIGHTMARES AND HALLUCINATIONS WERE HORRIBLE!!!		F	28	4  days875	3/2/2013
1	Mastoiditis	Although I was also taking probiotics I experienced extreme watery diarrhea after the 6th dose.   Became dehydrated very quickly.  Will definitely not take this again, I don't think my colon/intestines could survive it a second time.		F	38	4  days	2/23/2013
1	Bronchitus	Vomiting, diarrhea, headache, yeast infection after 1st dose and the worst was I woke up on 3rd day in extreme pain in all my joints. Could not move anything!  Ended up in ER with morphine not even stopping the pain. Took 3 days of pain meds for me to walk again because of the pain. Will never allow anyone in my family to take this horrible medicine!		F	38	2  days	1/28/2013
1	sinus infection	loss of appetite nausea fever went up to 103 after taking this medicine.. severe stomach cramping. Do not take this medicine ask your doctor for something else this is the worst medicine I've ever taken in my life.		F	31	4  days875	1/26/2013

3	sinus infection	Very mild nausea, tinea pedis	It helped, but has not beaten my infection. I took a course of this medicine with an infected tooth 3 months ago. The infection has spread to an adjacent tooth = 2 root canals! No significant side effects except for a susceptibility to fungal infections.	M	60	6  days500 Mg 2X D	1/8/2013
1	Bronchitis	I throw up a few hours after every single dose. I have never taken it on an empty stomach and I always eat 2 yogurts before I take it. I feel like I constantly have the tummy flu. I even cut it in half to see if it would make the side effects subside, but it did not :-(		F	38	10  days874	1/3/2013Email
3	Strep	The first two days taking this made me very nauseous but I found eating a large meal when taking helped with the nausea. I also developed a yeast infection the second day, regardless of a probiotic and yogurt. I recommend picking up some Monistat when you fill this script! I have also experienced extreme lethargy with this med.	I am on day 7 of 10 and while it has helped my sore throat I now have chest congestion and am coughing up  green mucous and running a low grade fever....but I also had the flu along with strep so I may have lingering side effects from that.

1	Pneumonia	I was prescribed this medicine to take every 12 hours for a minor case of pneumonia. I was experiencing nausea, lack of appetite, and diarrhea before starting. However, I am on day 3 of taking this medicine and my symptoms have gotten worse. Today I've been running to the bathroom every 15 minutes with watery diarrhea and cannot not shake the nausea. I also just feel completely run down and out of it. I've made an appointment with my actual doctor tomorrow morning as opposed to an urgent care clinic doctor (they were the ones who prescribed me this horrible medication). Hopefully my doctor can get me straightened out.		F	27	10  days875MG/2x	12/18/2012

Two hours after first dose, on toilet with a bucket in hand throwing up violently and watery diarrhea.  I stayed there for an hour and 45 minutes.  Sweating profusely and pulse of 120, resting.  I realized it was dehydration and in getting up to rehydrate, bot legs cramped up leaving me unable to walk.  I had been severely sick off 875 mg but the superinfection I had required Augmentin, so we decided to risk it, at a lower dose.  I thought I'd be okay but NEVER again will I take this medicine.  I was seriously scared for my life.		F	37	10  days500 mg	11/28/2012Email

3	Acute Sinusitis	Nausea, Heartburn, Restlessness, Mild Diarrhea: -possible- Sciatic nerve flare-up* I've taken various antibiotics in the past several years for different reasons (ie, Amoxicillin, Z-pack, Penicillin, etc) & honestly, other than a few very minor stomach upsets, never really experienced major side effects.  Last November I was prescribed a strangely high dose of Augmentin (875mg x twice a day) for what I truly believed was a minor case of Sinusitis.  On the fourth day, I woke up with an absolutely excruciating case of Sciatica down my left leg.  The days preceding, I had a slight tense feeling in the same leg but thought nothing of it until all hell finally broke loose.  It took a full 5 weeks to somewhat recover from the miserable, debilitating pain.	*However, what needs to be mentioned is the fact that the month before, I had been in a minor car crash & since then, my back and legs never felt quite right.  While I'm 100% sure this was a pre-existing, dormant issue already, I tend to believe that the Augmentin may have contributed to the flare-up.  Fast forward to last week: I was put on Augmentin, 875mg yet -again- for a sinus infection despite my protests (the doctor assured this didn't cause the sciatic nerve pain the previous time).  However, shortly after taking the first two doses, my left leg felt like it was starting to ache more than usual.  I immediately stopped taking it twice a day and the pain lessened after 24 hours or so.  Additionally, I did suffer very minor side effects like nausea and diarrhea however taking a probiotic vitamin twice a day REALLY, REALLY helped to nearly entirely fix these issues.  I highly recommend taking probiotic supplements with antibiotics.Overall, Augmentin did appear to fix my sinus issues and do its job, but I would like to give a word of caution to those with pre-existing nerve/joint issues, ESPECIALLY Sciatica: while I -know- it didn't cause my sciatic nerve problem, I'm pretty convinced the very high dose may have caused the flare-up itself or at least contributed to it.

4	Cat bite	Extreme fatigue, foggy feeling, nausea and diarrhea. The fatigue is the most annoying side effect. I don't have the energy to do anything, however the augmentin is clearing up the infection.		F	29	7  days2X D	5/20/2012

Stomach felt better when it was full, so started eating snacks to keep something in my stomach to make it less uncomfortable. Worse in the morning (empty stomach)	F	45	10  days875 2X D	5/6/2012Email
1	Ear Infection (that I did not have)	Took first pill at 4pm, by 7pm the watery explosive bowl movements started, followed by vomiting around 1am, at 4am I took a second pill, after using the bathroom ~12 times before 9am I realized it was the antibiotic that was causing the problem.  Called doctor, eventually went back in.  A second doctor told me that I did not have an ear infection and that augmentin was notorious for severe side effects.  He didn't understand why the first doctor prescribed it to me.  I discontinued use after the second pill.  I last took a pill 24hrs ago, but I am writing you this from on the toliet. It is bad bad bad.  I really am upset at the prescribing doctor!  The side effects are not worth taking this medicine!!!!		M	31	1  days	5/5/2012
1	Strep throat	What a great way to lose 3lbs in one night!  If you don't mind puking up blood.....After one hour of taking this pill (after dinner) I had severe vomitting for three hours every fifteen minutes along with sweating and the shakes!  So bad that I almost choked on my vomit by aspirating it!   The next morning came the diarhea.  I thought I had food poisoning because the symptoms were the same.  I waited one day to let my stomach regroup so i could eat solids to take the antibiotic again. I ate breakfast today and took half of a pill this time and within an hour i had the same symptoms, but not as horrible as the first night.  I think since i had cut the pill in half it did not affect me as strong as the first time.  I now realize it was not food poisoning but the antibiotics.  I will never take this med again!!!! I have never experienced something like this before and I warn you...stay away and have your doc give you something else!  I'm still shitting my pants and I think I'm down 4lbs now...but not worth the suffering.  Especially when you have an infant baby to take care of!		F	35	2  days850 mg	4/27/2012Email
1	Strep	Nausea, terrible stomach cramps, diahrrea, loss of appetite, exhaustion.	I haven't been on antibiotics in years - I have no idea why my doctor prescribed augmentin instead of penicillin. I've stopped taking it because the augmentin made me just as sick as the strep. It's been 36 hours since I took my last pill and i'm still doubled over in agony. I will never, ever take this pill again.	F	25	10  days875 2X D	4/11/2012
5	upper respitory infection	Nothing to really complain about....just extremely tired!  But was told that was the infection, not the medication.  I've taken this medication several times & never had problems.   The people that have upset stomachs should try eating before taking this....that definately helps me!  Have had loss in my appetite, but not complaining about that :)		F	34	10  days2 X day	3/31/2012
1	probable infection in jaw	after 4th dose - extreme nausea and chest pain, dizzy, stomach pain, loose stools, itchy back, high blood pressure 148/100...Don't know if the pain and the tension from so much pain elevated b/p or the augmentin itself, but I've never had such high b/p ever.	Had throbbing pain in jaw along with cracked tooth. Oral surgeon extracted tooth but jaw pain didn't go away. Pain has been in jaw 1 month. Oral surgeon prescribed augmentin due to possible infection in bone. After 4th dose (all taken with a full meal), the symptoms started.Went to ER thought I was having a heart attack because I felt so bad. Had full battery of tests and heart is okay. Blood work was good. ER doc said blood work shows no sign of infection. She felt along jaw and had me open and close mouth and believes pain is from TMJ - my jaw is out of alignment. I can feel it after she showed me how, so went through a full day of misery and ER expenses to find out never needed the augmentin anyway.My advise - ask for an alternate antibiotic. The probable side effects aren't worth it.	F	48	4  times125 mg 2X D	3/18/2012Email
1	Sinus infection	I only took this for two days with meals. The third day I woke up in the middle of the night with severe stomach pains and diarrhea. I also had a fever of 104, almost passed out, and was vomiting. I stopped taking it and my doctor prescribed me something else. This was awful. I will never take Augmentin again.

3	sinus infection	Didn't notice it at first, but slowly realized it was the reason why my legs ached and I was SO exhausted when I stopped taking it after day 7 and the DR told me to continue taking it.  Immediately, I went back to feeling awful.  He told me I felt awful because of the sinus infection, but it turns out it was because of the antibiotic!		F	34	10  days875 2X D	3/13/2012Email
3	chronic ear infection	Ive taken the drug before to treat mastioditis. it treated the infection, side effects were minimal/not enough to recall about. Currently, I am on day one. Symptoms so far include: nausea, loose stools & intense HALLUCINATIONS! (only in sleep/waking up process)	i think its important to know your body and what works for you. personally the hallucinations dont bother me so much, and its the only antibiotic ive taken that has aggressively gotten rid of any infection quickly. powerful stuff, especially at the dose im taking.	F	23	10  days125 2X D	3/10/2012
1	sinus infection	After 2 doses felt anxiety and restlessness. On 2nd day stomach ached and had bad cramp in my calf. 3rd day off balance and headaches, that nite heart "flutters", same on 4th day. Quit taking & called my doc. Told me not to take any more, I was having allergic reactions to it. Was put on a "z-pac" for sinus immediately.		M	42	4  days875mg	3/2/2012
1	swollen parotid gland	Severe (the worst) tendon and joint pain I have ever had, started on day 2 and by day 5,  I discontinued the medication. The tendon on the front of my foot running up my leg about 6 inches was so severe, I could not flex it or walk without severe pain. The tendon was visibly swollen. I'm not sure how long this will last as today was the day I stopped the Med but as of tonight, it's still very painful and hurts tremendously to walk even woke me up! Noted joint pain and depression/anxiety as well as a persistant sore throat and now a yeast infection! I will never take this medication again!		F	43	7  days875mg 2X D	2/27/2012Email

5	Cat Bite	Dizziness, tired, some stomach upset but for an antibiotic of this strength it wasn't bad. I took it with food like the instructions suggest.	I feel I was extremely lucky not to have some of the horrible side effects mentioned about this drug!	F	61	14  days875 mg 2X D	1/27/2012Email
4	sinus infection	None	This drug is a miracle worker for most sinus infections. I get a sinus infection at least once a year, and this is what I am most often prescribed. Only once has it not kicked my infection. I will say, however, that the 875 dose is best taken with a probiotic. If you don't, you may experience stomach problems. However, I have never had a single issue with it.	F	26	10  days875MG 2X D	1/27/2012
1	Acute sinusitis	After the first dosage, had severe heartburn.  After the second dose, I had the most debilitating stomach pain and nausea I have ever experienced.  I only took two pills--12 hours apart--and took each pill with a full meal followed by two full glasses of water.  I called my pharmacist to ask what I could take to help with the stomach pain, as I had tried Gaviscon, Pepto, Mylanta and Tums to no avail.  The pharmacist said every single person she has known who has used this drug ended up with serious, SERIOUS stomach trouble.  THIS DRUG SHOULD BE BANNED!!!  Six days after taking only two pills, my stomach pain is worse, as is the nausea.  Someone needs to take the makers of this drug to task!!		F	49	1  days 2X D	1/23/2012

I haven't taken it in 24 hours and my stomache isn't as bad as it was.  I still have headaches and now have developed a stupid cough and a sinus headache from hell. I do not recommend this medication to my worst enemy. It should be pulled from the shelves and banned from ever being made.		M	41	4  days825. X2	11/28/2011Email

On the first day I had a reaction, I thought it was a fluke so I kept taking it. Turned out my body doesn't like this stuff. Seems like the majority of people with anxiety, stress, depression, have problems with this medicine. I remember why I dislike medicine, it never works and always makes me feel terrible. Note to self, try more natural remedies, they seem to have less/no side effects.	M	26	10  days875mg 2X D	9/23/2011Email
1	tooth implant	Given this toxic drug as a preventative measure so I would not get an infection after a tooth implant.   After 2 days I had horrible diareah, nausea.  Reported these side effects to dentist who said "take them anyway, and be sure to take all of them!".  Because I had no known infection this drug caused me (on day 10 of dosage) to go to the Emergency Room from dehydration, nausea, diareah.  I think it harmed my immune system.   Do not take this drug.	My dentist (Ehsan Rezvan, Gilroy, Calif) mis-prescribed this drug and ordered me to take a large dose, the strongest possible for 12 days, when I had no infection.  My health was in serious trouble until the ER got IV's into my collapsed veins.  The dentist has not taken responsibilty.  My research with the pharamecutical company shows that this drug is for "RESISTANT PNEUMONIA" and certainly NOT for for people WITHOUT infection and who have (or had) a healthy immune system.   Isn't this exactly how bacteria become "resistant" to these drugs?   The pharmaceutical company making Augmentin" should do much more reserach before allowing this drug to be fed to the public.

Produces white thick mucus in throat and lungs.	I have to take this long term for my lyme- if not- I would be dead.  I have constant sinus infections and pneumonia and I would not be able to function.  Lyme is a brain infection and this is the only drug powerful enough to kill the lyme spirogets.   I would not take this if it were not for my lyme.	F	54	1  days875 1X D	8/10/2011

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span.

We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011
1	manic depression , anxiety	every day had horrible trembles, would wake up from the pills every night , causing me to none stop throw up, not funn at all	DONT DO IT	M	18	7  days30 mg 1X D	1/19/2011
1	Bipolar disorder	No side effects while on the Abilify. But ever since I stopped(4 years ago) I still have dizziness upon standing up and seizures randomly throughout everyday. I cant afford a lawyer or I would sew. SERIOUS BRAIN DAMAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!	I wish i could sew them and make it to where these companies can not sell their poison to another child teen or adult. All they want is money they dont care what the pills do to you.	M	19	6  months10mg 2X D	1/12/2011
1	addition to an anti-depressant	Oh my god it was terrible. A day or two after starting it I got sooooo dizzy I couldn't even stand I just wanted to lay down and die. Worst feeling ever-it made me not able to think clearly, and keep my train of thought. I got off of it within 1-2 weeks	Spare yourself and don't try it	F	18	2  weeks 1X D	1/9/2011
2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.

5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
4	BIPOLAR 2	Severe Hiccups, lasted for 3 days.  Nausea, severe burping, felt like I was going to throw up, lasted for a week.  Slight mania, abbreviated sleep cycles, still having these.  I feel the side effects are worth it because of how well it keeps me from short cycling, which causes way more problems in my life than a little Nausea		M	36	8  weeks15 MG 1X D	6/2/2010

1	bipolar depression	Agitation, Heart Pounding Anxiety, Insomnia, Sweating, Headache, Shakiness	I took this drug one time, and it was a HORRIBLE experience. Abilify is not the right drug for me. I do NOT recommend Abilify.	M	41	1  days5 1X D	5/21/2010
5	As a complement for Major Depressio	Stiff Muscles and ridigity, upset stomach but those symptoms went away in aprox. 1.5 weeks.	A life saver for me. Eased my stubborn treatment resistant depression. I am starting to feel like my old self.	M	41	40  days15 1X D	5/17/2010Email
3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped. Abilify worked immediately and I haven't been depressed since.	F	24	3  weeks5mg 1X D	5/9/2010Email
4	psychotic symptoms	i was taking Geodon for some psychotic symptoms. have sleep problems (insomnia), switched to Abilify and i felt like i gained some of my energy back (still have sleep problems, though). i haven't had very many side effects with abilify and taking it seems to prevent the onset of my psychotic symptoms.	geodon seemed to help me lose all the weight i gained from zyprexa and helped me keep it off. my weight on abilify has fluctuated and i have not been able to return to my ideal baseline.

Normally b/c of other GI issues, my appetite is very suppressed but now I can't stop eating. However, the other side effects have decreased to almost nothing.	F	33	4  weeks5 mg 1X D	4/30/2010

4	GAD with Nausea	Appetite coming back.  Sex drive increased.  Anxieties seem to have diminished.  Feel a bit tired and flu like at times but not too bad.	Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal. I belive my GAD is finally diminishing - regular therpay is helping me too.  I have had my condition for 6 yrs and 6 months now.	M	45	2.5  weeks2 mg 1X D	4/19/2010
1	paranoid schizophrenia	hallucinations, night terrors, thought people were coming to kill me, locked myself in my studio, saw demons everywhere, racing thoughts, hearing things, couldn't sit still or sleep, the hour or two i was able to sleep was awful, i was going to kill myself but some how made it to the hospital and got some seroquel.

1	Bipolar spectrum disorder	Restlessness, anxiety, drowsiness, face rash	I went on Abilify at the start of an up period, so I don't know how effective it would have been in treating depressive spells. However, it did counteract some of the effectiveness of my lithium, and I was falling asleep during the day more frequently than usual. Had to go off it because of a rash on my chin/cheeks/ears.

5	for depression-w/ my antidepressant	lowering my libido. Craving more sugary, fatty foods and carbs.     I took this several yrs. ago and although the medication initially worked-I packed on more than 10 pounds. I got depressed due to weight gain, but after several months I feel medication ceased to be effective. This time  was very reluctant (2 yrs later & different Dr. & different anti-depressant medication-Prozack-2 yrs ago) but I am trying it w/ a different antidepressant than previously-Taking now w/ Wellbutrin.

4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue. Negative - I find myself much more emotional - memories, key phrases, smells, songs, pictures, etc.can bring me to tears.	M	50	9  months50 MG 1X D	4/11/2010
2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now. I have woken up from a 12 year-long medication-induced nightmare.	M	57	 15 MG 1X D	4/7/2010Email

2	depression	Nausea the first few days, some constipation, cloudy thinking, increased appetite	Combined with Wellbutrin XL which suddenly stopped working for me after 3 years. After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

Insomnia (but the Seroquel has completely cured that.)	Abilify has helped me like no other drug.  I am on it along with cymbalta, deplin, seroquel and ativan.

I feel kind of leveled out, but I hate the tiredness all the time.  I can sleep for 10 hours, take my son to school, come home and go back to sleep for another couple of hours.  Then still have little to no energy for the rest of the day.  I was previously, taking 60 mg. of Cymbalta for almost 2 years, but my dr. switched me to this when I started to feel like dying again.

3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!

2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010
1	depression, of all excuses	This is to the PARENTS out there who believe that if their child looks passive on the drug it is a godsend:  Beating someone over the head with a baseball bat can also make them sit still.  Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.	F	31	1  years	1/14/2010
5	anxiety and depression	increased hunger and increased energy	This is a wonder drug for me. I thought I was going do die due to severe depression and anxiety. I am taking cymalta but after about a year, it didn't work. My MD RX'd 5mg of abilify along with my cymbalta every day. In my opinion, it saved my life. I feel like I have a reason to live and starting to enjoy the things I used to, just after one week of starting the med.	F	42	7  days	1/13/2010
4	Bipolar and anxiety	restlessness increased appetite inability to concentrate. Not sure if there are periods of anxiety or nervousness. No Mania	Works for mania. My pdoc says there is activation at low doses. My son started on 10 mg and takes 15 mgs. He also takes 900 mg of lithium and 10 mgs of Lexapro.	M	10	6  months	12/29/2009Email
3	Depression	Weight gain and constant appetite, anxiety, inability to concentrate	Worked well for the depression, but the constant appetite and associated weight gain, along with anxiety at higher doses, was not worth it overall	F	39	2.5  months	12/22/2009
5	Major Depression, PTSD	Insomnia, but only compared to previous behavior of sleeping 10-12 hours per day.	It really works!	M	64	1  months	12/21/2009Email
1	anxiety and mood swings	increased heart rate that made my daughter pass out only after the 2nd day.	after first night of taking my daughter missed school the next day feeling nauseated and stomach cramps. That night she experienced indigestion/heartburn. She vomited. Sleepy but couldn't sleep. Feeling scared for no reason. Next day she passed out after being awake for 15 min. I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug. I got home and looked up the side effects and all of these were listed.  I can only say that we are glad we found out so quickly about this drug.	F	12	2  days	12/19/2009
2	OCD, racing thoughts.	drowsiness, leg pains, akathisia...	it is a great drug to calm down mind... seems to be on a "holy peace"... but side effects are too strong, just for me.	M	23	14  days	12/18/2009
3	bipolar	stopped after 14 months due to heart pulpitations, memory loss, trouble sleeping, slur speach due to excess syliva, after 12 months these things started. At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying. I am very uncomfortable giving a child this age any drug that is diagnosised by trial and error.	M	8	14  months	12/17/2009
2	unipolar depression	nasal stuffiness, dyslexia, word finding problems, increased appetitite, change (worsening) of vision, weight gain and wanting to graze constantly, watering eyes, feel like gravity is heavier (I have to sit down to brush my teeth), very restless around people, visual hallucinations (things disappear then reappear right where I saw them last), trouble focusisng while driving  --- weird.	I am taking 50 mg of lamictal concurrently with 7.5 mg abilify.  Affect is flatter, less mood swings, but more non-reactive than anything.  I'm not sure this is where I want to be. I have been able to get projects done that I had difficulty starting.  Some days I have energy, some days I don't.  I a fasting blood draw yesterday and haven't heard the results yet.  Continuing to take abilify is a quandary -- do I feel worse or better if I factor in all the weird side effects?  I will probably cut down on the dose since I really will be suicidal if I gain any more weight.	F	51	30  days	12/17/2009
3	Bipolar	Some weight gain, some restlessness	My 14 yr old son has been on 2.5 mg of Abilify for 3 months now.  He has gained 8lbs. so we are going to be watching this closely.  It has helped him be able to concentrate, and definitely better in school, and social groups.  Smoothed out the ups and downs.  Previously was on trileptal and zoloft.	M	14	90  days	12/14/2009Email
1	Post-opiate addiction depression	Cannot sit still, terrible anxiety after about 2 weeks, weight gain	This drug should be taken off the market.  After about the 3rd day you will not be able to sit still, ever.  It feels like there is something inside of you trying to get out.  After about 2 weeks I started having severe anxiety attacks almost constantly and came very close to having to be committed/hospitalized.  Smack your doctor if he recommends this.	M	26	 	12/13/2009
5	Depression, bi polar, etc.	NONE, ...perhaps a little sleepy. I only take 5 mg per day.	I know I am lucky for this but I really haven't noticed any side effects. Abilify has been great in that for me it creates a kind of peace of mind by eliminating the aberrant thoughts and whatnot.  I stop talking to myself so much, it helps me get out of my head so to speak...   Based on my positive experience I would tell others to start with no more than 5 mg for the first month...  	M	42	3  years	12/3/2009

3	bipolar	insatiable appetite. Gained 7 pounds in 4 weeks.	Worked well on stabilizing my mood. But already being overweight, my Doc said the rapid weight gain was unacceptable and switched me to lamictal. Geodon had been working well for me, but the side effect of clenching my left side...mainly leg and toes, leaving my toes red and swollen, led me to stop taking it. Depakote made me a zombie.

4	autism spectrum disorder/ bipolar	Weight gain - up to 30lb	My daughter has had tremendous improvement in energy, concentration, and mood. Before taking Abilify she was on Geodon and had terrible akathisia. It also interfered with her ability to learn, and she had to withdraw from college courses to avoid failing. (She wound up finishing college with a B average, so you can see she's normally able to learn. ) Once she got off the Geodon, the irritability and stupidness went away but she became suicidal and self-injured. Since starting the Abilify she hasn't tried suicide even once. (Before that it was 14 times in six years.) I am grateful to the Abilify, but I wish she wasn't so hungry all the time.

4	recurrent major depression	Within the first 4 days I had experienced a great sense of relief of the depression. I had a burst of energy that is still there, my old self. I did experience about 3 days of severe headaches , migraines , but I weathered the storm and  the headaches went away. I take Cymbalta 60.mg and now 2 mg  abilify.I would stick with it since it works within 2 weeks.I sleep better, and  am more focused. I do eat more but I think it's the winter and I needed to feel better from the headaches. Diet tomorrow!		F	49	6  days	11/23/2009
5	Autism/ADHD/Bipolar	Muscle pain and sleepiness	My son started taking 10 MG about a year ago.  He has made drastic improvements in his schoolwork and social skills.  He is now making friends and getting good grades.  Besides the leg pain and sleepiness at night it has been great.	M	9	1.5  years	11/19/2009Email
1	bi polar	Weight gain within weeks. I felt bad enough w/o the extra pound a week.Went From 110 114 IN 3 Weeks. Very restless as well. I stopped taking my 10 abilify and continue with ambien and clonazepam	made me feel worse. I would rather deal on my own	F	39	1  months	11/15/2009
1	depression & anxiety	I took this and right away I had more energy. Even joined a Gym for the first time in my life. But than within a week my blood sugar sky rocket, I mean I was in the hospital with sugar over 600, my meter couldn't even read it, and the hospital had trouble bringing it down with fast acting insulin. Then my legs started shaking couldn't keep still. I had to go off it cold turkey because of my dangerously high sugar. It might work for some people but be careful of the side affects.		M	26	1  months	11/9/2009
4	major depression and anxiety	the first night i felt like i was coming down from meth. i adjusted the times i took my meds, because i take asprin, reglan, nexium, and effexor 75's.  i took the asprin, nexium, and reglan with dinner, and the effexor and abilify, plus a half of a klonopin at bedtime, and i sleep through the stomach upset.	the second day i felt much better.  i was able to clean a room, take care of bills, and just never thought of negative things more than twice.  this is my third day, and i was able to joke around with my husband at the store, and though i still haven't showered, i may do that tonight, after i clean the bathroom.  i have great hopes for this med, and hopefully, i won't have to take it very long.	F	47	3  days	11/8/2009Email
5	Bipolar depression	Some weight gain and insomnia.	This drug saved me from the darkest, deepest depression I have ever had to endure.  For over two years, I lost my will to see people, clean house, get dressed, etc.  After just three days on Abilify, I was able to get up, shower, go visit friends in New England (I live in South Florida), clean up my messy house and talk on the phone again.  I have gained a great deal of weight over the years from all different types of medication.  I accept the fact that medication makes me heavy and I am grateful to be heavier and sane than thin and crazy.	F	54	30  days	11/2/2009
5	Depression/Anxiety	Occasional headache.  Woke up in the middle of the night a few times but that got better.  Still sleeping well.	Doctor added 2 mg Abilify to my 10 mg Lexapro because I was still having suicidal thoughts despite the Lexapro.  Its worked great so far and has been a real boost in energy and mood.	M	17	5  weeks	11/2/2009
4	anxiety, paranoia and major depress	restlessness at 20 mg, eye tic at l5 mg, now down to 2 mg daily.  No weight gain at all on any of the doses.	Because of side effects including diabetes risk tried to go cold turkey at l0 mg.  Okay for about 2 weeks then experienced major nervousness, disorientation, jaw clenching, etc.  Now taking 2 mg. daily and feeling much better.  Still worried about side effects.  Not taking any other drug along with it.  Still experiencing anxiety but it is manageable.  You must wean yourself off this drug and not try to quit at once.	F	62	3  months	11/2/2009
3	ADHD	uncontrollable muscle movements, especially when in the car.	My son has been on Abilify (1 mg) for over a year.  We started on .5 mg because of his weight.  I did not want to medicate my child but I had no choice.  He was diagnosed at 2 with ADHD, but I didn't believe the psychologists because it's hard to diagnose something like that at age 2.  He is also ODD.  Last summer he was almost kicked out of daycare because of impulsivity, aggression, and inablility to sit still.  The Abilify worked for him then and continues to work.  I would love, however, if he didn't need it but now he's in kindergarten and has to take it to get through the day.  I was also able to get him a 504 plan with the school since I got another diagnosis at age 4 which was ADHD.	M	5	1.5  years	11/2/2009Email
2	add on for depression	none except rapid and major weight gain	I was very hopeful at first. I felt improvement after the 3rd day when this was added to my Wellbutrin. But in 5 months time, I gained 40 lbs on a petite, 100 lb frame!! I'm really struggling to lose it, and am currently discontinuing because of it. People that I bump into at stores and such ask when I'm due!!Really too bad, I had no other side effects. but now I'm left with this big mess with my weight to clean up.	F	34	5  months	10/29/2009
1	GAD/Depression	weight gain, extreme fatigue, depression worse	I was taking 2 mg of Abilify last Spring after Paxil didn't seem to be working as much any more. I felt ok then I felt bad again. Dr put me on 5 mg of Abilify. I feel terrible!  Extremely tired- so much so that I can barely move. I am going to ween my self off immediately.	F	47	6  months	10/28/2009
3	Mood stabilizer along with Zoloft	I took 1 mg daily and it helped but caused too many side effects. I'm very med-sensitive. I've stopped Zoloft at this point.	I was on Zoloft and Abilify but stopped both due to weight gain. After a lot of research I'm adding Abilify back at 1 mg every three days. I'm very med-sensitive and tend to respond at lower doses than other people do. Will be back to post how this goes. Something has to help. I'm a wack-job right now. Can't control my thoughts and I dwell on bad stuff too much. Can't get sad events out of my mind etc. I have to give Abilify another chance at a reduced dose.	F	62	 	10/27/2009
4	Oneiric states	jittery at low doses, sleepy at high	It has helped me stop feeling like I'm in a dream all the time                                   but my mood is only a little better so far	F	59	3  weeks	10/25/2009
2	Depression	Insomnia, chest pain, blurry vision	Only on 0.5 mg. for three days.  Horrible insomnia no matter what time of day I take med.  Makes me drowsy during the day, hard to tell if my mood is improving due to the side effects.	F	35	3  days	10/24/2009
5	major depressive episode	Energy and hope restored.  Insomnia, head ache, speedy, shaky,visual disturbance,constipation.	Hopefully the side effects subside as my body gets used to the med.  I'm not willing to stop taking the med as I feel so much better with just 2mg of Abilify as an adjunct to Lexapro.  I have hope again.  I got my butt out of bed by day 3 (went shopping) then cleaned the house on day 5.  What a change from the depths of deep epression to my old self in less than a week...WOW!	F	46	10  days	10/23/2009
3	bipolar II	agitation, shakiness, acne, loss of libido, weight gain, inability to urinate	This med helped stabilize my mood a bit, but I could not get the full benefit because I could not increase the dose.  Every time I would go up on the dose, I would be hit by an avalanche of side-effects.  Had to get off eventually.	F	26	5  months	10/23/2009
3	To help my mood	Strange itching in my nose. I made myself bleed by trying to scratch it but couldn't help myself. It tasted good so I'm okay with it.	I've had depression of one kind or another most of my life.  I wanted to feel normal.  But, I ran out of samples after a week.  It wasn't long enough to find out if it would help.	M	56	7  days	10/22/2009
3	Mood Disorder	My son is 9 years old. He started in June on a mood stabilizer.  Abilify 5 mg, worked on mood, however he has gained 25 pounds. He can not stop eating.  He even sneaks food!! I don't know what the doctor is thinking.  We are taking him off.		M	9	4  months	10/19/2009
5	Bipolar Disorder	Very hungry, but able to manage it. Some difficulty sleeping, usually for an hour in the middle of the night. Spending money a little more than usual. Initially had a few days of headaches, not major.	This drug immediately snapped me out of low-grade depression that was steadily worsening. I started taking 2 mg of Abilify each morning and all of my depression symptoms lifted. I only realized how bad my concentration had been because it was so improved on this drug. Like others have said, I lost my hyper-sensitivity to people and situations and replaced that with a high tolerance for life's challenges -- big & small. The side-effects are very minimal at this point, but I'll be paying attention to see if this continues. Lastly, the fact that it works so quickly is a powerful asset if it works for you.

1	depression/schizoaffective	can't stop pacing, feel like someone is inside me trying to get out of my skin, insomniac, no sex drive, having to put car into park at stoplights to keep from ramming into someone in front of me; insane.	i stopped taking this today and hope to G-d it doesn't last long in my bloodstream.

2	possible bipolar	feel like a crack addict, hard to even sit here and type, hitting wrong keys, clenching jaw, restless beyond belief	on 10 mg...gained about 5-7 pounds, doc swears I need it, am bipolar but w out mania, just very low lows.......need to get off this but afraid of geodon...feel like a speed freak.  sleep is my only relief.............

1	Mood stabalizer	makes me gain weight, tired, not sure if it is what causes memory loss, fatigue, moodiness, irratability.		F	35	2  years	10/7/2009
5	Anxiety, depression, mild mania.	Jitters, sleepiness, stomach distress.	This drug is very strong and very good.  I am taking 2 mg in conjunction with 7.5 mg of Lexapro.  It has reduced my severe PMS and helped me with my previous need to sleep 11 hours a day.  Note that I am on one tenth of the recomended starting dosage for someone who is bi-polar; I can only imagine the side effects, however for my purpose it has been a god send.	F	29	1  months	10/3/2009
1	Bi-polar	pacing, high blood sugar, foamy urine, severe thirst, fatigue, pancreatitis, kidney damage	Please stop taking the Abilify immediately.  My husband was prescribed Abilify and it almost killed him. He was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis for 10 days and then on home care hooked up to ivs for another 2 weeks. He is now diabetic and needs to take insulin shots 4 times a day. He is on a very strict low-fat no-sugar diet and may never have even a sip of alcohol ever again. His pancreas is permanently damaged. We are very lucky he is alive. Abilify is evil. Please do not take it. It will kill you.	M	30	 	9/30/2009Email
5	depression, OCD	more alert, motivated, racing thoughts greatly diminished, some nausea, no weight gain!	I was leery about taking this, others make it sound like a nightmare drug. I have no doubt that it affects some people badly, but for me, it made a huge difference. I do wonder if this will wear off after a few months, but so far 5 mg have allowed me to think clearly, get off the couch and accomplish things. No weight gain but dr has me on Metformin to regulate blood sugar and cravings, so that might be the trick there. Important for everyone to monitor their own reactions carefully, or ask family members to help, because every drug works differently for every person. YOU know best what helps YOU.

3	depression/ bipolar	flattening/apathy, word-finding problems, short-term memory loss, trouble concentrating, not able to articulate thoughts and feelings, muscle weakness. To be fair, it made me manic for the first month I took it, which was wonderful, and I say I'm not depressed now, but is apathy really that different from depression?	When trying to stop taking 5mg, severe akathasia that literally kept me from sleeping at all. I'm tapering, now on 2.5mg, but still fearful that I will have the same symptoms when I discontinue again. Feeling a little trapped.	M	35	7  months	9/17/2009
3	Childhood Bipolar, ODD	WEIGHT GAIN, MUSCLE PAIN/STIFFNESS	My son has shown improvement in mood, decreased mood swings, more even temperament, however, he constantly complains about pain in his feet and legs. He describes as burning, stinging pain, mostly in his feet. We have observed more nasal stuffiness. He appears short of breath, at times, however, we are linking this to his weight gain (approx 12 lbs) and history of asthma. We are still observing and waiting to gauge any affect in cognitive abilities (school grades). Time will tell if the side effects are actually worth taking the medication.	M	11	3  months	9/16/2009
1	Bipolar 2-PTSD	Eating abnormal amounts - lethargy - no libido - no personality - sweating	This shit, and yes I say this profanely because that's what it is. It made me more depressed than ever. Yes the headaches and voices went away. But it made me socially anxious , paranoid , ripped me of my self esteem and made me gain weight because all I did and wanted to do was eat. I am an athlete, model, and full time mom. I kissed my life goodbye when taking this shit. Desparate, I stopped taking it. Which made life even more worse. I wanted to kill myself so badly because I wanted the pain to go away. It's all in my head. Mind over matter. I'll be the moodswingin crazy gal I am than risk my life. Also causes muscle weakness. Lucky to be able to carry anything up a damn flight of stairs. All in all, just stay away!!! Spent the whole summer in bed sleeeeping getting fat and suicidal. Whack!!!	F	25	2  months	9/14/2009
1	GAD/BPII/PTSD/OCD	Severe depression/out of touch	I was on Abilify for three weeks.  I started with the 10 mg for two weeks and up to 25 the third week.  On the 10 mg I started feeling "funny" and experiencing some side effects.  By the third week I was self mutlilating (something I have not done in 15 yrs.  I was so depressed I could not function at any level, very irritable and people just were too much to deal with.  All I wanted to do was sleep and just disappear.  My Therapist said it was like I did a 180 in two weeks and was so concerned she called my Psych.  After seeing my Psych, she immediately took me off it and put me on Geodon...not sure if that is a possitive change or not.	F	37	3  weeks	9/14/2009
3	Bi Polar 2	Akathesia, insomnia, anxiety, weight gain, head aches	The Akathesia was awful.  I would lie in bed thinking I was weak or flu-ish, but once in bed I could not get comfortable.  My workouts decreased as I felt weak, dizzy, short of breath, lost balance while stretching. My face would sweat way more than normal.  I could tell I was starting to gain weight and would pack on the pounds rapidly if I did not stop taking this. Since exercise is therpeutic for me, the abilify took that away from me.  BUT it did help control my mood swings (by making me feel like an emotionless zombie) and the need to act out my irritability. However, inside I felt increasing anxiety and irritability.  The side effects just aren't worth it.	F	30	2  months	9/8/2009
3	Depression/Anxiety	I have gained 20 pounds and am not eating any more than normal.  The medicine definitely lifted my depression, but the weight gain now has me looking like a pig.  And, it seemed to increase my libido.	Started off with 5 mg; now am down to 2.5... but, because of the weight gain, I am asking to get off of this medication.	F	40	4  months	9/5/2009
1	anxiety	Akithesia	Do not take this med. I had severe akithesia whereby I had a constant feeling of having to 'move' It was exhausting and I thought it would never leave which made me feel even more panicked. It was the most scared I'd ever felt on a medicine. Before this I truly never paid attention to side effects on labels, now I do.	F	38	 	8/29/2009
4	Bi-Polar	Akathisia, increased libido, insomnia	Loved it the first week until the Akathisia kicked in.  Then I wanted to jump out the car while it was moving... Halfed my dosage, no help.  Halfed the dosage again, no help.  Now I am on 1/8 of the pill.  Akathisia is gone, but increased libido went away.  Still have insomnia taken care of by Ambien.	F	46	1  years	8/28/2009Email
5	for incentive, to mk decisions	none except lots of hope, energy, lack of fear,loss of procrastination, able to make decisions, ability to focus just an all around zest for life with unlimited happiness	If your anti depressant or anti anxiety meds work but you still have no energy, ask your Dr to add Abilify. I had never heard of it but now instead of thinking of everything I need and want to do I am optimistic and bubbling with enthusiasm and energy. Now instead of reading all day long I am cleaning and doing hobbies, kyaking, running, dancing and marching with my grandchildren Whats next a sea plane ride and travel. Was just weeks ago I was close to Agoraphobia. If your meds only get you to the bottom of the mountain looking up and wishing you would, try Abilify, you will climb that mountain, maybe even run up it and then dance on the top!!!	F	62	3  weeks	8/23/2009
2	bi polar 2	weight gain, sugar cravings, excessive sleepiness, inability to exercise (no stamina, gasping for breath)	It helped with irritability (because nothing seemed to matter) but left me unable to live normally and my friends all asked if something was wrong because I was so quiet and getting more quiet with each passing day.  Because the side effects were so crippling, I have stopped taking Abilify and switched to Geodon.	F	60	4  months	8/18/2009
1	Bipolar I	Akathisia, loss of interest in life, Always sleepy, high anxiety, catatonia	Got really bad Akathisia after only 3 days on 10mg. Was taken during a bad manic/pschotic state so was forced to stay on it. Initially was bumped to 20mg which made me catatonic. Back to 10mg kept hallucinating. Added Cogentin, made Akathisia go away but severe anxiety came in it's palce along with lack of motivation and no interest in anything. Severe confusion followed. This sucked my will to live. The Akathisia was so severe I was suicidal.	M	32	7  months	8/17/2009
3	depression; withdrawal aid	VERY rapid weight gain (10 lbs in a month!), constipation, swollen legs and feet, back pain	GOOD NEWS: This drug helped me in the horrible phase of discontinuing Cymbalta.  I was no longer moody and nasty-tempered.  BAD NEWS: the fact that my face is so puffy I now look like a fatter, older version of myself and I now have GOBS of fat in places I never gained weight before (back of arms, waist) proves this stuff is POISON.  It may inhibit thyroid function, because I am not eating more than I usually do (in fact my appetite is less than normal--wierd!) yet I am piling on weight. The constipation, nausea and fatigue aren't fun either.  And I look like CRAP: bloated, haggard, pale, and unhealthy. Phasing off this med asap!	F	31	2  months	8/14/2009Email
5	depression	I have experience swelling of the calves. This may not be related to the Abilify, as I have had a kidney transplant.	My family has a history of serious depression to the point of being institutionalize. For many years now my brother and I have tried one drug after another. Nothing helped us 'open the curtains'. Two mg of Abilify each morning, after just a couple of days, has given us our lives back. This is a miracle drug for both my brother and my self. I must include, we have only been on this medicine for two or three weeks.	M	60	18  days	8/8/2009Email
5	wellbutrin	somewhat more tired, some difficulty urinating..	A Great help.. relieved pain in my shoulders and elbows.. and has rid me of most of my suicidal or weird thoughts and voices.	M	57	25  days	8/5/2009
4	bi-polar 1 disorder	nausea, vomiting, insomnia	I am 5mg, for just about a week, first 2 days I was very hostile, last 4 days restless with insomnia and cant eat much.However I have energy, I get things done, I am back to being social which I was not for over a year and half. No fears of public and can focus to read, play games etc.  My patience level is much better.  Just would like to know when the insomnia and nausea will pass.	M	41	1  weeks	8/5/2009Email
2	Possbile Bipolar 2	Extreme sweating, extreme nausea, weird chest movement, insomnia	Been on Celexa for 10 years now, up and down in dose as lifes stresses went up and down... 40mg now for past 2 years. Doctor added abilify for possible Bipolar 2. I took at 7pm and within 2 hours I was sweating profusely and kept doing so for the next 24 hours, then it started to go away. I wasn't hot, I even cranked up the air conditioner, didn't help at all. I soaked my clothes and sheets. This caused some dehydration which didn't help the nausea. That was also extreme. I never actually vomited but still laid on the bathroom floor just in case. The first few bouts of it I could barely move. I was flushed and weak and trembling it was so bad.I also couldn't sleep, which I'd already been fighting insomnia the past few months. But this made it worse as I couldn't sleep more then 10-30 mins at a time. The constant sweating didn't help when trying to sleep.I'm not saying don't take this med. I dealt with bad nausea for weeks when I first started it, and also when I went without for over a week. Just wanted to share what happened to me	F	32	1  days	8/2/2009
5	major depression/Bipolar	None really..Some initial insomnia but got better with time. Sexual sides are minimal and never a problem	A great medicine.It worked the 1st day I took it (5 mg)..I felt so much better..NOTHING has worked for me except Abilify and Parnate. People love to rant and rave when something is not working for them. Fine. But please don't tell other people to stay away from the drug because it doesn't work for you. If your having a hard time finding something that works, try this med. It works quickly so you'll know if it's for you without having to wait 2-4 weeks.	M	49	60  days	7/31/2009
1	Bipolar Disorder	Weight Gain	I was taking this medicine for about half a year and was recommended to not go off of it. In this six month period I gained 67 pounds. It also made it very hard to lose the weight afterward. Here I am almost two years later, and I am five pounds away from getting rid of the 67 I initially gained. Although the weight is gone, the stretch marks remain and still will. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE.	F	22	6  months	7/27/2009
5	schizo personality disorder	I LOVE ABILIFY!!  It is my favorite antipsychotic.  Side effects range from mild tiredness and hunger spells to insomnia at bed time.  But that helps with Ambien CR which my doc loves to prescribe like candy to me!  Abilify helps tremendously with voices and does not give me the akathisia movement disorder like the "dones" risperidone and ziprasidone antipsychotic do 100% of the time.	This medicine is a mild antipsychotic when it comes to side effects when compared to other antipsychotics.  I would recommend ABILIFY (aripiprazole) over the other atypical antipsychotics any day.	M	29	6  years	7/23/2009

1	major life long depression	I had a STROKE after 9 days on this awful medicine. I've been on wellbutrin for years and started to feel a deeper depression than normal. My psychiatrist put me on Abilify as a boost. Within 3 days I became very confused and very tired. It was the weekend, on Monday I called the doctor. He said it was the side effects and would clear up, that I had only been on it 6 days. On Thursday, I called and told him that I was stopping it. In addition to the confusion, I was having a hard time talking. He said the side effects would probably be gone by my appointment. They got worse! I couldn't remember how to use my utensils, my toothbrush etc. I couldn't spell or write, was mixing up the phone number even if I was looking at it. Monday, he still felt that it was side effects but at my insistence he sent me right to a neurologist, who ran me through a number of tests. He agreed that it was side effects. If I wasn't better in 3 weeks, he'd do a CAT scan. After 1 week insisted on the scan and lo	I was 62 years old and do not have dementia. My doctor did not consider me elderly. At what age does the drug company consider elderly? My doctor said that this shouldn't have happened. I am better but not back to the way I was before Abilify and the stroke. After 13 months I don't feel that I am getting any better and I honestly feel the problems I am still having are permanent. But it could have been worse, I wasn't paralyzed! Even with the computer, this write up has taken me 2 1/2 hours to compose.	F	63	9  days	7/15/2009Email
2	Some psychotic disorder	Akathisia. Insomnia.	Tried Abilify for a while and was hoping the initial akathisia and insomnia would go away, but after a month there was no change, so I gave it up.	M	34	1  months	7/14/2009
1	depression	I had bad nausea and vomiting. Very bad acne. Super drowsy.	It didn't even help with my condition. I have been trying it out for about 4-5 weeks and the side effects are horrible. I was still the same person I was before takin Abilify if not worse.	F	21	5  weeks	7/10/2009
2	Depression	Nausea, vomiting, anxiety, restlessness	Only took 2.5mg and had horrible first day so I decided not to continue taking it.	F	33	1  days	7/9/2009
1	Bipolar	Explosive headaches, sexual dysfunction, blurry vision, muscle stiffness, indigestion, nausea, loss of concentration and memory impairment	I am a heart patient and have also experienced sky high BP. I have no idea why this drug would even have been prescribed to me. I agree it is a poison.	M	51	1  months	7/5/2009
4	Pediatric BP rapid cycling	tired, sleepy,	9 yr old boy, started on 10 mg then increased to 15 mg. Takes 900mg lithium and 15 mg Abilify. Takes all at night due to sleepiness. Is a bit far away during the day on the 15 mg. Hardly any mania or outbursts. No complaints of inner restlessness. No weight gain. Appetite is normal.	M	9	1  months	7/3/2009Email
1	Bipolar	Miserable, horrible drug: extreme fatigue, bloated face, mental sluggishness and confusion.	NO theraputic effects whatsoever for me. Useless. I took it for about 6 months in 2003 and was taken off it by my psych. at my sister's urging. She came to see me at Christmas and was shocked at what she found. I was not even aware of how bad it was until I was taken off it.	F	41	6  months	7/3/2009
1	BiPolar II	Severe headache, tooth pain, muscle aches, depression, lethargy, trouble sleeping, jaw pain.	Called doctor and she said I had an allergic reaction to Abilify and to discontinue use immediately.  If you have any of the symptoms listed above, contact your doctor ASAP.	F	35	1  days	7/1/2009
5	Schizoaffective Disorder	I initially experienced Akathesia, Nystagmus and sleepiness. Then my dosage was recently upped from 20 mgs to 25 mgs due to break through depression, after that I did feel some nausea. Other than those few side effects I've felt fine on Abilify. I would recommend Abilify to others who are being carefully monitored by their Psychiatrist. I just happen to have an excellent Dr., which does make a difference.	I take Abilify along with Divalproex Sodium ER 1250 mgs for migraines, Clonazepam, Cogentin 1 mg for Akathesia, 2 grs of Armour Thyroid for Hypothyroidism.	F	47	5  years	6/28/2009
1	deppresion and anxiaty	facial tics, my daughter eyes are moving without control. Her tongue is heavy like if she is drunk, she gained 30 pounds. This medication is a poison I will not give it to my daughter anymore.		F	16	2  years	6/23/2009Email
3	anxiety/pmdd/depression	I have tried all the SSRI's and am currently taking Cymbalta 60 mg daily.  I was told that abilify helps so many people in my situation but so far the side effects have been miserable.  Yes, I am more mellow and not as irritable, but I have a constant headache/eye pain (like a migraine), I cannot sleep and I'm nauseous.  I'm reading all these other comments and I'm terrified of gaining weight, so I think I'm going to stop.		F	39	3  days	6/21/2009
1	misdiagnosed	SEVERE AKETHISIA- I had to walk out of the class room daily and skip class because I COULD NOT SIT STILL TO SAVE MY LIFE i felt like something was inside me trying to come out...my mind could NOT control my body, SEVERE WEIGHT GAIN ..and I used to always be thin) made me OBSESSED with food...I would do anything to get to food and i would eat and eat and eat uncontrolably. Never have I been suicidal, but I wanted to die just to get rid of the akethisia it was LIVING HELL. I have permanent side effects... i'm way slower in the head...memory loss...stuttering... I would lie down and not be able to get out of bed I was SO tired at times.	POISON! google AKETHISIA and read the hell it could bring you and your loved ones.DO NOT TAKE ANTI-PSYCHOTICS ... they WILL make you CRAZY so they can keep giving you more pills when you complain about the side effects they will more than likely tell you it's symptoms of something else and just put you on more medication that will permanently damage your brain and life. I can't believe they give this to people knowing what harm it can do.	F	19	6  weeks	6/18/2009
2	Major Depression	weight gain, fatigue/tiredness/drowsiness, loss of concentation	I have ADD and even though I am on Adderall the abilify counteracted it and I had a lot of trouble focusing in school. I am tired all the time getting 12 hours of sleep a night and still taking a 3-4 hour nap in the afternoon. It did help with my depression but recently I have been having suicidal thoughts. I also gained 15 pounds in just a few weeks.	F	20	2  months	6/15/2009

1	Dad (82)was taking it for dementia	This drug killed him! He threw up all night and next day,was unable to swallow,his dementia got much worse, and over a month long period he lost 40 pounds! The stupid doctor said he was psychotic but we found out later dementia can have a paranoid component. Dad was never bipolar! He went downhill and quit eating, etc., and finally died--night and day difference for the worse after the pill. We found out later this drug should not be used for people with dementia. Parade magazine has been ads sayi\ng don't use in the elderly and esp. those with dementia! Don't take this if you're older or have dementia.		M	82	1  days	7/21/2008Email
1	BiPolar - Mixed	Debilitating -- Exhaustion -- Fatigue -- NOT able to get out of bed.	This is the WORST drug I've ever been on -- and I've been on a lot.	F	58	1  weeks	7/21/2008
1	Depression	Just after thirty minutes of taking the drug (I took it in the morning), I literally fainted on my living room floor, and slept for six hours before waking up again. It made me feel like a zombie, dizzy, and it certainly didn't help me at all. The next day I took it, I saw spots all over, and I felt as if I was going blind. It scared me so much.	Never will I take this drug again.	F	15	2  days	7/18/2008
2	Depression	Restlessness, leg aches, foot pain, inability to "get comfortable," unable to concentrate on one task long enough to finish it, always hungry, skin breakouts, confusion (driving has become scary), light bothers my eyes, and my vision is blurry -- like there's a layer of gel on my eyes that I can't get off.  I keep moving things closer and closer to me so that I can see them.	I took 2 mg for two weeks and 5 mg for 1 week. I'm also taking Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, and Topamax -- all because I'm so depressed that I see no point in any aspect of living. Add in the Abilify side effects, especially the muscle pain, confusion, and vision problems, and I'd rather not live than continue taking that drug. Think I'll inquire w/ my doctor about Cytomel or Ritalin to augment the antidepressants.	F	37	3  weeks	7/15/2008

5	Bipolar II	Acne, occasional fatigue and leg cramps in the first couple of weeks, has since gone away - still have occasional pimples.	Love this medicine. It's the only Bipolar med that has helped me along with Topamax. I have tried almost every med out there and everything had so many side effects or just made me loopy or made me pass out all day. This combo has kept me stable with little to no side effects. I'm so thankful for Abilify.	F	29	1  years	7/6/2008Email
1	Yes	Tardive dyskinesis, weight gain, terrible mental health ( mental fog, slow thinking, poor coordination, excessive sleep)  not able to function to my full potential...just a walking zombie....like being in a vegetative state.	Presribed by doctor and forced to take by the doctor for her diagnosis for schizophrenia....the new doctor i saw after her expressed concerns about the previous docs diagnosis....for i never exhibited any of the symptoms except for depression...

2	major depression and gen. anxiety	the first night i had a bit of nausea and kept waking up in the middle of the night, and then second night i also had nausea and i ended up passing out in the hallway.  it felt like there wasn't enough blood in my head, and then i collapsed and hit my head, and a few minutes later i threw up.	i can't say anything about its psychological benefits because i only took 2 small doses (2.5mg), and i stopped taking it due to the bad side effects.  mostly i'm terrified of taking new meds now, as i already had an intense fear of getting sick and was weary of side effects from anything.	F	17	2  days	6/21/2008
5	schizoaffective or biploar	none	This drug made many improvements in my day to day life.

2	Bipolar - rapid cycling	jittery and sleepy all of the time.  Extremely irritable	I began taking this drug to help with my rapid cyclng.  Abilify only made my life more difficult due to the unability to sit still for more than 15 seconds.	F	35	3  years	6/6/2008
3	bipolar	Initially I was VERY restless and had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Eventually that wore off. Weight gain.	I'm on the fence as to I feel about it.

2	Depression	My Dr. added this Rx to my Effexor (150mg) and Wellbutrin (300mg) because I was still having problems with my depression.  I'm gaining weight (which I definitely don't need since I already have a weight problem), my knees are killing me, I feel very fatigued, I'm not sleeping all that great, and I can't seem to feel "good" anymore--not even for a day. I'm going to ask to be taken off of this drug.  I have never done this before and I've dealt with depression off and on for the past 10 years.  The side effects are just not worth it to me.		F	48	3  weeks	5/27/2008
2	PTSD - Anger Management Issues	Extreme Restlessness, Unable to concentrate/focus (this is a big problem for me as a go to school), Night Sweats, Weight Gain, Blurred Vision.	Abilify is supposedly the better substitute to Geodon according to my Doctor. However, I never felt anything different other than than my nausea went away. I always have this feeling of restlessness and the need to move every minute. It has also become difficult for me to study for school because I cannot focus my attention to my readings! My dreams have also become vivid and I wake up all sweaty. Since I started taking Abilify, I couldn't stop eating! I already gained 10lbs in the last 3 days. Definitely not worth it!

3	depression-CFS	constipation, I've gained 20 pounds.. but I took a vacation and I have been able to gain wieght easily in the past.	It seems to really numb me out. I take 15mg abilify-120mg cymbalta-90mg adderall + slepping pills. I think the abilify take the highs and lows out of the adderall. Bummer on the highs but good on the lows. I would rate it higher if I had more exerience with this drug	M	37	30  days	4/19/2008
5	PTSD; depression; rapid cycling	Some blurred vision; muscle stiffness and fatigue	I am extremely medication resistant and after trying virtually ever psych drug on the market with no success, Abilify has been a life saver.  It works for me on a low dose (4mg) and has improved and stabilized my moods and quality of sleep. A great drug if it works for you.  Try lowering dosage or starting on a really low dose if side effects are too much.	M	45	4  weeks	4/16/2008
3	OCD	extreme restlessness	this medciation is REALLY helping my ocd, but the restlessness is almost unbearable, especially since i have a desk job. i'm going to talk to my psych about maybe taking something to combat the side effect.	M	24	1  months	4/12/2008
4	Bipolar: depression, phycosis	night sweats, weight gain, bloating, restlessness, insomnia, hypo manic and a little grouchy	i have been on 10mg for about three weeks. at five mg the first week i felt great. i had been having psychotic thoughts and depression. now i am hypo manic which is much better than being depressed. i can't sleep well or sit still but i get my housework done. I have started having night sweats and insomnia on week 3. the psychotic thoughts have not totally been taken care of but i do not want to increase my dosage yet. it's hard to be around other people when i have these thoughts.

4	Bipolar, antisocial disorder	Not able to eat much, bowel movements inconsistant, weird taste in mouth	Mu Daughter has been taking this med. in the morning, along with Pamilor at night(I assume to counter effect some of the nasties that can go along with Abilify) So far, her mood and behavor are MUCH better, relationships with friends and family are more stable. She is on 5mg right now with an expected increase next week to 7.5mg. I think that will do it. She seems to be aware of other human beings now and the distruction of the house (mostly unintentional) has improved soooo much.	F	13	1  weeks	4/3/2008Email

3	Childhood Onset Bipolar Disorder	Parkinsonian symptoms including elbow flexion, mask face, dysfunctional posture, some stiffness in arms, initially somnolence, but this eventually passed	My 7 year old son was started on Abilify as soon as he was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder.  He improved remarkably after the first dose, and within 6-7 days his symptoms were improved by 80-90%.  However, he also immediately developed what is called in medical lingo akinesia, which is abnormal movement and posture, delayed spontanuity in gesture, and abnormal posture.  Most of these side effects made him look like a Parkinson's patient.  The pych was against giving a drug to counter these side-effects becuase he felt it was not a "clean solution."  Later however, we did put him on Congentin which immediately took care of these side effects.  In a nut shell, we tried various other drugs and none worked as well as Abilify so we are now going back to it hoping the side-effects don't re-emerge.  He has been on numerous anti-pychotics since, and the side-effects are slowly diminishing with each new one.	M	7	6  weeks	3/25/2008
3	bipolar II - Depression - anorxia	killer headache - pain in my jaw - nausea - dizziness	Can't really say yet if I like this medicine.  I've only been on it for four days - 5mg.  Seems as though a lot of people have gained weight. Hopefully that won't happen to me - right now I am nauseous so I don't want to eat; which is good sort of - I've had an eating disorder for many, many years.  Now I am worried about gaining weight.  If I do - I am off this drug. Thanks for the heads up - because my Doc prescribed this med as opposed to seroquel.  I am hoping that these side effects go away.	F	50	4  days	3/25/2008
1	SUPPOSED BI POLAR AND DEPRESSION	I cant fall asleep or stay asleep when the abilify was added to the effexor a week ago. Anxious and Xanax wont take the edge off	AS I sit here crying at 5 am becasue I once again am sleep deprived, have gained weight from it and keep getting told its okay I want to scream its not!!  I am goging to have my dr remove me from this drug.  Its as some have said not worht the side effects.  I lived through the nausa but the no sleep other than 3 hours a night is wearingme out.

5	Complex PTSD	thinking becomes dull, thick.  Dizziness, a little tardive dyskinesia.	Used this drug for a year or so, then was able to ween off of it. Now it works well when  I cannot slow my brain down in any other way.  Sometimes I only need it for 3 days, sometimes for a month. I can always ween off of it again and have months that I am ok.  Many times, it has kept me from having to go back to the hospital.  I am grateful to have it.	M	51	3  years	3/16/2008
5	BIPOLAR II - PTSD	mania, jaw clenching, consitpation, increased appetite for sweets, jittery, sleepy after taking, anxiety,	it has IMPROVED my mood 100%. Very LOW dose 2.5mg. Started at 10mg, then 5mg every other day, then 2.5 mgs. That works best. Perhaps these folks on higher doses need to lessen dose until it is manageable. I am on EFFEXOR+Abilify 2.5-was suicidal b4 for 2 years.  Now in less than a week I was up, productive, working, getting things done I hadn't in months. Will monitor for weight gain--I already gained weight on Effexor! No need for more weight.	F	46	14  days	3/11/2008

1	Bipolar	Fatigue, depression	I was taking 15mgs and could never stay awake. I would sleep for almost 12 hours and still fall asleep at work and in class. I had to drink 4-5 energy drinks a day just to make it and I STILL had difficulty staying awake.	F	22	1  months	2/23/2008

1	Bipolar II	So far, the side effects of this medication are some of the worst I've ever felt. I have had non-stop nausea, vomiting and a horrific headache since the medicine got into my system. I've only taken one dose and am reluctant to take another before first speaking to my doctor about my exteme side-effects.	Skin "crawling" and cannot get comfortable.	F	30	1  days	2/12/2008
5	bi polar	sleepy	you doctor may not tell you this but if you are over weight or insulin resistant this medicine may cause you to become diabetic I am insulin resistant and for that reason I had to wean myself off of this the benefits were not worth having a future of diabetes	F	28	9  months	2/11/2008
4	PTSD	Weight Gain	Helped with nightmares. Went to sleep within 1 hour of taking. Other than 20 lb. weight gain, this medicine was very effective.	F	25	3  months	2/3/2008

1	Was switched from Rispiradol.	Our 16 year old son had gained a tremendous amount of weight taking Rispiradol and the Dr. switched him to Abilify.  "Will do the same as Rispirasol for your son without the weight gain", the Doctor told us. Well, he STILL continued to gain weight (always hungry) (has gained 70 pounds in 9 months, and he was always small framed until beginning the Rispiradol). He became extremely restless and he would pace and not be able to sit still for more than 8 minutes at a time. His lying and disrespect intensified.  It was as if we no longer knew our son.Now, two weeks after stopping the Abilify, our old son is re-emerging.  It is a welcomed sight.	We will never allow him to be put on abilify again.	M	16	2  months	1/22/2008
2	Anxiety & Depression	Strange restlessness; especially in arms and legs. No chair felt right. First few weeks: couldn't sit still !! Increase in anxiety & depression. Slight increase in weight which subsided after 5 weeks.	Quicker orgasms!	F	40	6  weeks	1/17/2008Email

My therapist knows someone who works for the co. and he said my psychopharmacologist didn't have the info because it hasn't been published yet. I was waking up several hours earlier than normal and went back to my regular schedule as soon as I stopped.	F	50	4  months	1/11/2008
1	supposed bipolar	my son was 17 yrs old.He was on abilify for9 months with some progress with social issues.he gained 50 lbs.he went to bed at 10.30 and passed away in his sleep.this was the only med he was on.autopsy report could not determin a definate cause.we believe it had to be from the med.		M	17	9  months	1/9/2008Email
4	Bi-Polar, ADHD	My seven year old son has been on this med for two weeks. He complains about a little pain, I am thinking muscle pain, he has had a sore inside his cheek that we treated with clove oil and hydrogen peroxide (went away), he has been a little sad on this med, a little whiny, but considering all he has been through, it seems like he is finally able to feel emotions whereas before he seemed very out of touch with reality and non-emotional (his dad abandoned him and we are in the middle of divorce, and my son has hardly registered emotionally, which might have been a blessing in disguise all this time, and I think part of his whininess is just his ability to finally feel the things he had not been able to feel before).	Now the good stuff, we tried this med first (physician sample), then Risperdal (actual prescription). The Risperdal had no effect on him, he was still racing around like a lunatic, and after seeing him on this drug, we decided this drug was far better. He can focus at school, listens to the teacher, was able to be included in his school Christmas pageant, the violence against others (classmates, his dad, myself) has stopped, and he is able to sit still for long periods, complete class work and homework, no longer destroys the house like he did before, the school is considering allowing him to rejoin his classmates in social activities (recess and PE, which he was held out of for most of the school year because of fighting and violence), and this saved him from being suspended for the second time. My son likes the drug, wants to take it, and gets a lot of satisfaction from being able to complete tasks and follow directions. He was in so much trouble before, and meds were a last resort f	M	7	2  weeks	1/7/2008Email
3	depression,  adhd, anxiety	2mg every 2-4 days, per shrink.  I have noticed that I have been happier the first day after taking it, each time, but then I get more moody or anxious as the pill wears off so I take another one which is about 2-3 days later.  I sleep fine but not as hard anymore as I used to and I find myself more bored.  I am more friendly to people though - most of the time.	I am still on the fence on this drug.  I am not sure if it is because I am "thinking" it is working in a good way - or if it really is.  This is one drug I am still waiting to see miracles happen but, honestly, I doubt it'll ever happen.  I will continue to take the samples I received from the shrink and go from there.....	F	38	30  days	1/3/2008
2	BI POLAR I	Tired, less energy, lathargic, mouth is dry, jittery, cold sweats, etc.	If i take it in the day I feel tired all day, I take it at night around 8 eiother was around lunch I am so tired and sleep 3 hours and around 8-10 at night, when I take it at night I am almost on the verge of passing out and it gives me quite a rush and keeps me up. I was very energetic before, now I feel like not even moving. LOL if you can tell I had just tookin my meds or I would not even be typing this. Also I am ever so restless legs, getting comfortable etc.	M	34	4  weeks	12/26/2007Email
3		Massive increase in hunger and weight gain.  No other side effects	Abilify worked great to stop mood swings and sense of "What's the point?" and fearful thoughts.  The doctor said the medication would make me lose weight but it didn't so I decided to stop it	F		2  months	12/25/2007
1	Bilpolar	RESTLESS!! Doctor said technical term is "akastasia" pardon spelling. Wasnt even comfortable to drive. I have driven cross country etc. before this experience. Couldnt sit still, stand or ANYTHING for 5 mins. Thought I would crawl out of my skin. Was making me feel almost suicidal! TOOK TWO full weeks or more off my 15mg dose to feel "normal" again.	I was on this med for occasional manic episodes and rapid speech.....it made me feel completely whacked out. Have never felt so uncontrollably "odd" like that before. Was honestly a terrifying experience!	F	30	4  weeks	12/19/2007
3	Bipolar	Extreme nausea like I've never had, unusually tired, constipation, and restlessness	Helps keep my mind clear though...good for that, but the nausea makes me too sick to move much	F	30	24  days	12/15/2007
4	Bipolar/OCD	Grogginess in the morning	This drug has worked absolutely fantastic for me, I was so manic, my mind was always racing..."I have to buy this", "I have to do that"; And now I feel so peaceful.	F	23	6  months	12/14/2007
1	Bi Polar disorder	Even more depressed, irritated, can't concentrate, bladder problems, shaky legs and hands, swollen extremities, can't laugh (I love laughing- now seems like I have to retrain myself how to do it), painful joints/stiffness>(doesn't subside at all!), severely panicky, crying a lot, very sad, can't stop thinking about how horrible I feel mentally and physically. I'm even more paranoid/worried about what other's think about me than I was before taking Abilify. 	Not for me. I'm glad to see that it works for some people. I was open minded and looking for help and whatever medicine works/worked, would be willing to try for sure..but not this one!	F	46	2  days	12/14/2007
5	complex PTSD	Thinking is thick and slow	I take abilify when my brain starts to go out of control and won't stop.  It is step 4 in a 5 step management process.  (Step 5 is back to the hospital.)  I've tried most other atypical anti-psychotics and for me abilify is the gentlest and sturdiest way to get my brain to stop.  Usually stay on it for a month after an episode and then go off of it and am ok for a few months.	F	51	3  years	12/11/2007
3	bipolar and OCD	motor impairment, slight weight gain, EXTREME fatigue, EXTEREME thirst, akathisia (need to move; I can't sit still anymore), and I believe I am experiencing Tardive dyskinesia	This medication was okay at first, or at least better than risperdal (which overall made me gain well over 100 pounds, but abilify was not that drastic). It had greatly reduced my obsessive and intrusive thoughts but now it's just an annoyance. Most of my meds, including this one, have slowed down my entire body (thinking, reaction time, speech, etc.) which is the reason I have a learning disability. I'm SO tired! I do have sleep apnea but abilify just makes it worse. Tardive dyskinesia is a problem, too (involuntary movements such as: grimacing, tongue protrusion, rapid eye blinking, finger movements as if playing a guitar or piano, etc.) Tardive dyskinesia happens with antipsychotics like abilify and I do every single thing I listed there. It's also potentially irreversable. I'm just not the same as I once was.	M	20	2  years	12/11/2007
4	stress disorder	restlessness tremors BOREDOM pacing vivid/scary dreams	i had to cut my dosage in half (15 mg to 7.5 mg) and the side effects lessoned..... it works but side effects are annoying	F	14	1  months	12/8/2007
5	Schizoaffective- Bipolar Type	Was tired when I first started taking it but that subsided.  Now after being on it for 4 years I'm starting to have Extra Pyramidal Symptoms in my Eyes (unusual eye movements).  So I've had to lower my dose.	This drug saved my life.  I was literally at rock bottom when I found abilify four years ago and it brought me out of the deepest darkness imaginable.  It stopped my hallucinations, controlled my bipolar symptoms, and allowed me to get to the point of being able to go back to school.  I'm terrified that I'll have to stop taking it because of the EPS.	F	22	4  years	11/27/2007
3	Bipolar/Hypomania	Hypomania, insomnia, blurred vision, nervousness, paraniod thoughts after 3 weeks of usage, unable to relax, confusion (could have been from lack of sleep).	The first week was great, very motivated on 10 MG.  Week 2 began feeling confused, blurred vision, light sensitivity, nerviousness, yet still unable to stop moving.  Third week 15mg, had to start taking Temazepam to get to sleep, still only 2-3 hrs of sleep a night.  Still unable to stop moving.  Finally called doc and weaned off in 3 days.  Wonderful motivator, but unable to focus and sleep.  The sleep deprivation and vision issues made this drug debilitating.  Seemed to make my hypomania worse.  Weaning off had delusional thoughts for a day or so.  Defintely do not cold turkey off this med.	F	34	3  weeks	11/27/2007Email

4	Major depression	Vivid dreams, waking up in the middle of the night, blurred vision (but I'm on a cocktail of meds so I don't know if this is all due to the Abilify or the others)	I've had chronic depression my entire life.  I was recently (last month) suicidal, and a few days after my psychiatrist prescribed 2.5mg a day, I was out of the suicidal haze and began to feel better.  After adding Lamictal (in addition to the Lexapro I was already on), I feel a LOT better.	F	21	1.5  months	11/8/2007

1	Bipolar II	EXTREME mania, severe throat swelling starting within 24 hrs of first 2 mg dose, sweating, uncontrollable tremors, twitching, headache, tiredness, blurred vision, nausea, agitation, dizziness. I ended up in the hospital after 4 days on the drug. I was severely dehydrated.	I would NOT take this drug. Even if you are having few side effects now I would say it's extremely dangerous and not worth the risk. Especially do not give this drug to children! There are bound to be long term effects that are irreversible. I will have to see if my muscle aches, tremors and twitching will subside permanently. Not a good experience!	M	25	4  days	10/13/2007Email
5	Bipolar	constipation, incresed energy, suppressed appetite.	i love it! on 5mg for past 2 weeks. I used to sleep 10 hrs a day before meds, and now I'm wide awake after 5 hrs. I have so much energy right now. I had taken Depakote, which was awful, I slept 12+ hrs a day, and still felt drowsy. Lost 5 lbs in past 2 weeks.	F	28	2  weeks	10/12/2007
3	Paranoid schizophrenia	For a short while, I experienced akathesia, but this has now gone.	Abilify has stopped auditory hallucinations, which is a great blessing. Sleep is interrupted, but I find that useful for reading and studying assorted Christian publications and the Bible early in the morning when all is quiet.  My appetite is enormous, so am constantly struggling with the temptation to gluttony and "making a god of the belly". So the challenge is self-control to avoid putting on more weight. I can thoroughly recommend the book "Strength for His People - A Ministry for Families of the Mentally Ill" by Dr Steven Waterhouse, Pastor of Westcliff Bible Church in Amarillo, Texas since 1985, (published by Westcliff Press - www.webtheology.com; e-mail is westcliff@amaonline.com; Ph: (806)359-6362). His brother Mark, suffers from schizophrenia and he wrote the book  in honour of him and to help ordinary people who may also suffer from this awful condition, and as a guide and consolation to families who may be the primary carer.(125 pages; Bibliography has 1	F	53	69  days	10/10/2007Email
1	Depression	RESTLESSNESS RESTLESSNESS RESTLESSNESS, dizziness, tiredness, nausea, anxiety/panic, flu-like symptoms	My psychiatrist prescribed this medication for me to help the Prozac work more effectively, she said. I HATE this medication, and after three days of taking it I WILL NOT take anymore. I could cry- I've never felt in such a way in all my life. It was like the walls were closing in. EVERYTHING was too boring to hold my attention! All I could think of, and I mean ALL DAY, was how GOOD it would feel to just run around my neighborhood screaming at the top of my lungs. It was IMPOSSIBLE to get comfortable, and I felt panicky, as if I were going to suddenly run out of oxygen. It was horrible. I've never experienced such crippling side effects before from any medicine like this.	M	18	3  days	10/8/2007
5	Bipolar Disorder	Fatigue, but it's fine since I take it at night and it helps me sleep.	EXCELLENT! So far, so good! I have more energy and motivation than I have ever had. I also have little to NO obsessive thoughts, practically NO racing thoughts, and my mood has been greatly improved. I can't say enought about how great this medication has been for me. I actually feel normal!!	F	34	9  days	10/3/2007
2	Bipolar II	Jittery, manic frenzy, sleeplessness	If this doesn't make you want to jump out of your skin, I don't know what will. I felt like I could scale the walls.	F	24	7  days	9/21/2007
2	Bipolar I Disorder	Tremors, insomnia, headaches, agitation, increased energy	This seems like a medication that might work for major depression, but I just don't see how it works for Bipolar Disorder.  It's so stimulating I had to take it as early as possible in the morning to avoid sleeplessness at night and it caused me to shake and have WAY too much energy during the day.	M	22	2  months	9/21/2007

3	Anger/Rage/Paranoid Thoughts	Extreme tiredness/exhaustion.  Blurred vision and body aches.	It has made me calmer and I feel a little aloof so I'm not worrying about things as much.  I don't know if the side effects are worth it though.  I'll give it another week and see.	F	30	2  weeks	8/23/2007
5	bipolar w/ anxiety, hallucinations	some tummy upset when starting the meds but otherwise none so far.	Abilify was a miracle for my 8 yr old. After 4 years of searching for something that would help with his panic attacks, terror, anxiety, audio and visual hallucinations and frustration/aggression as well as his hyperactivity he was ultimately prescribed abilify 7.25 mg.  This was a miracle drug for us and alone has solved all of his issues. I'm so happy my son feels as he says "calm and happy" and isn't afraid of simple things like rain and leaving the house. He has been on it for 2 months now and the change is so dramatic. I'm one of those who tried so hard not to put my son on medication but he is a different child now, happy and no longer unable to function. As another mother here said, it gave him his life back.

2	rapid cycling bi-polar disorder	have gained 10 lbs in 4months, urinate frequently,no sex drive, blurred vision, makes me intensely hungry after i take it.unusually tired	I'm on lamictal and klonopin and have been on both of those for almost 10yrs, drs have been trying to add something for a boost as the lamictal makes me a little blah feeling. I have tried everything and just started the abilify 4 months ago and i felt like it worked great at first then the longer i take it the worse my side effects have gotten, i thought something new was wrong with me since it worked well in the beginning it seemed but have been so tired its ridiculous. i'm glad i went back and researched my meds just in case and found all my problems are side effects of this med.	F	34	4  months	8/22/2007
5	BPII, BPD	In the beginning I had some "wooziness," but that passed quickly.  Overall, I've had no real side-effects.	It has helped tremendously with my moods and I am able to take it during the day, which is a great thing (I don't tolerate medications well, and most tend to make me very sleepy).	F	26	3  months	8/15/2007Email
5	BIpoalr disorder	The main side effect is not being able to sleep for very long, but I also have more energy and get more things done.	I have taken almost every depression drug out there, and thought that I was just supposed to feel detached or apathetic. Abilify has been a miracle for me. I have a sense of humor again, lots of energy and the negative critical side of me is GONE.	M	35	30  days	8/12/2007Email
2	OCPD, anxiety, mild depression	Listlessness, lethargy, fatigue, reduced libido, ambivalence, lip sore (?), weight gain (?).	I was feeling highly motivated for two weeks before starting on Abilify. I started 5 mg for 5 days, then ramped to 10 mg for another 2+ weeks. All of the side effects started out barely noticeable. Over the last 5 days or so, the side effects have intensified. [Note: Taking 30 units Lantis(insulin)/dy for Type 2 diabetes; My BMI is 38;  I'm also on 40-80mg/dy Prozac for depression/aggression, the last 10 yrs., w/ no side effects.] I suspect Abilify is slowly turning me into the PillsBury Dough Boy. So, I'm not waiting another 2 weeks to get the shrink's opinion. I'm stopping taking this Rx cold turkey-right now. Of course I'll call the shrink to let him know I'm stopping this med.. All side effects w/ no noticeable benefits for me (unless you like feeling like a human marshmallow). Of course, your experience may or maynot be positive, unlike mine.	M	53	3  weeks	8/11/2007
4	Bipolar 2	VIVID DREAMS (things I think about during the day, i dream about at night.  These dreams feel very real)  K.O. component (I fall asleep within an hour of taking abilify)	I take Abilify with LAMICTAL(mood stabilizer) & Remeron.  I have nothing bad to say about abilify except it doesnt give me the desired effect i'm looking for which is the semi-resurrection of my mania so i am able to be an intellect and have a personality.	M	24	2  months	7/21/2007
3	Schizoaffective	I'm on lots of meds, so I'm not sure what side effects are caused by abilify; I haven't noticed any.	Abilify helped things make more sense. It helped a lot with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. I stoped wearing sweatshirts in the summer shortly after the drug was started but didn't realize until later that the abilify was why. I would recommend this drug.	F	19	2  months	7/21/2007Email
1	supposed bipolar disorder	Mental "fog," totally detached from everything, and severe--and continuing, even after 18 months off Abilify--movement problems akin to Restless Leg Syndrome.	Despite 30mg being the maximum dosage, my psychiatrist had me on 45mg, and did not listen when I told him about the side effects.  So, after about a year on Abilify (as well as Seroquel and Lamictal) I took myself off the two neuroleptics.  And yet I still have moment problems, increasing when tired or stressed, all this time later.	F	26	1  years	7/21/2007
2	Aspergers Syndrome, Tourette's	Intense sleepiness for first day, then after second dose, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, intense akathesia. Four days after discontinuing, the akathesia is subsiding, and the insomnia is lessening, but still present. Also: intense feelings of hunger.	This drug was supposed to calm me, help me to focus, control repetitive behaviors and tics. It did the opposite. It made it very difficult for me to sit still and write or type.	M	45	3  days	7/9/2007
1	Bipolar 2	Tremors in arms hands.  Two right fingers don't function normally. Restless legs.	The restless leg thing was bad.  I felt like a hyper 5 year old.  Tremors in arms and hands almost as bad as Katherine Hepburn.  Two fingers on right hand don't function normally.  Since I throw freight as a package handler, I'm useless at work.  Also have the urinating issue, I wait until I HAVE TO GO, otherwise not much happens - unlike normal.  Took 10 mg without Cymbalta, then with it again.  I have stopped takeing Abilify on 6/30.  It is now 7/5 and side effects haven't stopped.  Tremor has actually worsened.	M	36	5  days	7/5/2007Email
2	Bipolar II Disorder	Constant mouth ulcers, toothaches, muscle pain	It helped control my disorder better than most medications, with a minimum of other side effects, but the mouth ulcers are too much when you can't even eat a decent cheeseburger without being in pain.  The toothache was from a still-growing wisdom tooth that only seems to come in when I've taken it.  My mother has reported similar symptoms, so I figure it's just a hereditary thing.	M	28	3  weeks	7/3/2007
1	depression, irritabiity	extreme nausea, I took 1/2 of this pill and vomited all night, dry heaves, you name it.  It was the most horrific experience, I will never,.. ever recommend this med, please beware!  I was also prescribed a 30mg tablet a day, and in doing more research found out that is the highest dose!  I think this nurse practitioner is a quack!		F	49	1  days	7/3/2007
4	Psychosis from PTSD	weight gain (despite claims that it doesn't cause weight gain)	Abilify has helped me think more clearly, rationally and aside from the weight gain, I've had no side effects at all.  I take the Abilify in the morning, as it tends to be a bit stimulating.	M	46	3  years	6/11/2007Email
5	schizophrenia	this drug is going to be similiar to the drug named BIFEPRUNOX(chemical name)coming out soon maybe end of 07 or 1st quarter of 08 it has a good side effect profile NO WEIGHT GAINNO INCREASE IN PROLACTIN LEVELSNO ADVERSE EFFECT ON BLOOD LIPIDS NO ADVERSE AFFECTS ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS NO QTc PROLONGATION	i will be taking my ABILIFY at 15mg until this drug called BIFEPRUNOX becomes availableI hope soon!

5	BP w/psychotic episodes; autism	My son has been on this med for two years and his only side effect has been minimal weight gain (about 20 lbs. in two years).	This medication worked very well for my son - stopped his visual and auditory hallucinations completely, decreased his motor tics, reduced OCD-like behaviors, and greatly reduced his aggression. This medication gave my son his life back; he is now able to function & communicate well and he is excelling academically.	M	12	2  years	5/17/2007
3	schizo/bipolar/depression	This medicince by far is the most effective when treating symptomsit has low impact on weight gain.  i recommend this drug if you have experienced weight gain with other anti physcotics such as seroquel and  zyprexa, i believe those drugs are linked to DIABETES, WEIGHT GAIN, and OVER EATING AND UNCONTROLLABLE HUNGER the dosing is very easy with abilify starting dose 15mg and that is the recommended dose you stay on according to my shrink abilify has not been found affective at higher does due to extreme side effects	this medicine made my eyes roll in back of my head once	M	32	14  years	5/14/2007
4	bipolar 1 disorder/mood instability	extreme tiredness, upset stomach, blurred vision, cold sweats, tremors (uncontrollable shaking) in hands.	I have been on and off this medication for 4 years and today is my first day back on it in 8 months. I feel very ill but I remember from all my past experiences that it takes a few weeks for your body to get used to and to respond(I just want to make that clear to the people that quit taking it after one day). I am taking 15mg but I'm pretty sure I'm going to start cutting my pill in half to lessen the side effects. Abilify has been highly effective in treating my irritability and mood swings, making me a pleasure, rather than a monster, to be around. Personally, I would rather have an upset stomach for a few days and be happy than to be constantly angry for the rest of my life. I took abilify with effexor a few years back and it sent me to the ER because I was shaking so badly I couldn't stand up. I am told it is dangerous to mix abilify with anything. Hopefully the side effects go away soon!	F	19	4  years	5/1/2007Email
5	bipolar/schizo-affectiver	As I went slowly up from 2.5mg to 15mg,- I experienced poor night vision;loud noises startled me at night;muscular aches and pains; always want to eat; tired all day but can't sleep through the night; restless, but tired.  Agitation, anger and anxiety came back if I didn't increase my dosage in about 4days.  I just began 15mg today. DR. said may go all the way to 30mg if we need to in the future.	Now, the good stuff--I'm calmer around people.  My anger is much reduced.  Oversensitivity is reduced. I'm able to cope with daily frustrations.  I'm no longer so irritable and impatient with people.  General anxiety, and nervousness to be around people is gone.  Bipolar mood swings are completely minimized and I recover from any emotional upset faster.  AWESOME drug for me personally!	F	38	1  months	4/25/2007
4	bipolar depression	weight gain (it was lithium's helper) spasming jaw, chattering teeth, tiredness, "wired, but tired"	This drug has kept me from falling any deeper into depressions. Both times it has rescued me from hospitalizations.  However, I do not like having to take two other drugs just so I can continue taking this one without the side effects.  Have to take cogentin and inderal both for the jaws and limb jerks.  Don't like that.	F	50	15  days	4/25/2007
3	Schizophrenia	increased sex drive, some tiredness, restlessness	Aripiprazole has being used to decrease the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and it has being effective at doing so. In my case, the side effects close to outweigh the benefits of this drug.	M	32	2  months	4/23/2007Email
1	Cyclothymia	Intense pain with muscle stiffness.  I might be diagnosed with Lupus now.  I never had these problems before I took Abilify.	I still have to have more blood tests to determine what is going on with the muscle and joint pain that I am experiencing.  I took 2.5 mgs. of Abilify for about a month and then felt like I was coming down with the flu.  It turns out that it was a rare side effect from this medicine, so I stopped taking it.  I am still in pain and it has been over 2 months since my last dose.  I am convinced that whatever my blood work says that I have it came from taking this medicine.	F	44	30  days	4/23/2007Email
5	schizophrenia	vivid dreaming, insomnia for the first four months	I lost 87lds on this drug and it gave my life back to me. No voices, no paranoia, no psychosis!!!	F	47	3  days	4/19/2007
1	bipolar disoder II, depression	I was vomiting the whole night after taking the first pill, the next day I was feeling sick that the only thing that I could do is just lying down in my bed; wasn't able to eat. I was feeling really sick, no drug made me fell that way	I took this medicine just for 1 day, and it was enough for me to decide that I wasn't taking it anymore. I was feeling really sick, just the same as when I was pregnant and having severe toxicosis , no drug made me fell that way. I'm going back to Depakote.	F	21	1  days	4/10/2007
2	schizoaffective, bipolar type	About three weeks after I started taking it, my entire body started gradually swelling up like a balloon, and I had this uncontrollable, horrible burning sensation in my legs and ankles. It got to the point where the swelling was so bad that I could barely move. I couldn't button my shirts anymore, my feet wouldn't fit into my shoes, and I had to go up a whole bra size (band AND cup). I found out, though, that only about two percent of the subjects in the clinical trials had this problem (and it's often an allergic reaction), so I must be special. ;-} Oddly enough, when I went off this, I got onto Risperdal, only to have the exact same reaction.	I was REALLY disappointed that my reaction was so bad, because it otherwise worked very well. I felt better than I could remember feeling in about 20 years. My mood swings went from every several minutes to ... not at ALL. I felt stable for the first time in a VERY long time, like I was finally on solid ground. The really WEIRD thing, though, was that for the first four days, I couldn't feel ANYTHING -- it was like someone had flipped a switch inside me and turned me off. After that, it took about another week to level out completely, but once I did, I felt GREAT.	F	28	5  weeks	4/5/2007Email
4	bi p[olar disorder	Tired. Very tired at first; now I don't even notice unless I stop taking it...then I'm a real c*nt to deal with and I am very irritable and angry.	When I started taking Abilify with Zoloft, I was very tired all day.  I felt like I had a wet blanket wrapped around my head, then they lessened the dose to 5 mg a day, and I'm fine.  It's subtle, I can't tell any effect at all from it unless I stop taking it.  Then it is like an immediate PMS.	F	37	1  years	4/1/2007Email
1	bi polar disorder	Started out on 5mg daily and over a period of 2 months was "upped" to 20mg.  By the middle of the third month, I developed the most horrible feeling, like wanting to jump out of my own skin, could NOT get comfortable, caused restless leg syndrome to go totally bonkers, made me pace and feel horribly panicky ALL THE TIME!  I had never in my life felt such an awful feeling!  Raging insomnia accompanied the whole ordeal, as well as vision trouble, completely unable to write a sentence or write my own name, for that matter due to hand tremors (which I still have sometimes to this day), constant feeling that the "dying to get out of my own skin or run screaming like a madwoman" feeling would NEVER go away.  It finally did, but golly did it ever take time.  That's the only thing that will help with the akathisia (acathesia)...time.  It took the same amount of time that I was on the drug, about 3 and a half months, for the feeling to finally start going away.	In all honesty, through bi polar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, severe panic disorder, visual and auditory psychosis at times, depression, etc., the ONLY time I ever truly even considered suicide was during the akathisia (acathesia) ordeal I went through, all due to the Abilify.  You don't know what utter hell and torment is until you've gone through the nightmare of akathesia, which for me was completely due to taking Abilify!  If it works for you, great, but be warned...try to stay on the smallest dosage that works for you...upping the dosage over a period of time can have this horrible effect on you too and I wouldn't wish the feeling Abilify caused me on my worst enemy!

2	psychosis, appearantly.	so restless i couldn't stop moving but exhausted at the same time, dizzyness, headaches.	i only lasted a week.  it did nothing to help me.	F	17	1  weeks	3/26/2007
5	BP 1/possible schizoaffective/PTSD	vertigo,(room tumbling end over end) one episode lasted two days, the other lasted one week, other than that no side effects. cannot be certain this medicine was to blame	abilfy helped me come down out of the sky, gave me very crisp feelings and perceptions of reality.  It dimmed out the white noise in my head, and for the very first time i can remember felt no noise in my head, just peacefulness.  Being numb from years of emotional shutdown, i actually had feelings surface for the first time, and had to start sorting through them and dealing with them.  sometimes it was painful at first because the pain was acute, but Id much rather feel now than be numb.  Ativan in combination helps deal with the tremendous anxiety.  Also take seroquel for sleep, and lamictal for the depression.  Overall, a good mix for me.  I would never want to go back to the worst moments of this illness before Dx and treatment, and for that I am grateful.	F	37	17  months	3/25/2007
5	bipolar1/ schizo	Restlessness   Severe at times.  strangeley, tiredness can acompany this or exist independently of it.  I feel agitated but clear headed.  i will accept the trade-off but feel that I must do something about side-effect.  Benzo helps. I forsee weight gain because I am hungry again.	I am only in the first week, but needed to speak of the progress I have made.  At just 5 mgs. I notice a substantial reduction in the chatter in my brain and I am better able to perceive and respond appropriately to social scenes, leaving me less sacred of people.  Paranoia is under control. i have been on several meds in my 20 year struggle with bipolar 1/schizo. disorder.  i am just coming off a psychotic break that lasted very long on and off.  I am what they call a quick responder when a med works for me.  So far wellbutrin (which i still take) Lamictal (which was like a god-send and then pooped-out, and now Abilify has improved drasticaly the picture in just 5 days.  Last night I could concentrate long enough to put a desk from Ikea together and I even cleaned my room.  Now i still have the memories of some terrible behavior and the knowlege of such negative poop-out tendencies of meds.  But for today I am grateful.  More later.  John. R.B. CA.

1	anti pyschotic, not needed	this drug made me walk like a zombie, slur my speech, I couldn't use my hands and fingers - it was like I had a small stroke, I couldn't lay or sit down - relaxing was very unconfortable, very nervous, loss of concentration.	I din't need anti-psychotics and was prescribed and administered them illegally.  I tried geodon, respirdal, and zyprexa too.  The abilify was by far the worst!  I was only taking 15mg., and I still had horrendous side effects!  This is a terribly dangerous drug.  I see no worth in any anti-psychotic or anti-depressant drugs, these drugs really mess with your mind and body. If you are having psychotic, bi-polar, depression, or whatever, and desire to take something.  Only take small dosages of anything, 10mg. or less.  These drugs can cause more harm than the disease!		41	18  days	3/12/2007
1	bogus court ordered "delusional"	Chattering teeth, leg shaking	I am forced to take the medication	M	42	6  months	2/24/2007
3	social anxiety,  ADD	Mood lift, more energy (too much at 1 mg), got very restless, felt calmer around people, woke up earlier with energy, became to restless and had to stop taking Abilify.	I would recommend this to anyone needing an AP. I just got too restless and would lose my train of thought in mid- sentence.  Not for me!  Abilify may work really well with you.  Try it out; you'll know very soon if its for you or not.	M	32	21  days	2/22/2007
1	bi-polar	very tired, headache, pressure above eyes	taking 200 mg lamictal, took 1 mg abilify for one day, just that small amount had a negative effect.  i'm exhausted.  i was told things would go the other way, but i don't like this drug in description or feeling, so i'm not going to take it tomorrow.	F	40	1  days	2/22/2007
3	Non-Specified Psychotic Disorder	My 17 year old has been taking abilify for 3 months.  The sleepiness disrupts his daily functioning terribly.  He leaves school early every day, sleeps several hours and gets about 8-9 hours of sleep every night.  He never feels well rested, but has no problem falling asleep.  He also experiences some muscular discomfort and dehydration.	We are currently weaning off of it.  He would rather deal with his symptoms then the side effects.  Doc has prescribed Luvox..hard to find info on it.  Not sure what we are going to do.  The abilify decreased his symptoms by about 90% on 10 mg. per day.	M	17	3  months	2/13/2007
5	Bipolar 2	weight gain/sweet cravings	Abilify has done wonders for controlling my aggression and irritability.  I am already taking Topamax and I have noticed  a slow weight gain from craving sweets since on Abilify (1.5 years) and Dostinex (3yrs).  I am going to try to give up sugar and junk to see if the weight comes off.  I am also coming off the Dostinex too to see if it is effecting my weight. I really need the Abilify.  I could tell a tremendous difference in my anxiety level when I went from 10mg - 15mg.  I take 15 mg. of Abilify every morning.	F	41	1.5  years	2/7/2007
2	BP1, SAD	jittery, wanting to crawl out of my skin.  can't sleep at night, can't take it during the day because then i can't work.	i would NEVER try this drug again....ick	F	25	4  weeks	2/5/2007Email
1	schizoaffective and OCD	terrible shaking, teeth chatter, neck pain, inability to stay in my seat, kept falling asleep, waking up in middle of night, lip quivering, lights bothered my eyes really bad, loud sounds bothered me bad.	I wish it had worked.  It really helped a lot with my illness.  But the side effects were impossible to handle.  I couldn't so much as eat dinner or read a book in any normal sense.  I wanted to just crawl out of my skin.  However, I must add that I take Paxil as well.  However, Paxil has never caused me any problems.my friend (same condition) also takes paxil and abilify.  both of us agreed that once we tried Abilify that mania was brought on.  For the record, Paxil has never done that to either of us until we had Abilify.	M	32	2  weeks	2/4/2007
4	Autism and Tourettes Syndrome	I was on Abilify for about 5 years and then had to go off of it.  I lost a great deal of weight when I went off of it, but my behaviors got worse. I could not think clearly. I recently went back on the Abilify and I have gained a great deal of weight in a very short period of time. Not happy about that.  Also, my appetite has increased slightly, and it makes me extremely tired.	This truly gets rid of tics (from Tourette's) and controls alot of the behaviors from Autism, but the side effects are just awful. There really is no drug out there that works as well, and that is a shame. Wish someone would develop a drug that didn't have so many side effects.	F	15	 	12/24/2006
5	Bipolar I Disorder	None whatsoever.	Silenced the voices, no more paranoia,able to think clearly, able to SLEEP, no weight gain here.No drowsiness as experienced with Seroquel.	F	42	4  months	12/23/2006
1	Bipolar I disorder - manic episodes	Severe eye tremors, double vision, hypersomnia, anxiety attacks, muscle weakness, severe depression, cloudy thoughts, hypertension.	Side effects were very severe.  I had to stop Abilify and increase my dosage of Lamictal.  The side effects completely abated after three days except for eye tremors which lasted about a week, hypertension lasted about another two weeks and then just plummet to normal.  Side effects first noticed at 10mg and then instantly severe at 15mg.	M	24	8  weeks	12/18/2006
5	Paranoid schizophrenia	The only side effects I noticed are a weight gain (40 lbs) and a slight case of insomnia (which could be the result of life stresses and not the medication).  The weight gain could be a result of the Risperdal I was taking in combination with the Abilify, not sure,  but stopped the Risperdal to see if I could lose a few pounds and remained stable on just the Ability (Don't tell my doctor). I have stopped gaining weight. I take the maximum dosage too, 30 MG. 	Since I started taking Abilify, I have the impetus to get up and out.  No other medication has had this effect. No delusions, hallucinations, voices or paranoia.  This is a great drug.	F	56	2  years	12/11/2006Email
2	Bipolar 2 hypomania	I cannot bear the side effects this drug has!  I Have no ability to THINK clearly on this med.  I am confused and retarded physically and mentally.  I am on disability, thank God! The only reason I am taking it currently is becasue I have been RX'd large doses of Prednisone )or a physical problem I have)which within 2 days made me totally manic! As fun as feeling hypomanic is, I didn't want to go over the top! So I reluctantly started taking abilify again during the steroidal treatment. I am in the taper down phase now of prednisone and abilify. I am looking forward to being on Trileptal alone again for treating my Bipolar disorder.	Since 1998 I had taken depakote and prozac, but then after gaining 80 lbs, I changed Doctors.  The new P-doc prx'd Abilify. I was unstable and had a lot of mixed states. I became all messed up---retarded, confused, irritable, sleep problems, inability to function in the medical field as a Sr. Veterinary Technician.  I needed meds to make me sleep and needed meds to wake me up...it was TERRIBLE.  My job performance was ridiculous.  The only reason I wasn't fired is that my boss and I had an understanding---and I was very very open about my BP. My Pdoc kept tweaking up the abilify and I got worse and worse. Finally, I decided he was a quack and I slowly tapered off ALL meds.  I became much better!  I was off meds for 18 mos before I cycled again and went back to the pdco to get treatment again.  I was relived he didn't force me to take abilify again until recently while I was taking steroids for another medical problem.  It knocks the heck out of any manic attack!  That is the one thing	F	42	6  months	12/10/2006
1	Bipolar Disorder II	Literally, I could not pee !  This drug was proscribed to "boost" the effects of other antidepressants, but did nothing at all aside from aggravate me.	Never would I take this medication again.....although, I have been told that I am like 1% of the 1% that have been recorded with this particular side effect.	M	38	1  months	11/13/2006
3	bipolar diagnosis after 25 yr lupus	extreme weight gain combination of depekote and ablilify  and trazadone for sleep severe depression and then slight stroke eight years ago. Lupus flair ups causes pain and not able to sleep i do not think i should have to take ablify medication for all these years, but want to decrease to 15 mg instead of 30 mg.  i went off the drug 18 months ago and ended up anxiety and panic striken and had to go to a week of health care around the clock to get back on medecine and then they added depekote because i was dizzy. during that stay at the help center i evened  out but they added a sleeping pill. I have no desire to do anything and if i let my mind get busy i start a lot of projects that make other family member crazy so it is best for me to  take several naps a day and stay calm. I eat compulsivley with out stopping to think about chewing and walk to the kithen to get a bite of food and would go back often if someone did not remind me not too.I do things in a hurry and shower half heart	has any one taken abilify as long as i have? over 2 years maybe three.and has any one mixed depekote that i have never had a seizure but they think this will control my bipolar actions. I think after my stroke and losing smell for 8 years.I visited a chiropractor last year and got my smell back, made my life a little better.  But i also take plaqenell, generic when my lupus flairs up and i have not had to take it the last three months. but someone said that they take celebrex for their lupus and i have always taken plaqeunell for the last 20 years when i have a flair up and i usually take it for three months untill symptoms subside. but i think when i went off the ablify on my own because of weight gain and being tired all the time is when it was really a bad week.  I was not rational at all and very anxious. enough that i wanted to go to institution and not ever come back home.  Said i would never go off the med again unless under a doctor that understood lupus and i was under 24	F	65	3  days	11/8/2006

5	Tourettes Syndrome	Slight increase in hunger, Tired during the day-yet restless leading to a constant uncomfortable feeling. vomiting about 3 times a day. restlessness is pretty bad	Wow. this drug has cleared my Tourettes 99%!! My tics used to be severe and constant, now they are rare and minor.  I can't believe I finally found the drug. It's worth the side effects for me. I can now get back to being social and enjoy college life.Only downside is if you dont have Insurance it cost about 750 bucks per month.	M	21	30  days	10/11/2006Email
4	severe depression	Insomnia, tiredness	I have been on Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal and Lexapro for severe depression for a little over a year. Recently, I went off the Abilify for two weeks in an effort to decrease my medication (under my Psychiatrist's supervision, because I want to get pregnant) and immediately became depressed and suicidal. Now I have been back on the Abilify for a week and I feel 'normal' again. The main problem that I am experiencing is insomnia at night and lack of energy during the day. Overall, it has really helped to balance my severe depression.	F	29	1  years	10/1/2006
