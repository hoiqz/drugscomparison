4	Restless leg syndrome	None	I replaced Requip, which had many very unpleasant side effects, including nausea, drowsiness and headaches after one glass of wine with dinner. The low dose that I take is effective with no side effects. I recommend trying it for RLS.	M	61	90  days2.5 mg 1X D	9/7/2012Email
5	Nauseafrom chemo and 2 put on weigh	Lack of nausea and hunger gain!		M	13	1  months2.5mg	6/11/2012Email
5	Headache and depression	Depression lifted, profound spiritual awareness, mental clarity, happiness, less freq of morning headaches, increased appetite (can be controlled), lose train of thought at times, increased emotional sensitivity, confusion at times.	I am taking less indomethacin because of lesser frequency of headaches. Long term use of NSAID meds for pain can be hard on liver and kidneys.  (I am a chronic migraine sufferer with headaches now under control).  Headache and depression are often linked, and when you treat one, you treat the other.   Marinol has been very effective in relieving my dysthemia, (low grade depression) which has had a positive effect on headache frequency.  I am thankful I have two understanding and knowledgeable physicians (headache specialist and family doctor) who are willing to prescribe me this med for "off label"use.  Its use is strictly controlled (handwritten prescription, no refills) so there is little potential for abuse.	M	55	60  days5 MG 2X D	5/24/2012Email
5	Chronic Pain/Cluster Headaches	Goofiness, increased appetite, improved sleep, enhanced motivation (oddly enough, given THC-9's reputation, but I find myself compelled to cook, clean, exercise, and do all the other chores/errands I typically despise, as I find almost any activity enjoyable/tolerable), improved concentration/mood, occasional altered consciousness (though this isn't unwelcome, as my typical consciousness before: "I'm in so much pain that I wish I was dead," becomes "this is the most fascinating thing I've ever seen," even if it would normally bore me). No withdrawal (I've always been tapered off when I suspended therapy), no long-term side effects, unlike opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ketamine, NSAIDs, Tricyclics, SSRIs, and anticonvulsant therapies. More effective and much less explosive than oxygen therapy. Didn't improve my appearance nearly as much as the BoTox injections. I am bipolar and it has no adverse effect on psychiatric symptoms other than occasional agorophob	Pain relief is moderate at best, I typically drop from a 7-9 to a 5-7, respectively, but it short-circuits the emotional response and the mental preoccupation with pain, much like the morphine/dilaudid/fentanyl/etc that I spent many years on and evoked the response "I'm in pain but I don't care about that or anything else besides ice cream," my response to dronabinol was more "yeah, I'm in pain, but why not go for a walk or paint or do something to take the mind off the pain." Much more consistant effects and much more reliable agency over the effect than with medical marijuana...and much cheaper, safer, and more legal (at the federal level), especially if, like me, you find smoking a medicine somewhat counterproductive and slightly insane. Tolerance does build over time, and doctors who are comfortable prescribing it (there is a stubborn reluctance, even among doctors who dispense morphine scripts as if they were napkins) tend to get uneasy about exceeding the recommended antiemetic dosage of 20mg/day. Actual tolerance is difficult to assess because potency degrades quickly, even if refrigerated and protected from light (as much as is possible), so that a 10mg pill is roughly equivalent to a 2.5mg pill by the last day of a 30 day script. The spherical gel caps are superior to the oblong, made by a different generic manufacturer (as the spheres are actually made by the same facility that produced the brand name for Watson Labs). Much less sedating, cheaper	M	35	2  years5-10 4X D	1/23/2012
4	Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome	Sleepiness, a little bit high.	Was prescribed 13 different antiemetics before this, and they all had terrible side effects, and wore off over time. Marinol works about 50% of the time for me, but it still more effective than everything else I have taken.	F	27	8  months5 1X AN	1/12/2012
3	to gain weight	Very Tired, Laughter, Outer body experience, VERY VERY HUNGRY, sometimes have awful thoughts...	I gained 15 pounds in 15 days, I wouldn't and couldn't stop eating.  But it would always take almost 4 hours to work...	F	28	5  years5mg 2X D	4/10/2011Email
5	ADHD, Depression	Very much like the real thing without the smoke.  If you've ever eaten pot brownies it's not unlike that.  Only bad side effect is bit of crash after wears off.  Feel more tired than usual.  Also unwanted weight gain for those of us not looking to bulk up.  Would not recommend it to people who don't like the feeling of being "enhanced."  (esp those who hate pot, obviously)	This scrip has enabled me to get off dexedrine, prozac, and ativan.  It energizes me and allows me to move from that dark place to focus on what I need to do, and with a level of enthusiasm I have a hard time accessing otherwise.	F	45	2  years5 mg 2X D	3/10/2011
2	to open up appetite	extremely paranoid, out of body experience, fear of dying, high anxiety	This was recently prescribed to my sister.  She is on Ativan now.	F	47	6  days5 mg 2X D	2/26/2011Email
4	Chonic Nausea / adominal pain	Only side effects I have noticed is the hunger you get which I have not felt in many years. Memory loss is the same as with Promethazine.	Doctors prescribed this to get me off the promethazine 25MG that I take 4 to 6 times a day. Marinol 10MG isn't as good as Promethazine, but it does work and isn't dangerous to take like longterm use of Promethazine. Still to early to tell if this is my savior, but I will update when more time goes by. I would definitely suggest its use to other people suffering from chronic nausea.	M	41	3  weeks10 MG 3X D	1/24/2011Email
5	Adult ADD	The therapeutic window was kind of short... it would be good if there was an extended release version.  Very little negative side effects.  None worth mentioning.   It is hard to obtain and expensive because the insurance companies and doctors don't support it yet.	Doctors are terrified to prescribe even though its less controlled and less addictive than many other ADD meds (Ritalin).  Here are the results: Focuses the mind by reducing stress, relaxing the breath. Raises awareness and helps to work smart by prioritizing. Helps to focus on doing one thing at a time. A feeling that its healthy and sustainable, little negative side effects. Better mindset for communicating with people. Feeling of being a human being instead of a robot. Improved mood and interest in life. Non-stimulant awakeness. No racing heart beat.  The coming down side of the curve is not dramatic. This medicine is very subtle, can be used on the weekends or after work when you don't want stimulants but want to be awake and able to think.	M	33	30  days2.5mg 3X D	10/27/2010Email
4	appetite stimulant and anti-nausea	slight mood elevation	Taken by my son during chemotherapy to treat a blood cancer (Hodgkin's Lymphoma). Cyproheptadine was initially prescribed but failed to stimulate appetite and gave him stomach cramps. He dropped from 134 lbs to 113 before getting RX for Marinol. His appetite improved immediately and he has been steadily gaining weight.  He has never smoked the real deal. I like the control over dosing with Marinol vs. inhaling varying amounts. It requires refrigeration which is not always convenient and difficult to secure from my older teenager's friends.	M	14	2  months2.5 mg 2X D	4/26/2010
5	Chemo nausea	Works almost as good as pot to alleviate severe nausea. Gives a burned out crashing feeling after several consecutive doses.		M	46	2  weeks2.5 1X AN	4/10/2010
4	Anorexia (NOT "nervosa")	Like with "real deal", I get high, paranoid, anxious...but HUNGRY (which is why I take it).	I started at a dose of about 5mg, then slowly upped it to my current 40mg (which seems pretty high, compared to others) as I developed a tolerance.  I take this (almost) daily, in the evening, when I won't have to drive...or function much.  When I get "'plexed" (as in "having a complex"), I just take a breath and wait for it to pass.  Won't answer the phone high, though, no matter what :)	F	41	1  years40 mg 1X D	3/28/2010
5	Back Pain	happyness, from both the pain relief and the up lifting effect the drug has.  Better eye sight. I went from 20/20 to 20/10 at 37 years old and my family has a history of eye problems short term memory loss	I was badly injured at my job.  It took me a year and a half to walk normaly again and have 24hour pain now 10 years after the accident.  I did not take any perscriptions for my pain for almost 6 years.  I recently (3 years ago) started back on opiods and was given Marinol several months later to counter act the side effects.  I stopped taking the opiods and just kept taking the Marinol.  At 2.5mg I could drive and funtion quite normaly it would lower my daily pain (2 to 5) 2 points, from 2 to 0 or from a 5 to a 3.  When my pain was up around a 7 a 10mg Marinol would lower it to a 2 but I would not drive on a 10mg dose.  I believe that this should be next to asprin at the super market.  I see a very low chance of abuse (as do most experts) and its only because of this drugs heritage that it is not freely avalable as other perscriptions that are now over the counter.

5	many broken vertebra/nerve pain	none	Was great, relieved pain, relieved depression/anxiety, relieved nausea/intestinal pain from that other drugs had given, could sleep, gave me back my appetite, easy to go off with no negatives unlike oxycodone or tramadol (both opiates) did not feel addicted at all.	F	57	3  months	2/17/2009
5	Pain	Happy,  lack of pain!	Had self medicated (Pain) for years with nothing but smoking or vapeing green bud. Once I finally went to a pain doctor and in redding the small print in the pain program agreement found that I couldn't self medicate any longer: it would be evident in a random urine screen and I would be kicked out of the program. I stuck with the program through about 25 different combinations and landed on Roxycodone and Methadone along with as-much acetaminophen and naproxen as my liver could  take  This worked  / works for the most part  I worry about my long term exposure too acetaminophen and naproxen, in everything I have read, long term (3+ ) years or more experientially raises my chances of dieing of a  hart attack or  liver poisoning.In discussing my findings with my doctor we decided that Marinol would be a good choice to try. I have been on Marinol now for about 8 months and have reduced my usage of Narcotics, Methadone, and the other garbage, as anyone knows who has been on opiates; an	M	35	8  months	1/15/2009Email
5	Severe chronic neuropathic pain	No apparent side effects	Marinol provides me with significant pain relief. Taken in conjunction with 400mg. Lyrica daily, I'm feeling much better than I was when taking Morphine and it's deritives.	M	58	2  days	12/9/2008
3	crohn's disease	tired	I lost 20lbs in 14 days at the hospital. Needed for appetite stimulation.	M	27	2  months	9/24/2008
5	chemo		it's very pretty - like a little orb and who wouldn't want to swallow a pretty little orb?  i was baked out of my mind for almost 8 hours - but a good baked.  better that the real thing because a) no coughing  b) no one knows that you've taken it because there is no obvious pot smell 3) lasts a very looooooong time and 4) i can't remember the 4th point i was going to make...  i only took 2 doses of this during 18 weeks of chemo and now just have it in case i want to take it for fun!	F	42	2  days	7/8/2007
5	early on set Dystonia	none	I love feeling relaxed because Dystonia keeps my muscles all in knots.   before I started Marinol I was in extreme pain from my muscles being in continuous motion and it is like my body could never relax.  My muscles would tighten up on me to the point of a full body charley horse.  The benefits out weigh any feeling of being high at I may experience. Medicaid even covers my monthly prescription.	M	35	4  years	10/30/2006Email
5	tourretts,nausea,vomiting,pain etc.	pretty high after gradual onset of 4 hours.came back doun and did great.leveled out.	I like the fact that it came on slowly so I was very comfortable,stopped all pain and nausea more than fentanyl and I didn't have to smoke it,so I didnt burn my lungs and can take it anywhere in my wallet. Works as good as pot.more legal because it a prescription.	M	45	1  days	9/5/2006Email
5	ADHD	Euphoria, lots of laughter, light hallucinations, both audible and visual, Very much like being baked out of your mind.	When i started with 5mg Marinal, It had the relaxing effect of one hit., this is most likely what my doctor intended. I however, requested it to be upped to 10mg, which is what I take now, because I prefer to do so once a day at night. This causes severe personalization. (If you are watching TV, it gives you the feeling of being in the situation), occaisionaly some mild hallucinations, but a generally good time. On several occaisions, if I do not go to bed within a few hours, a SEVERE state of paranoia occurs. The feeling of sensing other people that aren't there. This however, is rare.

4	Multiple Sclerosis	Gives me more inner drive and mental energy.  Relieves depression and most pain.		F	55	6  months	4/24/2006
1	nausea due to chemo treatments	panic, feeling of time warp, depersonalization, I didn't know who I was, if I was speaking, where I was. I thought I was going to die.  I ended up in my bed and I don't know how I got there.	Would never take this again.	F	53	1  times	11/10/2005
4	chronic pain/SCI			M	48	5  weeks	10/17/2005
1	HIV/lack of appetite	extreme nausea and vomiting and apathy.	It and the real deal makes me extremely sick at my stomach.  I have never had anything to make me as sick. It also makes me not care about anything.  I didn't care about taking my medications.  Someone had to watch me and make sure that I took them.  I let all my work, housework, bill paying etc. just go.  I couldn't finish anything that I had started.  So, I had to get off of it as it would have ruined my life.	M	41	2  months	8/31/2005
5	Crohns Disease	NONE.	Used this to justify the Cannabis which shows up in my urine tests.  I take morphine sulfate, and use Cannabis for nausea and pain.  My doc. does drug test to ensure I am using the morphine.  Cannabis shows up every time, but doc. understands why, and has no problem with me using real deal.  Just So Doc. not get in problems with DEA.... Doc scripted this so that it would justify the Cannabis Showing up, as cannabis is not legal in my state yet.... BOO-HOO.  Would be cool though if it was covered under my prescription insurance, or could get at pharmacy. Smoke the real thing if you can get it.  Lungs are side effect of smoking, but it does wonders for us chronic nausea suffers, and acute pain fighters.  I am able to even put on a few pound from eating much more as a result, when/if I have some.  Too bad we have to take a real trip to like another country that is, just to be legal in using it.  Good idea though, just watch out for the dogs on the way back, if you light up before you get on the plane home.  Not implying in any way to attempt to bring this back to U.S., only saying if you smoke one before you get on the plane, the drug dogs will be all over you.  Don't have to smoke either, can be baked into foods, or if you really into it, can eat it right off the stem....

5	Depression.	Euphoria and energy with a goofy feeling.	It's been a life saver in treating my depression I've tried other treatments in the past, but this is the only one thats worked. I take 10mg.s of marinol five times a day.	M	48	3  years	11/13/2004
5	Nasea, Rating on some ones behalf.	Extream vertigo, Euphoria, Prolonged laughter, Enjoyable visual and aditory hallucinations, The feeling of flying threw outer space, after sounds. < But all the side effect were fun thats the weird thing.	Very odd medicine. Nasea/vomiting was virtually eliminated, but a state of vertigo/floating set in wile it had an antinaseating effect.	M	23	4  months	11/7/2004
3	migraine related nausea	Mostly being tired.	Marinol took over 1 hour to work after each dose.  Also, I constantly felt tired.  Otherwise, not a bad alternative to Compazine.	M	34	5  days	9/17/2004
4	bad pains	none		M	44	 	2/23/2004
