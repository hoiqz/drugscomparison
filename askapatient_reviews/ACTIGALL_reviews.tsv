5	cirrhosis of the liver	none noticed	When I first found out I had cirrhosis my doctors were pretty sure I would need a transplant. They decided to up my dosage and since then the swelling went down and there has been no additional scarring on my liver. I should probably say that I am helping the cause of it remaining healthy because I do not drink nor have I even tasted alcohol.	F	19	4  years500 MG 2X D	4/18/2010
3	Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis	Severe fatigue at 9 pills per day.	For a drug known for its lack of side effects, be careful at higher doses.  I had been taking six per day for about six years and never realized how lethargic it was making me feel.  When the Dr. increased the dosage to nine per day, I could barely function.  Without it, my liver enzymes go off the chart, so for now I take four per day which is tolerable.	M	36	6  years	8/8/2007Email
