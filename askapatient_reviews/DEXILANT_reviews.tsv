3	GERD	It is the first medicine that has helped my GERD but the side effects are not worth it. Been battling recurring yeast infections mouth, vaginal, and skin for almost two months. Stopped taking Dexilant and yeast seemed to get better but GERD returned so started taking Dexilant again. Within two days of being back on the medicine side effects started retuning. Trying probiotic now and yogurt but not sure which is worst. GERD or the yeast.		F	43	90  days60mg 1X D	3/18/2013Email
4	Acid reflux / hiatel hernia	Hives and rash	I first took dexilant as a sample from my gastro. Worked wonderful. Then got a refill and two days later broke out in a rash/ hives that was like having poison ivy all over my body. I did not know that it was the dexilant at the time that caused my hives because I had taken the samples with no side effects. I suffered with this hives, rash for 5 months. I was going to the dermatologist weekly trying to find the problem, then I stopped taking all medicines, changed foods , drinks, washing powders, soap etc trying to figure out what I was allergic to. I finally thought I had it figured out and decided it was a natural drink I was drinking that had vitamins in it. I Had to take a dose of prednisone to get rid of hives after suffering for so long. I Have not taken dexilant since until last week when I had acid reflux so bad I couldn't suffer any longer si i took one pill on tuesday and on wednesday I had hives so bad all over again. Now I know after all this time that it was the dexilant that caused the hives. I still have them and it has been one week, one pill was all it took! This is a scary side effect.

5	acid reflux, hiatal hernia	no side effects. works great!		F	57	12  months60mg 1X D	1/1/2013Email
4	GERD, breathlessness	The only side effect I have has is urgent diarrhea.  I haven't had a solid bowel movement since talking this..but it's better than having such difficulty breathing that I had to take time off from work!	I am taking Dexilant for bubbles in my esophagus that led to pant-like breathlessness and discomfort when lying down.. I had an upper endoscopic procedure that showed spasms in my lower esophagus. They expanded my lower esophagus and I can take a good deep breath now!  My insurance comp. wanted me to try a lower priced med named Pantoprazole but looking at this site about that medicine, I'm petrified to try it...I'm hoping that in a few months I can wean off of Dexilent. But it is an excellent medicine!	F	42	40  days60 1X D	7/30/2012Email
1	Gastritis from H. Pylori	Dexilant was having tremors, muscle spasms, tingling in leg, major anxiety and depression.	It works, but has way too many side effects. I've tried all PPI's and don't know what to do to cure the gastritis.	M	28	3  weeks60MG 1X D	4/17/2012Email
1	Acid reflux, breathing issues	Horrible hip joint pain; couldn't lift leg	Techincally, this was for Dexilant (same drug).  Other family members had complained of leg pain with PPIs, but I dismissed it--until I found out first hand.	M	51	8  days30 mg 1X D	4/11/2012Email
5	Hiatal hernia, acid reflux		Kapidex, now known as Dexilant, is the BEST medicine I have ever taken for my hiatal hernia and acid reflux. My gastroenterologist put me on every medicine and finally decided to try this new one. It's amazing, and keeps all my symptoms away (which were so severe that I lost 10 lbs and couldn't function). I was so happy to have found this pill. My insurance company put up quite a fight and did not want to pay for it and made me try all other pills--which failed. Finally got approved for it. I have not had any side effects. It has only helped and cured my symptoms--not created others.	F	22	2  years60 MG 2X D	1/14/2012Email
2	esophagitis from GERD	itching, tingling, feeling like something is crawling on me, pins & needles sensation when I get hot and/or exercise	This is the same med as Dexilant (dexlansoprazole).  After taking Dexilant successfully for months, it has suddenly caused me to have itching, crawling feelings, tingling, and when I get hot or exercise I have a stinging like pins and needles on chest, abdomen and back.  I have been trying to stop this reaction with benedryl but that's not working.	M	60	8  months60 1X D	1/10/2012
3	GERD, esophagitis	Sore throat, dizziness, nausea, severe intense itching in ear, sinus pressure and pain.	I couldn't tolerate Nexiums side effects unless I wanted to wear Depends, and while Dexilant gives me some relief from the constant diarrhea, the sore throat and ear itch are just as bothersome and painful.	F	45	2  months30 1X D	12/31/2011Email
4	GERD/Esophagitus	none	Taking as alternative to Reglan which caused depression and anxiety. Kapidex (now known as Dexilant) has worked well. I have few symptoms of GERD, only when I overeat or eat stuff I shouldn't, and I believe my esophagus is actually healing. Works far better than Nexium or anything else I've tried.	M	61	2  years60 MG 1X D	9/6/2011Email
4	Gastritis	When exposed to the sun, horrible rash on face and arms. Two courses of steroids and multiple Benadryl later, finally stopped.	I am on many meds and allergic to many additives in shampoos and lotions so this took a lot of effort to figure out. Haven't been able to find any info on this reaction, so I am perplexed. On another note, the drug really helped my gastritis. Going off of it was difficult. Trying Nexium now.	F	41	7  weeks60 my 1X D	7/2/2011Email
2	GERD	The first month and a week it was terrific.  Then, WHAMMO!  Unbelievable diarrhea.  I am talking about biblical diarrhea...the pharoah was given this by Moses.  I went 4 weeks with diarrhea, lost 15 pounds, ate like a horse only to sprint to the bathroom about every hour and a half.  After I stopped taking it for about two days, my stool began to get a little back to normal but then I got a sore throat that has since moved into my lungs.  I have NEVER missed a day of work in my 20 year professional career until taking this (Dexilant)	After I stopped taking it, bowels were back to normal in a week BUT, the upper respitory infection I have now is spectacular...again, I never get sick.

4	Severe Acid Reflux	The first month and a half was great. Acid Reflux took about 3-4 weeks to get under control. Then about 4 weeks ago; I realized that even with sleep meds, I had an awful problem sleeping, tossing and turning for atleast an hour each and almost every night for the past month. I take this med at night with my sleep meds. I think it finally caught up with me. I no longer sleep blissfully and peacefully. I will try and take this kapidex (dexilant) in the morning instead of at night and see if I can sleep any better.	It has helped my severe acid reflux......I'd say it's like 80% better and it's worth a try. If you can't sleep after taking it, however; consult your physician. I am having a chat with mine this week to see if another anti-reflux medication can be taken in it's place and not cause such horrible side affects as not being able to fall asleep in a few mins.....and also walking up sometimes in the middle of the night and it's hard to get back to sleep.

5	Gerd/ Acid-reflux	Very mild SE's  Some dizzyness, occassional head pain, loose stools and cramping or constipation both mild. A little insomnia.	This is a great medicine with minimal side effects, thus far after a year. They are more annoying than anything. This keeps away the burn for several days after a dose and knocks out acute attacks well. I still take an occasional Tums, but I have been on all OTC medicines and Aciphex, and this is the best and most effective. Take this in the morning with food for best results and to avoid sleeplessness.	M	34	1  years60mg 1X AN	4/23/2011
3	GERD/LPR	muscle twitching/spasm in arm	It worked, but I had muscle spasms in my arm.	M	31	7  days40 MG 1X D	12/9/2010
2	GERD	nausea, chest pain,very bad constipation after taking it for 6 mos; the depression is also very bad.	The side effects were minimal for the first 6 mos or so, then they got very bad. The constipation is the worst as is the nausea. It's to the point now where I need to stop taking it. The drug is OK, but not worth the side effects when you cannot eat because of the nausea. The constiptation is also awful. The worst side effects is the depression. I recommend finding a new drug as this one is simply not worth it. At first there were no side effects, but they slowly got very bad. Trust me and avoid this drug and find one you can stay with in the long run. I'm going back to something like Nexium if that will work.	M	45	1.5  years 1X D	12/9/2010
5	Anastomotic Ulcer	ZERO	KAPIDEX (Now known as Dexilant) has been a wonder drug for me.  Nothing worked for me.  I had horrible GERD, especially during the night, where I would wake during the night with a mouth full of acid, horrible stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, etc.  I had lost approximately 30 pounds due to this ulcer.  The Dexilant is now working and I am doing much better!  I had tried every other medication on the market for Ulcers and GERD and none of them worked!  Thank Goodness this medication is on the market!!!	F	44	3  months120mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	GERD, chest pains, heartburn	Slight loose stools and slight dry mouth	Side effects are very mild, but well worth taking because it's helped improve my GERD symptoms immensely! I've heard many other people say this too.I'm going to switch to 30mg and see if it will eradicate the side effects which are mild anyway. I also have tried Prilosec and Prevacid OTC and had strong, unpleasant side effects. I highly recommend Dexilant (formerly Kapidex), though it is expensive, it is a quality drug.I'm guessing that not many people have posted on here because of the lack of side effects!!! Makes sense right? ;)	M	24	6  weeks60mg 1X D	10/29/2010Email
5	acid reflux	none	Name has changed to dexilant. I love this med, I have tried many, this is the best!!!	F	43	6  months60 1X D	9/28/2010
4	gerd	none	taking for 1 month for acid reflex and throat pain.acid reflex gone still some throat pain.	M	39	1  months30 1X D	8/24/2010
1	Possible IBS	The first four weeks were OK, then it started getting worse: bloating, dry mouth/tongue, mouth blisters, severe depression, inability to sleep, heart racing, constipation.	Very bad side effects.	M	35	3  months1 x 60 MG 1X D	7/24/2010
1	GERD	Severe bloating, gas, abdominal pressure, abdominal pain, feeling of fullness when eating just a little.		M	31	3  months30 MG 1X D	4/27/2010
