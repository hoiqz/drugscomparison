5	heroin addiction	Great drug. And don't be so silly! do your research. YOU DONT HAVE TO STAY ON IT FOREVER. I was seriously opiate addicted, went from heroin and had to go on methadone. I tapered off and I am still here 12 years later not addicted to anything. I have never needed to take an opiate since. THe withdrawal can be HELL but don't fool yourself, you can get off it!!!!

3	BACK PAIN and NEUROPATHY	Hello EVERYONE !!  If at all possible do NOT start taking Methadone UNLESS your PAIN is Completely UNBEARABLE ,, BECAUSE you will become an ADICT of this Drug and as far as I know you will NEVER be able to get Off of Methadone Unless you DIE !!	As far as I can remember I have been taking Methadone for 8 or 9 years for my Back and Body Pains and Neuropathy from Diabetes .But !! I wish to GOD  that I would NEVER started taking Methadone BECAUSE  I can NOT Quit !  If I do NOT take a 10MG pill for more than 12 hours I start getting Withdrawal Symptoms that get worse every hour after the first 12 hours .  I started taking Methadone to get OFF of Vicodin and my Doctor NEVER told me that Methadone would become WORSE than Vicodin .Doctors are such LIARS !! Now I am age 62 with type 2 Diabetes and weigh about 340 lbs. and also have Neuropathy in my feet , Legs and Left Arm amd Hand .And worst of All I'm on SSI and have NO Job and NO $$$ ,, so I guess I will DIE using Methadone fot the Rest of my Life .No Sex Drive , you Gain weight , and Sweat after taking the pills , andalso have sever Cramps when getting out of Bed and Sometime you become very Constipatedand need to use water enemas and Pills to force you to be able to SHIT .  Also affects your MEMORY and could possibly lead to Alzhimers I think because I can not remember more than 1 or 2 days ago  hardly most of the time .My biggest HELP  is that I sleep with my PC 24-7 and Browse the Net every DAM  day just to try to keep from going CRAZY !!I'm just passing time waiting to DIE !!  or if I'm very Luck MAYBE  someone will Invent a PILL or something to get me OFF of Methadone forever .I'm LUCKY because I usually only take 2 10MG Pills each Day	M	62	9  years	5/4/2009Email

4	Arachnoiditis	At first, nauasa and fatigue.	Methadone has given me a life. I don't have my old life back but at least I'm able to work full time, take care of my house and two dogs.	F	42	5  years	1/19/2005
4	Back Pain/Opiate Dependence	Daytime drowsiness, fatigue, loss of sex-drive, dry-mouth, mild insomnia at night, nausea, and visual disturbances	I am on 60mg per day. At first they gave it to me all at once, but I was getting too tired during the day. Now I take 20mg 3x a day. Good drug for someone in my situation (pain and history of opiate abuse.) This is the first opiate I can take without taking more than I need. I get very little euphoria and if I take more than I am prescribed, I just get very tired. It does a good job with my back pain as well. For the first time, my prescription lasts me the whole month. That is unbelievable for someone like myself who loves opiates so much.
