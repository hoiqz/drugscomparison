1	Chest infection	Severe chronic stomach pains, nausea and sickness. Pain lasted for 18 hours after the last pill. Was so severe, we were close to calling an ambulance. I wasn't advised by my doctor that this drug had such severe side effects. IF PRESCRIBED THIS DRUG - ask for a second opinion as there are alternatives available. Was prescribed Clarithromycin 250mg tablets which did the job without the side effects.		M	68	7  days 4X D	12/8/2012Email

1	Sinus Infection	Extreme nausea, very tired and weak, abdominal pains, vomiting, headaches, bloating....	This medicine did help with my sinus infection (within a few hours) however, I don't think the side effects I experienced are worth it. I have had extreme nausea and have been vomiting since I started it. I would definitely ask for an alternative if you can. This is my 4th day taking it and am considering stopping because the side effects are too much to deal with.	F	30	 	2/2/2010
4	infected parotid gland	I have Sjogrens Syndrome and get infected salivery glands due to lack of saliva.  I have had Erythromycin before (I'm allergic to Penicillin)and it has never bothered me.  This time felt ill, terrible diarrhoea.	Thought the pills looked different from previously.  Anyone know if the drug company has been tinkering with them? It did cure the infection but didn't care for the reaction to it	F	80	5  days	1/19/2010Email
1	dental infection	complete muscle weakness starting in arms and legs, spreading to rest of body. Trouble breathing, slurred speech. Loss of hearing, blurred vision. Felt completely spaced out.	My side-effects are listed as 'myasthenia type symptoms' in the drug info but my GP said i was his first patient in 22 years that has suffered from them. After checking on various forums it seems they are actually quite common. They are very scary, very real and i ended up in hospital. Please be very wary of this commonly prescribed, cheap medicine.

1	Pityriasis Rosea	stomach ache, nausea, diahria sometimes worse than others, I wanted to go home from work, I hate this medicine and it was only the second pill I took	My overall quality of life went down after one day	F	25	2  days	3/12/2009
1	Sinus infection, Dentist	Severe nausea and tiredness and weakness.	This medication causes severe nausea really bad and vomiting at times.  Not sure if it's a side effect or an allergic reaction.	F		7  days	2/17/2009
3	sinus infection	lots of gas...man gas you cant hold in...headache...stomach pains, bloated look like im pregnant, cold sweats..oh yeah and i pooped like 5 or more times a day....		F	26	14  days	12/1/2008
4	Bronchitis	The first few days made my chest feel even tighter than it had before I started talking the medication. Also I had a lot of stomach cramping but by the fourth day the symptoms disappeared. My illness went away quickly however the whole time my appetite grew making me feel hungry 24 hours a day. I ate so much, but thankfully I didn't gain any weight.	Drug works but the side effects aren't really worth it. It is a cheap drug and you can certainly tell. There are better drugs for Bronchitis ie: Azrithomycin which I would recommend.		20	10  days	6/18/2008
4	gum infection	Extreme tireness, as well as nausea and constantly feeling hungry.	Contrary to reports that this drug causes depression, I actually felt happier than usual. :-O	F	36	5  days	3/11/2008
