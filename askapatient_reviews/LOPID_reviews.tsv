1	high triglycerides	Severe pain in all joints, muscle pain generalized, tingling in ankles.	Just two days of this drug and I can barely walk! Won't be taking any more. Wish I knew a quick way of eliminating this from my system!	F	51	2  days600mg 2X D	4/21/2012Email
4	Hyperlipidemia	None	Taking Generic brand by Teva. Has lowered my triglyserids from 550 to 108.	M	43	6  months20mg 2X D	9/20/2011Email
2	high trigs	fatigue, depression, irritability, trouble sleeping, HIGHER trigs than before taking the meds!	Doctor put me on gemfibrozil to lower my Triglycerides and raise my HDLs, however after 5 months on the drug, my Triglycerides are now almost double what they were before and my HDLs have not increased.  This drug has done more damage than good!	M	36	5  months600mg 1X D	3/3/2011Email
5	Very high TGs (several thousand)	None that I can attribute directly to lopid. I do get some foot cramps (but I am type II diabetic) and I can control them by keeping feet warm and eating bananas. I did have two frozen shoulders, but I am taking many oral meds so who knows what caused them.	I'm satisfied. My TG went down from 2300? to 215. While I do find sites like this useful, bear in mind that it's generally the people who have problems who post. I found this site as I wanted to see if anyone had advice about controlling TG *and* HDL/LDL (which usually means a statin) and lopid, which is a *dangerous* combination.	M	51	15  years	11/3/2009
1	Cholesterol total was 231	Muscle aches in arms and back, blurred vision	Had taken Lipitor years ago and had to stop due to muscle pains.  Two months after starting Lopid, I have muscle pains mostly in my arms, shoulders and back, but the blurred vision scared me  due to previous surgery in that eye.  My eye doctor found nothing wrong and thought it could possibly be a sinus infection. (but I didn't have the usual sinus infection symptoms).   Unsure if antibiotic worked, as took full length of 10 days before blurred vision stopped, but now it returns off and on and only in one eye.   I'm going to stop Lopid for a while and then try again, and if same problems occur, I'll know it's the Lopid.  My total cholesterol was 231 (HDL 44 and LDL 154).	F	69	2  months	7/13/2009
4	High tri's	Some heartburn and appear to be more tired than usual.	I am taking one 600mg tablet a day.  Also 3 fish oils per day.  I have an underactive thyroid and take meds for that as well. This medication in conjuction w/ fish oil ( which i took alone for 3 months and lowered tri's from 992 to 512 ) has now lowered my tri's to around 200.  I think continuing with fish oil and lopid and continuing to exercise and lose some weight will get me where I need to be.	F	45	6  months	5/27/2009
1	High triglycerides	Wild, vivid dreams and joint pain	I couldn't figure out why I was suddenly having wild, vivid dreams so I tried to figure out what was different.  I had started taking Lopid three days earlier.  I stopped the med and the dreams stopped.  I waited two weeks and started taking Lopid again and after two days the dreams are back, so the med is going away forever.  I am exhausted every morning from the dreams.	F	52	3  days	7/16/2008
1	High TG's >900	Immediate flu-like symptoms, chest infection, runny nose, sore throat, zero sex drive, depression, homicidal/suicidal thoughts, irritability, urinary problems, gas, weakness, and fatigue.	My side effects were listed as happening in 2% of people in Lopid studies. My reaction onset quickly (within 3 days), and after quitting gemfibrozil/Lopid, I started feeling better within days. I was re-prescribed Tricor, which is in the same class as Lopid. I had similar effects with it. So this family of drugs didn't work for me. I was given 1200mg (2x 600mg tabs) Lopid per day. I was only taking over the counter Claritin for allergies while on Lopid.	M	27	9  days	6/23/2008
5	High Triglycerides	At first a little nausea; otherwise, no side effects	As far as I know it has dropped my Triglycerides significantly (according to Doc). They were over 1700. I go back for another check up soon, so I will see exactly how far they have droppped.	F	37	2  months	3/19/2008
1	triglycerides over 2000	rectal bleeding, bloody nose, abdominal cramps, extremely tired, soft stool, rushing after eating, headache, gas, some diahreah.	Just hated everything this medication did to me and how It made me feel. My system just hated it from day one.	M	34	4  days	1/26/2008
1	Familial Hyperlipidemia	Showed no side effects until my first gall bladder "attack".  Eventually had to have it removed.  Weeks after the surgery a new doctor told me it was probably due to the Lopid and put me on Lipitor.	Did work to lower my triglycerides and cholesterol.  I was just one that could not tolerate it.(Taken 1991 - 1994).	M	53	3  years	10/17/2007
4	high trigclerides	None	Lowered my Tri's from 750 down to 120	M	51	3  years	7/30/2007Email

5	High Triglycerides	Muscle aches	Triglycerides went from 798 to 54 in two months time.  Also diagnosed with Type II diabetes and drastically changed diet with a rigorous exercise program	F	44	5  months	11/20/2006
1	High triglycerides	Headache, cramps in my feet and muscle aches in my legs.	I was told this would not harm me like Lipitor did since I was no longer taking a statin drug.  It seems to be once you have taken a statin and experienced damage from that other meds will do the same thing to our bodies.	F	49	7  days	8/31/2006Email
3	triglycerides between 400 and 650	extremely tired, once I had abdominal discomfort	In 30 days, reduced trigycerides (a several year problem ignored by previous doctors at my HMO) from 413 to 85.  Increased HDL from 49 to 67.  BUT...I simultaneously changed my diet from sugar, sugar, and more sugar and high carbs (grains including bread, noodles, rice, etc.) to a diet where I tried to eliminate ALL sugar and eat carbs very sparingly....AND I started taking a fish oil supplement AND I bought motion control sneakers to start walking every day.  Don't know what was the Lopid and what was the diet and fish oil and exercise but the doctor says it was the Lopid.	F	81	30  days	8/17/2006
1	High triglycerides	Severe muscle cramps!  Shortness of breath.	I have controlled triglycerides before  with diet and exercise.  Knee surgery interferred.  I will stop pills and get back to diet and exercise.	F	60	1  years	7/26/2006
4	High Cholesterol	I had gotten a rash from this medicine, I was itching constantly!	I will never take this med again.	M	27	3  months	6/26/2006
3	High Cholesterol	None	Although I never had any side effects, after taking it for eight weeks my cholestrol went up from 227 to 249. Trigs were lower but not as low as tricor. Now on Vytorin, have to see how that works out. 	M	43	60  days	6/22/2006
1	cholesterol and triglycerides	it made both my cholesterol and triglycerides go higher than they had been before I took any medication	I'll never take it again	F	22	1  months	2/5/2006
1	High cholesterol, triglicerides	All the symptoms of drug induced lupus: joint and muscle pain (neck, back, knees, feet, hands, hips), sleeplessness(had to sleep sitting up because of the pain), depression, curled up fingers on both hands, trouble walking, zipping my coat, got worse as the day progressed, severe fatigue, pains internally on right side...felt like I was 90...doctor talked about steroids...Saw article about lopid effects and decided on my own to stop taking it and see what happens...all symptoms stopped within 2 weeks of discontinuing lopid.....Doctor insisted lopid was not the problem. I changed doctors. New doctor wasn't convinced- tried me on it again a year later as "an experiment".....symtoms started mildly within 2 weeks....stopped taking it immediately and will never take again!!!!! Proof!!!!		F	50	1  years	10/19/2005
3	triglycerides over 1000	headache, nausea, blured vision, red eyes	I was feeling okay until I started taking this stuff.  I hope these side effects quit soon!	M	53	2  days	9/30/2005Email
3	high triglycerides	Lowered triglycerides from 400 to 220 but experienced musclepains in lower back and had leg cramps.  I would recommend watching out for side effects as soon as drug is started.		F	69	5  months	3/28/2005
4	CHF & COPD	None		M	70	3  months	3/21/2005
5	High Lipids	Actually, none.  This med helped to drop my Tri's from 1620 to 200 over a period of time.  I cannot tolerate any type of Statin drug so this (or Niacin) was my choice.		F	66	4  years	2/14/2005
3	High triglycerides	lightheadedness; muscle aches	Lowered triglyceride level from 1386 to 220...but I don't feel quite right.	M	46	16  months	1/12/2005
