3	type II diabetic	Currently take 2.5mgs before 1st meal and 2.5mgs before bedtime. Medicine makes me feel shakey somtimes.  Other than that I tolerate it pretty well.		F	58	3  years	9/20/2007
4	Diabetes	None that I know of.	It definitely worked.  Within 3 hours of taking the first dose my blood sugar dropped to the lowest I'd seen since I was diagnosed.  Unfortunately it was way too low and my doctor halved the dose.  Since then it seems to be helping.  I'm not sure if I will keep using it as I'm a little wary of the interaction with metformin and the fact that it is essentially whipping my body to produce insulin.	M	27	6  weeks	6/5/2007
2	type 2 diabetes	I didn't know I had any side effects until I quit all the other meds (metformin, then Actos) to prepare for injecting insulin. Then, when my blood sugar was high, I'd take a glyburide. I felt really fatigued, grumpy and a little nauseous. This happened every time I took the stuff.	It's clear the side effects pile up on each other. Metformin made me feel terrible and I didn't know what caused it for many months. I gain 40 lbs on Actos, suddenly developed low thyroid and high cholesterol. My doc started me on Lipitor for the cholesterol problem and that gave me numb legs and terribly swollen feet. So I've ditched them all and will see which ones I really need when I'm on insulin.	F	60	10  years	11/19/2005Email
