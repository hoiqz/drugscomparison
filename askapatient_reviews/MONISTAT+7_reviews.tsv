3	Yeast infection	I tried this medicine for the first time last night and had so just discomfort in the first 10 minutes. The itching and burning was so awful I ran to the bathroom to get it out. I'm hesitant to keep using it but will try again tonight.		F	19	7  days	5/12/2013
5	Vaginal Yeast Infection	I developed a yeast infection after taking metronidazole for a bacterial vaginitis.. My doctor prescribed diflucan but the yeast infection did not go away. Monistat 7 completely got rid of my yeast infection. It did leak out during the day and during those times is when I experienced some slight burning and discomfort.  Once I wiped away what leaked out I felt better. The leaking stopped completely by the second day after my final treatment. I have tried monistat 1 before...that burns like FIRE and didn't get rid of the yeast infection. It actually made it worse!!  Monistat 7 is the way to go...it may be a little messy and it takes a whole week but it is well worth it!!!		F	34	7  days100MG	4/30/2013
4	Very bad yeast infection	First of all,last night was my first application with monistat 7,and Lord have mercy,my tears literally came out.It was burning and itching like worst more than the infection itself.But ladies I have to say,that it was well worth it,cause all day today I was already feeling much better and I will continue with treatment.		F	35	2  days7 days	4/13/2013
5	yeast infection	Monistat 7 is an amazing over the counter product. I've only used it for 5 days and I seriously feel like the old me. It was uncomfortable at first, and hated the fact it was very messy ( wear a pad ). But other than that, nothing else. Go for it.		F	17	5  days	3/28/2013
3	I'm a diabetic so I get YI ALOT!!	Not even 2 minutes after putting it in I experienced the worse itch ever worse than the infection itself!! But I'm gonna keep trying it. I tried prescribed terconazole3 day suppositorys and it didn't help at all so I switched to Monistat 7. 20-30 mins after putting the cream in I felt some relief by applying a ice pack. The itch was so bad I was pacing the floor and crying! So yea from the pacing I pushed all the cream out.		F	16	1  days	3/27/2013Email
4	yeast infection due to antibiotics	So I started to use this stuff an the first night it didn't hurt at all, it just felt uncomfortable. So I took it again right now (day 2 out of 7) and all of a sudden my cooch had a terrible itch, then it burnt so badly on the outer walls I wanted to cry. I hoping its just killing the infection, but it does burn. So be prepared for it when it happens, an remember you already paid the 20 bucks to get the damn stuff, just keep taking it an trust that it works.		F	16	7  days	3/12/2013
5	Yeast Infection	Ladies don't let the negative comments keep you from trying this product! I almost did, but I am happy that I didn't! I had a really bad yeast infection to the point where I couldn't walk. I started feeling better after the fourth dose. I didn't experience any side effects as I thought I was after reading the reviews. Hopefully after the next two doses I will be 100%!		F	23	7  days	3/4/2013
5	yeast infection	I've had no side effects. & my infection was very bad. the applicator was uncomfortable the first day. but after that it's was fine. I have no complaints about it at all. so far so good c(=		F	21	2  days	2/17/2013

5	Walgreen	This is a dam good product all women should use it . It burns first however it will kill all the yeast And good luck.dont be afraid go for it !!!!		F		1  days7	1/15/2013
5	Yeast infection	The first dose was horrible! Effect wise. As soon as I applied it I felt the worst burning and itching sensation. It lasted about 5 minutes. After that everything was okay. I'm on the 2nd dose and this time there wasn't much of an effect after applying it. Seems like it working. Hopefully it does.		F	20	2  days	1/8/2013
3	Yeast Infection	Normally when I have a yeast infection this stuff works fast. However, I am now into day 4 and my yeast infection is not completely gone. I suggest using the suppositories at night as to day where you would experience a lot of discharge which, by the way, is completely uncomfortable and feels gross. Days 2 and 3, I felt the burning sensation. I didn't want to stand or even urinate. I would suggest using Monistat 3 instead to get faster results.		F	23	4  days	12/8/2012
3	yeast infection	I took it and after inserting the cream it itched sooo bad on the inside, but all the itching on the outside stopped.. I hope this cures it .		F	17	1  days	11/29/2012
3	yeast infection	I'm not done with the seven day treatment, but for the past four days I experienced a REALLY annoying itch about 2-4 minutes after I injected the cream. However, the external cream relieved a lot of the itchy sensation on the outside...which took me about 5 minutes to work. I personally try not to think about it...it's so annoying. I read all the reviews and I really think it all depends how your body takes it..we're all different.		F	16	4  days	11/26/2012
5	Severe Vaginal Yeast Infection	So far I haven't experienced any side effects.		F	19	4  days	10/16/2012
3	Yeast infection	Extreme burning on the inside of my vagina immediately after using the applicator and inserted the oval pill. I also felt extreme heat in my inside.	I chose to use the Monistat1 Day treatment Day or Night pack which came with the applicator, one white oval pill and 1 tube of cream to relieve the itching. The topical cream only caused a slight burning for a few minutes but nothing too bad. However, about 10 minutes after i used the applicator, I felt a burning that i had NEVER experienced before. It was sooo severe that i was trying to ice the area over my pj bottoms. I came upon this website just when i was starting to freak out and thank god for all the other comments. I feel very comforted to know that its NOT ME!! THe burning was horrendous for about 3 hrs and is now starting to subside. I still feel burning and heat but a lot less than a few hrs ago. From my experience, i can say that its probably better to lay down and sit up. You will definitely feel less burning lying down. I am pretty sure that the 3 Day and 7 Day will have less burning because they are less concentrated than the 1 day. But if you are like me and just want to treat it and move on, then you are going to have to stick it out!!I am feeling a little better so there is HOPE :-)	F	30	1  days1200mg 1X D	9/21/2012Email
2	Vagina yeast infection by antibioti	Skin allergy	i took 7 days treatment, it didn't work. I used it again, it didn't totally cure after 14 days of treatment with period. I am trying to drink apple cider vinegar now.	F	40	14  days100 mg 1X D	9/21/2012
5	Yeast Infection	Before using had discharge ...itching used day one and it did burn really bad....not the worse pain I felt though....in the morning no itching no discharge all day. day two very minimal burning....no discharge ....however be prepared to wear a pad it gets quite messy down there. I'm satisfied so far it is doing its job....the 1st burning sensation doesn't superceed the pain of the yeast infection it in doubt just try it...on that note...monistat 1 & 3 r the same as 7 just and intensified amount of medicine so take heed those will burn worse. I will definitely continue my treatment and use again if I need to!		F	27	2  days	8/28/2012

3	yeast infection	i just used monistat  7 and its burning just a little bit, it doesn't itch or anything i hope it wont burn for the next 6 days,  ive been reading that it just burns the first time you use it,  for some reason im not that worried about it but its not comfortable at all..  i pray to my lord that this will help.

3	yeast infection	I have used this product in the past and NEVER did it burn like this! Something is absolutly different. I will say that an ice pack did help. I used a gel ice pack over my pajama pants.		F	36	1  days7day	2/27/2012
5	Yeast Infection	The first night it burned like crazy, but that is because there was no natural lubrication in the vaginal area, and the medicine was killing the yeast. Don't stop using this product! By the second night it's only a little uncomfortable, and the third day it's gone. Keep using the product until the tube is empty; it WILL help!		F	18	3  days	2/19/2012
1	yeast infection from antibiotics	This product made mild symptoms 1000X worse.  I can not believe that this is a product allowed to be on the market.  The manufacturers absolutely must HATE women.  It was tortuous and required a doctors visit and two prescriptions to fix.	AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL PRODUCT!!!!  do not use it under any circumstances.	F	49	1  days 1X D	2/16/2012Email
3	For a YI	I, like many other have taken Monistat in the past and never experienced this before. After just 2 min of using it, I had so much itching and burning I thought I would go crazy. I can't wait to be done with this treatment. I agree with the many others that said the formula for the product must has changed recently.		F	25	2  days3x	2/8/2012
3	Yeast Infection	Well, with all the negative reviews I'm reading here, it makes you wonder if the product works. I started my first injection about 7 PM tonight. It did burn and itch. However, it's now 10 PM and it feels much better. Like peroxide on an infection it burns and foams up right? Don't you think Monistat 7 would have the same reaction for a yeast infection? I would think so. 		F	51	1  days7 day	2/4/2012
4	yeast infection	I experienced the intense burning and terrible pain with the first dose and just twinges of burning sensation the 2nd day. The following days no pain when applying. I have one more treatment left and so far it is really helping.		F	44	  1X D	1/13/2012
5	Yeast Infection	didn't have any side effects.	took monistat 7 and it stopped the yeast infection itch as soon as i applied the topical cream. relief after the first vaginal treatment. cleared up infection in 7 days. will take again if i have to.	F	23	7  days 1X D	12/11/2011
4	Yeast Infection		I have used monists before, for the 3 and 7 day kinds, and never experienced burning after using it. Today I used monistat-7 and initially it burned like crazy. I immediately googled it and it would appear this is common. I find it slightly odd that it never burned before and does this time, however, this yeast infection is much worse than those in the past. I was in Italy for the last several weeks and  did not feel comfortable buying anything I couldn't read so I had just been dealing with it. The burning does go away and the less movement the better, I'd suggest sitting or lying down.	F	20	7  days100 1X D	12/1/2011Email
5	Yeast infection	none	I am shocked and amazed on how well the cream applicator has cleared my infection up!!! I experienced no pain, no itching, and no burning AT ALL!!! I'm not sure why everyone is bashing the product when is effective.	F	28	7  days 1X D	8/28/2011Email
1	Yeast infection? Irritation/itching	Intense burning	I used  Monistat 7 a long time ago  and had no reactions.  Then I tried Monistat 3 about a year ago and the reaction was so bad (very intense pain, burning) that I decided to go back to the Monistat 7 this time.  I have had a burning sensation ever since I put it in 10 hours ago.	F	62	1  days 1X D	8/4/2011
4		I tried Monistat 3 first and it burned horribly, so I switched to Monistat 7. Monistat 7 is like a dream compared to Monistat 3 - hardly any itching from the product and my YI is starting to feel better already.	My big complaint is to the drugstores, who all have multiple versions of Monistat 1 and Monistat 3 covering four or five shelves at eye level, with just a few Monistat 7 options on the bottom shelf. They are encouraging and steering customers toward those horrible products that make it feel lie your vag is on fire when Monistat 7 has much less side effects and is more effective!	F	38	  1X D	8/1/2011
1	yeast infection	Intense burning	I thought I would have to go to the ER.  I agree with other posters - I used this product many years ago and had no such reaction.  I strongly believe the formula must have changed.	F	37	1  days 1X D	7/21/2011
5	yeah	my yeast infection was horrible, and reading all this stuff was crazy scared me , i got monistat 7 and honestly i have not had any crazy side effects. i mean yes it itched but it i itched just as bad before i took it. im on day two and feel pretty good. i suggest monistat 7 no question!

4	Yeast infection	Extreme itching the first few nights.	First of all let me say that this medicine did seem to clear up the infection. However, the first 2 nights I experienced some of the most intense itching ever. My infection was brought on by antibiotics. I just did my last treatment last night and I feel great. If you can stand the first few nights it does get easier to handle with each treatment. If you don't think you can tolerate the itching I have heard there is a pill your doctor can prescribe that have little to no side effects. So I rated this a 4 because it has seemed to work, but the itching is pure toucher. I hope this helps someone, or at least let's them know that the extreme side effects seem to be normal.

1	Yeast infection	First and last day using it, I had a terrible burning and itching not even 2 minutes after inserting the medicine,  it was worse than the infection it self.	There is no reason why we, women, have to suffer such an outrageous situation using a medicine that suppose to make us feel better.	F	22	1  days 1X D	4/13/2011Email
4	yeast infection	Well this was my first yeast infection and monistat was recommend to me. Being a virgin i found it kind of hard to insert the tube, but once it was in and i applied the cream i felt a slight burning and bad itching. Im 2 days into the 7 and still feeling it.

1	yeast infection (after antibiotics)	my comments are about monistat 1, I have used monistat 7 in the past for yeast infection and while it was messy sitting in that stuff for a week, it was helpful and gave me relief and cured me of the yeast infectionRecently, after bacterial respiratory infection treated with antibiotics left me with a yeast infection, I tried monistat 1 (so I wouldn't have to sit on that messy stuff for a week)  Well--give me the messy stuff any day, the monistat 1 was horrendous, the burning and pain made me feel I was chemically scalding my insides.  I have never experienced such pain or for so long a period of time.  It has been three weeks now, I have seen my gyn twice to see if I had something other than a simple yeast infections--lab results are negative, but the burning, scalded feeling continues.I do not have a partner--thank goodness--I can not imagine having sex with my vaginal area in this condition.  There continues to be constant burning, and intensified burning upon urination.If any		F	60	1  days 1X D	2/9/2011

4	possible yeast infection, doc rec'd	Barely anything. About 20 minutes after inserting ovule I had some slight warmness, but it wasn't uncomfortable. A VERY slight stinging feeling after applying the external cream, but it goes away quickly.	I logged onto this site AFTER inserting the 1-Day/Night Ovule and got freaked out by all the comments, then took 3 Melatonin (for sleep) and 2 Acetominophen (for pain). I ended up not falling asleep but never experienced the crazy burning logged here by so many others. Thank goodness! I woke up in the morning and felt fine. No problems at all. Applied the cream again the next day around lunchtime and it did sting/burn just a TINY bit but only for about 2-3 minutes.I had been experiencing itching for about 1.5 weeks before I called my Dr. and she recommended I get this rather than coming in for a check up. It may not have been a yeast infection, but I guess I'll find out in 6 more days if the itching is gone. If it was a yeast infection it will have only been my 2nd in 8 years of marriage/sexual activity.	F	31	1  days1200mg 1X D	1/13/2011
4	yeast infection (dr diagnosis)	None	I was wary but took it anyway and I have to say aside from some white discharge (the medicine as it leaves) for 2 days I had no problems. My yeast infection was not severe- I had no symptoms & no idea I had one until the Pap Smear results came back and said I did.	F	25	1  days 1X D	1/9/2011
1	Vaginal Yeast Infection	This product gave me horrible burning and itching that was much worse than the yeast infection itself! After 4 days I could no longer bear the treatment and saw my doctor (who confirmed this product causes burning in alot of women).	If you live in Canada, you can now buy a great new over-the-counter single pill taken by MOUTH, called CanesOral, at any pharmacy. It worked great for me. It's made by Caneston, see www.canesoral.ca . I don't think you can buy this yet in the US. Regardless, your doctor can prescribe no-pain alternatives!	F	48	4  days2% 7X W	1/5/2011
4	Yeast Infection		I just started taking Monistat 7 today, and so far I've only used the external cream. It's worked wonders so far, for the first ten-ish minutes I had to adjust to the feeling of it and noticed it felt a little bit weird, but after that the intense itchiness got replaced by a nice warmth, and a very dull itch which is much more comfortable and easy to move around with. I'm a little nervous about the internal treatment because all of the negative reviews, but I hope it will work! Even though I haven't tried Monistat 1 or 3, with my knowledge about medication, I would definitely suggest 7. A really high dose of something all at once is bound to be potentially more damaging to your body and have stronger side effects.	F	17	  1X D	11/27/2010
5	Yeast Infection	NONE	Experienced my first yeast infection due to massive steroid injection! Burning and itching are due to scratching!! With the monistat I used the cream and yes it burned at first because I was scratching once I quit the burn went away!! I am on my third dose and showing little signs other than a little itching of my infection!!!!!!! Completely satisfied with this product!	F	35	3  days 1X D	11/22/2010
3	Yeast infection	extreme burning and itching	I used Monistat many times in past years.  I never experienced any side effects, and it always seemed to work.  However, now I am in my thirties, and have two children--- who knows if that is the change or the product has changed.  I used Monistat for two nights now, and I have extreme burning and itching upon applicati and until I am able to fall asleep.  I do not know if the product is working, but I am going to complete the series because I do not want to have to start all over again.  I agree with a past commentor... I think that the product has changed over the last few years.	F	33	  1X D	11/21/2010
4	Yeast Infection	Intense burning and itching.	I just took the first dose of Walgreen's version of Monistat 3.  The first 30-45 minutes were just awful--lots of burning and itching.  But, I waited it out and it's much better now.  I'm very thankful for this site, I didn't know if this was normal or not!  Now there's just a comforting warm sensation.  I can't say if it's worked or not yet because this is my first night.  My advice is:  Stick it out, ladies!  It gets better.  :)	F	21	3  days200 mg 1X D	11/19/2010
5	yeast infection	I experienced NO side effects. It was effective and went very well. Before taking it I read these reviews and was terrified but went ahead and tried it out anyways. It was great. If you experience severe itching before taking the medicine, maybe try not using the outer creams. That tends to cause the side effects described by most the reviews. I would definetely recommend this medicine. It's a quick, easy, convinent cure!		F	18	3  days 1X D	11/17/2010
5	Yeast Infection during pregnancy	Burning/itching on par with yeast flare up the first two doses	I developed my first yeast infection at the end of my second trimester.  My mid-wife recommended Monistat 3.  I did not trust this recommendation for the following reasons: A) History of bad medical advice from doctors and nurses, B) Many sites warning against use of Monistat online (especially the higher 1 and 3 day doses), C) Preference for maintaining health through diet and certain home remedies before relying on the pharmaceutical industry.  I ingested crushed raw garlic and yogurt, and applied garlic cloves and yogurt directly for a few weeks, but as soon as I went a few hours without treatment I would get a bad yeast flare up.  After 3 or 4 weeks of increasing misery I decided to try the Monisat 7.  The first treatment burned and itched slightly more than the yeast itself, the second treatment less so, the third treatment a warm sensation, and the fourth/fifth/sixth had no noticeable feeling.  The discomfort from the infection was gone after the fourth dose, and all discharge/symptoms are gone after the sixth dose.  I still need to use the seventh treatment tonight, but I am pleased with the results.  Baby is still kicking and active, and my parts finally feel clean and normal again.  I still eat plain yogurt daily and plan to ingest garlic 1-2 times per week as a preventative measure, but the Monistat did the trick for a full blown infection.	F	26	7  days2% 1X D	11/17/2010Email
3	yeast infection	Slight burning sensation, great deal of itchying and irritation	I used monistat 7 a couple times before. But last night (first doasge) i had to use monistat 3 b/c that was the only one the store held. I read the directions and side effects etc, before i inserted the pre-filled app. The side effects stated that i might experience burning, itchying, and irritation. But i never experienced that before while useing this product. So i went ahead and insterted the app. And not even 10 min. after i felt slight burning but alot of itchying. I was so tired and wanted to sleep but couldnt. So i took some night quil, which knocked me out. And when i woke up the next morning the pain was gone. So i thought.I went to use the bathroom and when i was done. It all started back up again. So i took some tylenol and went back to sleep for maybe 2-3 hours. When i woke up the pain was gone again. I was to nervous to move b/c i didnt want the pain to come back. But it didnt. I felt fine. Well...randomly i would feel about 5-10 sec. of itchyness and irritation. But that was it. I know the side effects can be unbearable, but once its done...you'll think it was worth it. However after reading everyones comments,im still a little iffy with this product. Only because lately everyones experiencing the side effects after how many times they've used this. It really makes you wonder if they changes something in the product. I rated it a 3 because even though these side effects are killer, ain the end you feel better.	F	19	3  days 1X D	11/6/2010Email
1	yeast infection	I used monistat when it was prescription only and had no problems, however several years later I purchased it over the counter and had intense burning on the first application. I think the company may have changed the formula? I then went to my doctor and he prescribed terazol 7 it did the job with littleor no discomfort. I would never again use monistat and cant understand why the FDA allows it to stay on the market!		F	45	1  days 1X D	10/31/2010
3	Diagnosed yeast infection		I was diagnosed with a yeast infection by my doctor and bought the Monistat One-Day treatment because why prolong it for seven days, right? Wrong. I didn't have any of these horrific side effects you girls have described, but when I spoke to my doctor after, she recommended that I use the Monistat 7 since the one-day treatments don't actually cure most yeast infections. That's ridiculous. Monistat shouldn't be able to market a product that isn't even considered effective by doctors. Don't bother wasting your time with the one-day treatment...

1	Yeast Infection	The most intense *burning* painful sensation about 2 hours after inserting the Monistat 1 Day treament.  The pain was absolutely debilitating and lasted about 4-6 hours until it slowly wore off.	I used Monistat 1 Day treatment yesterday for what was a very mild yeast infection.  I wish I had researched the product before buying it, as it would appear most people feel the 7 Day treatment is much milder and manageable.  This was my second yeast infection (the first was 12 years ago), so I was not well-informed and simply picked up the "party pack" version of the box: 1 day treatment ovule, cooling wipes, and a tube of external cream.  I inserted the ovule while at a public conference and almost left in tears; because I was at a work function out of town I had to white-knuckle through the intense BURNING.  About 2 hours into the treatment, I went to the bathroom and I belive that after urinating, something was triggered and that's when the sensitivity and BURNING began. I later joked to my sister that it felt as if an Altoid was thrust deep into my vaginal canal - it was THAT INTENSE.  But this is really not a laughing matter.Wheter you have had yeast infections a lot or never before, this product is a scam as a super-mega-dose "1 day" treatment.  Please be warned!  I thought I had to go to the ER and frankly, the it was very scary feeling that wretched internally in such a sensitive region of the female reproductive system.  I think having "girl" issues is one of the scariest as well as embarrassing problems to endure.  To have to encounter this level of pain while attempting to cure a yeast infection is absolutely criminal.  Monis	F	33	7  days 1X D	10/14/2010Email

4	Yeast Infection	It burns a bit during the first day, but I spoke to a doctor who said it will sometimes burn if the infection is a little worse then normal.  I'm the type of person that doesn't realize she has anything like this until it's out of control.  I'd rather it burn a bit for a night so I can get rid of the infection for good...	I've used this a few times in my life and never had anything scary or awful happen and I'm a fairly sensitive person.  I don't even take Tylenol or Motrin unless I'm in severe pain, like once after giving birth.	F	35	7  days 1X D	9/22/2010

Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
