3	edema in ankles and feet	diarrhea and leg cramps	After a few days the edema went down, but when diarrhea started I discontinued the Dyazide.  I've gone through this scenario before; you see, I have UC which has been in remission for over a year and I won't take any med or eat any food that causes the UC to flare.There must be another med to take; else, I'll live with the edema.

3	HBP	I notice my feet sweat alot and vaginal dryness. no extra bathroom trips but I am not retaining water...not sure if this med will work for my issue. BP was 160/110 almost a week ago check last night after exercise and was 130/92. Dont know if its the med or the exercise, go back to the dr on 4/29. Plan: lose 5-10lbs and keep exercising.	Dont want long term meds, too young but bad fam history and over weight. I think weight loss will take care of the problem. plan to be off med by 7/2012	F	27	5  days37 1X D	5/15/2012Email
1	Meniere's Disease	Felt like death warmed over and the worst hangover of my life.  My BP fluctuated wildly; headache, severe nausea, light-headedness, couldn't stand for more than a few minutes, pulse spiking >170 bpm after non-stressful activities (walking up 6 stairs), BP would bottom out with no notice - suddenly I would be sitting on the floor, unable to even try to stand.	I was prescribed Dyazide to help with daily bouts of vertigo from Meniere's Disease.  My BP has always been in the normal range, tending toward the lower end of normal, so a medication typically used for high BP caused me lots of problems.  I called the doc's office after 8 days of terrible side effects; they told me to stop taking it and stick to a low sodium diet instead.  I would rather have daily vertigo than deal with the terrible side effects from Dyazide.	F	26	8  days 1X D	1/13/2012
3	HBP	I have been taking this drug since I was 36, now that I am older(48) I have noticed some side effects such as the tingling, in toes, & hands on occasion. If I miss taking it for a week, my ankles begin to feel swollen. It does make me urinate often, therefore I take this drug before 4pm each day. I have been getting frequent headaches lately and frequent loose bowel movements.	I take this drug along with one other (ATENELOL 100 mg.) They are supposed to work together, but you must cut the salt out to achieve any results with these two drugs. It is a cheap drug, and I hope it does not ruin my kidneys, after long term use. This is something I want to address to my Physician soon.	F	48	12  years	12/11/2009Email
1	high b.p.	I took it in the a.m. and by late afternoon I had to go home from work because I had horrendous head pain and down the back of my neck.  Could not get rid of the head pain until next morning and then the next evening still felt very bad.	I did not take any more of those pills as I was certainly afraid of the same thing happening again.	F	57	1  days	6/4/2009
3	Hypertension	For the first month I was taking the drug I had Hot Flashes constantly.  They lasted for about 1 month only.  After being on the drug for 10 months I began to get foot cramps and am feeling fatigued 4 to 5 days a week.  It has controlled my Hypertension and my reading are in the normal range on a daily basis.		F	52	14  months	6/3/2009
1	Hypertension	I have been taking this for 3 days.  I have tingling in hands and feet, cramping in legs, have no energy and feel very much out of it.  Dizzy and headaches low grade.  I am in good shape and a runner, very sad that I have high blood pressure at 47.		F	47	3  days	4/14/2009
4	HP	None until a year ago. Then tinnitus started in ears. Now have in both ears and tingling throughout body. Sometimes feels like something crawling inside or feeling of buzzing in body.  Dr considering taking me off and using beta blocker with other diuretics.		F		 	2/27/2009
3	Borderline hypertension	First two weeks, got dizzy changing positions.  Already have an inner ear problem so didn't like the extra dizzies.  Now top right teeth are cold sensitive.  Unsure if related.  BP getting slightly lower.  Vague headaches frequently.  No weight loss.	Meds generally freak me out.  Would rather control with diet, alternative therapies.  Potassium was checked and is okay.  Heart flutters.  Triglyceride levels through the roof but difficult to believe that could be related.  Jury's not in on this yet for me.	F	65	5  weeks	11/30/2008
5	high blood pressure	I am a 51 year old female with first time high blood pressure.  After three weeks on dyazide I've lost 11 pounds! I don't retain fluids and I'm not having the problem with constant urination like others noted here. I cannot use any other type of BP meds because I'm a asthmatic so beta blockers will not work well with my asthma meds. Anyway, bottom line with dyazide I'm just simply not hungry (this is a good thing as I'm about 35 pounds overweight).  I do feel dizzy occasionally and initially had a sense of restlessness, but that is subsiding.  I would recommend this medication. BP is down, weight is down.  A GOOD THING!		F	51	3  weeks	10/24/2008
4	Borderline HTN	I started having dizziness after 1 year on the dyazide. I has kept my B/P down marvelously, however if I skip any doses I can feel my hands and feet swelling.  Not sure but have started having tinnitis, it's aggravating.  I have feet, and leg cramps, so far my potassium level is o.k., but the cramps come 6 hours after dosing if I do not hydrate myself well.	I am wondering has anyone else experienced tinnitis with dyazide, along with uncomfortable itching.  My itching may be due to the bath & body work products I use every day.  I notice a decrease in itching a week after I stop using bath & body works but it has not completely stopped yet.	F	47	1  years	9/16/2008
2	hbp	Nausea.  I only take this every other day, not only doesn't it seem to work but I am nauseous every once in a while		F	62	2  years	1/6/2008
4	Hypertension and edema	I  have chronic hypertension and idiopathic edema, and after an 80 lb weight loss, my Dr. took me off Norvasc and HCTZ and put me on Dyazide because my BP was much more normal, but I still needed a mild antihypertensive.  Dr. told me to take it every day. On day #4 I experienced sudden vertigo and passed out in my kitchen floor. When I "woke up" I was sweating profusely and very weak. My BP wouldn't even register on my BP machine, it was so low. I now take a Dyazide every third day. It is just enough to keep my BP normal. I urinate very frequently of course after I take for around 12 hours, and always experience some muscle twitching and muscle cramps (mainly feet & legs) the day after taking it. My electrolytes are always normal when they are checked.I no longer have chronic edema like I did. It's great having normal sized feet and ankles! I don't feel like a water balloon anymore.	Dyazide literally decreases my Systolic BP and Diastolic BP by about 20+ points each when I take one, and taking one every 3 days or so works great for me. I feel like the antihypertensive effects peak at about 24 hours for me.  BP will run around 130/80 and then when I take one, it will decrease to around 100-110/60. I do experience occasional orthostatic hypotension and dizziness. My BP will gradually creep back up over the next 3 days or so, until I take another one. Dyazide has a potent effect on my BP personally. It seems to decrease my BP more than Diovan HCT or Norvasc ever did.  Of course, it could just be that I lost down to a normal weight and it's just mild HTN now. I like the fact that I am only taking one pill every 3 days, it totally takes care of my chronic edema, and generally keeps my BP normal.  I do have to watch out for hypotensive episodes sometimes though and make sure I drink 2 liters/day when I take it for hydration.	F	36	1  years	8/21/2007
5	Elevated blood pressure	Extreme craving for salt initially, none now...was eating a jar of pickles plus drinking pickle juice initially to relieve craving.	Has worked very well in decreasing my BP	F	45	6  months	8/19/2007
4	Borderline Hypertension	Having cramping and spasms in feet, legs, thighs, buttocks, and hands. Moderate dry mouth.	My doc prescirbed for bordeline htn, b/p 140-150's/90-100, down 2nd day to 115/74-80.  No more mild feet swelling	F	46	3  days	8/19/2007
2	For my blood pressure and edema	My doctor Prescribed Dyazide and Norvasc to control my blood pressure and the swelling in my legs and feet.According to the medical dictionary Norvasc causes swelling in the legs.I haven't question my doctor about this but I intend to.I have also become sexually disfunctional.My Urologist prescribe Cialis,but it has no get effect on me	I think that the drug would work better if the doctor would suggest a proper diet for the patient or a list of meals that you can choose from that will not increase you sodium intake and lower your blood pressure.	M	62	3  years	6/10/2007Email
4	Hypertension, edema	I take this in AM and haven't noticed excessive urination. The heachache is chronic, though, a nagging 2-3 on a 1-5 scale.I disregarded the sunlight warning one day and my face and neck have a rash that is still irritated and itchy four days later... yow!	Pretty tame Rx, considering I'm taking it along with Metformin, Effexor, Lipitor, Levothyroxine, and an antibiotic as well right now.	F	53	28  days	6/6/2007
1	hypertension	Heart flutters; unable to do yard work without feeling weak and exhausted; tightness and aching on the left side of my chest.	I started taking Dyazide at the same time I reduced my Toprol XL dose from 75mg to 50mg so the side effects might be related to taking less Toprol.  Side effects began after 4 days and on the fifth day I went back to taking 75mg of Toprol but symptoms continued.  Quit taking Dyazide after 7 days and the symptoms disappeared.	M	60	7  days	5/23/2007
3	severe edema/feet and calves	seems like i'm the only one but when i take the dyazide the inside of my nose dries out so bad that the nostrils swell inside. impossible to move out any mucus since it becomes thick or completely dried out. and i cough as if i have a chest infection. this goes away when i d/c the pill.  but swollen feet return right away. i'm afraid to try the lasix rx that i have, it's such a more serious water pill.		M	44	2  weeks	5/4/2007Email
4	high blood pressure	nothing that I'm bothered by anymore (been on it for years) except needing to pee a lot in the morning (take medication when I get up in the moring) and for about 2-3 hours after taking the medication I have difficulty getting and maintaining an erection. I sometimes take the Dyazide a few hours later if I run in the morning (so don't have to pee so bad on run) or my wife and I have sex in the moring.		M	50	10  years	4/24/2007
4	BP and water retention	sentivity to sunlight, headache, palpitation.	I am taking it 1x a day and in combination with Altace (10mg. I Noticed that when I stop taking Dyazide, my BP goes up after the third day. I don't get bothered much by frequent urination when I work or play sports (lots of running). this med works.	M	50	1  years	4/14/2007
3	Hypertension	Excessive urination all day long. Dry mouth. Sometimes blurred vision. Recently experiencing dry eyes.	May wash out good minerals as well as sodium.  Frequent potassium checks via blood tests should be done, as Dyazide is a potassium-sparing diuretic.	M	65	4  years	3/2/2007
5	HBP &  Fluid Retention	Only on the first day.....so far just a mild feeling of vertigo after I took it this morning, but I expect that with any new drug. Frequent urination....so I assume that it has begun doing what it is suppose to since I do have fluid retention as a result of HBP. Blood pressure has been at 186/98. Very high indeed. Took a reading this evening and it was 129/88.	I am hoping that this will help with my HBP issues. Will come back to post progress on this drug in about a week.	F	30	1  days	10/21/2006
2	blood pressure reduction	flushed face, dizziness and irregular heart beat (missing beat every 5-10 beats - never had this before - really scary). Took myself off. Was taking cardizem cd as well, and dyazide did not lower my blood pressure. I once had a reaction to a sulfide drug and that might also be part of this - there's a warning about sulfa algery - my doctor didn't seem to know this.		M		8  days	10/4/2006
4	High Blood Pressure	Dizzyness at times, but also side effect of Effexor. Change in bowels, sort of constipation. Some people described dry mouth, I have "Burning Tongue Syndrome". It is getting worse and occurred after increase in diazide to 25mg every other day. Could it be a side effect?	With Norvasc, it helps controlling my blood pressure. I was taking it 1X weekly and increased it to every other day.Previously I'd been taking Hydrochlorathyazide with the Norvasc.	F	73	3  months	3/12/2006Email
2	borderline high blood pressure	Dr. put me on a beta blocker (atenol) I believe, first and experienced a total soaking of prespiration all over.  I took it for 4 days, and took myself off, I control it on my own.  When I went back in and told him what was happening, he told me that wasn't a side effect.  BUT, the sweating quit.  SO he puts me on dyazide, I have taken it three times, the slight swelling in my hand have decreased but the sweating has started back..	I don't think I'm going to take it anymore and try to bring it down on my own.	F	42	3  days	10/1/2005
4		Very satisfied with the effect on my blood pressure. After being mildly hypertensive I went to normal after about three weeks on this medication. Psyllium husks helped with constipation. However, my skin was becoming progressively more wrinkled, and after my physician noticed my sodium level declining, he agreed to take me off the medication.		F	71	7  months	3/18/2005
5	Meniere's disease	In the first few days I felt a little weak, and also felt numbness and tingling in my face, tongue, hands etc. But these went away and I no longer feel any side effects.	This drug has been very effective in reducing the incidence of vertigo attacks. In the two months before I started taking it, I was having 3 or 4 disabling attacks a week. Since I have been taking it I have had only one serious attack in two months. I think my initial side effects were due to the drug lowering my blood pressure, which was not high to begin with; but since I have gotten used to it I am fine and would highly recommend it.	F	53	2  months	12/31/2004Email
5	borderline high hypertension	Cleared up irritable bowel syndrome by helping kidneys function better (a good side effect). It is hard to tell whether periodic chronic fatigue and nerve tingling is a side effect since I had them before. They may be genetic or due to high blood pressure.		M	53	1  years	11/8/2004
2	hypertension	severe leg muscle cramping, arrythmia, apparently from loss of potassium from excessive urination,and  exhaustion, but this was more likely the beta blocker I was also taking. This caused fatigue and weight gain. When I developed severe arrythmia (taken to ER) I took myself off the diuretic and the beta blocker.	I read  Dr. Julian Whitaker's book 'Reversing Hypertension' re getting off meds and the adverse effects of long term diuretics and other BP meds. There I found out about potassium. My doc. though sceptical, prescribed it for me and also changed me to Norvasc. Weight came down, arrythmia, cramps, fatigue stopped.	F	66	2  years	10/8/2004
4	high blood pressure	No side effects other than dry mouth and it makes me urinate A LOT for about  4-6 hours after I take my pill.  This intereferes with traveling or going places so I try to take it after dinner, but way before bedtime.  If you take it too late in the evening, you'll be up all night going to the bathroom every hour.	If I don't take it, I retain water and my hands and feet get very puffy.  I feel bloated and get irritable, becuase my BP goes up.  I feel much better on it.	F	47	4  years	9/27/2004
2	High Blood Pressure	Flushness in face first day and overall puffy feeling and weakness of muscles & moderate headache. Second day, experienced tremendous migrain for over 12 hours.	I am allergic to sulfites and think there is a connection.	F	32	2  days	3/18/2004
3	hypertension	frequent urination, but not bad if taken in morning	Sometimes it was less effective in controlling my blood pressure.  When I started coming down with a virus it could go up to an uncomfortable level for me.	F	53	7  months	1/10/2004
3	high blood pressure	Back pain between shoulder blades requires Advil twice a day.  Muscle cramping in legs when trying to relax in the evening.   Difficulty staying awake in evening.  Overall weakness.	Symptoms are improving after 2 days off medication.  Hope to lower blood pressure with weight loss and natural methods.	F	56	2  months	1/8/2004
2	high blood pressure	Extreme dryness in mouth, nose & eyes.  Eyes burn and are blood shot.	I've been taking dyazide for almost 4 weeks.  I didn't know if the eye problem was related so I stopped taking it for a few days and eyes felt fine.  Took one yesterday and dryness in eyes returned.  Guess it's the Dyazide.	F	46	4  weeks	12/1/2003
3	as needed for ankle puffiness	I took one pill in the AM and for some reason by PM, I was falling alsleep at the dinner table.  Went to bed early and my big toes were tingling and I was restless.  I also had taken 2 Advil at noon so so not know if this was a side effect of one drug or the combination of the two.		F	60	1  times	9/10/2003
4	hyperension	on an empty stomache, I used to get cramps. When i statred taking it a year ago - I used to perspire a great deal. I am taking this along with atenolol &  the increased urination stopped and I have lost 30lbs. I am still leery of there drugs and I want to get off them if possible.		M	40	1  days	7/3/2003Email
5	HI BP	Low grade headache?	Had been taking 25mg along with Accupril, Lopressor and Norvasc with poor results.  After double my dosage of Dyazide my BP is now very good.  Just wondered if it could cause the headache.		50	2  years	1/9/2003
5	blood pressure	tingling in fingers		M	67	23  years	11/15/2002
3	High Blood Pressure	Frequent urination (water pill)	BP had been falling in the "borderline" area for about a year. Dr put me on Dyazide in hope it would control BP. Now Dr added ALTACE (ramipril) because BP recently got higher. Will see if combo of both works.	M	38	1  years	4/9/2002
