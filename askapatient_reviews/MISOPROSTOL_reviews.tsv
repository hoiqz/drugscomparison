5	miscarriage management blighted ovum	Complete evacuation, like a natural miscarriage. With correct dosages this works in up to 95% of first trimester miscarriages.	I was afraid to have a D&C because my friend got Asherman's syndrome from one. She recommended this instead. My doctor gave me both options and I chose cytotec. I would recommend Cytotec to anyone who is interested in preserving their fertility.	F	37	1  days800mcgx2 1X D	10/8/2010
2	Fibromagelia & pinched cspine nerve	Blew up like a balloon, elephantitus looking legs & ankles.  Finger circulation cut off by rings...terrible reaction!	It took about a week to come down from the swelling.  My ankles hurt so bad & were so swollen, wow...nasty reaction for me!	F	44	1  days	2/23/2008
1	medically managed miscarriage	Horrible cramping that extended down my legs.  Did not effectively complete my miscarriage.	This drug was recommended to me as the least invasive way to complete my miscarriage (embryo 2 weeks behind in development with no cardiac activity).  The doctor did not mention that it is often not effective in one dose (or even after two doses, though I doubt I could have convinced myself to take it again).  I returned for a follow up visit a week later and learned that the miscarriage was still not complete, and had to schedule a D&C anyway.  I would definitely recommend the D&C over this drug any day.
