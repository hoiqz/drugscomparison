1	I could not sleep	I feel super lazy the next day and sad very sad I'm normally a very happy person but after of taking these pills I wanna quite life the next day		M	32	2  daysTwo pills	7/10/2013
1	Insomnia	I take this drug only occasionally and find that I am very agitated and depressed the next day. Also, get constipation.		F	61	2  days 1X D	3/30/2013
2	Insomnia	I have been on ambien and was up to 30mg but it would still take 2-3the hrs to kick in. I have been using unisom when my ambien runs out bc im only allowed a certain amount each month. I am now up to 5-6a pills and they ztill take 2-3 hrs to fall asleep. I wish i could find a sleeping pill thatwould take 15-30the mins to work and still sleep through the night. With 6 pills i still wake up in the middle of the night and if i have to get up for work after only 3 hrs of sleep i dont feel groggy or anything. Im wide awake and can stay awake for 24 hrs no problem		F	32	3  days300	11/19/2012Email
1	severe trouble falling asleep	causes me not to be able to fall asleep more than if I did not take it! And then I sleep feeling like I'm wide awake.  Worsens RLS symptoms.  Compared to the now MIA Simply Sleep (by Tylenol) Unisom does not work at all.  Save your $$ and just take deep breaths.		F	40	14  days50 1X D	9/12/2012Email
2	Insomnia	This is my first (and last) time taking Unisom.  I have frequent insomnia but do not usually take any medication for it.  I have tried Ambien and Lunesta in the past with no bad side affects.Unlike Ambien, I had a very difficult time falling asleep, missed my morning Alarm clock, overslept by 40 minutes, and was so sleepy that I was unable to function for most of the day at my office.The sensation was like a really bad hangover.  The effects started to wear off approximately 15 hours later.  Multiple cups of tea and coffee did little to help the drowsy, cloudy feeling I felt all day.	Worst sleep-aid I have ever used.  Benadryl, Ambien, and Lunesa have little to no side-effect if taken once in a while.	M	41	1  days25mg 1X D	4/23/2012Email
4	trouble falling and staying asleep	I never taking sleep meds so i started with 1/2 of one 25mg tablet after 30 mins of no results I took the other half.   I still had trouble initially falling asleep but after that I was out, I had no problems with waking during the night.  I won't take it again because I felt tired and groggy all the next day.  Not worth it I would rather be tired from no sleep and able to function then feeling out of it all day because of a pill.  It basically all depends on the past medical history.  I someone has been taking sleeping pills often and have built up an immunity to them this probably won't work, but for someone using only once in awhile it does the trick.		F	27	1  days25	3/31/2012
2	Insomnia	Unison(doxylamine) is not as effective as I hoped. I have to take between 50 and 100mg (2-4name) pills)to feel sleepy at all and also add a couple benadryl if the unison does not work after a couple hours. I do not have insurance but I gotta find a cheap Dr. Because these otc pills are useless		F	30	1  days100mg	3/24/2012Email
4	To prevent insomnia	None so far after taking them...	It will work when I dissolve by drinking water along with the 5HTP. Remember that this does not promote a normal or rejuvenating sleep, it helps people to fall asleep. Once people take two which those that have the melting tablets, drinking water along with the 5HTP may or may not help. As a user, I'm satisfied with this. 5HTP is to relax the mood and with the Unisom, it will last a night and wake up with a little grogginess. I'm okay so far, so no side effects as of yet. I gave it a four out of five because this will not work without taking 5HTP twice a day.	M	22	1.5  weeks50 1X D	3/18/2012Email
1	Insomnia	depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, dry mouth, hangover.	Effects have been bad for me. Its my belief that after taking this drug for months that it has made my depression and anxiety much worse.I would not recommend using Unisom or other antihistamines over any period of time if you are predisposed to depression or anxiety.Like other hypnotics, sleeping pills alter brain chemistry the same way. Benzos, antihistamines, and SSRI's (antidepressants) target GABA receptors in the brain. Taking Unisom or other hypnotics will only mask the causes of insomnia, you will fall asleep, but it will be unnatural. This is what gives you that "hangover" effect when you wake up in the morning. That "hangover" effect may have cumulative negative effects on your brains normal operation and can, over time, make depression and anxiety worse. We know depression, anxiety, insomnia are all related. I know its tempting for doctors and patients to seek a quick resolution of insomnia or depression since they impact your life greatly.But I would caution against using Unisom or other sleep agents if you have depression/anxiety and seek practical, natural, and behavioral steps to alleviate your insomnia.There is very little information about doxylamine succinate. These drugs have only been around for a few years while insomnia, depression, and anxiety have been around for as long as human kind. We cannot fool ourselves into taking new drugs for ages old conditions.Unisom, Benzos, SSRIs, & antihistamines side effects are t	M	26	2  years25mg 1X D	2/17/2011Email

5	insomnia	morning grogginess, difficulty waking, increased appetite in morning	I became reliant on these tablets for sleeping so cut my dose to a quarter of a tablet and increased to half if still unable to sleep. Now I only use for emergencies. Very helpful!	F	25	1  years12.5 1X D	10/26/2010Email
5	Insomnia; to sleep	Sometimes groggy in the morning. I usually take it when I know I don't have to get up early, and I let it put me back to sleep for a while.	My seventeen year old daughter and I both have insomnia. For her, Unisom Sleepgels have worked very well. I have had to take something stronger most nights, and am currently taking Ambien. But on occasional nights, I do take the same Unisom Sleepgels that my daughter does. They work very well. Sometimes it takes a while for them to take effect, so I will take one an hour or so before bedtime. They often keep me very sleepy the next morning, so when I take them, I try not to plan too many morning activities. At the time they do put me to sleep, they feel very strong for an over the counter medication.	F	49	2  years1 Sleepgel 1X D	10/1/2010Email
4	insomnia	sinusitis, cough, dry mouth, swollen eyes	1/2 a tablet really did help me sleep. However, because of side-effects, I will only use as a last resort.	M	55	 15 mg 1X D	3/3/2010

5	Morning Sickness	You must use the Unisom with the active ingrediant Doxylamine if you want it to help with morning sickness.	Works great for me!	F	35	2  weeks	10/23/2008
5	Insomnia	I am using Doxylamine already for a few years. I live in Australia and take it in tablet form with the brand name Restavit. However, I take only 1/2 a tablet (12.5mg) about an hour before going to bed. I then take also a Valerian capsule and 1/2 teaspoon Tryptophan. The combination seems to work exept when I have been overstimulated by having visitors or working too late on my computer etc. I have Fybromyalgia and find that the anti-histamnine is something I also need for some of my allergies.	So far I have not found problems with taking this but I may not recognise them because of the complaints I have with Fybromyalgia.	F	56	7  years	4/14/2008Email
4	Insomnia	Having used sleeping meds for years and after having become highly addicted to them, Unisom brought me wonderful relief from extended insomnia when I had to stop the sleeping pills.Be warned though! I now have HYPER acidosis! Have to take up to 80mg's of acid blocking P.P.I's due to a totally messed up gastric system now. This has lead to ulcers and now gout type arthritis which the Physician says all stems from having used Unisom for close on 3 years.		F	51	3  years	1/21/2008Email
4	Insomnia	A very effective insomnia remedy. Better than sleeping tablets. The down side is that over time you need to keep on upping your dose till you reach a point where you are actually overdosing as you become tolerant very quickly to the Unisom (Doccylacime Succinate.)For people with gastric sensitivity it is worth keeping in mind that this is actually an anti-histamine and can mess quite badly with the acid contents of the stomach.

4	Insomnia	Lingering grogginess in the morning.	Even though this is an over-the-counter drug, as far as inducing the feeling of sleepiness, it is one of the most powerful I've tried and, in that respect, works better than both Ambien and Lunesta. The problem with it for me is that it can take over an hour to kick in -- but when it does you'd better be in bed or close by. It's so strong that I have to buy it in the oval tablet form and break them in half. If I took a whole one, I'd still be in a fog for over half of the next day. As it is, even with the half tablet, I'm still too groggy in the morning which is why I don't use it more. But it's a very effective sleep medicine.	M	51	18  months	10/9/2006
3	Sleep aid (doxylamine version)	Morning drowsiness.  Fewer side effects than with Benadryl (can't remember Benadryl's generic name, it is used also in a different Unisom formulation):  no hunger or dry mouth which I get with Benadryl.	This is a very powerful drug and should be available in a lower dosage.  I am now taking a version (Donormyl) I buy in France which is 15 mg, divisible in two for a 7.5 mg dose, and I am very happy with that dose.  Unisom is available only in 25 mg. tablets so that even if one splits the pill, as I did, the dosage is still too large.  I recommended this (as the only version available in the US) to two friends who both tried and rejected it as too powerful.	F	65	30  days	7/28/2006
