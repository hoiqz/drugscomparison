1	Lyme Disease	Steven Johnson's Syndrome	I had no idea what Steven Johnson's Syndrome was until my fingers, lips and private parts started burning and blistering. I though it was from minor exposure to the sun until I kept completely out of the sun and everything kept burning, then blistering, then bleeding. It was extremely painful and scary and everyone should know to watch out for this kind of reaction and stop the med/go to the ER ASAP.	F	34	11  days 2X D	4/11/2011
2	SORE THROAT TIC BITE	HAD NO EFFECT ON CLEARING UP INFECTION	DID NOT WORK IN FIGHTING INFECTED THROAT. SWITCHED TO BIACTIN AND WAS BETTER IN ONE DAY, BUT CONTINES BIACTIN FOR 9 DAYS	M	72	3  days100MG 2X D	8/7/2010
4	Perioral Dermatitis	I received a horrible stomach ulcer because the doc didn't say anything about not taking this before bed. The pain was excruciating. I couldn't eat solid foods for a week. Do not take this before bed! It severely burned my stomach/esophagus. Take with lots of water, and stay up-right for 1 hour after taking. Other than this, no problems.	Worked great for perioral dermatitis, and after taking Doryx for a month I didn't get the condition again for another 3 years. I also noticed while taking it that my pores disappeared and my face was clearer than it's ever been. Just be sooo careful, it is very rough on the lining of the stomach.	F	26	30  days	9/13/2009
5	Acne	None, but as with many antibiotics, makes you feel pretty crappy if you consume alcohol with it.	Used in addition to a cream.  Doryx helps breakouts heal faster.  It also, for me, prevents breakouts on my shoulders.  Since I only put the cream on my face, I am positive that the Doryx is what keeps the big, painful acne off my shoulders.  Most breakouts heal very quickly compared to not taking anything at all.  It's the creams that should prevent new breakouts.	F	26	3  years	7/29/2007
1	Acne	Cleared up then got worse.	I took this for acne on my chin. After it initially looked like it was improving, I got big thick welts under my skin filled with brown blood and muck that I would have to burst or else they would stay there. Over a year later I still have very pale scars from it. I went to a different doctor who prescribed me a cream called Duac gel. My skin cleared up in 3-4 days to the point that people would comment how lovely my skin is. Try this if doryx doesn't work for you.	F	26	2  weeks	6/24/2007
5	Acne	None that I'm aware of	I had pretty constant acne on my chin-- that painful, under-the-skin kind-- and Doryx has totally eliminated it.	F	23	2  years	12/3/2006
3	Lyme	Mild stool changes.  Some stomach upset.  Mild insomnia.	I was on Doryx with another drug called Plaquenil.  Plaquenil is supposed to enhance Doryx.  Doryx seems to supress some of my Lyme symptoms.  I am on Zithromax and IV Rocephin right now and the symptoms are coming back.  I can't wait to get back on Doryx.	F	43	2  months	4/8/2005
3	Acne	My face cleared up at first then it got worse than it started as and really dry and big pimples, but I'm still waiting for it to get better...it's only been about 3 weeks.		F	18	3  weeks	11/7/2001
