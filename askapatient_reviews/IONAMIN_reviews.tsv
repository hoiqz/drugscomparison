1	weight loss	appetite suppression moderateslight agitation first week or so  THEN  came the crushing depression.  Horrible.  please warn people of this possibility esp. if you previously suffered bouts of depression.		F	60	15  days	12/25/2008
3	first, weight loss	dry mouth, funny taste in my mouth, sore tongue, chewing lip, gas	i really cannot say that i have lost a lost of weight with this.  i have taken it for over a year and since then have lost 9-10 pounds.  however, i have some type of problem being able to stay awake in the daytime.  after starting this med the dr. told me to stay on it since it was keeping me from being so fatigued and wanting to just lie around.  that is one thing i can say, it really gives you enery and i can't say that it makes me have heart flutters or anything like that and i REALLY have to be careful about anything that does make my heart flutter, but so far, no problems.  Just hope I see more weight coming off!	F	51	1  years	6/3/2008Email
3	to loose weight	insomnia, anxiety, mood swings, complete loss of appitite, thirsty all the time,constant need to chew(make sure that you have plenty of chewing gum)	this drug is very effective in assisting with weight loss but i urge you to be very careful that you are not replacing one addiction with another. I found it extremly difficult to stop taking this drug because it is just so much easier to take one pill every day than it is to find the time to excersise reguarly along with having to cook and plan a healthy diet also this drug works almost instantly and has amazing results diet and excersise takes time. Once you stop taking this drug you will most likely find that you are stacking on the pounds at a rapid speed. It does the job as i have lost half of my body weight  but be very, very careful as it IS also an addictive drug!!	F	25	6  days	3/1/2008
5	Weight loss	in the beginning, maybe 2-3 wks my sleeping was worse than usual. took a really long time to fall asleep & then woke up about every 2 hrs the rest of the night. Dry mouth & shakiness if taken too much to start until you get used to it.	Really like it. Has helped me loose 42 lbs but after taking it for almost two years, with little breaks of my own choosing - say 1-4 days w/out about every 4-5 wks, I have finally gotten to the point where it is no longer effective. Too bad. I have switched to Tenuate for the next month or so to see if that will work as well but if not then my doc will give me the Ionamin (phentermine) again. I took 1/2 tablet at first (don't recommend the time released capsules as you can not control them as well as the tablets), maybe 6 mos, then 1 full tab, then 1.5. When I had to take 2 to still get any effect my doc & I decided to switch for a bit. I have taken the Tenuate for about 2 weeks and it is, for me, inferior to the Phentermine.

5	weight loss	insomnia - first 2 days	I took Ionamin on and off for several years.  It is incredible.  Unfortunately my current doctor will not prescribe it to me.  I definitely recommend it to anyone with weight to lose - in combination with reducing your caloric intake and increasing your exercise.  This medication increases your energy so you're wanting to do more.	F	28	6  times	2/19/2007
5	difficulty losing weight	Duromine - occasion dry mouth when stressed, gassy	I took duromine for 3 mths, had 1 mth break and now am back on it. The first 3 mths I lost over 15 kgs, gained 3 on the break (my own error) and have now lost 6 kgs after 3 weeks of being back on the pills which is a total weight loss of 18 kgs. I have had weight problems since I hit puberty and this is the only thing besides killing myself with over-exercising that works. The first night I had problems sleeping but only because I read too much about the problems that I may have. The best thing to do is just to tell yourself you don't have sleep problems and close your eyes (this worked for me, but it's a case by case thing). I can manage to eat two pieces of fruit and dinner in a day and weigh myself twice a day as the weight differs morning and night - it's a good guide to know what does and doesn't make you lose weight each day. The first week I stayed off the scales and thought I had gained weight as I didn't know what time of day I am at my lightest.. I feel much more confident, h	F	23	4  months	1/14/2007
2	lose weight	very speedy, chewing on inside of cheeks, sore, raw, under the tongue.short temper. unquenshable thirst. no sleep at all. super irritable and impatient. can't focus well,can't do math,or think properly at times.very powerful mood altering drug.	works for surpressing the appitite, but the side effects are just too severe. dry mouth is so uncomfortable, and cheek chewing really bad. nerves are shot!! would compare it to 50 cups of strong coffee!!Be carefull!! Only try a few days first for sure.	F	50	7  days	9/1/2006
3	Lose weight	Increased heart beat, increased alterness and agitation, appetite almost disappeared but when I forgot to eat anything, I felt dizzy & weak. Recommend eating eggs or tin of tuna every few hours. Day 4 - bad stomach cramps!!		F	27	4  days	5/2/2006
