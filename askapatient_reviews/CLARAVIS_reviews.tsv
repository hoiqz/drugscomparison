5	Moderate cystic acne	Update: I am now taking this medication for three months and am experiencing joint pain, lower back pain, and heel pain. I am also experiencing a major loss of appetite and have dropped from a healthy size 10 to a size 8. The dry skin, dry lips, eyes and mouth still persist. My acne got worse for awhile but is now starting to clear up dramatically. I'm thankful I'll be off this medication in two months. Please only consider this medication if you have severe acne that has not responded to other treatment by a dermatologist. This is a very serious drug and the decision to  take it should be thought out. I will post another update at the end of my Claravis course to let everybody know how everything turned out.

1	mild acne	GERD (Gastroesophogeal Reflux Disease), permanent floaters within my vision, constant lower back pain (that later went away), dry skin and lips	I took this drug for 17 days when I started experiencing lower back pain.  It was not severe, just constant. I informed my physician of this side effect and was told that that was not common for this drug,she said that I probably had a kidney infection.(I did not.) I got online and discovered that this was a common side effect of the drug and got so scared about it that I decided to stop taking it....It was too late. The day I stop, I developed heartburn that evening. The heartburn was constant and would just get worse after eating. I have had it everyday since then. Now, I have been diagnosed with Acid Reflux Disease. To make matters worse, one week after I was off the drug, I noticed that I had floaters within my vision. My eye doctor says that my eyes are fine but, I still have the floaters. The lower back pain went away within a week but, the more serious side effects have remained. Before this, I was in excellent condition for my age with no health problems....I just broke out a little bit. Now, I have a disease which medications do not work for half the time and I am worried that the floaters will get worse with time. Not only do I wish I had never taken this toxic drug but, I wish I would have never went to the physician who put me on it.	F	26	17  days40mg 2X D	9/4/2010
