1	possible infection	convulsions, severe nausea, migrane headache, severe weakness, diarrea.	Taking this medicine (along with cipro) was a traumatic experience. I only took it for 3 days and I started going into convulstions.  After that calmed down I was so weak I could hardly move for 3 days, and the nausea and headaches were unbearable.  What confuses me is when I went to the ER because of these symptoms they told me to keep taking the flagyl and cipro????????  I felt poisoned!!!	F	25	3  days	8/9/2006
