				F M	 	 	    
5	Rash on back	None.	I used on a "as needed" basis, for about a few months back in 2003.  Rash cleared up and never returned.	F	46	3  months	6/5/2008
4	eczema on legs	None so far, but have only been using it for a week. Not suppose to be a long term cream.	Helped with the itching, but am concerned with the side effects of long term use.  Will switch to a natural product as soon as possible.	F	47	7  days	5/10/2005
