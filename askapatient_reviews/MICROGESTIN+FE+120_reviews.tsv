2	Prevent Pregnancy/Acne Reduction	Breast tenderness for entire time, breast size increased (negative), pain behind eyes and issues with contacts, moodiness and issues with Basal Antral Follicle (BAF) count.	Birth Control user for 10 years including 'The Patch', Nuva Ring, and different pills, never experienced negative side effects until now.  Took myself off Microgestin immediately after learning Basal Antral Follicle (BAF) count decreased which is needed to donate eggs.	F	27	60  days60 1X D	2/24/2013Email

3	Cramp/Heavy Period Relief	Headaches, a lot of nausea.	I've previously taken Junel FE and Gildess FE (all the same generic brands). This was the only one that commonly gave me nausea.	F	18	1  months30 MG 1X D	11/17/2012Email
1	estrogen and hormone balance	I started taking this medicine because my pharmacy quit selling Juvel, my previous med and put me on this generic brand.  I began have terrible night sweats and continued to have periods of being constantly cold and hot all during the day.  Also started having terrible fatigue.  This medicine did not work for me.

2	Pregnancy prevention	Minimal migraine break thrus, acne cleared slight, SEVERE BLOATING AND STOMACH TENDERNESS. I thought I was dying. Getting switched to something else asap		F	25	6  months	7/15/2012
5	Regulate Period	No major side effects	This is the only BC pill that has worked for me (I have tried a few). No depression, no headaches, no anxiety at all. I LOVE this pill. I don't even know I am on it, except for the fact is has cleared my skin and caused me a little bit of weight gain, but we're talking maybe 5 lbs. 	F	34	2  months 1X D	7/9/2012Email
5	Prevent pregnancy	Slight nausea in first 3 months, very light periods and little to no menstrual cramps on this pill and I experience excruciating cramping. From what I read, every single persons body is going to react differently with this pill however.		F	18	1  years	4/5/2012
4	Ovarian Cysts/Acne/Birth Control	Increase in migraine headaches (one per period), slight weight gain, and occasional missed period.	Positives: ovarian cysts disappeared, awful acne (that nothing could help) finally went away, breasts went up 1-2 cup sizes, period went from 8ish heavy days to 2-3 light days only needing a pantyliner, and my pms virtually disappeared. I actually only came on here after realizing the last few months my PMS seems to have gotten worse (emotional--still no cramps!).	F	23	1.5  years1.5 1X D	3/23/2012
5	Perimenopause symptoms	Aside from minor breakthrough bleeding ..this has helped me alot. I dont wake up from night sweats anymore. It has considerably helped with mood swings and insomnia. I will definetly stay on this medication. Every body is different and at different hormonal stages in their life. You gotta find what works for you.		F	43	30  days1/20 1X D	8/1/2011Email
5	Painful periods/endometriosis	Just the usual at first--ALL hormonal birth control will have some amount of side effects the first 1-3 months. Microgestin was suggested to me after several horrible experiences with other BC pills that caused severe mood swings, nausea, etc. Microgestin was easy peasy in comparison--maybe some slight nausea occasionally and a little PMS-type crying, but it paled in comparison to other pills and was a God send considering how bad my periods were.	I take Microgestin 3 months consecutively so I only get 4 periods per year. My periods had suddenly gotten so bad that I would get fevers every month, crippled in pain, couldn't keep down food/water, and I'd have to spend 3 days a month in the hospital. I was skeptical Microgestin would help, but it has truly changed my life! My periods instantly were shortened and lightened--maybe 3 days. Cramping is so minimal that I typically won't take anything for it at all (as opposed to needing IV drugs in the ER). No more fevers, no nausea, no more losing a week or more of my life each month being sick with horrible PMS gastrointestinal symptoms. I can't say enough how much I love this drug. I honestly feel like the luckiest girl in the world to have found it. It's truly changed my life. You just have to stick it out through the first couple months until your periods are stable and go up on dosing if you start experiencing spotting. This is one of the lowest-dose BC pills around, so it may not be strong enough for all.	F	26	4  years 1X D	5/25/2011
4	To stop 2 months of heavy bleeding	Constant spotting in first month (this has stopped). Depression and fits of crying, I thought I was going crazy. Luckily this stopped in the 3rd month. Weight gain in stomach even though I am loosing elsewhere due to diet and exercise. Nausea can occur when taking the pill without food or too late at night. No more migraines!!	After bleeding heavily for over 2 months the pill was one of my best options to stop it. Which it did. I have never had a regular period before so the spotting never bothered me. The mood swings and crying fits were completely foreign and scary. This did not stop until the 3rd month and now I am back to myself. The biggest tip I can give is to take this at the same time every day!! I only experience bad side effects when I do not take it at the same time of day. Luckily my body reminds me within a couple hours if I did not take it at my usual time.	F	28	3  months20 1X D	5/16/2011
5	Pregnancy prevention	None.	I've been taking this BC for 5 years without any side effects. When I started taking it it was like I never did. My periods became lighter and last about 3 days. I have no complaints.	F	21	5  yearsDunno 1/20 1X D	2/16/2011
4	Birth Control	Extreme nausea at first and loss of appetite. Initial weight loss, but now everything is back to normal. Very very emotional though, cry at the drop of a hat. Still get nauseous once in a while. But it regulated my period like magic!		F	27	2  months 1X D	9/20/2010
4	Reduce perimenopause effects	None whatsoever ... I was nervous at first since my Dr prescribed the Brand drug, Loestrin FE ... That was not covered under my plan, so I had to switch.	After 6 months, I contacted my mail order pharmacy (MEDCO) and they switched my prescription to Gildess FE (unbeknownst to me). Now I have to either go on that, or get my doc to send in another prescription that specifies do not substitute.	F	45	7  months20 1X D	8/20/2010
2	Birth Control, Yeast Prevention	Yeast infections, depression.	I tried this pill because I am prone to yeast infections, and my Dr. thought that this pill would be a good one for me to try to remedy it.  For side effects, the yeast infections did not subside, and I became QUITE depressed and emotional while on this pill.	F	26	  1X D	7/22/2010
3	Birth control	weight gain, more balanced mood originally then after a couple months suppressed moods, clearer skin		F	37	4  months? 1X D	5/11/2010
