4	Stop Smoking	This is the 3rd time taking this medication.  The first time it worked like a charm I quit for three years and started back when I started this awful, stressful job which was my fault.  This time I have noticed I have already cut back a lot.  I am experiencing vivid dreams like the rest of you, not necessarily scary or bad dreams just vivid dreams.  One thing I have noticed this time around are the headaches.  I have a headache from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed.  Tylenol etc helps briefly then its back to the headaches.  Also noticed I have been more irritable and moody nothing crazy just a little noticeable. Smoker/pack a day for 27 years.  WISH ME LUCK!!!  :)		M	43	6  days1mg 2X D	4/12/2013Email

1	i took chantix to quit smoking	Chantix absolutely helped me quit smoking, but I quit my great job told my boss off divorced my husband, and because of these thing also had to let my children be with there father most of the time, instead of them being with there mother. It ruined my life. I feel like 3 years later I am feeling better but I feel like I will never be the same. I still don't smoke, how after all of that could you even think of it.

3	Smoking Cessation	I only made it through a month of taking Chantix although it was prescribed for 90 days. I did have very vivid dreams which wasn't a problem. however the depression and weight gain is a problem. its been over a year since taking it and despite much effort I cannot lose the weight I have gained, 30+lbs. for me, I would have rather have continued smoking.	It did help me quit smoking with ease, however I have not been the same since. Not worth it in my opinion.	F	30	30  days30mg 2X D	4/4/2013Email
1	quit smoking	Felt "flat" - realized it was depression.  Nothing has any stimulating effect anymore...not caffeine, sugar, etc.  Once the dopamine receptors are bound by this drug, there are no ups...just flat.	Never had a depressed day in my life (beyond a normal grief in loss) and now I wake up every morning in a fog...taking an antidepressant which kicks in by afternoon and helps a little.  There needs to be research on how to reverse these effects before doctors continue to prescribe it for patients!	F	63	3  weeksas directe 2X D	3/3/2013Email

I now have vision problems. Throat problems which i am on drugs for.  Severe Depression for the rest of my life which i am on drugs for.  I never had any drugs prescribed in mylife.  Now I am spending 200$ a month because I wanted to stop smoking and trusted Chantix.   Do NOT take this ever please.   	FDA needs to take this off the Market  like they have in Europe   please I am begging you. You Are supposed to protect not destroy.	M	44	4  days 1X D	8/26/2012
5	To Quit Smoking	Happiness with a relaxed mind, but restless at night. Dreamed, Little Sleepy in the morning. Other than that, I have had no other side effects.	I think this is the easiest process ever invented, I am Smoke FREE! No cravings, No Urges, No Smoking. I even still hang out with my smoking pals, and it doesn't bother me. I take my 1mg when waking, on empty stomach. Take another 1mg at 4pm, then another before bed. Before taking one before bed, I was restless. This is the miracle pill! After a pack a day for 10 years, I am Smoke Free! Thank you so much Chantix! ZWade-Texas	M	26	29  days1 2X D	8/16/2012Email
2	Smoking	Trouble sleeping, anxiety, restlessness, loss of interest, mood swings, hate towards everything and everyone. Trouble remembering things.	I used to be a very active individual with no underlying mental illness. This drug has made me lose interest in everything I enjoyed. I used to work out everyday. I loved it. Now taking chantix I hate it and can't motivate myself. My relationship is horrible since taking chantix, I think my boyfriend of 3 years is getting ready to leave. My anger goes from a 1 to a 100 in a matter of seconds. This medicine has made me feel bat shit crazy. I still can't give up the smoking. Even though at this point there's no enjoyment anymore.

4	to quit smoking	Third time taking this course and this is first time I have had this extreme fatigue.  No other side effects strong enough to be worth mentioning.  Am quite concerned that other side effects will begin after stopping because of warnings and what I've read here.	took this once and worked like a charm, fell off cigarette wagon at a convention while drinking (still want to kick myself in the butt for that idiot move)  Second try and I thought it was the Chantix giving me terrible headaches so I quit before the first week was out - turned out they were stress headaches.  This is my third try and this time the fatigue is astoundingly bad and the cravings are still hitting me - which did not happen on try 1 or 2.  I'm going to try to stick this out for another 10 days and then wean myself off in  a reverse dose of week one.  Am going to try the reverse dose mostly because of what I've read about after effects and other's experiences ~  figure it's better to be safe than sorry with withdrawing from the Chantix.  I would hate to go through all this fatigue for so long only to go back to uncontrollable cravings and cave in.  Now that would be depressing!	F	58	18  days1mg 2X D	6/26/2012Email
4	To stop smoking	Some dreams, nothing bad. Trouble sleeping at night. Weight gain	Chantix did work for me, i stopped smoking.	F	56	3  months1mg 2X D	6/23/2012Email
5	To quit smoking	HORRIBLE STOMACH ACHES! shortly after taking the medication.	This is my 2nd time taking chantix,, it really does work.. just with the terrible stomach aches,, (even if I do eat prior to taking it) I have to talk myself into taking the pill knowing my stomach is going to hurt so bad. Both times I have used Chantix, I am able to quit after a week of taking the first pill. I've been a long time smoker.. it works great and I didn't start smoking the 2nd time because chantix didn't work. One big stressful event and I think a cigarette is going to help.. I DOESN'T .. looking forward to being a longtime former smoker. Good Luck everyone!	F	42	10  days1 mg 2X D	6/12/2012Email
4	Smoking	Vivid dreams, depression, anger, upset stomach if take without food	This is the 2nd time I have taken Chantix - the first time I was extremely nauteous and was out for about a week. I quit taking the drug and started smoking for 2 more years.  Tried again in March after looking at the pills for 3 months.  It has worked beautifully and was much easier this time - must have been ready. Still have some cravings and have smoked one or two the last  two months but they taste awful and reminds me of how far I have come. Have noticed just recently that I am depressed and angry...hoping that it goes away after my last month. I am only taking 1 pill a day now to try to start weaning. Don't read too much into all these reviews.  The pros greatly outweigh the cons of this drug...I say it's a miracle drug as well. I sure feel better about myself and my bank account is a lot fatter!

4	stop smoking	feeling of intense doom, sleepwalking, anger	4 years smoke free.  I still get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach, almost like I am grieving for cigarettes if I am around smoke now.  Still sleepwalk occasionally...	F	34	  1X D	4/17/2012Email
5	To quit smoking	Week 1: Cigarettes started tasting really bad near the end of weekWeek 2: Did not have a cigarette..no real urge to have one...didn't really think about it....I had REALLY VIVID dreams during this week.  Which included me and my Mom (of all people) fighting ZOMBIES.  (We lost)....no urge or craving to smoke.  i do feel sick when taking meds on a empty stomach.Week 3: No significant urge to smoke.  I have noticed I do like to eat a little more than usual..which I can not afford to do.  I also noticed, I don't drink as much coffee as I use to.  Something else I noticed, (warning TMI) my urine has a really strong (pee-pee) smell to it and it is rather dark in color.	I smoked for 12-13 years.  I am really glad I tried this product! I have never really tried to quit smoking.  However, I have made the New Year's Resolution to quit MANY times and always end up putting it off. It feels good to say "I quit smoking" or "I don't smoke anymore". Overall I am VERY pleased with Chantix!	F	32	3  weeks1mg 2X D	4/12/2012
5	To quit smoking	nausea - HAD to take this with food or I felt sick to my stomachDreams - Yes, what you hear is true.  You will dream more vivid dreams.  Where you normally had 2 to 3 dreams a week that you can recall you will have 3-5 a night and recall every detail	keep smoking while taking something to help you quit?  Awesome!  I smoked around a pack and a half a day, sometimes more.  I haven't smoked a cigg in almost 2 months, now.  This will NOT make you quit, but help you.  I got down to 2 a day and realized I didn't need it anymore.  Only YOU can make the final choice.  If you're not ready to quit then don't bother starting Chantix.	M	29	2  months1mg 2X D	2/19/2012
5	to stop smoking	nausea, some sleeping troubles, feeling yucky, headaches,	I was extremely skeptical to take this drug as I have read some negative feedback from previous people taking it.  But I really wanted to quit and I was unable to do it on my own.  The first week it was hell basically I wasn't myself, feeling depressed, tired and extremely lazy.  The second week it got better.  By the third week while taking 2 x day (1mg pill) I was feeling always nauseas and I hated feeling that way, so I just decided to take 1 x day (1mg) and feel much better.  I haven't smoked since Dec 8th.  I did try to have one just to see if I still like it but the smell and the nicotine did not do anything for me, so I knew that I am slowly weaning myself from cigarettes.  I  think what people need to understand is that it will take some time before you actually start feeling like yourself again.  Any drug out there has some kind of side effect.  I do agree also that this drug is not for everyone.  I'm just glad that I am smoke free and I hope to be this way forever.	F	32	50  days1mg 1X D	1/6/2012Email
1	To quit smoking	Some nausea, loss of sleep, loss of appetite, short temper, gas, vomiting.	My side effects were from when I was on it. Now that I am off it,they are all way worse. I did quit smoking, but the price I am paying now doesn't really seem worth it. I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone.	M	40	8  weeks1mg 2X D	1/5/2012Email
1	smoking cessation	Dizziness, vertigo, depression, inability to feel pleasure, stomach pain, pre-syncope (almost fainting), lack of excitement	After stopping varenicline due to side effects - they side became progressively worse and have not stopped 8 months later.

3	Stop smoking	Depression, Insomnia, Weight gain, Feeling like crap, Sick to stomach,gas , Bad headaches.	I started smoking when i was 16 years old. Its was a habit i enjoyed. But as ive gotten older Ive had children and they hate me smoking. I also started havin the smokers cough in the mornings. But what really made me stop was my Father layin in his death bed with Cancer and he asked me to please stop smoking. I lost my father .He was 60 yrs old. He passed away Sept 14th 2011. I have been smoke free for 40 days!! I want to live to see my great grandkids.  This medicine has made me sick..Its made me want to die. I felt worthless and cried all the time. The first 3 weeks of this medicine Is living hell. Thank God i had family and my boyfriend to help me through. I dont suggest anyone take this medicine and be alone. The medicine works..Im better and im glad im not smoking. But honestley there has to be a better way.	F	37	2  months1mg 2X D	1/2/2012Email
5	Couldn't quit on my own	This is the 3rd time I have quit smoking on chantix and the only reason is because I CHOSE to start smoking again. Not because the pill didn't work. The first two times I had absolutely no side effects, but the 3rd time around I did experience no appetite, really bad dreams, a little nausea and some stomach pain. This was very unsual for me considering I never experienced these side effects before, but I was also under a great deal of stress which could have helped trigger this off. Overall I rate this to be an excellent source to help in quitting smoking, with a high success rate. Not everyone will have side effects, but if you ask me, 1 month of side effects is a small price to pay to quit smoking and be healthy again. I reccommend this product to everyone, if you are serious about quitting. It really works.	Im so proud and happy I quit. My kids are so happy too!	F	29	20  days1 mg 2X D	12/28/2011Email
5	Stop smoking	On day 7 with only a little nausea after I take second pill. Nothing else noticed this time around. This is my second time in about 6 years first time only some crazy dreams that were not out of the norm. Worked great til I ended up drinking at a bar and started smoking again.

5	quit smoking	Minor hallucinations such as bugs on the floor. However i did take alot of LSD as a teenager. Also when i quit drinking 2+ yrs ago and was not on chantix, i saw bugs on the floor a couple of weeks into sobriety.	I went into taking chantix with a complete positive outlook. I told myself im going to take chantix and its gonna work and im gonna quit and im not going to get depressed or want to kill anyone. And it worked! I smoked for 15 yrs and i loved smoking! But i WANTED to quit. I was ready. I still have the obsession but i get on my knees every morning and ask my God to remove the obsession.  It worked for vodka, im sure he will rid me of the obsession soon. Thank you chantix thank you God. Thank you ex-smokers who support me and tell me why i shoulnt pick up that trashy stinkin good for nothin ball n chain smoke. Good luck to you. God Bless.	F	30	4  months1mg 2X D	11/17/2011Email
1	Stop Smoking	Severe nausea, severe stomach pains, severe constipation, severe diarrhea, severe vomiting. Fatigue, laziness, dull mood. Loss of appetite. Everything tasted funny. Crazy dreams (not nightmares). Joint pain, particularly in right elbow. Experienced a very painful lump behind vein on right side of neck. Memory loss and brain fog	Laid on couch for 5 days straight not wanting to do anything, and I am on the computer usually the whole time I am not sleeping or at work. DO NOT USE THIS DRUG, it may ruin your life. I lost all interest in the things I love to do everyday (hobbies). 2 weeks later and still have a very low interest in these things. .  Memory loss and brain fog --  couldn't spit out a word, like keep saying "hunting" when wanting to say "hinting"   NOTE - This medication DID WORK as it was supposed to.	M	38	 30 MG 1X D	11/11/2011EmailHistory
5	to stop smoking		I quit cigarettes on the 10th day of this medication with absolutely no problem. Chantix is a miracle drug in my opinion. I have been a smoker for about 35 years, and was smoking 1 pack a day when I quit.eta:  Still not smoking 5 months later.  Brief, fleeting cravings only occasionally.	F	54	 1 mg 1X D	10/27/2011EmailHistory
5	to quit smoking	Some nausea soon after taking pill, aggression, agitation, mood swings, smelly urine, vivid dreams, some insomnia.	Ok, so the list of side affects seem a bit excessive but it really isn't that bad.  I have been a smoker off and on for the past 12 years and became more of a heavy smoker soon after meeting my husband (he is a smoker too). With that said, we recently found out that we will need IVF to start a family and smoking can no longer be an option for us.  I want to be healthy and have the best body for carrying a baby.  The Chantix works like a charm. I quit after the prep week 7 days.  I do have some cravings, and at times they are a bit strong but I just feel deep down inside that I don't need the cigarette and the urge will pass.  I also drink a lot of water. If u have your support system in place you can be successful and will be able to get through the rough patches like yelling in the car in the middle of heavy traffic. My husband is completely understandable and let's me know when my mood has taken a bad turn.  The worse part for me is the insomnia...I get very little sleep and this is every single night.  I get up to go to the restroom and then I'm up for the rest of the morning. I'm averaging 4 to 5 hours a sleep every day. I want to be a mother more than anything in the world, so I have to loose some sleep but I working to be a non smoker and I want it to be for a life time and Chantix is helping me get there.	F	33	3  weeks1mg 2X D	10/26/2011Email
4	To become a Non-Smoker	A few vivid dreams the first week.  When I stopped smoking altogether I was extremely sad, depressed, anxious.  Not sure if this was from the Chantix or my body detoxing (I smoked a pack a day for 25 years).  My insurance did not pay for the medicine (which is unfortunate) so I am slowly weaning myself off of the drug (half a pill in the morning, half at night).  I did notice that by doing this, I have had some cravings but nothing that I can't manage.	This drug really worked for me.  I did not have many side effects.  However, it still was difficult to quit (I loved smoking).  Chantix helps with the physical withdrawal somewhat, but for me I had to overcome the psychological withdrawal as well and that was tough.  For those that are struggling, keep going!  For me, things started to get better and now I LOVE not be addicted or controlled by cigarettes.	M	39	60  days1MG 2X D	10/17/2011
4		The first time I had other medical problems and had to get off it to rule out medical problem. This is my second time on Chantix. The last time I was smoke free for 8 months and that was with taking the pills for a week. The mistake I made was not continuing it for the full 12 weeks. So I am back on again to finish it all.	My side affects are very mild; gas and skin kind of breaking out (lightly) but it may be from major stressors in my life as well. I don't like how I feel tired and when I try to nap sleep does not come!! So I just take a sleeping pill at night. I love how I do not have the craving mentally or physically. No bad dreams...just vivid ones. Unfortuantely the drug is not for everyone. But the ones that it does work for...Good luck!!	F	51	10  days 1X D	9/19/2011Email
5	Smoking cessation	Sleep frequently broken leaving me tired in the day.  Occasional insanely itchy forearms!!!  Like right now!  I'm looking for heavy grit sandpaper -- I'm going nuts!  Some gas in the beginning, some vertigo from time to time, dreams have been mild and very pleasant.  I feel very fortunate that my side effects have been minimal.	I know I'm among the very lucky candidates who have had no seriously negative side effects.  The itchy forearms is nearly unbearable when it strikes.  Otherwise, I'm absolutely amazed.  I have absolutely no desire to smoke other than the psychological habit, which is completely manageable since I don't physically crave cigarettes anymore, and I can even hang out with my former smoker friends at work and their smoking doesn't phase me in the least.  And I DON'T nag them, either.  It's a tough choice.  I smoked for about 30 years, about a pack a day.  I LOVED smoking, so the fact that Chantix has worked this well for me really does seem like a miracle!  It's a shame it doesn't work like this for everyone.	F	46	35  days1 tab 2X D	9/4/2011Email
5	smoking cessation	fatigue, vivid (but good) dreams, constipation, gas, smelly urine.	3 weeks in, i am very happy with this drug. yes the side effects are annoying but i can deal with them for 12 weeks if it means i am more likely to stay not smoking for life. was smoking 20 a day for 15 years - quit on day 8 and have not even been tempted to smoke since. after attempting to quit many times before using patches, gum etc..this has been like a miracle drug to me.	F	32	21  days1mg 2X D	8/23/2011Email
5	to quit smoking	First few days I was sleepy and had mild stomach cramps. Still experience mild cramps if take pill on empty stomach. Have had some vivid dreams, but not scary ones.	This drug offered the boost I needed to stop smoking.  I did smoke longer than drug company recommends, but my doctor was very honest with me about having to personalize the pattern of cutting back and not being too harsh about it.  This has worked, and I can hardly believe I can say I've been nicotine free for 9 days and feel great. Started to exercise to control weight gain, though (7 lbs and don't want more!). I would suggest Chantix to anyone as a BIG help once you make up your mind to quit.	F	57	90  days1 MG 2X D	8/18/2011
1	to stop smoking	nausea, depression,anxiety,irritability,sleep problems just about everything..	Very difficult drug to take..this is my third time and I am getting off it tomorrow. I'm afraid I'm going to hurt my kids...	F	45	2  weeks 2X D	8/12/2011
1	Quit smoking	Loss of emotional senses.  Feeling of emptyness. Almost a sense of emptyness in my brain.  I did have dreams while on Chantix, but they weren't horrible...dreams of being with my loved ones who had passed on.	Loss of sense of happiness, severe depression, anger, and hate of everyone and everything around me.  I began to hate my children, my husband, and my 18 mo old grandson, I even avoided my best friends.  I've gained 70 pounds in the three months since I've been a non smoker.  While my smoking habit of nearly 3 packs a day is gone, I'd rather be the person I was before I began my journey with this drug.  My life is really just not worth much anymore.  I wish that I had found this forum and had read the negative effects before hand. I really hope that my life comes back to me someday...	F	43	3  weeks 1X D	8/10/2011Email
1	quit smoking	Lots of side effects for me. Irritability, restlessness,vivid dreams, shortness of breath. So bad I was taken to the ER. I truly thought I was having a heart attack. Turns out I was having a panic attack. Never had one before taking chantix. Doctor said to discontinue the chantix.		F	47	8  days1mg 1X D	8/7/2011EmailHistory
1	to stop smoking	SEVERE Abdominal pain, SEVERE vomiting, SEVERE DIARRHEA, I am no longer taking the drug, but I am left with those side effects...It is so bad, some days I am in the bathroom for hours at a time. I have diarrhea 4-10 times a day, vomit at least weekly and the pain is so bad I have to be put on pain medicine...a high does at that	DO NOT USE THIS DRUG, IT WAS PUSHED OUT BEFORE ANY TEST WERE DONE!!!!!!!! Be warned	M	37	3  weeks 1X D	7/28/2011Email
4	Quit Smoking	First 3 days, during sleep, felt like I was suffocating. Awoke several times thinking I had swallowed my tongue, or couldn't get my breath. Nightmares for first 10 days. The constipation is more than I can stand not having bowel movements for 5-6 days. I've gained 35 pounds as a result.	I find it easy to quit.  I also find it easy to smoke while on it.  None of the usual smoking side effects.  You still need to break the habit of purchasing cigarettes, lighters, etc. But at anytime its easy to stop smoking once you have restarted. Recmmended to me was to take Chantix a month longer than you think.	M	49	120  days 2X D	6/26/2011Email
4	To give up marijuana	Severe inflammation of left side of face and scalp (large amounts of peeling- not sore though just embarressing) including ears (on the third week) . Dark eyes. increased energy. Irritability.Constipation. Severe mood swings. Depression. Extremely REAL dreams. increased heart rate. Extremely talkative (usually a quiet person)Thoughts of questioning my relationship with boyfriend.	It actually works if your willing to put up with ALL these side effects!Gave up properly on the second or third week. Dont give up because it DOES work !	F	19	  2X D	6/21/2011
5	stop smoking	at first a little nausea that stopped when I ate with taking the medication. Vivid dreams (not overly bad) and some gas the 1st week that went away.	I smoke for 27 years and I have been totally smoke free for 17 days and do not miss it. Even though Chantix has a few side effects it is totally worth taking it. I have tried many other ways to quit and have never quit for this long without being totally stressed out. This time it is a breeze!	F	42	3  weeks2 mg day 2X D	5/27/2011Email

5	Stop Smoking	Very tired, stomach ache, some dreams--not bad, though.	Chantix was the only stop smoking aid that ever worked for me. I have tried: patches, gum, lozenges, electronic cigarettes, cold turkey....this is my second time on Chantix--the first time I quit for three months but went back to smoking because I gained 10 pounds. This time-- as I know Chantix will work--I plan to combat weight gain with exercise and diet. Good luck everyone! The effects of smoking no where compare to the inconveniences of Chantix. (I have smoked a pack a day for 37 years--yikes!)	F	52	7  days1mg 2X D	5/2/2011
5		no side effects other than the dreams, which I dont mind... lost a sister a few months back, so in my dreams I am able to see her and talk to her.... so thats a plus in my book	it finally kicked in after about 9 days after my quit date.  Just make sure you get rid of your cigarettes and dont buy any and it will work.	F	47	26  days10mg 1X D	4/15/2011Email
5	Quit Smoking	Lots and lots of VIVID dreams, mostly normal but occassional scary ones in the beginning.  Basically whatever I thought about that day, I dreamt about that night.  Drowsiness, good for night time dose, bad for morning dose.  The worst of all however is the pain and nausea for 15-30 minutes after morning dose.  Have tried everything, with food, w/out food, milk, tons of water, etc...  Just can't escape it.  Will suffer however, because this pill works!	Aside from the gut wrenching pain and nausea during mostly the morning dose, this is a miracle pill.  I took Chantix for 3 weeks before quitting.  The day before my offical quit day, I couldn't even choke down the last 3 cigs I had, and hardly smoked that whole weekend.  So, quitting was easy to say the least.  The cravings are short and with each day, much less.  I am on day 9 and have made it through one full weekend, which I dreaded, but it was pretty easy.  I will obey the warnings from others however not to just go off it all at once.  This has been sort of an anti-depressant for me as well.  I not only quit smoking but have much less desire to drink and have been much more motivated at home and work.  I will ease off the drug eventually and work with my physician to avoid sliding into a depression w/out it.  Good Luck to those out there, I feel like a million bucks not smoking!

5	Quit smoking	The last 2 days, I've had some bloating and gas. Tummy gurgling after eating. I started a blog about my experiences using Chantix because I had read so much about the side effects when I first started using it. http://chantixblog-review.blogspot.com	Overall, I have found quitting to be quite easy on Chantix. I had a firm quit date, and stuck to it. I didn't necessarily wait for the Chantix to really make me hate the taste of smoking. It has really helped with the cravings. I am so firmly resolved in my quit, I feel I could stop taking the Chantix. I hardly have any cravings at all anymore.	F	48	28  days1 MG 2X D	4/5/2011
1	To stop smoking	Excessive gas, bad bloating, nausea, depression, thoughts of suicide, excessive appetite and weight gain, massive constipation, and acne.	I will say, It did stop the smoking.... however, until they get the side effect issues straight, I do not recommend. As of today, looking back, I beleive I would rather die a happy smoker, than a dismal depressed non-smoker. I feel I will be reuming smoking in the future. Hope not, but probably will....

2	QUIT SMOKING	Vivid dreams, nothing bad so far.  Sleep much better. Very tired after taking pill. Bad taste in mouth after smoking. Feeling cold. No other real side effects so far	Its been 9 days still waiting for the "dont want the cigarettes"to kick in. Picked a quit date but that didnt happen. Still craving cigarettes.  Hope this works tried everything else	M	45	9  days 2X D	3/14/2011Email
1	quit smoking	Dizziness, vertigo, anger, depression, frequent episodes of sudden hearing loss, hyperacusis, muscle pain, neck rigidity, insomnia, I lost my job  because of paranoia, depression, aggressiveness. Ocular nystagmus. 2 years after, my life is ruined. Think 1000 times before take this drug!		M	36	28  days1 mg 2X D	3/14/2011
5	To stop smoking	No side effects at all! As long as I eat something before taking pill, I have NO nausea at all!	This drug is a miracle drug. I have had no side effects and for the first time in 30 years I am smoke free! I feel wonderful, NO depression, NO suicidal thoughts, NO weight gain, I have recommended this drug to everyone I know that smokes!	F	46	14  days1mg 2X D	3/8/2011
4	Quite Smoking	Dreams pretty much all night, and sleeping much lighter that  usual. Constant fatigue, drowsiness, moody and loss of apetite leading to a little weight loss.  Constantly cold, not to the point of chills, but noticeably right after taking one and then tapering off till the evening pill is taken.	This is the second time after a failed attempt several years ago trying Wellbutrin.  In my case, it definitely curbs any interest in smoking, especiall compared to taking the Wellbutrin.  But the primary, and secondary side effects are a bit difficult to deal with.  Between a strong desire to quit, and the effectiveness of Chantix, I'm pretty sure this will work.	M	42	3  weeks1mg 2X D	3/8/2011
4	quit smoking	Very vivid dreams, about 50% good, 50% horrible.  Feel like i never get a full night of sleep.  Rapid mood changes, agitation, depression sometimes.  Violent thoughts. noticeable Weight gain.	It definitely takes the edge off the cravings and side effects just make withdrawl effects just a little worse.  But I would recommend this to anyone who has smoked for awhile and at least a pack a day.  Only bad part is some insurances cover it some don't, it costs more then smoking a pack a day for a month, but it does work.	M	21	3  weeks1 mg 2X D	3/3/2011
5	Stop Smoking	Dreams.. Sleepiness..Frequent Urination/Bloating/Tingling -Nasty taste in my mouth/Sensation on Tip of fingers..HORRIBLE GAS-Irritable-moody, but I am sure that came from trying to break the habit of not smoking..	I experienced nausea when I first started taking it, but as long as I take it with a meal or a light snack, I am fine. This drug has worked wonders for me. I mean, all the side effects are manageable, I would rather have them than to continue smoking. I had a hard time trying to break the habit of smoking, even when I didnt crave the cigarette. I eat ALOT of ice, carrot sticks and pretzels and I am fine. I havent had a cigarette in 14 days, I started Chantix about a month ago. I stopped smoking fully after 9 days. I am glad I jumped out there and spent that $150.00 it was well worth it. Luckily for me, all the crazy side effects I heard people were having didnt apply to me. I had the pills for a month before I took them because I was so scared I was going to try and kill myself or someone else, lol. But no, I hate having to remind myself to take 2 pills every day, but I love the way I smell,  my hair, my sense of smell, and Im just proud of me!	M	34	12  weeks 2X D	3/2/2011Email
5	quit smoking	terrible smelling gas, VERY bad odor to urine.  Nausea if taken without food and even with food can still have about 30 mins or so of nausea. vivid but good dreams.  was smoking two packs a day easy and now down to about 5 cigs a day. I used this drug about 2 years ago and totally quit for about 1 and 1/2 years and just do to stress started back but this time is for good. I think this drug is awesome!!		F	43	18  days1mg 2X D	2/28/2011Email
5	Quit Smoking	Nausea breifly after taking, frequent urination, gas, VERY vivid dreams.	This is the second time I am prescribed Chantix; the first I stopped taking it too soon.  I have absolutely no urge to smoke, and don't even think about it at all.  I am thankful for this, however I am starting to experience some of the side-effects full blown.  Last night I was up 4 separate occasions urinating, even though I did not drink much the day before.  Every night I am having dreams that seem so realistic, I wake up remembering everything.  Not that this is a bad thing, but I am someone who rarely has or remembers my dreams.  I have been smoking for 12 years about a pack a day.	M	27	11  days1 pill 2X D	2/24/2011Email
3	quit smoking	The first week was actually very pleasant. I enjoyed my vivid dreams and slept like a baby. After the first week i had to double my dos to .1mg bid and that week was terrible. Everyday i was nautious and sick to my stomach. I had taken my blood pressure because i wasnt feeling well and it was sky high.	my face was flush, i was very aggitated. I cannot take a high dose, it doesnt work well with me.	F	42	7  days.05 1X D	2/7/2011Email
5	to quit smoking	mostly anxiety, anger and depression the third or forth week of prescription that lasted for about one week	i have quit smoking and am so very happy that it worked.  i did not have bad dreams,  but the depression and anger was very strong for the week that i experienced it   i am lucky to have a strong support system and supportive husband.  i do think this medication is worth taking	F	45	3  months1mg 2X D	1/31/2011
2	stop smoking/high blood pressure	Anger issues, wanting to cry all the time, nausea for 30-45 minutes after dose, fogginess, tiredness.	Don't know if this will work or not...the rage at everything is almost worse than the smoking.  Will try for the rest of this prescription, 120.00 is nothing to waste!  Absolutely no desire yet to stop smoking.	M	49	3  days.05 mg 2X D	1/29/2011
2	quit smoking	Severe nausea. No other side effects.	I quit without assistance several years ago. Started smoking again during times of stress. Tried chantix to try to take the "edge" off. The pills made me violently ill within minutes after taking them, regardless of what was in my stomach. After eight days, I quit chantix and went back to will power.  Still smoke free with my breakfast intact.	M	37	8  days1mg 2X D	1/24/2011
3	to stop smoking	Horrible constipation, and gas	I had to take this medication for a whole month before I noticed it worked, I did go down to 1 cigarette a day and had no cravings, but I had to stop taking it because of the side effects to my stomach  Also my insurance didn't pay for it and it cost more than what I way paying for cigarettes	M	48	2  months 1X D	1/6/2011

2	Bipolar 2	Restlessness, waking as early as 3am, anxiety, high blood sugar.	I was not on this medication for very long. I'll admit it improved my mood somewhat, but I was waking as early as 3am and feeling very restless (at first the medication made me drowsy but the longer I was on it the earlier I would wake up). It increased my anxiety to the point that I couldn't work on my uni assignments without freaking out. I had high blood sugar while I was taking it (blood sugar is normal now).	F	25	3  weeks5mg 1X D	2/11/2012
3	Bipolar 2	I was hypomanic after the death of my father in November. Began taking Depakote in early December for anger/rage/mood problems.  Psych suggested Abilify might help Depakote work better.  While my mood is better and my anger issues are nearly non-existent now, I'm finding I'm still a bit hypomanic and the Abilify creates extreme restlessness in me.  While my house has never looked better and I'm getting lots of project done, I find I can't sit still for longer than 10 minutes and by the end of the day my feet ache for being on them so long running around in the house and doing all my projects.	Together with Depakote.  Doc now prescribing propranolol for agitation/restlessness/irritability - would rather prescribe additional med for side effect than change primary meds...and I agree with his decision.  Doc now bumping me up to 10mg 1xday and propranolol 10mg 1xday.	F	36	7  weeks5mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email
1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email
1	Depress or  Bipolar	All side effects what listed on Abilify's instraction. was hospitalas, digestiv sistem  not functionable for  3 dayABILIFY : best killer	only 5 MG of Abilify can kill you in 4 Hs	F	52	1  times5 1X D	2/2/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.	F	52	8  years20 MG 1X D	1/13/2012Email
2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify.

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie).

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011

4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010

3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped. Abilify worked immediately and I haven't been depressed since.	F	24	3  weeks5mg 1X D	5/9/2010Email

Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal.

1	Bipolar spectrum disorder	Restlessness, anxiety, drowsiness, face rash	I went on Abilify at the start of an up period, so I don't know how effective it would have been in treating depressive spells. However, it did counteract some of the effectiveness of my lithium, and I was falling asleep during the day more frequently than usual. Had to go off it because of a rash on my chin/cheeks/ears.

I got depressed due to weight gain, but after several months I feel medication ceased to be effective. This time  was very reluctant (2 yrs later & different Dr. & different anti-depressant medication-Prozack-2 yrs ago) but I am trying it w/ a different antidepressant than previously-Taking now w/ Wellbutrin.

4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue. Negative - I find myself much more emotional - memories, key phrases, smells, songs, pictures, etc.can bring me to tears.	M	50	9  months50 MG 1X D	4/11/2010
2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now. I have woken up from a 12 year-long medication-induced nightmare.	M	57	 15 MG 1X D	4/7/2010Email

2	depression	Nausea the first few days, some constipation, cloudy thinking, increased appetite	Combined with Wellbutrin XL which suddenly stopped working for me after 3 years. After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

Insomnia (but the Seroquel has completely cured that.)	Abilify has helped me like no other drug.  I am on it along with cymbalta, deplin, seroquel and ativan.  Within just a few days I was feeling better and am now able to exercise, clean my house and just moved across the country-something I could never have done during my depression.

3	bipolar depression	unsure if I am experiencing any NEW side effects	this medicine has stopped my obsession with dying.  I am taking this in addition to Effexor XR	F	42	35  days5mg 1X D	2/17/2010
3	Bi-polar, Depression, GAD	Terrible night sweats, very vivid, bizzare dreams, constipation, twitching, extreme lethargy...	I don't feel depressed and sad anymore.  I feel kind of leveled out, but I hate the tiredness all the time.  I can sleep for 10 hours, take my son to school, come home and go back to sleep for another couple of hours.  Then still have little to no energy for the rest of the day.  I was previously, taking 60 mg. of Cymbalta for almost 2 years, but my dr. switched me to this when I started to feel like dying again.  I also take Valium (5 mg.) when I feel anxious and panic coming on.	F	35	14  days5 mg. 1X D	2/12/2010Email

3	Bipolar II, PTSD	Started with 2 mg... upped my mood considerably, side effects then were indigestion, headache, nasal congestion..  those subsided after a few days. Upped to 5 mg, felt like a ton of bricks at first. Seems to be subsiding.	Mood elevation subsided and went back into the "I don't want to see or talk to anyone" and sadness. Yesterday Got upped to 5mg, felt like a ton of bricks at first... seems to be subsiding now, feeling better... will keep you posted	M	52	14  days5 mg 1X D	2/5/2010Email
3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!

2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010
4	ocd, agitation, schizotypal	drowsiness at high dosage, jittery at low. however, sometimes i feel my legs very heavy, other times i've a little akathisia. try to manage the right dosage for you, it's the only way.	it get slow my mind, my obsessions get down almost to not have. i take it in combo with Wellbutrin and Gabapentin, and i feel calmer and relaxed than before. it was horrible only thinking about past.

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010
1	depression, of all excuses	This is to the PARENTS out there who believe that if their child looks passive on the drug it is a godsend:  Beating someone over the head with a baseball bat can also make them sit still.  Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.  No more for me. Abilify- Forgetaboutit!!!!!!!	F	57	3  days	1/30/2010Email

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.

5	anxiety and depression	increased hunger and increased energy	This is a wonder drug for me. I thought I was going do die due to severe depression and anxiety. I am taking cymalta but after about a year, it didn't work. My MD RX'd 5mg of abilify along with my cymbalta every day. In my opinion, it saved my life. I feel like I have a reason to live and starting to enjoy the things I used to, just after one week of starting the med.	F	42	7  days	1/13/2010
