1	have spotting and it won't stop	I have spotting and it had started 2 days after I was taking them I had stopped taking them for 3 weeks now and still have spotting problems, I talked to doctors and they just shrugged it off. And then told me go home, I still want to have more children I am at my wits end!!!		F	32	10  days50 mg	3/12/2013Email
1	Lower back arthritis	Took one pill and 20 minutes later had intense pelvic and back pain. Felt like a miscarriage (I've had 3 of them). This intense, horrid pain lasted 1.5 hours.  Then I had spotting. And terrible bloating and nausea.		F	43	1  days50 mg	2/12/2013
5	Arthritis in low back, knees, hands	I have not experienced any of the side effects.  Arthrotec helps me get through the day		F	54	12  years75 2X D	12/28/2012
5	Osteo Arthritis in both knees	none	I cannot believe the immediate difference this medication had made in my life. I could not get up from my desk without holding onto the desk and walking up the stairs was intolerable.Within one day I felt the pain lessen. I am now walking up the stairs 95 % normal and can actually walk through a mall without having to sit down every 5 minutes. i am in need of a knee replacement, but in meantime feel like I have my life back.

3	Shoulder pain, M.E.	Has been  all OK until recently when I started to get " fluey" feelings  in upper arms, legs etc. As I had just  recently had flu jab  thought this was the cause. However the symptoms persisted, GP said " just flu jab" - but after 4 weeks!Noticed today after  leaving Artrotec off for a day or so ,that things were much better until I took one dose...fluey feelings returned within a hour.Draw your own conclusions.

1	ostoarthritis plus	after taking just one dose, had hunger feeling and stomach cramping, in the eve and through the night constant muscle cramps in my calf muscles, couldn't sleep, had to keep jumping out of bed because of the cramps	I just went for test and haven't gotten results yet, but Dr feels I have more than 1 form of arthritis, I also have a very sensitive stomach, this is cheaper and more approved by health insurance, so that is why  this prescribed.  Seems to me we always have to choose lesser of the 2 evils, I can't deal with Charlie Horses, so I am stopping this med	F	55	1  days50 1X D	11/16/2012Email
1	tmj pain	Went to hospital for my Tmj pain because it was getting out of control. A doctor prescribed me this to take two a day. One pill and 20 minutes later the worse period cramps in my life. After half an hour it passed, but its been a day a half now, and i  still feel sick after eating and random shooting lower abdominal pains. I'm scared to death.		F	24	1  days50	10/25/2012Email

5	hip pain	no side effects	Met with surgon last week to schedule hip replacement. Could not tolerate pain. Was on hydrocodine heavy aand did not like side effects. Almost overnight was 100% pain free. Sorry ladies i don not have bleeding or stomach pains. Truly wish you could have same results as i have.Took 5 years ago for shoulder pain and it worked as well.I am on my feet all day requiring steps and was ready to retire. I danced at a wedding this weekend for the first time in 3 years.	M	62	5  days75 2X D	10/15/2012Email
3	Heel spurs	This medicine helped with the heel spurs, however the side effects were far worse and not worth taking the medicine.  I had bad gas and SEVERE diarrhea along with stomach cramps and nausea.		F	38	3  days75	8/24/2012
1	Ehler's-Danlos	Naseua, vomiting, cramps, dry eyes, loss of appetite		F	46	10  days7(	6/20/2012
1	Chest Pains	Stomach pains, chest pains, anxiety, fatigue, headache, erratic heart beat, raised blood pressure, dizziness, nausea (even when taken with food), blurred vision.	I was given a 6 day trial of Arthrotec along with a 9 day trial of Aciphex on 4/25 (three bottles of three pills). This was a solution my doctor came up with. I've never had consistant heart burn or indigestion, no signs of acid reflux, so I was confused as to why he would offer me this medication. The first day I took both pills, I experienced some dizziness and some nausea and some serious period like cramps. I was at work, so I just had to brush it off. It continued each time I took it. After about two days (two doses), the cramps continued and began inhibiting my menstrual cycle (which I was due to start). So, I googled the side effects of the drug, came across this site, and realized I wasn't the only one with those side effects, so I felt a little better about it. On the evening of 4/30, I suddenly got some serious chest pains, an elevated heart rate (I was laying down with my husband and this was similar to an "I just finished running!" heart rate), hot flashes, dizziness, sever stomach cramps, and weakness in my legs. I literally thought I was dying. It passed within 45 minutes and I was able to go to work the next day. At work (5/1), I was sitting at my desk and the same thing happened. I stepped out to get some air but it didn't work. A friend at work had to call an ambulance. I was filled in by the ER doc that the mixture of Aciphex and Arthrotec was insane and that he was trying to keep from cracking up at my primary doc's decision to combine them.	F	20	6  days 1X D	5/2/2012
4	Lupus/rheum arthritis/fibromyalgia	Random severe cramping, diarrhea, increased menstrual blood flow.	The day I took my first Arthrotec, I started experiencing urinary incontinence. It's not severe but enough to be disruptive and require a pad. I haven't seen this listed in anyone's symptomology. Has anyone else had this experience?	F	37	2  months75mg 1X D	5/1/2012
1	Fibromyalgia/ hip pain	Dizziness, sickness, stomach gas, feel like a bubble of air is stuck in my chest. Hadn't realised it was related until I read this but I get the hunger pangs too, I'm assuming this is the acids and gas in your stomach constantly churning over that make you feel like you're hungry.	I've taken co-codamol for my fibromyalgia for many years which I have very few side effects with. I've recently had this severe hip pain on both sides which the co codamol wasn't touching so I went back to the Dr. He recommended this anti-inflamatory and as he said next stop would be cortozone injections I was willing to give it a try. I've tried it for a week but it makes me feel dreadful. Every time I stand up I have to hold onto something for fear of falling over, I feel sick and light headed and I get those waves of nausea where you suddenly feel all clammy. It's very much like having a permanent hangover, even down to the hunger which until I read thsi site I hadn't connected to the rest of it. I've felt no discernible difference in the pain in my hips and the side effects simply aren't worth it so thats it for me and this drug.	F	42	7  days75mg 2X D	4/30/2012Email
5	low back pain, arthritis in spins	none	I have been concerned about long term effects of Arthrotec, but with chronic back for 9 years I cannot live without it right now.  I was shocked to read some of the comments on this website. I never had any stomach trouble, or cramps, or anything people have mentioned here.  People mentioned Celebrex. A friend of mine developed an ulcer after only a short time on Celebrex.   I do not have any kind of stomach trouble after 8 years.  Would I rather not take it?  Of course, but I have to be able to get out of the bed in the morning.  I have blood work done every year to see if there's any kidney, liver damage or anything, and so far there hasn't been any.  I would recommend it.	F	49	8  years50 mg. 2X D	3/12/2012
1	arthritis	none but it wears off after 15 days	Natural cures are better; apple cidar vinegar can effectively cure arthritis and headaches; vitamin C crystals can help pain at high doses; the Gerson diet with no salt can cure migrains, Fibro etc. see doctoryourself.com and 'just say no to drugs' (Nancy Reagan).

1	Tennis Elbow	Took my 1st pill 5 hours ago & almost immediately experienced sever abdominal cramps. Much like period cramps. Just took 2 Advil to try & combat the cramping pain! Also; some diarrhea. Will not take any more of these!		F	48	1  days75MG	1/20/2012Email
1	Elbow pain	Upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation to loose bowels, excessive hot flashes and night sweats, blurred vision, irritability, chest discomfort. Took with food , did not help.	Took for 7 and 1/2 days. could not take another dose. Very bad drug. Would rather  have the elbow pain!	F	48	7.5  days75 2X D	12/13/2011Email
1	Knee pain	I took my first pill this morning, with food as noted. Rode my bike 12 minutes to work & didn't think I could make it. Got to work, ran to the bathroom with SEVERE abdominal cramping, had massive diarrhea & severe cramping continued for 2 hours. I had to leave work & go home sick.	I would much rather put up with my debilitating chronic knee pain (waiting for surgery) than to ever take another pill. I spent $100 on the stupid pills - what an utter & complete waste of money.	F	47	1  days75 MG 2X D	12/8/2011Email
4	Hip arthritis	While this medicine did help with my pain, the side affects out-weigh the benefits. My menstrual cycle is completely out of whack, I'm bleeding several times a month. Nausea occurs when I'm hungry - very odd. Irregular cramping.	This has been to date the only medicine to relieve my hip pain, but it's affecting my quality of life. Who wants to have their period all month long and be non-stop nauseous?! If they ever fix the kinks I'll be the first in line, but at this point I don't consider this a safe medication.	F	46	3  months75 mg 2X D	8/24/2011Email
5	Hip	Bleeding mini periods, lightheaded some time, finger tingling when I wake up		F	61	3  years50 mg 1X D	8/11/2011Email
4	pain in in hands, knees and feet	just starting to feel tired this week after 3 weeks on the medication and that is the only bad side effect.  I think I will try once a day.  I could not walk or open my hands in the morning until I took this.  I had a hysterectomy over 10 years ago, so it does not affect my period.		F	52	30  days50 mg 2X D	7/28/2011
4	arthritis in lower back	the first pill i took it caused severe abdominal pain but after taking the first one it never did that again , but recently i've been feeling like my stomach is full and empty at the same time hard to explain but thats what it felt like , and also have been getting bruises allover my body due to this drug , other than that my back is back to normal now and i am back at work		F	25	2  weeks75mg 2X D	7/21/2011Email
1	Arthritis in hands, knees	headaches, extreme tiredness, worse heartburn in back of throat, hunger pangs, dry mouth, severe lower abdominal pain/cramping, very irritable.	Helped with pain BUT side effects outweigh benefits.  No periods for 10 years, but felt like the worst PMS symptoms ever.  This drug should not be taken by women unless misoprostol removed.  As well, GERD much worse.  Stopped taking & contacted doctor.	F	57	7  days50 2X D	7/11/2011Email
3	lower back pain from torn disc	I have been on Arthrotec for a year and a half and have been very pleased that it does help deal with my back pain. However....over the last six months, I have started having vaginal bleeding almost every day of the month. Lots of clotting, and horrible periods. I went to the obgyn and everything came out normal. The doc put me on birth control. But, the bleeding has not subsided. So now I am scheduled to have an endometrial biopsy on Wed. I had an ephiphany last night about Arthrotec and began researching the side effect. When I came across this website, I was appalled that the majority of the females mention heavy/extra vaginal bleeding. I firmly believe this is the answer to my bleeding problem and will be telling the doctor on Monday,	Although this drug has helped with the pain, it is not worth the cost and hassle of bleeding constantly., On top of that, I am now having to have a procedure that a 31 year old should not have to endure. I truly hope that there are no long term effects from this. I have not taken Arthrotec in almost a week, yet I am still bleeding. I do not look forward to the extra pains I will llkely experience in a couple weeks, but I am sure I can find something else to deal with them. I feel that I have become dependent on this medicine to function.	F	31	1.5  years75 1X D	6/26/2011Email
1	joint pain from Ehlers-Danlos Syndr	vaginal bleeding and cramping 2 years after menopause	While this helped some with the joint pain, I was unpleasantly surprised at the return of my period after 2 years. I had severe endometriosis and adenomyosis all my life, plus the impairment in blood clotting due to EDS, so my doctor probably should not have prescribed this drug. I'm not taking any more tablets. Cymbalta 120 mg per day helps enough with the pain.	F	58	1.5  days75 mg 2X D	4/15/2011
1	Joint pain	Anxiety and the feeling I was bleeding inside.  Sudden feelings of cramp like being punched in the stomach.  A general 'scared' feeling and sitting very still in the hope it would go away	I will tolerate the pain before I would ever take this again	M	39	1  days 2X D	3/27/2011Email
1	Endometriosis pain	One hour after taking Arthrotec, I experienced the sudden onset of severe mentrual cramps. I am on the birth control pill and should not have my period for another 3 weeks. I am in so much pain that I cannot sleep, nor can I take Advil for the pain as it is also an NSAID.	The patient warning indicates that this drug can cause an abortion. I wish I'd read my entire monograph before taking the tablet. I would not recommend for women prior to menopause. Nor sure why my doctor thought it would help my endo pain.	F	41	1  times75 MG 2X D	3/24/2011
4	severe lower back pain	After taking the drug for 7 years, i've suddenly developped diarrhea, nausea, loss of apetite, stomach cramps. I've had these symptoms for 4 weeks and i've just realised it could be side effects from arthotec. The problem is if i stop arthrotec I become paralysed by back pain. Seeing the doctor next week. But not sure if my symptoms are due to the drug as i've been on it for so long with no side effects.	After trying several NSAIDs with side effects, I finally discovered arthrotec which relieved the pain and no side effects. I usually take 1 or 2 a day and when the pain gets really bad increase it to 3 a day for one or two weeks.	F	49	7  years50mg 2X D	3/6/2011Email
1	Hip Bursitis	nausea,extreme hunger,stomach pain, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding,cramps.	I really think that my doctor hates me. otherwise why would he give me this poison???? after 4 days of suffering I'm stopping this nightmare and yes there was some improvement with the pain but is not worth to continue	F	39	4  days50 3X D	3/5/2011Email
3	knee arthritis	I have taken 6 pills in the past (75mg each), but the side effect I had from my last pill was awful. It induced severe vaginal cramps without bleeding about 2 hours after I took the medication. I ended up having to take additional medication to get rid of the cramps (pamprin) so that I could sleep. Sat on the bathroom for 30 minutes. If I knew I would have went to bed with a sore knee instead - it hurt less than the cramps.	This is the only anti-inflammatory drug that helps for my knee pain/inflammation and its reliable in that. I take it infrequently, once every several months and 1 pill is often enough for me.	F	35	1  years75mg 1X AN	2/20/2011Email
1	Foot	Within half hour of taking this drug I suffered from excessive cramping. lasted 1/2 hour and continued sporatically over course of several hours. Became tired,fatigue,shortness of breath from pain, dizzy,nausea, unconsolable. went hospital, but sat 5 hours never seen by doctor. drug wore off on its own and went home to rest. Threw away the remaining pills.	Should be removed from market.	F	40	1  days75 mg 2X D	1/6/2011
1	Migraine	Severe abdominal cramping, sweating, period cramps, vaginal bleeding, diarrhea, acid reflux, dry mouth	I would rather have had a migraine than the pain I suffered after taking one of these pills. Don't recommend at all.	F	31	1  times50 mg 1X AN	12/3/2010Email
1	migraine/neck pain	Didn't have much pain relief, and within a few days of starting the meds I began having cramps and heavy vaginal bleeding. My period ended last week and this med made me have another one!		F	26	5  days50 mg 3X D	11/21/2010
1	Lower Back Pain	I was experiencing lower back pain & noticed my spouse had some arthrotec 50mg anti inflammatory pills left. So i read about it online then decided to take one. Then about 20mins later i had MAJOR menstrual cramps & started bleeding. i had rlly bad sickness & ended up puking. . thank god i got the pill out my system, the pain stopped 10mins later but i am still menstrating. This drug cant be good for you if it brought my period on when ive only just finished my last cycle 10 dyas prior to taking the drug! I would not reccomend taking this drug if it hasnt been suggested by your physician. I wont be making that mistake again!		F	22	 50 1X D	11/18/2010
1	Lowe Back Herniated Disc pain	1 month PRN. Horrible lower pelvic pain. Uterus contractions. Bloody vagina the next day. Horrible gastric pain. I am looking for another drug to replace this one. I went to the OB GYN thinking there was something wrong with my uterus but I am completely ok. I am not taking it again.		F	34	1  months75 1X D	11/9/2010
5	arthritis in back	slightly heavier menstrual cycle	An absolute miracle drug for me.  None of the stomach issues others seem to have.  I was at the point where I was becoming highly immobile and in constant pain.  Started taking arthrotec and had IMMEDIATE relief.... honestly never thought I would feel that way again......  recently pain has started to increase though, and not sure if I've overworked my back..... or if I'm becoming intolerant.  Have recommended to two others who have had similar exceptional results for chronic arthritic type issues.	F	49	15  months75 mg 2X D	10/22/2010
2	chronic neck pain	just took the drug about 30 minutes ago and am now experiencing the worst abdominal pain ever, like mentstrual cramps/diarreah cramping combined. i had to keep dropping into a crouched position due to the severity of the lower abdominal pain. i was put on this medication because i was taking such high doses of Advil to quell the inflammation in my neck and back muscles that it caused me to have a GI bleed. but after this little episode, and after reading that it can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, i highly doubt this drug is the best fit for my problem!! i already have anemia due to the gastric bleed. how could my doctor not think of this? i'm also starting to feel dizzy and light headed, and can feel acidic bile at the back of my throat. great!! :|		F	34	1  days50-200mg 1X D	10/21/2010
3	Extreme abdominal pain, headache	I was prescribed this drug because I had spent a whole night in complete agony; abdominal pain, lower back pain, all that I imagine labor pain to be, except I was not in labor. Though the cause of my pain remains undetermined, the Arthrotec combined with Paracetamol pretty much eliminated the pain. This was a big relief, as the 1200 MG of Ibuprofen I had taken throughout the night had done nothing. I only took 1 Arthrotec and 1 Paracetamol and that did the trick.HOWEVER: I had a very bad headache yesterday and Ibuprofen again didn't work. I still had the other Arthrotec pills left, so I took one. Although it alleviated the pain, I got up this morning with heavy vaginal bleeding even though my period ended last week. I was relieved to read that this could be a side effect, as it means I probably don't have something serious, but I will have to be in some serious pain to risk bleeding from the vagina again. Next time I'll try my luck with Paracetamol.	The pill I took consisted of 50 MG Diclofenac and 200 MG Misoprostol.	F	32	1  days 1X D	8/9/2010Email
4	Knee joint injury	Particularly diahrea! Many unscheduled washroom stops over the time I've taken this medication. Lately ankle swelling and lower tendon pain that was not experienced previously.	Males tend to tolerate this medication better than women from my observation. This medication helped get me back to work and achieve tolerable pain levels and mobility. I stopped taking it for 4 days and the pain returned. Currently take one 75mg dose 2 hours before work and seems to be enough to ease my particular condition. Probably alright for otherwise healthy individuals but those with other medical problems should probably avoid it. It will most likely exacerbate there ill health with unwelcome side effects.	M	57	5  months75 mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	herniated disks, neck pain	Initially, I experienced a slight, but noticeable difference in pain level: the pain was less severe. Within a few days, I noticed acid reflux shortly after taking, and it got progressively worse. It got to the point that I was apprehensive about going to bed; I consistently found myself waking up with acidic bile in my mouth, tasting like I had thrown up.		M	61	40  days75mg 1X D	7/5/2010
1	cervical disc herniation	NSAID gastritis, severe stomach upset after prolonged use. false full feeling, very poor appetite. increased menstruation, 2-3 periods a month instead of once a month, menstrual cramps present with or without vaginal bleeding.	i would not recommend this medication for any female who has not already completed their menopausal phase.	F	24	6  months75mg 1X D	6/12/2010
3	Osteoarthritis and Spinal Stenosis	Some stomach sensitivity	I am taking it only 1 time per day because of the possible side effects.  Without this drug I was severly restricted and could only walk less than 100 meters.  With the drug I can walk 1/2 km and function. I am thinking of increasing it to twice per day and/or getting surgery and/or epidural steroid injection.	F	50	6  months75mg 1X D	5/26/2010
5	exteme pain in shoulder	I have no side effects that I am aware of.	I have tried various pain meds for the shoulder and nothing worked. I was skeptical when my doctor asked me to try Arthrotec but my pain is totally under control without any apparent side effects.	M	59	90  days50 1X D	5/18/2010

4	joint pain	vomitting - I have to fight to not throw up  I am supposed to take this twice a day - but it makes me soooooo sick that I take literally as I a going to bed, so that I am asleep before the sickness kicks in.  I have tried and tried to take the day dose - but I would rather live without the sickness - its just too awful.	very painful joints - but with this tablet, the pain is much much reduced.  If I miss a couple of days I really know about it.  If I could find the same sort of thing without the EXTREME nausea - I would switch drugs in teh blink of an eye.	F	42	4  years75mg 1X D	5/1/2010
2	back pain - motor vehicle accident	No side effect to begin, but now starting to upset my stomach even while taking with food and plenty of water.	Didn't work for me.  Still can't sleep, can't work without pain.  Didn't see any positive change.	M	29	14  days50 2X D	4/8/2010
1	arthritis,neck,thumb,hip,thumb,	started having a severe sudden onset headache in the back of head, resulted in trip to DR, BP was extrememly high, and pulse was high as well, after three shots, and 3 clonidine to bring down bp was recommend to visit ER. Had high BP for another 10 days, before it came back down to normal, and pulse is still extremely high 3 weeks after stopping the medicine.  I only took for 7 days, and it caused this much problems.  Never again, I would not recommend this to use.  I have had 2 trips back to dr, since this happened and a third visit due to the tachycardia is schedule in 3 more days.	I will not use anymore.	F	38	7  days50mg 1X D	3/28/2010
2	Back muscle pain and spinal pain	It began with stomach pain,then slight nausea, then reflux each time I took a pill.After the second pill the same progression of symptoms only now the abdominal gas,cramps and pain would be with me all day.I stopped pills but abdominal cramps persist.	The only good thing I can say about Arthrotec is that I did notice pain relief but I won't put up with the side effects on a daily basis since I spent a long time getting rid of a reflux problem in the past. The abdominal gas,cramps and discomfort are another thing I don't want to see get worse if I keep taking Arthrotec. I've taken Tylenol 3 and never had a problem like this. Perhaps there is something not right yet with Arthrotec.	M	61	1  days75 MG 2X D	3/19/2010
5	Sever arthritis in hands & feet	No side effects	I tried the advertised Arthritis medicines with severe side-effects and only tried this one because the doctor had samples. Instead of taking the pill 2X daily, as prescribed I take it at most once per day, usually about 3-4 times per week, but often skipping a week or two at a time. My arthritis has been under control for years and only causes me trouble if I skip taking the pills for about a month. At the time this was prescribed the doctor was discussing the strongest possible medicines in serious (threatening) doses. This drug has been a god-send for me.	M	43	5  years50 MG 3X W	3/1/2010
1	pinched nerve	I am menstruating with heavy bleeding every 11 days.  Honestly, I can't figure out how I can lose this much blood and still function.  I have horrific cramps to begin with, so I can't say whether arthrotec increased that.  I have endometriosis, so I'm not sure if that is something that doesn't agree with arthrotec.	It did help with the pain I experience with the pinched nerve, but it is not worth it to me to continue.	F	41	40  days75 2X D	2/22/2010
1	osteoarthritis lower half of body	Constipation right from the start and in ladt 4 weeks extreme joint pain at night (just few hours after taking tablets). Pain so bad it disrupted my sleep co pletely. also, extreme itching on legs and arms, so bad I scrathced myself raw. mobility has DECREASED rapidly, especially when trying to go down stairs.	Was warned about possibility of constipation but think doctor underestimated how severe it would get. Arthrotec was supposed to ease my pain not make it worse. Have stopped taking and immediatedly muscle/joint pain eased and sleeping much better. Have reverted to use of co-codamol to ease symptoms as required.	F	50	3  months50mg 1X D	2/21/2010
4	severe osteoarthritis, mainly back	I feel a bit drowsy & have a little blurred vision, so far no gastric problems	I've been on Arthrotec 50 for over 10 years on and off, only taking it when I needed it.  Due to my arthritis getting progressively worse, to the point where I am in tears with the agony, gp's started me on 75 twice a day and I have to take it.  every day for the next month to see how I get on, here goes.

4	arthritis in a foot	I had been taking two tablets per day (one @ breakfast time ,the other @ dinner time) for a couple of years when I was alerted to possible long term side effects & then consulted my GP who advised because of the time I had been taking them to only take them on a "need to basis".I immediately stopped completely but found that I had muscular pains all over my body,I have now reduced my intake to one per day @ breakfast time & find that this has proved a moderately succesful outcome.

1	inflammation in multiple sites	Severe abdominal pain,bloating,gas,nauseous,constant hunger. These symptoms persisted three days after I stopped taking the drug. My stomach is still sore when palpitated after 5 days. Please think twice before taking this drug		F	44	5  days	1/1/2010Email
1	shoulder pain	Took 50 mg arthrotec with one tylenol #3 and within 30 minutes I had the most severe abdominal pain I've ever experienced.  It was more like bowel/uterine cramping.  It was so severe I had to go to the emergency room.  I had spent the day there already for my shoulder pain, was given a prescription and never told of these side effects.  I then spent the night back in the ER for the severe pain.   The doctor thought it was likely the codeine in the tylenol #3 but after reading all these comments, I doubt it very much.	Will never take this medication again.		39	1  days	11/24/2009
4	Lower back pain	Some stomach irritation, feels a bit like my pressure is up (in my head mostly).	I pulled my lower back at the gym 2 times.  last time was about 1 1/2 years ago and it was pretty bad.  Since then my back has really gotten worse.  I still exercise everyday and stretch, but it really is not helping.   I final went to the doctor and i am getting x-rays on my spine tomorrow.  He gave me about 25 samples of Arthrotec 75.  3 days later I cannot believe how good my back feels.  It has to be this drub, because this is the first day i can comfortably bend down with no pain and even touch my toes without bending my knees.  It seems that this drug, like many drugs, works for some and not for all.  as for me seems to be really good.	M	38	3  days	11/19/2009
1	Tendonitis	I took the drug only once, at about 9:00 p.m.  15 minutes later I experienced dizziness, nausea, and stomach pain, followed about 10 minutes later by level 6 pain in major joints (knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, hands).  Elevated blood pressure and heart palpitations.  Still felt somewhat dizzy and sick the next day.  Extreme gas in stomach and intestines for several days afterward.  Had acid reflux-type symptoms for a few days, though I have never had reflux.  Evil drug!!		F	41	1  times	10/31/2009

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.

2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.	F	35	4  weeks15 MG 1X D	8/29/2010Email
5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR.

5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it.

5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.

5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
4	BIPOLAR 2	Severe Hiccups, lasted for 3 days.  Nausea, severe burping, felt like I was going to throw up, lasted for a week.  Slight mania, abbreviated sleep cycles, still having these.  I feel the side effects are worth it because of how well it keeps me from short cycling, which causes way more problems in my life than a little Nausea		M	36	8  weeks15 MG 1X D	6/2/2010
2	Bi-Polar	Lethargic, Weight Gain and Depression has gotten worse.  I want to be taken off this medication.  Having indecisiveness (more than usual) and my OCD has increased.  Not seeing many benefits after being on Abilify for 2 months.  Feeling sadness daily and lack of energy.  Seems to slow me down to a sad halt.		F	53	2  months10MG 1X D	5/29/2010
2	bipolar 2	sleepiness or death tired during the afternoon even after 9 months of taking this med also i'm waking up in the middle of the night; also i decided because of the drowsiness i would go off of this cold turkey- bad decision because he had sweats, nausea and severe headache.....	the doctor wants me to stay on this but the daytime drowsiness is ruining my life and the nighttime waking is too much	F	50	9  months2mg 1X D	5/29/2010
4	bipolar	very beginning days i had a bizarre hyperactive yet peaceful at the same time cleaning mode (well the house needed it since i had been depressed before i flipped into hypo/ mania) mild restless legs, waking up middle night every other night it seems	it seems to be calming me down somewhat from my up following a depression episode...i may need to incr to 7 or 10mg  as i still am having repetitive thoughts / constant urges to shop but has lessend drastically than before beginning taking it.  i have been able to focus somewhat more than before began this drug....was in thoughts randomly shooting off in 50 thousand directions so i have actually lost a little weight 7 pounds being able to focus and be consistent on walking/jog 4 times a week, which pleasantly for me seems opposite to the majority of other posters here...
