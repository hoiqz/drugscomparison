4	strep throat	nausea (which subsided after eating yogurt 3 hrs. after each dose), fatigue, headache and back pain.	I've taken this med several times over the past two years for tooth infection avoidance without any negative side effects.  However,this time was totally different the fatigue and back pain were the worst and i almost didn't take my last five pills because of this.  The back pain started on the second day my doctor said to keep taking the meds, by the fourth day i felt so bad that i started taking them every ten hours instead of every 8.  This eased the nausea and fatigue somewhat along with eating greek yogurt 2.5hrs. after each dose, of course i had to take the meds longer but was able to function better.  I have become quite sensitive to antibiotics as i've gotten older. I will try natural alternatives next time.  of course they have their side effects too but not nearly as bad as prescribed meds., and they get the job done naturally.

1	UTI	None, it didn't work!		F	19	7  days	1/14/2013
1	teeth infection	I started getting clumps of hair falling out. Muscle aches and fatigue.  The amoxicillin cleared my infection, but along with it  came certain side effects.		F	33	7  days500 mg	6/12/2012Email
5	Gum abscess	Great little drug! Some loose stools, but no major problems. Thank God for Amoxicillin. Others have almost put me in the emergency room!		F	49	10  days500 mg 4x	12/25/2011
5	Tooth Infection	No side effects, I wish people would stop being so dramatic as other will people will get paranoid and aviod treating their infection!!	Amoxil is a fab antibiotic, as with any antibiotic space them evenly, every 6-8 hours, eat with them as this will stop nausea or upset stomach and give them a chance to work. More than likely its the infection itself that is making you feel ill not the tablets!!!!	F	34	7  days500 3X D	10/17/2011Email
5	Helicobacter pylori	Mild stomach discomfort. Diarrhea, cramping. Went away after first week.	Helped cure my Helicobacter pylori and I had minor side effects. Still was able to go about the day. I felt better in less than a week after being sick for over a month. Was easy to take, only twice a day, and was highly effective.	F	24	3  weeks1000MG 2X D	5/15/2011Email
3	Ear Infection	Doctor Prescribed me 500mg pills 4 times a day 2 pills at once. When i was taking the 2 pills i would get EXTREME confusion, stomach aches, a feeling of shortness of breath, insomnia and anxiety. After a couple hours it went away but i simply couldn't take 2 of them at a time it was 2 much i dropped to 1 2x a day and the side effects were still there but more more mild.

5	throat infection/bladder infection	No side effects. Cured everything.		F	56	14  days500 mg 2X D	11/21/2010
1	Sinus Infection	The only side effect was adult acne.	Always took the drug after meals and had no other side effects than acne on the forehead. My real issue is the drug didn't have any impact on my sinus infection. I need to go back to the doctor and get Zithromax again.	M	44	10  days500 3X D	7/27/2010
4	Tooth Extraction/Infection	I took this with an OTC product I purchased called AZO YEAST - this contains probiotics which help with gastrointestinal problems and warding off yeast infections, the dose I took was more than recommended on the AZO Yeast Box, but I have taken this before with antibiotics with good results, Take 2 AZO yeast pills about 5 minutes before each dose of the antibiotic and had NO bad side affects. I do recommend the AZO Yeast as most of these penicillin based antibiotics give me yeast infections.	I clench my jaws and i had to have the extractions on teeth I had root canals on because I cracked the roots right along the gumline and the root canals become unsealed and infected... ugh... This medicine worked well but I went back because I still had some pain and swelling in my check and the oral surgeon now gave me Augmentin 875 2 x's a day - I go back on Friday because we haven't ruled out the fact that it could be another tooth abscessed!!

1	tooth infection	A few minutes after the first pill, I developed leg cramps on the side of my left leg that sometimes radiated to the buttock.  As a medical transcriptionist, I feel I can safely say that it felt like vascular pain, like there was no blood flow to the area.  The pain subsided once I went to bed, but the next day, by the end of the day, the pain had returned.		F	50	7  days500 3X D	5/6/2010Email
5	Tooth and Jaw infection	I have a severe anxiety disorder and depersonalization disorder.  All I can say is thank God for Amoxicillin, it's the only anti-biotic I can take.  Most other anti-biotics actually have side effects that can really screw people's heads up... racing heart, anxiety, mood swings, bad dreams.  Amoxil does none of these to me.  Again, thank GOD for Amoxil.		M	32	7  days1500 mg 3X D	4/7/2010Email
1	ear infection	Extreme stomach pain, indigestion and nausea - worse each time she took it - last dose I was ready to take her to the ER	My daughter took this in November.  She had a total of 4 doses.  Ever since taking this drug she has had trouble with her stomach. Reflux, constipation and food sensitivities. I have taken her to an ENT and a GI.  They can find nothing wrong with her.  I think it was from the Amoxil.  Anybody else out there have a similar reaction?  The doctors prescribed an adult dose of Prilosec for her symptoms, which after reading this site, she will not be taking.  I've got her taking probiotics and really watching her diet - hopefully it will fix itself soon.	F	10	4  days 2X D	2/20/2010Email
5	Trimethylaminuria	little bit of stomach ache, slight headache, clouded head, weird taste......	was taken rocephin shots about 3x a month (almost 70 so far) to clear up this horrible disease, i take 250mg amoxicillin once per day and it keeps it at bay	M	39	3  years	12/1/2009Email

5	bronchitis	I took the liquid form, so I got thrush, but it was easily cured with Nystatin. Otherwise, I had no side effects.	I had terrible bronchitis for weeks, as I was scared to take anything for it.  The Amoxicillin cured me in several days. I wish I'd had the courage to try it sooner.  It would have saved me weeks of coughing.	M	44	10  days	5/7/2009
1	strep throat	No side effects, but it doesn't kill strep!	My son has taken this drug several times in the past for strep throat, and years ago it used to work.  But this time, after the full 10 days on it, the strep returned a few weeks later...in his anus!  (I'm not joking here.) He got this itchy rash that kept him up at night and hurt when he went to the bathroom.  After several trips to the perplexed doc, she finally did a swab test (down there) and found out he was positive for strep in his anus.  Augmentin worked this time.  I wouldn't trust amoxicillan for strep any more!	M	11	10  days	4/11/2009
5	sinus/lung infection	NONE WHATSOEVER.just take it with food and ull be fine.	this site is scary!people get on here and tell all these horror stories about side effects! i should have never looked this site up! it had me all worried for absolutely nothing!	F	25	875  days	1/10/2008
5	Throat Ulcer	I had no noticeable side effects. The only side effects I felt came from the Tussionex that I was also prescribed.	Other than that it rapidly worked, the scratchy pain in my throat went away, the swelling went down, loose mucous.	F	23	10  days	4/20/2007
2	Abscessed Tooth (extracted)	Seventh day:   pimply red, itchy, painful, rash on upper legs, stomach,lower chest and starting to spread other places	Helped tooth problem, but then got the above rash;  then a vaginal "thrush" and tongue heavily coated (used Monistat and had severe burning by the way)Will not be taking this againLabel:      Apo-Amoxi 550g 3 times a day;  Amoxicillin Trihydrate (Canada)	F	64	7  days	3/15/2007Email
