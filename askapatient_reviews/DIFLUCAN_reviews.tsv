3	Yeast Infection	Severe right side pain in my lower back and liver region! SO MUCH PAIN!	I have a yeast infection for about a month. I took 1 does of diflucan 150mg  at the End of january with no reaction to the product, but it did not clear up my problem. A month later I got tested and still had yeast. My doctor recommend that I try one 150mg does every 3 days for 3 doses. I was like thats fine since I had no reactions and it would only be about a week and Iam desperate. After the first 3 days everything was fine, then i took the second does. Heres where the problem started. Next day started to get right side pain, nothing bad but it was noticeable. It continued to get worse but I thought I sprained a mussel until I took the 3rd does three days later...... THE PAIN GOT WORSE TO THE POINT 800MG OF IBUPROFEN DID NOT WORK. IT HURT SO BAD!!! I ended up in urgent care for 12 hours to get a CT  to make sure i didnt have a ovarian cyst or my appendix burst. All said it was not the pill. They sent me home since could not find anything but the pain was so bad i missed school. luckily after that hell I came home and it slowly got better after the drug was complexly out of my system which is why Iam convinced. I have never had this happen before until the pill. BEWARE IF YOUR 110 pounds. It and my liver did not work and I was not even on a long term use.... (ps it stopped the burning in my vaginal region but did not kill all my yeast). I will never take that much again.	F	22	9  days150mg 3X W	3/23/2013
4	Yeast Infection	So far, I just had one day of bad gas.  I had stomach pain at the start, and this medication made it go away.  Before taking this drug, I had been taking 2,000 mg of caprylic acid daily for a month.   I had a bad reaction to that treatment at first--severe diarrhea and vomiting, but it was probably the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction because I got past this after a couple of days.  I'm supposed to remain at this diflucan dose for 4 weeks and then get my liver function tested.  If all is well, I'm supposed to stay on Diflucan for a total of 6 weeks.  I'll be reporting back.

5	fungal meningitis	hoarseness of voice, dizziness, headaches, nausea	Had fungal meningitis twice in my life.  First time around, I took Diflucan for 4 years.  Second time around, (recently), I have been taking Diflucan for two months, 800mg both times.  I am going to be decreasing intake to 400mg, for the rest of my life.	M	45	 800mg 1X D	1/4/2013Email
4	Yeast infection	None	Diflucan usually does a pretty good job of clearing up a yeast infection. Occasionally the infection won't go away with one pill and I have to repeat a pill 2 days after the first. That almost always knocks it out. I've never had any side effects from the Diflucan.

2	Yeast infection	After 2 hrs the sides ifs face were tingly & itchy , went to the pharmacist right away.. Allergic reaction.. Took a Benadryl  symptoms subsided.. Woke up through out the night face started burning red blotchy again the next morning.. Went to the dr. She said stay on the Benadryl for 3 days... It has always worked for me in the past.. Tingly face happened a  couple of times but not like this. Will not be taking it anymore I'm allergic ... Now what?		F	48	1  days150	10/30/2012
3	oral fungus infection	I was taking one pill a day for 5 days(200mg) for possible oral fungus infection. Experienced dizziness and nausea especially the first day. Also some fatigue and raised heart rate. But the side-effects diminished every day. Also am using a medicated mouthwash. Hopefully I will be cured soon!	Every drug gives you side effects....but this one is not really bad!!	F	61	 200 1X O	10/26/2012
4	Valley Feaver	dizzyness, sweating, tightness in chest and stomach - somewhat similar to the feeling you get after eating a lot of food.	Diflucan definitely helped get the fungus out of my lung. Was diagnosed with pneumonia 2 times over the course of 2 years before it was found that fungus has been growing in there, so the infection was pretty severe. After a month, I had no more pain. Wheezing went away after 2 months. I had no side effects for the first 3 months. During the 4th month, side effects got really bad to the point where I had to wait until I had a few hours after taking it where I could relax under a fan.	M	26	6  months200 mg 2X D	9/15/2012Email
1	Yeast Infection	Severe hives, angioedema (swollen eyes, lips, and forehead), swollen glands, difficulty breathing.	The day after the 1st day of a 2 day dose, I developed a small case of hives that I thought was a food allergy.  However, within hours, I intensely broke out into hives, and my face began to swell. I did not take the Diflucan on the second (and the last day of the prescription) because I was taking Benedryl, still unaware of the cause of my hives, but not wanting to mix drugs.  I woke up to angioedema, to the point where I could hardly see, my eyes and lips were horribly inflamed and the hives rash was unlike the kinds I get from food allergies.  The hives were on my legs, torso, arms, knees, back, and feet.  My hands and feet felt swollen (although they looked normal) and I could have sworn that there were hives on my palms and the bottoms of my feet (even though I couldn't clearly see anything). Since the hives were severe, I refrained from hot baths, applied ointment, drank water, and tried to ease the symptoms with Benedryl. The only time I felt good was when I was asleep, but the symptoms would wake me up at times and I struggled to get rid of the burning sensation. After the 4th day, the sweeling in my face subsided, but the hives became aggressive, now covering my forehead, ears, scalp, neck, shoulders, torso, underarms, trunk, buttocks, legs, knees, and the tops of my feet.  The rash was also much larger and more painful than the hives I'm used to experiencing.  It was then that I realized it wasn't a food allergy (which typically lasts a few hours up to a day	F	37	1  days200mg 1X D	7/29/2012
1	vaginal thrush	Had taken it before with no problem. The last 2 times  I have suffered horrific side effects. Swelling of the throat, eyes and lips. Day 2-my eyes began to weep yellow fluid constantly as well as being extremely fatigued. Day 3, eyes still weeping, burning pain in genital area, mouth and lips red and sore. Day 4, eyes STILL weeping, cant lift my arms to shoulder height. Day 5, eyes still weeping and getting stabbing pain behind my left eye. Genital blisters. The skin around my mouth looks badly burned and blistered, EXTREME fatigue. Day 6, weeping eyes becoming better, fatigue remains! NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!! I would rather have thrush!!"!

3	Vaginal Yeast Infection	Took the medicine for 7 days in February, got a nasty cold sore.  Took 1, 150mg tablet in early June, no cold sore but it didn't cure the infection.  Took another dose of 100mg for 7 days, cold sore again.	Dr said it's "not common" but it sounds like people can develop these symptoms.  The last time around they tested me for HIV (I'm thinking, so it's more likely that I have HIV than the medication is causing this?).  I was Negative.  they want me to test again in 2 weeks.

3	Yeast Infection	I took Diflucan a few months back and woke up in the middle of the night because the soles of my feet were extremely itchy and my lips were itchy and swollen. Coincidentally, that day I used a new face wash and lip balm, and had my carpets cleaned so I thought it was one of those things that I was reacting to. I had previously taken Diflucan without issue so didn't think twice about it being the cause.My feet were itchy and tingly for days.Fast forward to tonight  --  I took another dose to treat a YI (6 months after the first reaction). I am now experiencing itchy lips and have put two and two together and have realized that I have an allergy to this med.  I took a Benadryl so hopefully it will prevent the itchy foot reaction.		F	37	1  days150 MG 1X D	4/27/2012Email
2	Yeast infection	Stopped working after the 3rd time I took it. The doctor started doubling up on my prescription to the point I was taking 3. Absolutely ridiculous. It also gives me stomach aches and i believe it doesn't work if your too far into the infection. Never again		F	19	1  days	3/21/2012

1	Recurring Yeast Infection	Headache, Nausea, Dizziness, Light-headed, High Blood pressure, Elevated Heart rate, Muscle weakness, Fatigue, Chest pain... BEFORE TAKING THIS DRUG BE VERY AWARE OF THE POSSIBLE NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS!!!	I am perfectly healthy and I ended up in the ER from taking this prescription and missed several days of work. It has been 6 days since I took the last pill and I still don't feel normal. I would NEVER take this again.	F	23	4  weeks150 MG 1X W	3/9/2012
5	vaginal yeast infection	Within a few hours of taking the first dose I developed these strange little bumps on my face and arms and felt a little lightheaded and breathless. I don't know if it was hives or not but I took an antihistamine and felt better. They have since cleared up. Also, I've had a bad taste in my mouth. Food has tasted a little strange but I'll take that over the awful yeast infection any day!	I had a bad yeast infection and was very uncomfortable with lots if itching and soreness. I had taken Diflucan before so I knew it would alleviate the symptoms quickly with no mess. I was prescribed 2 150 mg pills. I took the first on day one and the second three days later, today. I know my body is still clearing the yeast infection but my symptoms have already dramatically improved. The itching was reduced within a few hours, and each day I have noticed improvement. I was prescribed an external cream for itching but haven't even needed it.	F	27	2  times150 1X D	3/1/2012

The vibrating leg thing has subsided over the year I have been on it.  Chapped lips that never get better.  Loss of body hair (what woman doesn't want that though)	I have a lot of pain in arms, shoulders, neck but I'm not sure if that is the drug or the disease.	F	56	1  years600 MG 2X D	12/19/2011Email

2	Vaginal yeast infection	I was supposed to take the pill once a day for 14 days, but on day 7 I broke out in hives on my abdomen, on day 8 I developed a rash on  my face, and on day 9 the sunshine through my car window hurt the skin on my face like a sunburn, and I began to wheeze, so I stopped taking it on day 10 as I put my symptoms down to the diflucan.	I read everyone's comments here, and I can't believe how prevalent the negative side effects are.  I will use this site to check on other prescribed drugs before taking them!  I pray these symptoms will go away soon,cand I caution others who may think taking it for a longer term will improve their results.	F	52	10  days100 mg 1X D	12/10/2011

1	Oral Thrush	severe hives, migraines, blurred vision, bruised/itchy skin, swollen glands, blisters on tongue, chapped/peeling/burning lips, burning sensation all over body, unsteady heartbeat, horrible fatigue, feeling unbalanced physically and emotionally, can't even begin to list it all, TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!	I felt fine when taking my 10 day (twice daily) round of Fluconazole(the generic Diflucan) but the day after I was finished I started feeling as if I was coming down with the flu and developed hives on my stomach and back. I figured I was having an allergic reaction to something in my clothing/in the air/ etc so I took some Benadryl and went to bed. The next day the hives had spread to my legs, tops of my feet, arms, chest and Benedryl didn't seem to be helping. By the next day it had spread up my neck to my face, ears, scalp, and mouth and started to resemble a severe sunburn that itched and burned. My tongue developed blisters and felt like it was burning. My lips were chapped and peeling and chapstick offered no relief. Then the headaches and the tickle feeling/swelling in the back of my throat began. I now have a cough because of the tickle that isn't helped by drinking water or medicine etc. At one point I thought my airway might close up. Now 95% of my body is covered in a burning/itching/bright red rash. Unfortunately, this all started on a weekend and my doctor has been straight booked so I will finally get to see her first thing tomorrow. I'm concerned she is going to brush me off but I know this is from the Diflucan. This is my first and last time taking this medication. I rarely take meds for anything but recently had my wisdom teeth pulled and had to take an antibiotic to keep from getting any infection which caused me to have oral thrush and a vaginal yeast infec	F	27	10  days200 mg 2X D	12/6/2011Email
1	Oral Thrush	Sores inside mouth, tongue and lips.	My problem started with being prescribed Cephalexin to prevent possible infection on a cyst removal in October.  Needless to say Cephalexin caused problems with the healing process.  I was taken off this drug and the incision healed.  In November came down with a sinus infection was put on Amoxicillin, next thing I know I have oral thrush.  Dr. puts me on Fluconazole 100 mg for ten days.  Developed cold sores, dry lips, sore tongue (ulcers) on tip.  Please think twice about any prescribed medicine your Dr. gives you.  There all toxins and they can play havoc on your system.

4	Oral Thrush	Headache and some stomach upset, but I know it's because this drug is hard on the liver.	To the person who recently posted that they have chronic yeast problems... if you take birth control pills, stop because that can make yeast infections keep coming back. Also, if you have amalagam (silver) dental fillings, get them replaced with white fillings because the mercury in the silver ones compromises the immune system. Chronic yeast is always caused by a compromised immune system. I have the same problem. I will be getting my amalagam fillings removed soon.	F	42	1  days150mg 1X D	11/23/2011Email
2	Precaution from Antibiotics	In the past this has always worked effectively for me. However, this time, my doctor gave me bactrim and diflucan together. I was to take one when I started the antibiotics and the second when I finished. The first time I took it with the bactrim, My mouth felt tingling and throbbing. I could actually feel my blood pressure in my mouth. I felt pricklyna all over my body including my vaginal area. I kept taking the bactrim but with each dose, I felt shaky and my blood pressure rased so I thought I was allergic to the bactrim. I developed a huge blister on the roof of my mouth which hurt so bad, I could not eat or drink anything. After I stopped taking the bactrim, I forgot to take the last diflucan so, a few days later, I took it and the same thing happened. My mouth throbbed, I developed a blister over the entire roof of my mouth, and now, I cannot eat or drink anything from the pain! It hurts so bad. I will not take either of them again. I think they both caused some kind of reaction.		F	38	1  days150 1X D	11/23/2011Email
1	chronic yeast	It made the yeast rise even more. I have been experiencing it for 3 years and no cure. I have also been experiencing bv from time to time and  the yeast won't go away. Sometimes I don't experience it. Could it be possible that I could be immune to diflucan?		F	29	2  days150 mg 1X D	11/20/2011
1	Systemic Yeast Infection	Naseau, stomach pain, throbbing stomach	I have been off the medicine now for 2 weeks and I still have the stomach pain and throbbing.  From what I hear this medication has a long half life and can stay active in your system for a long time.	F	57	19  days200 mg 1X D	11/18/2011Email
3	Recurrent Yeast Infection	I had 3 or 4 yeast infections in the last 12 months. My doctor gave this to me because the last treatment kit didn't completely get rid of the infection. I took this with my lunch yesterday and felt fine until dinner time. I cooked my dinner and started to eat it. Halfway through I couldn't stand the smell or taste of it. This morning I thought I was going to throw up after just a small sip of my coffee. I broke out in a sweat and felt dizzy. I didn't throw up but my stomach still feels funny. I did have some vaginal itching overnight.	So far it has worked othere than the nausea, slight dizziness, and breaking out in a sweat.	F	24	1  days150 mg 1X D	11/17/2011Email
1	yeast infection	I recently had a minor surgery and was given antibotics. I incurred a nasty yeast infection from it and called my dr. for the diflucan. I know from taking in the past that it has caused a cold sore, however, my lip starting itching and burning less than an hour after taking the diflucan this time. A few years ago I suffered from recurring yeast infections and couldn't figure out why I was all of a sudden having painful and huge cold sore breakouts. It always appears in the same spot so I thought I caught this cold sore from someone else. I then realized it was from the diflucan and will NEVER take this pill again!	I read all of the other comments and was shocked to see I am not the only one suffering from side effects of this medication. Some miracle pill. I remember the first time I ever took it I had no side effects and it worked great. But, the more I took it, now looking back this is the cause of this cold sore and am very upset that a medicine to "heal" you can cause another medical and embarrassing issue to deal with for weeks! Oh the burning and itching in both my lip and genital area is crazy!  I hope others will choose NOT to take this "medicine".	F	34	1  days 1X D	10/27/2011Email

A week later I took another dose of150 mg which was yesterday and this morning I woke up and couldnt walk a straight line because of severe dizziness.  I felt like I was going to vomit.  It has lasted all day I feel horrible.	I called my doctor and he said it was so rare to feel like this however after doing my own research I see it is not rare at all.

5	Yeast Infection	No side effects.	Took one tablet which effectively decreased my yeast infections.  Second tablet (4 days later, as prescribed by my doctor) fully healed my infection.  I'm not sure why so many people have ill reactions but I had a pretty cut and dry case.  Oh, and to the woman complaining that it gave her oral herpes... well, I think we all know the truth about that one.	F	28	2  days20 1X D	10/4/2011Email

5	Vaginal Yeast Infection	I had no side effects other than some stomach pain and nausea. Nothing too bad. I have used this at least 5 times and it always works. However, this last time I got severe die off symptoms. My doctor recommended I try a cream along side this, but according to many sources online, that would only make it worse. Be aware of Yeast Die Off. I also have regular yeast infections, so this medicine may be why, not sure.		F	22	2  weeks 1X W	9/1/2011
5	Vaginal yeast infection	Some pronounced and unusual dizziness/fatigue after drinking a glass of wine (avoid alcohol while on this medication)	While on a course of antibiotics I developed some very unpleasant symptoms that, as I found out two weeks later at the doctor, were caused by my first ever vaginal yeast infection (awful experience). I took one 150 mg fluconazole (generic Diflucan) tablet that day; I experienced relief within 24 hours and my symptoms were mostly gone within 5 days. I took another 150 mg tablet 10 days after the first one, and all my symptoms were completely gone within two days of the second tablet. Fluconazole was very effective at getting rid of my yeast infection without me having to deal with OTC creams or suppositories, so overall I'm quite happy with it.	F	22	 150 mg 2X M	9/1/2011
5	Yeast found in stomach	I've always had a positive experience with this drug. However, I've only ever taken it one at a time. Now I'm on a regimen for 14 days so we'll see what happens.	As an FYI when you take Diflucan you will experience something called "yeast die off". You can Google it. When the yeast die they produce toxins that cause many side effects that are blamed on the drug. I'm not saying the drug doesn't cause side effects because it does, just be aware that killing the yeast fungi also causes side effects. It's also important to repopulate your digestive system with a good probiotic. There are many out there but personally I'm going to give Three Lac a try this time around. It sounded promising on the web site.	F	59	14  days100 mg 1X D	8/30/2011Email
3	Yeast Infection	Severe dizziness, tongue tingling, headace	I've taken this drug in the past with no complications or side affects, however the past couple times I have had this reaction to it.  The first time I took it I never put 2 & 2 together and realized it was the Diflucan, I went to my PCP and she gave me some Rx for vertigo which did not help.  This time the dizziness is worse and the tongue tingling started.  I always swore by this drug in the past as the Miracle pill, but in the future no more :(	F	37	1  days150mg 1X D	8/26/2011Email

1	systemic candidiasis	I had a terrible allergic reaction to this drug.  It was prescribed for me because my allergist feels that I have systemic candidiasis.  I had taken Nystatin for four months with no improvement in my wide-spread body pain. Since I was nervous about taking a more powerful drug like Diflucan, I only took 1/4 of a 50 mg. tablet.  Within two and a half hours it felt like a 300 pound weight was on my chest, my throat burned, the inside of my nose was on fire and I felt extremely aggitated and anxious.  Obviously, I didn't take any more BUT six days later, I have small sores on my neck and a few on my wrist - like tiny blisters.  My nose is still a little inflamed but not nearly as bad.  I would NEVER let anyone I love take this horrible drug. I would have ended up in the hospital had I taken the whole pill.	Awful.	F	64	1  days10 mg 1X D	8/12/2011Email

3	Yeast infection	Facial rash and intense itching across my forehead, down my nose and around my mouth.	I have taken this drug numerous times over the years without issue. A few months ago I was on a 7 day course of 100 mg 2x day.  By the second day I started having the facial itching, rash, and ended up with sores on the corners of my mouth.  I thought it was only because of the extended course of treatment.  I needed a course of prednisone to alleviate the allergic reaction.  This time around i only took one 150mg dose and within 2 hours I had the exact same facial reactions.  Two days later and the itching is driving me nuts, even after taking anti-histamines!

1	yeast inf, mold exposure	nausea, violent stomach pain; SEVERE heart palpitations, inability to sleep for 2-3 days at a time; Thyroid tumors	Sunday school student got Whooping Cough, I was forced to take antibiotic - which caused yeast infection. Took diflucan. Had some strong stomach pain & nausea but it cleared up my lungs!  I had lived in an apt with mold 18 mos prior & proceeded to have bronchitis 12 times in 24 mos, to the point of coughing up blood. Diflucan completely cleared up my lungs.  Then I had to move, and didn't realize NEW place also had mold until the rains started.  Took diflucan AGAIN. Moved again. Mold AGAIN. Doctor kept checking liver levels to make sure it was "safe" to take the diflucan, no problems with liver.  HOWEVER, I developed heart palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath (not bronchitis), severe insomnia - sometimes going 2 - 3 days without being able to fall asleep.  Blood work revealed T-3 normal but TSH non-existant. Ultrasound showed 3 or 4 tumors on my thyroid. Radiology said unlikely to be cancer, so I took N-Acetyl Cysteine to detox fluoride from my body. (DiFLUcan is fluoride based - osteopath says is poison to your thyroid) It has taken a good 6 months to get my heart reasonably normal and also be able to sleep.  Thyroid tumors have gone down. ER docs, cardiologist, & other traditional Western docs said No Way diflucan caused this - my osteopath,  alternative MD, & chiropractor say HELL YES it caused it!  I swear I almost died.

1	Possible yeast infection	I took this drug and 5-6 hours later I started getting dizzy, shortness of breath,upset stomach, then cold sweats, dialed 911 and lost conciousness. I went to the ER, they found nothing and told me to continue the drug as prescribed by my doctor. I again, almost passed out with the same symptoms. Went back to the ER and they ran tests again, nothing wrong. DEFINATLY side effects from this drug. No way am I continuing it!! SCARY!	Not for everyone.	F	34	7  days100 1X D	5/24/2011Email
1	toenail fungus	i took my first dose at midnight last night.  when i woke up this morning both of my knees itched a bit.  then my elbows started itching.  the tops of my thighs (in back) started to itch. I realized i had a welt or hive on my butt cheek.  as the day has progressed there are 5 welts on each cheek now.  not so irritating or itching now but dr's office said to keep cool compresses on them for the itching and to stop the meds now.  i thought that a spider had gotten to me in my sleep so my sheets went in the washer.  but now i realize i'm having an allergic reaction.  I'm prety bummed about it.  i've used this medication twice in the last 10 years for toenail fungus with great results.  but not this time, ugh!		F	49	1  days200 mg 1X W	5/5/2011Email
2	Yeast Infection	I am type1 diabetic with mixed connective tissue disease. I get yeast infections regularly since anything off (stress, infection, etc) can cause my sugars to run high. I have taken difulcan over the years. The past 2 times, anywhere I have swelling (arthritis/psoriatic) turns BRIGHT RED, I itch all over and develop a red rash over face and body.	Benadryl seems to help, and with this the second time, I will not use it again. The yeast infection goes away fast on the pills, but the uncomfortable feeling of the swelling and rash does not make it a good fit. When I ask doctors about the side effects, they always try to treat something else. Not worth it.	F	33	1  days 1X D	5/1/2011
3	Yeast infection	Since I have cronic sinusitis & am often prescribed anti-biotics I have been taking the fluconazole 150 mg pill. It has been working fine until these red blemishes showed up on my face after taking it one day. At 1st I thought it was a mixture of the antibiotic & the fluconazole, but since I've been off the antibiotic & had to take the pill again the blemishes came back. In the same places, one big one on my chin turned purple and left a black mark/scar on my face!!! *tears* I am allergic to the over-the-counter creams & this pill has been the alternative, but there has to be something out there that won't attack my face.

2	Vaginal Yeast Infection	Mostly I have been very dizzy.  Upset stomach and feel generally unwell.	This is the second time I have taken this medication in the past month after using the creams.  First dose was stronger and only three pills. Second dose was for 7 days. Worked for a few days both times and then the infection comes back.  Have been given meds for bacterial infection at the same time with the second prescription of Diflucan.  Just want this infection over with but I don't seem to be getting long lasting relief.

4	Valley Fever	stomach cramping, naseau, headache, vertigo, significant hair loss (head, eye brows, lashes)	naseau and vertigo minimized with motion sickness meds. side effects did not become problematic until 7th month and then grew increasingly obvious.	F	43	10  months400mg 2X D	3/12/2011Email
4	Yeast infection	Took 1 pill on Thursday late that night or early that morning rather around 4-5am   I got a Headache/ random pains in my head and a Upset stomach.

1	yeast infection	very bad headache, nausea, shakiness.  Headache has lasted 4 days and still continues - can not get relieve.	I was fine before I took the medicine, within 2 hours a headache developed - and has been feeling absolutely awful for 4 days now.  I WILL NEVER TAKE THIS POISON AGAIN!!

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email

Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.

3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010

I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010

3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped. Abilify worked immediately and I haven't been depressed since.	F	24	3  weeks5mg 1X D	5/9/2010Email

Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal.

4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue.

2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now.

After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

3	Bipolar II, PTSD	Started with 2 mg... upped my mood considerably, side effects then were indigestion, headache, nasal congestion..  those subsided after a few days. Upped to 5 mg, felt like a ton of bricks at first. Seems to be subsiding.	Mood elevation subsided and went back into the "I don't want to see or talk to anyone" and sadness.

3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!

2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010
1	depression, of all excuses	This is to the PARENTS out there who believe that if their child looks passive on the drug it is a godsend:  Beating someone over the head with a baseball bat can also make them sit still.  Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.  No more for me. Abilify- Forgetaboutit!!!!!!!	F	57	3  days	1/30/2010Email

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.

5	anxiety and depression	increased hunger and increased energy	This is a wonder drug for me. I thought I was going do die due to severe depression and anxiety. I am taking cymalta but after about a year, it didn't work. My MD RX'd 5mg of abilify along with my cymbalta every day. In my opinion, it saved my life. I feel like I have a reason to live and starting to enjoy the things I used to, just after one week of starting the med.	F	42	7  days	1/13/2010
4	Bipolar and anxiety	restlessness increased appetite inability to concentrate. Not sure if there are periods of anxiety or nervousness. No Mania	Works for mania. My pdoc says there is activation at low doses. My son started on 10 mg and takes 15 mgs. He also takes 900 mg of lithium and 10 mgs of Lexapro.	M	10	6  months	12/29/2009Email

1	anxiety and mood swings	increased heart rate that made my daughter pass out only after the 2nd day.	after first night of taking my daughter missed school the next day feeling nauseated and stomach cramps. That night she experienced indigestion/heartburn. She vomited. Sleepy but couldn't sleep. Feeling scared for no reason. Next day she passed out after being awake for 15 min. I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug. I got home and looked up the side effects and all of these were listed.  I can only say that we are glad we found out so quickly about this drug.	F	12	2  days	12/19/2009
2	OCD, racing thoughts.	drowsiness, leg pains, akathisia...	it is a great drug to calm down mind... seems to be on a "holy peace"... but side effects are too strong, just for me.	M	23	14  days	12/18/2009
3	bipolar	stopped after 14 months due to heart pulpitations, memory loss, trouble sleeping, slur speach due to excess syliva, after 12 months these things started. At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying. I am very uncomfortable giving a child this age any drug that is diagnosised by trial and error.	M	8	14  months	12/17/2009
2	unipolar depression	nasal stuffiness, dyslexia, word finding problems, increased appetitite, change (worsening) of vision, weight gain and wanting to graze constantly, watering eyes, feel like gravity is heavier (I have to sit down to brush my teeth), very restless around people, visual hallucinations (things disappear then reappear right where I saw them last), trouble focusisng while driving  --- weird.	I am taking 50 mg of lamictal concurrently with 7.5 mg abilify.  Affect is flatter, less mood swings, but more non-reactive than anything.  I'm not sure this is where I want to be. I have been able to get projects done that I had difficulty starting.  Some days I have energy, some days I don't.  I a fasting blood draw yesterday and haven't heard the results yet.  Continuing to take abilify is a quandary -- do I feel worse or better if I factor in all the weird side effects?  I will probably cut down on the dose since I really will be suicidal if I gain any more weight.	F	51	30  days	12/17/2009
3	Bipolar	Some weight gain, some restlessness	My 14 yr old son has been on 2.5 mg of Abilify for 3 months now.  He has gained 8lbs. so we are going to be watching this closely.  It has helped him be able to concentrate, and definitely better in school, and social groups.  Smoothed out the ups and downs.  Previously was on trileptal and zoloft.	M	14	90  days	12/14/2009Email
