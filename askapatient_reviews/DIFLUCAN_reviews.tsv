3	Yeast Infection	Severe right side pain in my lower back and liver region! SO MUCH PAIN!	I have a yeast infection for about a month. I took 1 does of diflucan 150mg  at the End of january with no reaction to the product, but it did not clear up my problem. A month later I got tested and still had yeast. My doctor recommend that I try one 150mg does every 3 days for 3 doses. I was like thats fine since I had no reactions and it would only be about a week and Iam desperate. After the first 3 days everything was fine, then i took the second does. Heres where the problem started. Next day started to get right side pain, nothing bad but it was noticeable. It continued to get worse but I thought I sprained a mussel until I took the 3rd does three days later...... THE PAIN GOT WORSE TO THE POINT 800MG OF IBUPROFEN DID NOT WORK. IT HURT SO BAD!!! I ended up in urgent care for 12 hours to get a CT  to make sure i didnt have a ovarian cyst or my appendix burst. All said it was not the pill. They sent me home since could not find anything but the pain was so bad i missed school. luckily after that hell I came home and it slowly got better after the drug was complexly out of my system which is why Iam convinced. I have never had this happen before until the pill. BEWARE IF YOUR 110 pounds. It and my liver did not work and I was not even on a long term use.... (ps it stopped the burning in my vaginal region but did not kill all my yeast). I will never take that much again.	F	22	9  days150mg 3X W	3/23/2013
4	Yeast Infection	So far, I just had one day of bad gas.  I had stomach pain at the start, and this medication made it go away.  Before taking this drug, I had been taking 2,000 mg of caprylic acid daily for a month.   I had a bad reaction to that treatment at first--severe diarrhea and vomiting, but it was probably the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction because I got past this after a couple of days.  I'm supposed to remain at this diflucan dose for 4 weeks and then get my liver function tested.  If all is well, I'm supposed to stay on Diflucan for a total of 6 weeks.  I'll be reporting back.

5	fungal meningitis	hoarseness of voice, dizziness, headaches, nausea	Had fungal meningitis twice in my life.  First time around, I took Diflucan for 4 years.  Second time around, (recently), I have been taking Diflucan for two months, 800mg both times.  I am going to be decreasing intake to 400mg, for the rest of my life.	M	45	 800mg 1X D	1/4/2013Email
4	Yeast infection	None	Diflucan usually does a pretty good job of clearing up a yeast infection. Occasionally the infection won't go away with one pill and I have to repeat a pill 2 days after the first. That almost always knocks it out. I've never had any side effects from the Diflucan.

2	Yeast infection	After 2 hrs the sides ifs face were tingly & itchy , went to the pharmacist right away.. Allergic reaction.. Took a Benadryl  symptoms subsided.. Woke up through out the night face started burning red blotchy again the next morning.. Went to the dr. She said stay on the Benadryl for 3 days... It has always worked for me in the past.. Tingly face happened a  couple of times but not like this. Will not be taking it anymore I'm allergic ... Now what?		F	48	1  days150	10/30/2012
3	oral fungus infection	I was taking one pill a day for 5 days(200mg) for possible oral fungus infection. Experienced dizziness and nausea especially the first day. Also some fatigue and raised heart rate. But the side-effects diminished every day. Also am using a medicated mouthwash. Hopefully I will be cured soon!	Every drug gives you side effects....but this one is not really bad!!	F	61	 200 1X O	10/26/2012
4	Valley Feaver	dizzyness, sweating, tightness in chest and stomach - somewhat similar to the feeling you get after eating a lot of food.	Diflucan definitely helped get the fungus out of my lung. Was diagnosed with pneumonia 2 times over the course of 2 years before it was found that fungus has been growing in there, so the infection was pretty severe. After a month, I had no more pain. Wheezing went away after 2 months. I had no side effects for the first 3 months. During the 4th month, side effects got really bad to the point where I had to wait until I had a few hours after taking it where I could relax under a fan.	M	26	6  months200 mg 2X D	9/15/2012Email
1	Yeast Infection	Severe hives, angioedema (swollen eyes, lips, and forehead), swollen glands, difficulty breathing.	The day after the 1st day of a 2 day dose, I developed a small case of hives that I thought was a food allergy.  However, within hours, I intensely broke out into hives, and my face began to swell. I did not take the Diflucan on the second (and the last day of the prescription) because I was taking Benedryl, still unaware of the cause of my hives, but not wanting to mix drugs.  I woke up to angioedema, to the point where I could hardly see, my eyes and lips were horribly inflamed and the hives rash was unlike the kinds I get from food allergies.  The hives were on my legs, torso, arms, knees, back, and feet.  My hands and feet felt swollen (although they looked normal) and I could have sworn that there were hives on my palms and the bottoms of my feet (even though I couldn't clearly see anything). Since the hives were severe, I refrained from hot baths, applied ointment, drank water, and tried to ease the symptoms with Benedryl. The only time I felt good was when I was asleep, but the symptoms would wake me up at times and I struggled to get rid of the burning sensation. After the 4th day, the sweeling in my face subsided, but the hives became aggressive, now covering my forehead, ears, scalp, neck, shoulders, torso, underarms, trunk, buttocks, legs, knees, and the tops of my feet.  The rash was also much larger and more painful than the hives I'm used to experiencing.  It was then that I realized it wasn't a food allergy (which typically lasts a few hours up to a day	F	37	1  days200mg 1X D	7/29/2012
1	vaginal thrush	Had taken it before with no problem. The last 2 times  I have suffered horrific side effects. Swelling of the throat, eyes and lips. Day 2-my eyes began to weep yellow fluid constantly as well as being extremely fatigued. Day 3, eyes still weeping, burning pain in genital area, mouth and lips red and sore. Day 4, eyes STILL weeping, cant lift my arms to shoulder height. Day 5, eyes still weeping and getting stabbing pain behind my left eye. Genital blisters. The skin around my mouth looks badly burned and blistered, EXTREME fatigue. Day 6, weeping eyes becoming better, fatigue remains! NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!! I would rather have thrush!!"!

3	Vaginal Yeast Infection	Took the medicine for 7 days in February, got a nasty cold sore.  Took 1, 150mg tablet in early June, no cold sore but it didn't cure the infection.  Took another dose of 100mg for 7 days, cold sore again.	Dr said it's "not common" but it sounds like people can develop these symptoms.  The last time around they tested me for HIV (I'm thinking, so it's more likely that I have HIV than the medication is causing this?).  I was Negative.  they want me to test again in 2 weeks.

3	Yeast Infection	I took Diflucan a few months back and woke up in the middle of the night because the soles of my feet were extremely itchy and my lips were itchy and swollen. Coincidentally, that day I used a new face wash and lip balm, and had my carpets cleaned so I thought it was one of those things that I was reacting to. I had previously taken Diflucan without issue so didn't think twice about it being the cause.My feet were itchy and tingly for days.Fast forward to tonight  --  I took another dose to treat a YI (6 months after the first reaction). I am now experiencing itchy lips and have put two and two together and have realized that I have an allergy to this med.  I took a Benadryl so hopefully it will prevent the itchy foot reaction.		F	37	1  days150 MG 1X D	4/27/2012Email
2	Yeast infection	Stopped working after the 3rd time I took it. The doctor started doubling up on my prescription to the point I was taking 3. Absolutely ridiculous. It also gives me stomach aches and i believe it doesn't work if your too far into the infection. Never again		F	19	1  days	3/21/2012

1	Recurring Yeast Infection	Headache, Nausea, Dizziness, Light-headed, High Blood pressure, Elevated Heart rate, Muscle weakness, Fatigue, Chest pain... BEFORE TAKING THIS DRUG BE VERY AWARE OF THE POSSIBLE NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS!!!	I am perfectly healthy and I ended up in the ER from taking this prescription and missed several days of work. It has been 6 days since I took the last pill and I still don't feel normal. I would NEVER take this again.	F	23	4  weeks150 MG 1X W	3/9/2012
5	vaginal yeast infection	Within a few hours of taking the first dose I developed these strange little bumps on my face and arms and felt a little lightheaded and breathless. I don't know if it was hives or not but I took an antihistamine and felt better. They have since cleared up. Also, I've had a bad taste in my mouth. Food has tasted a little strange but I'll take that over the awful yeast infection any day!	I had a bad yeast infection and was very uncomfortable with lots if itching and soreness. I had taken Diflucan before so I knew it would alleviate the symptoms quickly with no mess. I was prescribed 2 150 mg pills. I took the first on day one and the second three days later, today. I know my body is still clearing the yeast infection but my symptoms have already dramatically improved. The itching was reduced within a few hours, and each day I have noticed improvement. I was prescribed an external cream for itching but haven't even needed it.	F	27	2  times150 1X D	3/1/2012

The vibrating leg thing has subsided over the year I have been on it.  Chapped lips that never get better.  Loss of body hair (what woman doesn't want that though)	I have a lot of pain in arms, shoulders, neck but I'm not sure if that is the drug or the disease.	F	56	1  years600 MG 2X D	12/19/2011Email

2	Vaginal yeast infection	I was supposed to take the pill once a day for 14 days, but on day 7 I broke out in hives on my abdomen, on day 8 I developed a rash on  my face, and on day 9 the sunshine through my car window hurt the skin on my face like a sunburn, and I began to wheeze, so I stopped taking it on day 10 as I put my symptoms down to the diflucan.	I read everyone's comments here, and I can't believe how prevalent the negative side effects are.  I will use this site to check on other prescribed drugs before taking them!  I pray these symptoms will go away soon,cand I caution others who may think taking it for a longer term will improve their results.	F	52	10  days100 mg 1X D	12/10/2011

1	Oral Thrush	severe hives, migraines, blurred vision, bruised/itchy skin, swollen glands, blisters on tongue, chapped/peeling/burning lips, burning sensation all over body, unsteady heartbeat, horrible fatigue, feeling unbalanced physically and emotionally, can't even begin to list it all, TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!	I felt fine when taking my 10 day (twice daily) round of Fluconazole(the generic Diflucan) but the day after I was finished I started feeling as if I was coming down with the flu and developed hives on my stomach and back. I figured I was having an allergic reaction to something in my clothing/in the air/ etc so I took some Benadryl and went to bed. The next day the hives had spread to my legs, tops of my feet, arms, chest and Benedryl didn't seem to be helping. By the next day it had spread up my neck to my face, ears, scalp, and mouth and started to resemble a severe sunburn that itched and burned. My tongue developed blisters and felt like it was burning. My lips were chapped and peeling and chapstick offered no relief. Then the headaches and the tickle feeling/swelling in the back of my throat began. I now have a cough because of the tickle that isn't helped by drinking water or medicine etc. At one point I thought my airway might close up. Now 95% of my body is covered in a burning/itching/bright red rash. Unfortunately, this all started on a weekend and my doctor has been straight booked so I will finally get to see her first thing tomorrow. I'm concerned she is going to brush me off but I know this is from the Diflucan. This is my first and last time taking this medication. I rarely take meds for anything but recently had my wisdom teeth pulled and had to take an antibiotic to keep from getting any infection which caused me to have oral thrush and a vaginal yeast infec	F	27	10  days200 mg 2X D	12/6/2011Email
1	Oral Thrush	Sores inside mouth, tongue and lips.	My problem started with being prescribed Cephalexin to prevent possible infection on a cyst removal in October.  Needless to say Cephalexin caused problems with the healing process.  I was taken off this drug and the incision healed.  In November came down with a sinus infection was put on Amoxicillin, next thing I know I have oral thrush.  Dr. puts me on Fluconazole 100 mg for ten days.  Developed cold sores, dry lips, sore tongue (ulcers) on tip.  Please think twice about any prescribed medicine your Dr. gives you.  There all toxins and they can play havoc on your system.

4	Oral Thrush	Headache and some stomach upset, but I know it's because this drug is hard on the liver.	To the person who recently posted that they have chronic yeast problems... if you take birth control pills, stop because that can make yeast infections keep coming back. Also, if you have amalagam (silver) dental fillings, get them replaced with white fillings because the mercury in the silver ones compromises the immune system. Chronic yeast is always caused by a compromised immune system. I have the same problem. I will be getting my amalagam fillings removed soon.	F	42	1  days150mg 1X D	11/23/2011Email
2	Precaution from Antibiotics	In the past this has always worked effectively for me. However, this time, my doctor gave me bactrim and diflucan together. I was to take one when I started the antibiotics and the second when I finished. The first time I took it with the bactrim, My mouth felt tingling and throbbing. I could actually feel my blood pressure in my mouth. I felt pricklyna all over my body including my vaginal area. I kept taking the bactrim but with each dose, I felt shaky and my blood pressure rased so I thought I was allergic to the bactrim. I developed a huge blister on the roof of my mouth which hurt so bad, I could not eat or drink anything. After I stopped taking the bactrim, I forgot to take the last diflucan so, a few days later, I took it and the same thing happened. My mouth throbbed, I developed a blister over the entire roof of my mouth, and now, I cannot eat or drink anything from the pain! It hurts so bad. I will not take either of them again. I think they both caused some kind of reaction.		F	38	1  days150 1X D	11/23/2011Email
1	chronic yeast	It made the yeast rise even more. I have been experiencing it for 3 years and no cure. I have also been experiencing bv from time to time and  the yeast won't go away. Sometimes I don't experience it. Could it be possible that I could be immune to diflucan?		F	29	2  days150 mg 1X D	11/20/2011
1	Systemic Yeast Infection	Naseau, stomach pain, throbbing stomach	I have been off the medicine now for 2 weeks and I still have the stomach pain and throbbing.  From what I hear this medication has a long half life and can stay active in your system for a long time.	F	57	19  days200 mg 1X D	11/18/2011Email
3	Recurrent Yeast Infection	I had 3 or 4 yeast infections in the last 12 months. My doctor gave this to me because the last treatment kit didn't completely get rid of the infection. I took this with my lunch yesterday and felt fine until dinner time. I cooked my dinner and started to eat it. Halfway through I couldn't stand the smell or taste of it. This morning I thought I was going to throw up after just a small sip of my coffee. I broke out in a sweat and felt dizzy. I didn't throw up but my stomach still feels funny. I did have some vaginal itching overnight.	So far it has worked othere than the nausea, slight dizziness, and breaking out in a sweat.	F	24	1  days150 mg 1X D	11/17/2011Email
1	yeast infection	I recently had a minor surgery and was given antibotics. I incurred a nasty yeast infection from it and called my dr. for the diflucan. I know from taking in the past that it has caused a cold sore, however, my lip starting itching and burning less than an hour after taking the diflucan this time. A few years ago I suffered from recurring yeast infections and couldn't figure out why I was all of a sudden having painful and huge cold sore breakouts. It always appears in the same spot so I thought I caught this cold sore from someone else. I then realized it was from the diflucan and will NEVER take this pill again!	I read all of the other comments and was shocked to see I am not the only one suffering from side effects of this medication. Some miracle pill. I remember the first time I ever took it I had no side effects and it worked great. But, the more I took it, now looking back this is the cause of this cold sore and am very upset that a medicine to "heal" you can cause another medical and embarrassing issue to deal with for weeks! Oh the burning and itching in both my lip and genital area is crazy!  I hope others will choose NOT to take this "medicine".	F	34	1  days 1X D	10/27/2011Email

A week later I took another dose of150 mg which was yesterday and this morning I woke up and couldnt walk a straight line because of severe dizziness.  I felt like I was going to vomit.  It has lasted all day I feel horrible.	I called my doctor and he said it was so rare to feel like this however after doing my own research I see it is not rare at all.

5	Yeast Infection	No side effects.	Took one tablet which effectively decreased my yeast infections.  Second tablet (4 days later, as prescribed by my doctor) fully healed my infection.  I'm not sure why so many people have ill reactions but I had a pretty cut and dry case.  Oh, and to the woman complaining that it gave her oral herpes... well, I think we all know the truth about that one.	F	28	2  days20 1X D	10/4/2011Email

5	Vaginal Yeast Infection	I had no side effects other than some stomach pain and nausea. Nothing too bad. I have used this at least 5 times and it always works. However, this last time I got severe die off symptoms. My doctor recommended I try a cream along side this, but according to many sources online, that would only make it worse. Be aware of Yeast Die Off. I also have regular yeast infections, so this medicine may be why, not sure.		F	22	2  weeks 1X W	9/1/2011
5	Vaginal yeast infection	Some pronounced and unusual dizziness/fatigue after drinking a glass of wine (avoid alcohol while on this medication)	While on a course of antibiotics I developed some very unpleasant symptoms that, as I found out two weeks later at the doctor, were caused by my first ever vaginal yeast infection (awful experience). I took one 150 mg fluconazole (generic Diflucan) tablet that day; I experienced relief within 24 hours and my symptoms were mostly gone within 5 days. I took another 150 mg tablet 10 days after the first one, and all my symptoms were completely gone within two days of the second tablet. Fluconazole was very effective at getting rid of my yeast infection without me having to deal with OTC creams or suppositories, so overall I'm quite happy with it.	F	22	 150 mg 2X M	9/1/2011
5	Yeast found in stomach	I've always had a positive experience with this drug. However, I've only ever taken it one at a time. Now I'm on a regimen for 14 days so we'll see what happens.	As an FYI when you take Diflucan you will experience something called "yeast die off". You can Google it. When the yeast die they produce toxins that cause many side effects that are blamed on the drug. I'm not saying the drug doesn't cause side effects because it does, just be aware that killing the yeast fungi also causes side effects. It's also important to repopulate your digestive system with a good probiotic. There are many out there but personally I'm going to give Three Lac a try this time around. It sounded promising on the web site.	F	59	14  days100 mg 1X D	8/30/2011Email
3	Yeast Infection	Severe dizziness, tongue tingling, headace	I've taken this drug in the past with no complications or side affects, however the past couple times I have had this reaction to it.  The first time I took it I never put 2 & 2 together and realized it was the Diflucan, I went to my PCP and she gave me some Rx for vertigo which did not help.  This time the dizziness is worse and the tongue tingling started.  I always swore by this drug in the past as the Miracle pill, but in the future no more :(	F	37	1  days150mg 1X D	8/26/2011Email

1	systemic candidiasis	I had a terrible allergic reaction to this drug.  It was prescribed for me because my allergist feels that I have systemic candidiasis.  I had taken Nystatin for four months with no improvement in my wide-spread body pain. Since I was nervous about taking a more powerful drug like Diflucan, I only took 1/4 of a 50 mg. tablet.  Within two and a half hours it felt like a 300 pound weight was on my chest, my throat burned, the inside of my nose was on fire and I felt extremely aggitated and anxious.  Obviously, I didn't take any more BUT six days later, I have small sores on my neck and a few on my wrist - like tiny blisters.  My nose is still a little inflamed but not nearly as bad.  I would NEVER let anyone I love take this horrible drug. I would have ended up in the hospital had I taken the whole pill.	Awful.	F	64	1  days10 mg 1X D	8/12/2011Email

3	Yeast infection	Facial rash and intense itching across my forehead, down my nose and around my mouth.	I have taken this drug numerous times over the years without issue. A few months ago I was on a 7 day course of 100 mg 2x day.  By the second day I started having the facial itching, rash, and ended up with sores on the corners of my mouth.  I thought it was only because of the extended course of treatment.  I needed a course of prednisone to alleviate the allergic reaction.  This time around i only took one 150mg dose and within 2 hours I had the exact same facial reactions.  Two days later and the itching is driving me nuts, even after taking anti-histamines!

1	yeast inf, mold exposure	nausea, violent stomach pain; SEVERE heart palpitations, inability to sleep for 2-3 days at a time; Thyroid tumors	Sunday school student got Whooping Cough, I was forced to take antibiotic - which caused yeast infection. Took diflucan. Had some strong stomach pain & nausea but it cleared up my lungs!  I had lived in an apt with mold 18 mos prior & proceeded to have bronchitis 12 times in 24 mos, to the point of coughing up blood. Diflucan completely cleared up my lungs.  Then I had to move, and didn't realize NEW place also had mold until the rains started.  Took diflucan AGAIN. Moved again. Mold AGAIN. Doctor kept checking liver levels to make sure it was "safe" to take the diflucan, no problems with liver.  HOWEVER, I developed heart palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath (not bronchitis), severe insomnia - sometimes going 2 - 3 days without being able to fall asleep.  Blood work revealed T-3 normal but TSH non-existant. Ultrasound showed 3 or 4 tumors on my thyroid. Radiology said unlikely to be cancer, so I took N-Acetyl Cysteine to detox fluoride from my body. (DiFLUcan is fluoride based - osteopath says is poison to your thyroid) It has taken a good 6 months to get my heart reasonably normal and also be able to sleep.  Thyroid tumors have gone down. ER docs, cardiologist, & other traditional Western docs said No Way diflucan caused this - my osteopath,  alternative MD, & chiropractor say HELL YES it caused it!  I swear I almost died.

5	Yeast infection	Very positive experience		F	44	1  days200 mg 1X D	7/1/2011
1	Possible yeast infection	I took this drug and 5-6 hours later I started getting dizzy, shortness of breath,upset stomach, then cold sweats, dialed 911 and lost conciousness. I went to the ER, they found nothing and told me to continue the drug as prescribed by my doctor. I again, almost passed out with the same symptoms. Went back to the ER and they ran tests again, nothing wrong. DEFINATLY side effects from this drug. No way am I continuing it!! SCARY!	Not for everyone.	F	34	7  days100 1X D	5/24/2011Email
1	toenail fungus	i took my first dose at midnight last night.  when i woke up this morning both of my knees itched a bit.  then my elbows started itching.  the tops of my thighs (in back) started to itch. I realized i had a welt or hive on my butt cheek.  as the day has progressed there are 5 welts on each cheek now.  not so irritating or itching now but dr's office said to keep cool compresses on them for the itching and to stop the meds now.  i thought that a spider had gotten to me in my sleep so my sheets went in the washer.  but now i realize i'm having an allergic reaction.  I'm prety bummed about it.  i've used this medication twice in the last 10 years for toenail fungus with great results.  but not this time, ugh!		F	49	1  days200 mg 1X W	5/5/2011Email
2	Yeast Infection	I am type1 diabetic with mixed connective tissue disease. I get yeast infections regularly since anything off (stress, infection, etc) can cause my sugars to run high. I have taken difulcan over the years. The past 2 times, anywhere I have swelling (arthritis/psoriatic) turns BRIGHT RED, I itch all over and develop a red rash over face and body.	Benadryl seems to help, and with this the second time, I will not use it again. The yeast infection goes away fast on the pills, but the uncomfortable feeling of the swelling and rash does not make it a good fit. When I ask doctors about the side effects, they always try to treat something else. Not worth it.	F	33	1  days 1X D	5/1/2011
3	Yeast infection	Since I have cronic sinusitis & am often prescribed anti-biotics I have been taking the fluconazole 150 mg pill. It has been working fine until these red blemishes showed up on my face after taking it one day. At 1st I thought it was a mixture of the antibiotic & the fluconazole, but since I've been off the antibiotic & had to take the pill again the blemishes came back. In the same places, one big one on my chin turned purple and left a black mark/scar on my face!!! *tears* I am allergic to the over-the-counter creams & this pill has been the alternative, but there has to be something out there that won't attack my face.

2	Vaginal Yeast Infection	Mostly I have been very dizzy.  Upset stomach and feel generally unwell.	This is the second time I have taken this medication in the past month after using the creams.  First dose was stronger and only three pills. Second dose was for 7 days. Worked for a few days both times and then the infection comes back.  Have been given meds for bacterial infection at the same time with the second prescription of Diflucan.  Just want this infection over with but I don't seem to be getting long lasting relief.
