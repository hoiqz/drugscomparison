5		it is well tolerated. In fact i had tachy cardia since school days. my heart rate used to be around 110. once in college life doctors at air force hospital declined to clear me for tachy cardia, systolic murmur and nodal rythm. however it all went well without any trouble. after age 55 i started taking it and my heart rate now stays around 85-90, not ideal but not bad comparing to past.	i feel loss of libido may be adjusted with viagra, if advised by doctor.

2	High BP, irregular heartbeat,	Dizzy, scared, feeling like I'm gonna faint, disrupted sleep	I took this med for aprx one year and hated it. Lost weight so my BP was great and I got off of it. My hip returned so I was put back on it again. Now I'm feeling very dizzy at times, and think I'm going to pass out. Feel weird, off balance, loss of interest, and just as I'm going to fall asleep it feels as if I'm going to faint. This happens about 10 times during the night. Was hospitalized for 6 days because of it. The hosp made me stop it to do testing to see if I had kidney problems. I did not so my dr put me back on it. While in hosp they gave me trandate which made me feel fine, no side effect, except loss of interest for a few days. I think I'm going to ask my dr to switch me back to trandate.

1	Heart rate	After a while taking this drug I started to have difficulty getting up the stairs. I found that I was pulling myself up whilst holding the stair rail. On really bad days I would crawl up on all fours to reach the top as my legs just wouldn't carry me. On reaching the top of the stairs I would have to lay down on a bed until my legs felt near to normal as possible. Also, I found doing every day task an effort, i.e. carrying a pile of ironing upstairs, carrying wet washing in basket outside to hang up on washing line (by the time I reached the line my legs would feel as if they were going to give way). Basically I have got to the stage where I can't be bothered to do anything, everything is a chore. I visited my doctor today and she has taken me off this drug not for the weakness in my legs but for the other symptom I have, being, numbness in tips of fingers. She hasn't linked this weakness to the drug. Why aren't these symptoms listed in the leaflet giving advise?	I'm hoping that these side effects don't take ages to dissapear as I want to get my life back.	F	63	3  months25mg 1X D	6/14/2012Email
5	Neurocardiogenic Syncope	At first, I was so exhausted, I couldnt get out of bed. My mom had to help shower me. Couldn't walk. Then I got better and started living normal life again. It completely worked to help me with Neurocardiogenic Syncope. However, after 3 years, I started to notice significant hair loss. I tried calcium channel blockers, but they are not as effective. I am sad about the hair loss, but don't know what else to do because the drug is so effective in treating my symptoms.		F	36	3  years25mg 1X D	6/3/2012Email
5	Hypertension	I started off my taking this medication before I went to bed this way whatever was going to poop me out was finished with when I got up in the moring. Now that I have been on this medication for years I am use to it slowing me up a bit! I might add that my Mom also took this medication for at least twenty years for hypertension and she lived till 96 years of age without having a stroke  or heart attack from hypertension that was first treated at age 50 like myself!	This is an old but good medication for hypertension!  I rather take a medication that's been on the market awhile then newer medications that end up being pulled from the market!

5	Anxiety/panic/MVP	Some mostly mild side effects early on. Stomach issues, and a little spacey at the beginning.	It's been a helpful med for me. I've had panic disorder for a year since taking a dose of a drug called Singulair. I also have a mild mitral valve prolapse that gives me some trouble. So, this helps keep my HR under control. I have naturally lower blood pressure, so I can't take too much. But, I take one pill at night and it seems to have helped with sleep and to help stabilize my body.

4	Palpitations	Hair loss, fatigue, brain fog	I have been taking Atenolol for palps (I've had one A-Fib attack 4 years ago). Lately, I've been experiencing palps again. Not sure if Atenolol is working now. But it did completely stop my migraines.	F	58	4  years50mg 1X D	5/3/2011Email

3	irregular heart beat .	have always suffered with extreme tiredness,beyond the norm!feel the cold ,veryy low bloodpressure.i have suffered with joint and back pain	i was initially diagnose as being anxious and neurotic at the age of 15 and then eventually a dr listened to me yrs later and i got sent to guys for EPS but they were unable to do the op that i needed.i then tryed a number of drugs to regulate my heart which raced at 170.all of them were horrific with side effects.much worse than atenolol, i was then put on atenolol which worked to regulate my heart rate but has lowered my blood pressure which causes the tiredness.i have no choice it seems but to put up with this.i also am unable to  nap in the day or do night duties as this for some reason throws my heart back into irregular rhythms which make me feel very ill and unable to funtion.why this happens no one can tell me.it does effect my life alot and i have to be careful not to drink alochol to much.caffiene effects me.i do get concerned about the long term effects of taking these as i am suffering with rashes,and considerable joint and back painand have done for a very long time which no one can explain why.it was suggested by one specialist that he advised to have a pace maker and not to be taking this drug for long term,back then i declined and now wish i hadnt as every time i have asked for this and was seen by different dr as my old one left they denied that this was offered and say i dont need it ,my advise is dont take it unless you have to, i do at the moment as its better than the dreadful feeling when your heart races so fast. am persuing pace maker option.wish you a	F	42	28  years25 2X D	12/2/2010
5	heart palpitations	None	I can't remember if I had side effects at first.  If anything, I would say the tenormin makes me a teeny bit more tired than usual and--or because--it lowers my blood pressure.I wish all drugs were this easy and safe!!!	F	52	20  years50 mg 1X D	8/26/2010
5	Mild High Blood Pressure/High Pulse	I have no side effects whatsoever. I am completely satisfied with it. I wish OTHER Medicines would not affect me like this has not. This is the best medicine I have ever taken.		F	43	14  years25mg 1X D	8/9/2010
2	A-Fib	The only good thing I can honestly say about this drug is it did finally put me back in normal sinus rythem and keep me there once I figured out to take half of the dose in the morning and half at bedtime. But I started to get some of the not so pleasing side effects and I must admit, I think I got all of them except the male ones. I had hives and itching all over my body, I was so tired and no energy all I did was work and eat and go to sleep. I had such weakness I couldn't even carry my laudry basket that was half full and not to mention the muscle aches and joint pain. My back was so painful that by afternoon and night I couldn't stand and it hurt to move in any direction. The mood swings, either I was crying or wanting to kill someone at almost anytime day or night. I gained 35 lbs over this period of time and no matter what I did to loose it I kept gaining. I could literly see my self get bigger and bigger. I had a very dry mouth, dry eyes, increase thirst and decreased urination	There has to be other alternatives with this medication that doesn't ruin your life. The doctors wouldn't even think about changing my medicine but instead put me on Zyrtex. Thanks!	F	52	5  months50mg 1X D	7/19/2010
5	HBP	Extremely tired. Went from sleeping 5-6 hours a night to sleeping 7-8 hours a night with 2-3 hour naps a couple of times a week.  Have no time for naps.	HBP started a couple of year after I quit smoking 16 yrs. ago. My mother, father, had HBP. My bother and sister had HBP for 30 yrs. before I did. Was on Zestril (cough) Diovan HCT (highest dose (did not work after 1 yr) added lowest dose of norvasc with Diovan HCT and had extreme swelling in feet and lower legs)  I was on 50 mg of atenolol once a day taking it in the morning and around noon was very dizzy. I asked the doctor if I could take 25 mg morning and night. Not dizzy anymore. Blood pressure is now between  128X59X55 to 110X45X45. Going to the doctor in two weeks. Will see what happens. I mow 5 hrs a week, take care of a husband with dementia from a head injury and need to be awake. I have shoveled our 700 foot driveway 4 times this year when our plower could not make it. I am somewhat active, trimming trees, weed whacking, flowers etc.	M	66	11  months25mg 2X D	6/28/2010Email
4	hypertension	A little fatigue, sometimes my heart rate gets quite low, like down into the low 60's, and I find it hard to get my heart rate into the "target heart rate" zone when I do a cardio workout.  Has slowed my metabolism some	This has really been and old reliable for me as far as controlling my bp goes.  It was the first medication I was put on at the age of 22, and I am still taking it today.  I have briefly substituted other meds for this, and I just don't get as good control as when I have atenolol on board.	F	29	5  years50 mg 1X D	6/22/2010
3	Hypertension	I take this medicine along with Micardis. I experience constant muscle aches, lower back weakness and pain, leg and finger cramps, unexplained fatigue.  I have difficulty walking, let alone picking my mail 30 yards away. I also have difficulty climbing upstairs and always use the hand rails to keep my balance and strength. My MD thinks I have arthritis so he referred me to a neurologist and the neurolgist prescribed me muscle relaxing medicine which did not work.	It helped lower my blood pressure from 175/85 to 135/65.

2	High BP	Weight gain, less energy, constantly tired, very low heart rate and pulse	My BP was under control for the first 5 years but started to go up afterwards and my doctor added Diovan.	M	47	9  years50mg 1X D	3/11/2010
5	Palpitations & Blood Pressure.	35 years ago when Ist prescribed was tired for 2 weeks then never had any side effects again.	Been taking Tenormin (Atenolol) generic for 35 years and I know I would not be alive today if it wasn't for this medication. I am 58 years old and started taking it when I was 23 because my blood pressure was so high and was diagnosed with MVP and a slight heart murmur and high blood pressure. I have never stopped this medicine, However, sometimes if I experience palpitations later in the day or night, I take another 50 mg. Of course. this is through my cardiologist orders.It is important to get some exercise during the day. A good brisk 15 to 30 minute walk and a healthy diet are the keys to NO SIDE EFFECTS! Also, it is always important to see your cardiologist at least once or twice a year. I highly recommend this medication if you tend to be an anxious, nervous type A individual that was diagnosed with HBP & MVP.	F	58	35  years50mg 1X D	2/25/2010
3	pvc	To treat PVC's. Worked for many year at 50 mg. Went down to 25 mgs and began having irregular heart beats. Back up to 50 mgs. 25mg in the am and them 25mg no later than 6:00pm. Take it with avalide 12.5/150. Good for blood pressure. Helps with nighttime sleeping because of PVC's trying to go to sleep.Have to take valium 5mg to help with anxiety due to PVC's at night.Lowers heart rate to 50 -55 beats a minute.

4	Heart Palpitations	You have to give this drug a chance in your body. Give it 10 to 15 days for your body to acclimate and the side effects -- lightheadedness and nausea -- will dissipate. Since taking my first pill I have not had any heart palpitations. Atenolol has also brightened my emotional spirits and added a shot of energy. 12.5mg in the AM and 12.5mg in the PM :: GOOD STUFF		M	60	30  days	1/13/2010
1	hypertension	Loss of appetite immediately after taking pill; super hyperactivity; couldn't come calm down  yet felt like it took the edge off  my mood swings; confused, spaced out, dropped my blood sugar to dangerously low levels, cold and terrible metallic taste in my mouth; felt like my tongue was swollen; kept trying to hydrate my lips and throat but didn't want to drink; insomnia	This was one of the most bizarre reactions to a drug I have had to date.  I know whether or not a drug will be good for me one hour after taking it.  I have a history of anaphylaxis to drugs so I'm very afraid of them. I took 12.5mg 2x/day - first day my appetite went away immediately. If you told me I could never eat again, I would  have said fine by me.  The bloating in my stomach immediately went away and I lost 2 lbs the first day because I couldn't nor did i want to, eat.  I felt like I had low blood sugar as I was spacy and confused.  Even when I would eventually put food in my mouth, it didn't help. I drove to NYC with my daughter and her friend to a concert.  I was wide awake by the end of it, and at midnight instead of heading home to CT, I was in the lincoln tunnel heading for NJ and then was stuck on the bridge all the way back from traffic.  We got home 2am and I was still rearing to go and had so much energy it was frightening. My bp was elevated to 179/112 (usually in the 130's-150's/100's).  The next day it did drop to 120's-130's/80's which is good.  But I couldn't deal with energy. I was hoping it would make me sleepy as I never sleep with this hypertension.  I usually go to bed at 2-3am and am up at 5:30am. My dr had me stop it.	F	56	3  days	12/14/2009
1	hypertension	hyperactivity, loss of appetite, chills, metallic taste in mouth, muscle pain, swollen tongue, dry mouth, forgetfulness and confusion	This is a continuation of my previous review. It got cut off because it was too long.After my reaction to atenolol (comments in previous post below), my dr wants me to try corguard/nadolol but I'm afraid to because this drug specifically says "if you have low blood sugar, it could make it worse" and "if you stop it suddenly, you can have a heart attack" - atenolol didn't have that warning. This is now the 5th bp med I am trying, as the calcium channel blockers (norvasc and plendil) had me curled up in a fetal position with a cluster headache like I have never had in this lifetime. I don't get headaches and this was so unbearable I thought I'd die.  They caused vomiting from the headache and elevated my bp to 250/135.  I also tried aldactone which also gave me a bad headache.  I don't know what I'll do if I keep on reacting to these meds.  I was supposed to add doxyzosin 1mg to the atenolol but didn't get that far. I don't like alpha blockers either. From what I read, they are super dangerous.	F	56	3  days	12/14/2009
5	Hypertension	I want to add one item to my previous review dated Oct 31...I switched from Norvasc.This drug has completely eliminated the anxiety I was suffering!  It works much better than the Paxil I was using, and withdrew from a few years ago!   (I believe that others have reported anxiety relief; well, it works for me, also!) This medication might have more side-effects later; I'll update with a year...		F	53	12  days	11/5/2009
3	Hyperthyroidism	Muscle pain weakness and bone pain severe at times, weight gain, swelling feet, terrible back pain can't stand up for more than five minutes before back pain hits and it is excrutiating.	I was prescribed Atenolol 25mg once a day because of Heart palpitations due to Hyperthyroidism and it worked for a little while until my DR. discovered I had a pulse of 40  then lowered my dose to half a pill and next day whole pill worked great for the migraines so left me on them. I used to be able to dance once a week and went for walks every morning but all that stopped, Can't do it anymore without being in pain, lethargic all the time, sleepy, can't concentrate memory loss gained 30lbs I say it's not worth the risks do plan to talk to dr. and stop them gradually.would appreciate any feedback on this has anyone experienced the same things dr. tells me it's nothing to do with the medication but it really started when I started taking this medication. email me	F	43	1  years	11/1/2009Email
4	Hypertension	None so far, that my previous BP med (Norvasc) didn't cause -- mainly tinnitus and cold feet/sensitivity to cold weather.	I wanted a change from Norvasc -- I took it for 2 years for my genetic high blood pressure.  I also have a neurological disease, and it was -- perhaps interacting with my other meds -- causing me many side effects, like extra unsteadiness, dry mouth, etc.  I also take Cozaar (losartin), 100 mg with my 25 mg of atenolol.  (I must take the Merck brand-name Cozaar due to coughing caused by generics.)Few people who find negative side effects of this drug mention their weight...mine is normal for my 5'11" height: 172 pounds.  That seems to really help the most.  Although my high BP is genetic, and can't help that, keeping weight low really helps...you must decide between feeling better or eating as much as you like.  I love to eat, and I eat everything I like, just watch portions.  Exercise is limited for me due to my balance trouble -- I'm in a wheelchair.   "Preaching" finished!	F	53	1  months	10/31/2009
3	lower pulse, high blood pressure	Heart rate went too low	I experienced no real side effect as most others.  50mg dose.  I was taking this because my pulse was over 100.  It did lower my pulse, down to the 40's and 50's which is why I felt tired alot.  Switched to bystolic and that has put me in the 50's and 60's  will give it another 2 weeks and call the doc after that.	F	44	11  months	10/25/2009
1	HYPERTENSION	Sleepy,Lethargic,Dizzy, Difficulty Breathing all the time!!Hard to exercise,always depressed.It affects my life and my work.Makes me feel lazy and incapable of doing things, even to think and make decisions!It is terrible and I agree with a lot of the comments by other people.	It controls my BP well,together with TEVETEN (ARB) for almost 2 years, but during the last few months I was feeling terribly bad.After reading comments on this site, I decided to STOP it.I was tapering the dose from 50mg. to 25mg. during the last 2 months, and to 12.5 mg.during last 1 week until i decided to stop.1st day stopping, I felt great immediately!However, next few days there were spikes on my BP, and the withdrawal symptoms are just as devastating. I need to go to a new doctor, and guess what this new doc told me..."atenolol are bad meds"!!he put me on Isoptin 120mg.every night, and my BP started to slowly go down, and my feelings started to improve too!!I have been out from atenolol for 2 weeks now, and took Isoptin for 5 days.Please do not STOP taking atenolol abruptly, taper it slowly, and consult your doctor. I learned a lesson not to do it alone. it is very risky.Avoid betablockers, unless on extreme need..Thank God I am starting a new life again! This site is very helpful to lot of people.

My bp and cholesterol are controlled. However, I could never determine the cause of my tinnitus, cramping, and dysfunction.

1	hypertension	I experienced fits of intense anger. I was also often confused and depressed. I went from having created a business that provided a high six figure income to having very little because while taking it I made one bad decision after another. All of those decisions were somehow negative because of depression, I think. After almost thirty years of being on it I got off of it and saw my history in a clear and rational way that I had not while on it.	I am taking a only a cheap generic water pill at 65, when my blood pressure should be high. It is mostly in the 110/64 to 140/80 range and I feel great.I believe that I was misdiagnosed in my 30s because I am 6'5' with large diameter arms. I think that the cuff was too small.

I have noticed that it is more difficult to exercise because of the inability for increased heart rate, but it hasn't affected my workouts to the point that I can't continue.  Also noticed mild hair loss.  My ears "ring" almost all the time, which can be annoying.  Is this a common treatment for someone who is having thyroid problems?	F	51	4  months	1/7/2009Email
2	Hypertension	Low heart rate (40), cold hands, palms of hands turned blue after exercise, lethargy.	Atenolol 50 mg. daily is too much.  I exercise daily (30-45 minutes). Made me feel sleepy and out of it.  Hair loss and  ringing in ears.	F	48	3  months	12/28/2008
3	High blood pressure	Headache and loss of appetite.  Also feel that my heart is pounding when I lay down to sleep.	I had pre-existing digestive problems before taking this medication, I don't know if it is aggravating my chronic diarrhea (which is yet undiagnosed) and causing the loss of appetite.  I feel nauseous at times.  I've been told that I have nothing wrong with me except a fatty liver.	F	43	2  months	12/26/2008
1	High Blood Pressure	Terrible constipation, headaches, wheezing & tightness in the chest and worst of all muscle weakness and fatigue.	I had been regular as clockwork for years.  Switched from Benicar when I reached 65 and went on Medicare to avoid "the gap" by using inexpensive drugs.  After 5 days the constipation became so bad I ended up bleeding.  Started on Monday and by Friday when I went to cardio rehab I barely made it through the routine I had been doing without strain.  By Monday I could barely walk and had to cut much of my treadmill work.  In my opinion if I had continued on atenolol 25 it would have destroyed my life.  Fortunately a doctor agreed and I ended up back on Benicar.  She said some people tolerate the drug but she is seeing many with the problems I had.	M	65	7  days	12/8/2008
5	Anxiety	None so far	I have high BP and severe anxiety during public speaking.  Was prescribed 25mg/day.  On a day when I had to give a speach, I took 50mg.  WOW!!! what a difference!! Said goodbye to racing heartbeats, trembling hands, weak knees and quaviering voice. I was back in control and able to deliver without looking nervous.	M	34	10  days	10/4/2008
2	PVC's	dizziness,pounding heart.Upon waking feeling shaky and my mental clarity unfocused.Disrupted sleep.I am still having trouble focusing...I took 25mg at 9:30 pm and it is now 8 am	I personally had one of the worst nights of my life.I would much prefer to deal the PVC's than what I feel like now and last night.It may work for other but be  forewarned.

1	hypertension	Depression, tiredness, felt like brakes were on when trying aerobic exercise, confusion, lethargy, aggitation, inability to react appropriately during negotiations, inability to control anger at times.	I firmly believe that this medicine destroyed my life. I spent my life very successfully negotiating multi-million dollar deals until taking this stuff. It seems that my response to any disagreement was either extreme apathy or extreme anger. When someone provided a reason not to make a deal I would simply accept it even if I knew it was wrong and the deal was great for both parties. I just did not seem to be alert enough to overcome resistance. At other times, I was very angry and could not calm down. Frequently, I felt that I was just tense and ready to overreact to any minor criticism. I was also more confused about things when I was on this in my 30s than I am now in my 60s. It is a horrible drug. I also believe that I was midiagnosed with hypertension because of the use of a small cuff originally, although I did develop it. I am 6'5 and have a 16" inch (muscular) forearm.  I firmly believe that my inability to be sharp during negotiations lost millions of dollars for me. I am	M	64	20  years	9/14/2008

2	hypertension and anxiety (OCD)	Difficult to exercise vigorously.  Used to be a sub-six minute miler, now rarely run and have gained 25 lbs.  Ringing in ears and impotency.	50 mg. is too high a dose.  Norvasc is better in decreasing BP variability.  Mean BP is 116/69.  Can't get my heart rate above 70, and can drop to low 40s.

1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out!

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011

3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.
