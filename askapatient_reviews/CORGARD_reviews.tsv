1	Rate control - A-fib	Terrible panic attacks would come over me without warning.  I thought I was cracking up and never suspected the nadolol since I figured all beta-blockers were the same.  The panic attacks worsened to the point that I was winding up in the emergency room on a weekly basis with blood pressure as high as 190/110.  I finally decided that perhaps the nadolol was the culprit.  I asked my doc to switch beta-blockers and he put me on betaxolol.  Within 2 weeks, the panic attacks all but disappeared.  I've been on betaxolol for nearly 3 years now, and I am so much happier now than when I was on the nadolol.  I'd never say that nadolol is bad for everyone, nor would I say that betaxolol is good for everyone.  But, I will say with absolute certainty that not all beta-blockers are the same!  If you're having trouble with one, insist that your doctor try another.		M	48	1.5  years20 2X D	8/21/2012Email
5	blood pressure	None	My overall health has been positively advanced by Corgard. I weigh the same as I did when I graduated from high school and the medication has not made me gain any additional weight.	F	76	11  years40mg 1X D	7/29/2011
5	migraines	Little to none. I was a bit tired the first few days.	This medication brought me from three severe migraines a week to maybe one a month, life changing.	F	26	6  months80 mg 1X D	9/9/2010
5	Stage fright, social phobia	Weight gain, fatigue, maybe depression.	Works like a charm for stage fright and social phobia but at a high price, I've had a steady substantial weight gain over the years and profound loss of energy. But I was desperate for help with social phobia and it was the only thing that helped. It also pretty much cured my migraines. At this point I'm considering tapering off to see what happens as I really need to lose weight because of high cholesterol. I never had a weight problem until I started this drug. In the first couple of months after taking I gained about 15 pounds and have continued to gain at a slower rate over the last 10 plus years.	F	54	10  years40mg 1X D	6/19/2010

1	Daily Migraine Sufferer	I have put on approximately 20 lbs since I started this med.  My once thick hair has become so thin I'm concerned it'll all come out before it starts to grow again!	My doctors didn't catch this problem!  I talked to my neurologist and he missed it.  I just finished a bunch of lab work at my family doctor.  I was hoping he'd find something...not cancer!  Thanks to this site, I have been able to discover so much!  Thank you for this site.  I am going off my Corgard...Forever!!!	F	49	7  months20 1X D	2/15/2010
1	Blood Pressure control/migraines	Am 51 yrs old, have been on this for 3 weeks, have had nausea that won't seem to go away, general loss of interest in things I like to do, and 3 severe migraines since start date.  Shortness of breath and BP isn't going down and staying there.	I would NOT recommend this to anyone, I tried it because of its possible dual purpose.  Horse hockey, It works for very few people and if you are prone to migraines, don't take it. It does help with sleep related troubles but the zombie feeling the next day is not worth this, NOR is the migraines that caused me to miss work.	F	51	3  weeks20mg 1X D	2/4/2010
2	Migraines/MAV/High Blood Pressure	Worsening headaches; extreme lethargy and lack of energy/interest in doing anything; nausea	A bit of background on my situation: I've had high BP and migraines for years. It was previously under control with 50 mg of Atenolol per day (worked for about a year). One day, I had sudden dizzines and worsening migraines; numerous tests have concluded it's MAV (migraine associated vertigo), and I have been working from home (unable to drive due to dizziness) for the past 6 months. This is one of about 6 beta blockers/calcium channel blockers I've tried in the past few months. The one positive thing I can say is that it made me sleep VERY soundly...it damn near knocked me out at any dosage I tried (I'm only 5'5" and weigh 115 pounds).  In addition to making me feel like a zombie, it actually seemed to make my headaches/migraines worse in intensity and frequency...not a good combination for me!  It also made me nauseous...not fun when I deal with nausea from migraines anyway.  I'm back to Atenolol until I find something that works better, I guess.	F	25	30  days	1/2/2010Email
5	palpitations	slow heart rate but no ill effects of that	I have been on this drug for 25 years and love it. I take a very low dose (10-20 mg daily). It does not make my palpitations go away completely, but it helps a LOT. Without it, my heart races all the time and I feel unsteady. This medication makes me feel normal.	F	43	25  years	12/27/2009
1	Migraines	dropped my heart rate to 47, muscle cramps, half-numb lips and tip of tongue, shortness of breath, total lack of emotion, fatigue		F	44	4  days	8/12/2009
5	Migraines	weight gain. went from 145 to 160 in 7 months.	very helpful! i was having a migraine EVERYDAY before i began corgard, however i have gained weight. ill begin working out and really hope to see that i can lose the weight ive put on due to the corgard.  if i cant lose the weight, ill meet with my neurologist and go over different options.

5	stage fright	none	Using nadolol for stage fright is an "off-book" usage, but is a dirty secret of professional classical music performance. Nadolol, dosed properly, seems to totally wipe out flight-fight response without affecting fine motor control, which makes it a great drug for anxious performers and speakers, especially as part of behavioral retraining. After years of severe stage fright issues, I started using it, first all the time, but now hardly at all, because it allowed me to have positive experiences on stage, which reduces the anxiety, and thus the need for the drug the next time. This was a fantastic drug for me.	M	37	75  times	4/18/2008
5	Atrial Fibrilation	I'm taking Nadolol (Corgard) for 10 years. It was very hard to adjust to it from beginning. I had a very unpleasant feeling that my heart is slowing down but after couple of weeks it went away and I am using it until today. There are no any side effects. My heart rate is good, ECG, ECHO and all tests are very good.	It's worth to give it a try and start with just a 1/2 of dosage your doctor prescribed. In a week (if everything is OK) increase dosage to normal.	F	58	10  years	3/26/2008
5	A Fib	I was on Corgard for about 8 years and really liked it.  Kept my heart beat regular.  No side effects.  Then my cardiologist changed me to Coreg and I hate it.  I've gained 17 pounds in 4 months with no change in diet or exercise.  I will ask my doctor to put me back on Corgard.	My 60 year old sister has been on Corgard for about 15 years and her doctor says that although it is a old medicine, it is still a good and effective one.  She has no complaints.	F	63	8  years	3/3/2008
1	hypertension	nausea, extreme weakness, abdominal pain, weight loss secondary to nausea, faintness while standing still for just short times.	I am a nurse, and I had a patient who had been through multiple tests for the same symptoms (I had also been through many tests--we both thought we must have cancer!).  A cardiologist who was doing a stress test on me told me NOT to take Corgard.  When I stopped and changed to Toprol, the symptoms subsided completely.  I regained my strength and appetite.  I told my patient about my experience, and she stopped the drug with her physician's consent, gained 22 pounds (she had gotten very thin and frail) and felt so much better.

3	to control high blood pressure	lethargy, shortness of breath, symptoms of Reynaud's in cold weather, and weight gain.	Effective at controlling blood pressure. Most side effects were minor, but the weight gain was significant.	F	47	2  years	9/17/2007
1	only considering taking it			F	71	0  days	5/31/2007
5	Mitral Valve Prolapse with PVCs	NONE	I have been taking Corgard for over 20 years for an irregular heartbeat due to a Mitral Valve Prolapes.  It has worked wonderfully and I have had no side effects.	F		20  years	4/7/2007
5	Migraines	My dose has varied from 20-40 mg. It controls my migraines, with very minimal side effects and totally improved my quality of life.		F	40	10  years	11/11/2006
1	Atrial Fib	This drug caused me terrible depression. Doc says he'll "adjust dosage". Didn't help at all.	I tried several other beta blockers. They all caused terrible depression. Had to abandon the whole class of drugs.	M	57	3  months	11/30/2005
5	Anxiety attacks and tach. episodes	tiredness in the beginning, decreased heart rate down to 60 bpm resting.	This drug in combination with Zoloft has helped free me from my 15 year battle with severe anxiety attacks. I started out with 20mg a day for the first year and then cut back to 10mg a day which is what I currently take.	F	38	6  years	11/14/2004
4	high blood pressure, tachycardia,	Tired a lot	I was diagnosed with beta-adrenergic hyperactivity syndrome at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN in 1998.  Since then I have had 2 kids and have difficulty keeping up with them.  I cannot run, only walk for exercise (5 days a week).  I get out of breath easily but my B.P. and tachy are under control.  I am on 40 mg.	F	26	6  years	3/12/2004Email

5	high blood pressure	No side affects and has kept my blood pressure consistantly in check for 20 years.		F	60	20  years	7/19/2002
1	High blood pressure/migraines.	Increased pulse rate, dizziness, fatigue.	Although it lowered my blood pressure my pulse rate increased to 120-130 bpm, and I constantly felt dizzy and tired.  My physician switched me to another beta blocker.	M	45	2  weeks	6/11/2002
5	Graves Disease-irregular heart beat	None, I love this drugIt is the best one that I have taken for my Graves Disease which causes Skipped, irregular and fast ( tachy) heart beats	This is by far the best betablocker and I would recommend it to anyone with heartbeat problems.	F	49	1  years	6/10/2002Email
3	High Blood Pressure	fatigue, change in heart rate (decreased)	generally effective	M	32	11  years	4/5/2002
