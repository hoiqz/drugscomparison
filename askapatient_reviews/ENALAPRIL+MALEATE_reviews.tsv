1	HBP	Burping, inappropriately -- waked in the a.m. with burping all day long. Awful experience!		M	59	9  months	7/4/2009
1	pre-hypertension	Prescribed by Dr. After about 5-6 weeks, I developed a strange blister on my lower lip like nothing I had had before.  Quit taking it after doing some research online and finding out that pemphigus vulgaris is a rare side effect.  This is a condition where your skin becomes loose from your flesh and is "ususally fatal if not treated".  Note the other post under brand name Vasotec where the person got lip blisters and swollen face.	My doctor said I didn't have the condition and belittled my concern. "Pemphigus is something totally different, where your skin sluffs off," she said.  I said, "How does it begin? It surely doesn't start out as a full-blown case!"  The answer is it starts with a blister or lesion, commonly on the face.  Look  it up.  I told her I would never ever take this drug again, and got no more argument, and she did not try to recommend an alternative.  I will live with slightly elevated blood pressure and work on it with exercise and good diet.  Wish me luck.  You can Google Pemphigus and Enalapril to find what I found.	M	65	40  days	2/1/2008
