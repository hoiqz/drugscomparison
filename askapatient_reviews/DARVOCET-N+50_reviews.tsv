5	Pain/spasticity associated with MS	I take Darvocet N 100 for pain associated with Multiple Sclerosis.  It reducsed the spasticity and gives me enough pain relief that I can get a good nights sleep	This is the one pain reliever that works for my MS pain.  I have tried Vicodin and Ultram, both of which gave me the worst headaches I have ever experienced.  I only take it when the pain is bad, 1-2 x per month.  Darvocet allows me to get a comfortable nights sleep (like I am sleeping on a cloud).  Now that it has been taken off of the market I am left without many options.

1	Post-op	I felt absolutely horrible. I did not experience any pain relief and felt worse after taking this medicine than before. My head felt like it was detached from my body and I couldn't even tell time or control my mouth.	I would never recommend any one to take this drug and was angry when my md prescribed it to me after surgery. Ibuprofen works better than any other pain medication I've taken	F	22	3  days600 mg 4X D	11/30/2010

1		useless drugmakes you more nauseas than hydrocodone cananyone who said they ahllucinated off it is lying also		M	8	  1X D	11/13/2010
3	pain in pelvis and testicles	THE DOC PRESCRIBED ME THIS AFTER I RAN OUT OF HYDOCODONE 7.5 (HE SAID IT WAS STRONGER). FOR ME, IT IS NOT STRONGER. I HAVE TO TAKE 2 OR 3 IN ORDER TO FEEL THE EFFECTS. TAKING ABOUT 2 OR 3 WOULD BE LIKE TAKING A HYDROCODONE 10 OR PERCECET 5.	IM TAKING THE DARVOCET-N 100/625 APAP. THE BAD THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT BY ME TAKING 2 OR 3 AT A TIME AND DOING IT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME IS VERY BAD FOR THE LIVER. THE TYLENOL (APAP) IS 625MG AND NOT SUPPOSE TO BE TAKING NO MORE THAN AROUND 4,000MG A DAY.	M	24	1  weeks100mg/625 2X D	10/24/2010Email
5	Pulled tooth	When I took it at night, it helped me get to sleep When i took it during the day, it made me tired at first, but was able to shake it off.	I tried Tylenol 3 and Moltrin 800 but both did not do anything for me.	M	22	5  days650 2X D	10/13/2010Email
4	arthritis pain/migraines	NO side effects when I take just one, when I take two (and I'm not supposed to) I'll get a little sleepy or loopy. No nightmares, no hallucinations, no stomach pain. But you have to realize I'm used to MUCH stronger stuff.	I started taking this for arthritis in my hands, my doctor gave it to me when I complained the pain was keeping me awake. It does not help with the arthritis.One day when I ran out of my other migraine medication (and I have been on all SORTS of stuff for that, some worked, some didn't and SOME had worse side effects than the migraines) I took darvocet, and was surprised it worked. I will take it when my migraines are mild (or at onset), and occassionally to combat a tough one I will take two, and USUALLY that is good enough, but it takes longer than other medicines to "kick in."	F	31	2  years 1X AN	9/20/2010
4	Recreational	Paranoid from hallucinations on the ceiling. Scariest nightmares i've had in ten years. Anger rose after effects wore off.	I would recommend usage during the daytime, less likely to hallucinate or have nightmares which seem to be common side effects.	M	16	1  weeks100-650 2X D	8/16/2010
3	Menstrual Cramps	Nausea if not taken with food.	I actually was prescribed Davorcet-N 100 for menstrual cramps. The dosage was 1-2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed. One pill did nothing for me. When I take two, they take about an hour to work on the pain. (They wear off in about two to three hours, depending on the severity of the pain. I'm actually considering asking my doctor for something stronger.) I have not experienced any type of "euphoria," drowsiness, or feelings of relaxation with this drug alone. When my cramps are really bad, I take two Davocet-N 100's and two .25mg Xanax so that I can relax and take my mind off the pain. For moderate to severe pain, I wouldn't recommend this drug. For mild pain, I think it would work just fine.	F	31	8  weeks100 2X AN	8/10/2010

5		mild euphoric feeling-pain GONE!	N 100 for bad hip joint pain.Pain was like I'd been hit by a car-very intense. 2 Darvocet worked great (every 5-6 hrs) finshed up the darvocet,and the doctor said I need somthing stronger-gave me vicodin.That did NOTHING.I said give me back the darvocet! I went online and read the fourms-sure enough, darvo works for some and viko does nothing, and visa versa for others. I am alcoholic (sober 10 yrs) and I'm glad I was on darvo only 1 week cause it makes you feel good. I do recall a nightmare went I took 2 darvo one nite only for a tooth extraction a few years back, but overall it's been very good to me. It'll be the first thing I request if I'm in enough pain to require a narcotic.	M	47	6  daysn 100 4X D	5/12/2010Email
4	urinary tract infection	dizzyness, a "high" feeling, stumbling, can't concentrate	It is hard for me to get from class to class and extreamly hard to stay awake. i also get frequent nausia.	F	17	7  days 4X D	5/10/2010
5	Tension Migraine Headaches	Mild pleasant feeling about 1 out of 10 times, otherwise no side effects.	Actually works better for my tension migraines than a number of  stronger meds including percocet, oxicontin, and toradol. Does not relieve muscular pain or low level aches.  Over the years I've found it effective for "acute" sharp pain caused by migraine/earache/toothache while useless on chronic or muscle pains.  Contains a truly stupid amount of unnecessary acetaminophen.	F	53	17  yearsN-100 2X AN	3/28/2010
5	SI joint pain	Euphoria. I seem to never stop talking when I take this med. Which is fine with me but probably bores my friends. No other side effects.	I have N-100 but split the pulls since it has too great of an effect ( not saying this equals n-50). In general i hate any type of pain med but this one works nicely. It gets rid of my pain related to sacroiliitis. I experiance no insomnia and in fact take just before bed, possibly gives me more vivid dreams but not nightmares. I have experienced no know issues with breathing.	M	23	2  monthsN-100 4X W	2/16/2010
1	Post op pain	Useless for pain, grogginess/ foggy head, nausea	Not as effective as TRAMADOL for pain. Very narrow theraputic index, take 1 it does nothing, take 3 end up not breathing. Each pill has a whopping 650mg of Tylenol in it. Thats probably the reason it works as well as it does. Yeah, it's a miracle drug all right.	M	27	2  days100mg 4X D	2/11/2010
5	post surgery	relaxed, positive mood, very calming	Took the pain away and made me feel like i was laying on a feather bed.	M	40	10  days	1/25/2010
3	neck, c-spine pain	unusal dreams (borderline nightmane)	dreampt of being poisoned, house burning down, people chasing me, knives, jumping on and off trains.  woke up this morning, still had pain, but vidid dream memories....can't wait for tonights episodes.	M	59	1  days	10/2/2009Email
3	Post-surgical pain	Felt a little spacy, developed upset stomach/pain after 2 days that made me stop taking the drug.	It did work for the post-surgical pain, but the stomach side effects were worse than the surgical pain after a couple days.	F	27	2  days	8/16/2009
1	Shoulder injury	none	this pill did nothing for me what so ever i felt like a had taken a tic tac	F	20	7  days	8/10/2009Email
5	Migraine, Shoulder Injury	Dry mouth, slight dizziness, mild euphoria. No other side-effects.	Darvocet works better for me than any other pain medication. It's not too strong, but just strong enough to knock out any pain I might be having for at least 8-10 hours. I get a little bit loopy, and a little bit euphoric, but that is generally short lived. I also don't get rebound headaches from it, like I do with Ultracet. I'm still able to function, drive, and work with no problem unlike stronger pain medications like Norco. For moderate pain, I'd recommend it. It's just enough to take the edge off.	F	32	4  months	7/11/2009Email
3	laparoscopy	relaxed	My pain is minimal to begin with, but I did feel like this drug took the edge off.  It definitely didn't make me feel numb all over like Vicodin (which also makes me violently dizzy, nauseous, and sometimes causes panic attacks) but I was relaxed and glad there were no bad side-effects. I probably could've gotten the same level of pain relief from a few ibuprofin.	F	24	2  days	4/10/2009
5	Back pain	None.	The only problem I have is that I could get hooked. It takes care of the pain and leaves me with a sense of well being that is so good you want more of it. I have to pace myself on this drug.	F	56	10  days	3/23/2009
1	Wisdom Teeth Extraction	Irregular heart beat, very low blood pressure, dizziness, shaking, nausea.	I took Darvocet N 100.  It gave no pain relief and nearly killed me.  I only took one dose.  My husband had to perform CPR on me because I was so out of it I wasn't breathing and my pulse was very low and irregular.  My blood pressure was also very low.  I ended up in the ER and was told it was a combo between taking this medicine and being dehydrated.  I do not recommend this medication!	F	30	1  times	3/14/2009
1	pain in back/neck	extreme nausea,extreme confusion,sleepiness,dizzines	I took one dose of this medicine for pain in my back, after a couple of hours the pain was gone however the side effects lingered for days.  It has been over 50 hours since I took this one dose and I am still recovering from the side effects of dizziness and confusion.	F	34	1  days	3/2/2009
2	wisdom teeth.	none.	it wasn't strong at all and i could not even tell i had taken it.  did not relieve my pain whatsoever - might as well have taken nothing at all.  maybe next time i should take 2 pills, as sometimes it seems painkillers do not work for me.	F	27	2  days	2/18/2009
1	herniated lumbar disc	extreme nausea (i NEVER get nauseous), shaky, feelings of anxiety/unease, insomnia, severe/continuos stomach pain (at prescribe dose), depression	This is the worst, WEIRDEST pain medication I have ever taken. I was given it as an alternative to oxycodone (daily) until I undergo back surgery. One dose repeatedly made me feel DOPESICK and DEPRESSED. I will never, ever take this medication again.	F	24	5  days	2/10/2009
1	arthritus	constipation, tired, some stomach upset. weight gain.	no pain relief what so ever. might as well take tylenol, it's cheaper!	M	70	10  days	1/29/2009

1	Post wisdom tooth extraction	Numbness in limbs, ringing in ears, constipation, extreme dizzines, heart plapatations, racing pulse/low heart rate, difficulty breathing	I WOULD NOT RECCOMMEND THIS MEDICATION!!!!!!!  I am no stranger to pain medication, having had hernia surgery last year.  I did not want to take Lortab and asked for somethng milder.  I have never had Darvocet before and WILL NEVER TAKE IT AGAIN!!!  I took one dosage and was sleepy within 30 minutes but no real relief from the throbbing in my mouth (2 impacted wisdom teeth removed).  I proceeded to take the prescribed dosage every four hours and finally had a little pain relief.  I was still in a lot of pain but managed to doze off. I was awakened because I COULD NOT BREATHE!!!  My heat slowed down so much that I had to get up and walk around.  I was sure I was dying and thought I would need to call an ambulance.  This went on for about 4 hours.  I had to lean forward and cough at times just to get my heart rate up. Whenever I panicked, my pulse raced and my heart struggled to beat.  It was the worst experience of my life.  I think that if I'd taken more than the prescribed dosage, I w	F	38	1  days	1/11/2009Email
1	Hip pain before surgery	Mild blurred vision, well-being feeling	I was taking Ultracet before this (I had to switch to Darvocet-N 100 cuz of my thyroid medicine)... I personally think the Ultracet worked better for my pain! This darvocet does NOTHING, I still feel pain - infact sometimes it feels like its intensifying the pain. I was taking 3 ultracet, but with this I have to take 4 darvocet to feel any relief. Going to ask for a different medication monday.... this stuff DOESNT WORK.	F	24	4  days	12/21/2008
4	pain from surgery	Severe stomach pain and drowsiness	It took the pain away but the stomach pain was terrible. I stopped taking it after 4 days because of the stomach pain.	F	45	4  days	12/4/2008
2	Shoulder	Slight Buzz	You have to take a 500 mg acetominophen with it to get decent pain relief.  For real pain, ask for Percocet.	F	36	4  days	10/4/2008
1	fibromyalgia	a little nausea	did nothing for pain, so I moved up to N-100, and still nothing, just an upset stomach.	F	30	5  days	10/1/2008
1	Deep pain, polymyalgia rheumatica	No side effects	No pain relief. None.	F	55	3  days	8/31/2008
3	Pelvic Inflammatory Disease	insomnia, shaky, weakness, hot flashes, little nausea, felt groggy, depression	It's 3:19 am and I had taken a Darvocet an hour ago for my pain then tried to go back to sleep. However, about an hour later I couldn't sleep and I started to shake for the first time with some nausea which made me do some online researching. I would of rather taken a tylenol pm than this because it gave me insomnia the whole week and just now figured it was from this pill. After reading the other comments, me being depressed the last 2 days severely makes sense. I am not a depressed person, but I found myself sitting in my room by myself with the lights off watching tv all day today refusing to join my friends who live with me. I was prescribed this since vicodin makes me sick... but this isn't worth taking because of the side effects. Well, i'm going to lay down and shake some more until I fall asleep hopefully before sunrise.	F	20	7  days	8/26/2008Email
4	Pain	Constipation, dry mouth, dry eyes, fatigue	Helps with pain and is effective for about 6 hours.	F	40	3  times	8/13/2008
5	Lumpectomy/node dissection	None	My surgeon wanted to prescribe Vicodin, but I told her that it doesn't relieve pain for me and makes me feel wired so she prescribed Darvocet-N 100 instead.  It got rid of the pain without making me feel different in any way.  I was amazed and relieved that I didn't have to deal with side effects to get pain relief.	F	45	3  weeks	7/8/2008
4	knee injury	groggieness, loss of appetite, agression, depression, short term memory loss, slurred speech	i had a knee injury previously and was on the medication relafen, i continued to take the relafen as per my doctor on top of the darvocet. i experienced breif memory loss including mid sentence loss for words many of times. also some agression and depression more than normal. i have had depression issues in the past and the warning is to not take this medication if you suffer depression as i believe it heightens it.  it definitely helped relieve the pain, but im not so sure the side effects are worth the risk of addiction	F	23	16  days	6/21/2008
3	Breast lift & reduction	Racing heart, mild sleepiness	I only took 1/2 a pill as I am very easily effected by medications. It took away the pain, but I hated the racing heart. That started about 25 mins. after I took it and lasted an hour or more.	F	35	3  days	6/21/2008
1	Back Injury (compressed disks)	Nausia, dizzy, feeling as though I have to throw up, shaky, cannot concentrate, loss of breath, cotton mouth, kidney pain, and so on...	Darvocet N-100 is what I was taking, did not help with the pain but gave me a whole list of other problems. would not reccomend it to anyone, use caution if taking already!!! I would rather deal with the pain than deal with all the other crap.	M	24	5  days	6/17/2008
3	wisdom teeth extraction	Sleepiness, slight disorientation	I had some pain from my surgery, but not alot. The Darvocet helped ease what pain I had and let me sleep much better. I can't tell how well it works on more severe pain, because my pain has been very mild.	F	27	4  days	5/29/2008
4	Back pain, arthritis, leg pain	None, except for occasional leftover drowsiness if I don't get at least eight hours of sleep after taking it.	I take this periodically at night for back or leg pain. I never use it during the day, due to the slight sedating effect. It seems to work better than most painkillers I have tried for my chronic back problems. Unless I am really hurting a lot, I will take only one pill per night; otherwise, it will sedate me too much, and I won't want to wake up early the next day. Still, even on the rare occasions that I have taken two of these, they didn't cause me as much grogginess as one Tylenol PM would!	F	54	14  months	4/19/2008
2	hand surgery	cried all the time, felt very sad, got depressed in a matter of a few hours after surgery. Feelings of despair over nothing.	It must have worked well for the pain as I had none, but I cried for 3 days not realizing why I was so sad over nothing. I was beginning to become depressed when the thought occured to me this feeling might be side effects.  I switched to ibuprophen that day and within a day all sadness-crying ceased.  Now I know why my father becomes depressed and cries alot for no reason. His Dr took him off NSAIDS for his arthritis and put him on Darvocet 100.  I knew it made him talk silly, but did not realize it caused his sad mood.		52	3  days	4/12/2008
1	lower back pain	Darvocet-N 100: nausea, dizziness, headache, short-term memory loss, sluggish	I was prescribed Darvocet-N 100 to relieve mild back pain experienced while lying down. All I wanted was a good nights sleep however, this drug did not deliver. Besides not relieving the pain, side effects were unbearable. I found much needed relief with vicodin-500mg.

1	Knee Injury	vomiting every time I took it, hallucinations (thought I had a bunch of animals running around in my house!), always in a "foggy" state of mind, cold & clamy followed by streaks of hot flashes, depression & sever mood swings	USELESS ..... MORE HARM THAN ANYTHING! Didnt even dull the pain. Stopped taking after a week since I didnt feel anything like my self	F	25	1  weeks	4/6/2008
2	broken hand	drowsiness....pain that just didn't go away	sorry to say this drug did nothing for me. I broke my hand in three places and they gave me a darvocet and it felt like it never kicked in, just made me really sleepy, but I could barely even do that b/c I was in so much pain. The next day I went to another hospital and the ER doctor laughed when I told him they gave me darvocet and his exact quote "Darvocet is pretty useless, isn't it?" seriously. He then gave me Vicodin and I was feeling sooo much better...definitely took the edge off and didn't even make me as sleepy. Bottom Line: Darvocet feels like one step up from tylenol (which isn't very good w/ pain anyway...better for fever).	F	21	2  days	3/24/2008
2	Neck Surgery; Malignant Tumor	Darvocet-N 100: edginess, slight anxiety, racing heart, general feeling of unease, and frustration at lack of pain relief (if that counts)	I had a very large mass in my neck, which my doctors discovered was a malignant tumor.  It had metastasized extensively, so surgery lasted for several hours (their goal was to remove as much of it as they could without keeping me under for too long).  I was given Vicodin ES post-op, and then given a prescription for Darvocet-N 100 (I-II p.o. PRN 4-6 hrs.) upon discharge.  Surgery was 3 days ago, and I used the Darvocet-N 100 exactly 2x before throwing it away.  My PCP prescribed regular Vicodin (5/500) (I p.o. TID) this morning, and just the ONE 5/500 Vicodin works better to lessen (not exactly relieve, but lessen, which I *am* grateful for) my post-op pain.  When I phoned the surgeon to explain that the Darvocet had not helped, I was told to take OTC Tylenol (after them cutting away at a major area of my neck and a 5" incision)!  I already have Motrin 800 mg., which would certainly work better than the Darvocet, however it can cause excessive bleeding if the incision is not fully		29	2  times	3/19/2008Email

4	menstrual cramps/breast pain	Mild euphoria/dizziness.	This is the only thing I've taken for menstrual cramps and premenstrual breast tenderness that has worked for me.  Tried naprosyn which did nothing.  Darvocet has been the only thing that has eliminated my menstrual cramps.	F	32	60  days	1/21/2008
4	4 wisdom teeth extraction	slight dizziness, light headed, no concentrating.	It works good but you never really notice it working because the pain just kind of disappears so you just feel like you.	M	16	3  months	1/21/2008
5	migraine	none	I take n 100 for migraines w/o auora.  Takes a good 30 - 45 min. to achieve pain relief, but it does get rid of the pain with no side effects.  For migraine with auora, I am fortunate that feverfew (herb) works for me.	F	36	 	1/11/2008
2	migraines	my head felt really cloudy, doesn't help	I'm taking n-100 for migraines. It takes about 1.5 hours for the darvocet to start working, and then it only takes the edge off, which usually is not enough for any kind of relief. This is a safer drug than vicodin, which I was on before but started to take more than I should have, which ended up raising my liver enzymes. But, I am really not getting enough pain relief from the darvocet.	F	20	1  weeks	1/3/2008Email
2	Wisdom teeth removal	None, other than it not working good.	I was in serious pain after having four wisdom teeth removed. Hydrocodone made me nauseous so my doctor gave me Darvocet. It sucked. I was still in serious pain, even with taking the Darvocet. It lessened the pain a little, but it was still unbearable. My doctor thinks his patients could be druggies so he doesn't prescribed us the good stuff. Boo.	F	22	2  days	12/29/2007

4		No side effects at all	Actually I am taking 2 Darvocet N-100 tablets every night with a Restoril sleeping capsule (30mg) whigh helps me sleep a good 8 hours. Without the darvocet I sleep less hours before waking.I have just started having Anterior right hip severe pain as of Dec 2007 and am taking two N-100 tablets 3 to 4 times daily for the extreme pain without any side effects but it appears to help reduce the pain considerably! I have to wait a week before my doctor will see me to further diagnose the hip problem.After reading many of the reviews printed here, it is obvious the Darvocet affects different people in different ways.End result.... Very good for some... Not too good for others!!!	M	79	2  years	12/13/2007

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email

Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

I cant afford a lawyer or I would sew. SERIOUS BRAIN DAMAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!	I wish i could sew them and make it to where these companies can not sell their poison to another child teen or adult.

Worst feeling ever-it made me not able to think clearly, and keep my train of thought. I got off of it within 1-2 weeks	Spare yourself and don't try it	F	18	2  weeks 1X D	1/9/2011
2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR.

5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it.

5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.

5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
