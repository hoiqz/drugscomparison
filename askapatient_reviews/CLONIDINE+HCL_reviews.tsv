1	insomnia,nightmares	restlessness,body aches,extreme dry mouth,stomach pains,dizziness,can not sleep at night more than couple of hours......	I do not like it..It was prescribed to me by my psychiatrist,for nightmares and to help me sleep through the night.I do not sleep at night..I sleep maybe 3hrs,then I am up every hour. In the morning my body aches, it is not the right medication for me..Do not like it at all!!!	F	26	1  days0.1 3X D	11/9/2012Email
3	HBP	dry mouth, very dry skin, hairloss, weight gain, lack of thirst even with the dry mouth, sore gums (I believe must have to do with the dry mouth), constipation, increased appetite	this use to work really well at lowering my BP as my backup medication when my every day meds weren't lowering it enough but as my primary medication it virtually doesn't touch i...hovers around 160/106. the dry mouth and dry skin is enough to drive you nuts, and I find it strange that I have no thirst even with the dry mouth when typically I drink water like it's going out of style. my doctor insisted weight gain wasn't a side effect of clonidine but I just don't believe it and I know that ppl mostly say they have appetite loss...I have increase in appetite! crave sweets almost constantly. The one good thing I can say is how it manages my anxiety level (I'm hyperthyroid) so that is kinda nice but given it isn't improving my BP at all will be asking doc to change my meds again	F	30	2  months0.1 MG 2X D	11/7/2012Email
5	RSD	none	Like the lady that posted for CRPS RSD - stage 4 and having extreme high blood pressure while sound asleep (me) or even taking a nap..  CLONDINE has been a Blessing!Alas for me the Clonidine has not helped the  stomach problems that goes along with sympathetic nerve problems. Helped the facial flushing by .  I also had Immediate results within one day and after a few weeks even better.  Waking up Before taking Clonidine my blood pressure would be 189/90  and so out of breath I would about pass out in trying to walk to the bathroom.    Now upon waking blood pressure of 124/68. Did help somewhat with the shoulders not up to my ears in stress feeling.  Alas not by much. 	F	59	4  months0.01 2X D	8/17/2012Email
5	RSD  High Blood Pressure upon wakin	Tired in morning and night time not sleeping as many hours	After years of the wrong diagnoses I was finally diagnosed as having CRPS RSD Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. I am alas in stage 4 with heart problems of waking up to extreme high blood pressure and the stomach problems that goes along with sympathetic nerve problems.  Oh..and extreme facial flushing.  Since I am So Very sensitive to drugs I have stated Clonidine Split in two/half.  In other words  of a pill.  Immediate results within one day with brings the morning high blood pressure upon waking of 169/100 to 129/76.  My shoulders are now relaxed and not up to my ears in stress feeling.  Facial flushing almost down.  With my immune system so weak I am hoping that this will calm everything else down with some time passing.  So far I am dancing with joy	F	58	1  weeks1/2 of 1mg 2X D	3/15/2012Email
2		Difficulty Breathing 2 Hours after taking pill. Shortness of breath lasted all evening.	Changed to HCTL and that did not work either. Had lump in throat & rash. I cannot find something that does not have terrible side effects. I have gone through 4 HBP medicines with bad side effects. If I find one that is better I will post it on this site immediately.	F	54	1  days4mg 1X D	11/26/2011
2	Insomnia; ADHD symptoms;elevated bp	weight gain weight gain weight gain!! Take something else!!!! Not fun to eat healthy and try to live a good lifestyle & your medicine is causing severe lethargy and then putting weight on no matter what- although it's secondary  purpose for me i'n controlling bp was achieved it's def not worth taking if your bp is only mild to moderately high- get something else bc it's had minimal to no effect on my ADHD and it actually made me feel like I needed more of my stimulant or some caffeine just to stay awake! Totally not worth it!!! I gained about 10 lbs then said- no more!!		F	27	2  months.1mg 1X D	10/24/2011Email
3	spiked blood pressure at night	dry mouth and dry eyes - heavy eye lids - tiredness and weakness - vivid or bad dreams at night can happen, works good in the b.p dept lowering fast and gets it down ,but does not last longer than 4 to 6 hours -	depending on the mfg of the drug , the fillers in the pills are diffrent thus diffrent side effects can happen. mylan uses a soft white powder like pill , if cutt causes stomach problems and gas to happen bloating condition . get the right dose and your fine !

4	hypertention	after 10 years of controlling my B/P,   the Clonidine has stopped working?  It does not lower it at all.has anyone else had this problem?		F	68	10  years4 mg 4X D	6/4/2011Email
1	yes	headache dizzy chest pain		M	40	7  days0.1 2X D	5/27/2011Email
4	third medication to control high BP	Extreme sleepiness.  Within an hour of taking Clonidine I have to sleep, does help sleep at night.  I notice a really bad headache (on left side of head) after taking this med. Light headed, dry mouth. Dry eyes, blurred vision.	Must admit it brings high pressure down quickly, but then shoots right back up within a short period of time, so I cut and split the dosages throughout the day, don't know what to do to prevent spikes/bp drops from 188/135 to 90/52. The longer I have taken it, it seems to take a higher dosage to bring my high bp down.  Of the 3 meds I take (Diovan, Ziac and Clonidine) the Clonidine does the most good.

1	hypertension	My whole body ached, mostly neck and shoulders, but filtered down to wrists, and legs.  Ringing in ears briefly at night and drowsey........not good	I have tried every beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, or angiotension II's..........I think the doctor's have written me off.  But I going to try Hawthorn and the ACE peptide from bonita Tuna, supplements, otherwise I'm back to Pharmco therapy from hell.	F	61	3  days0.25 2X D	10/13/2010
4	add, high bp	drowsiness, dry mouth	I react to it in an unusual way. The side effects are different, less severe or more severe, for no obvious reason.	M	53	60  days.15 3X D	6/15/2010Email
1	High blood pressure	Urinary incontenence and extreme sleepiness.	I had a hysterectomy almost five months ago and after one month, my blood pressure started to slowly rise.  I tried Clonidine and after only three days I noticed that I was having bladder leakage again.  It took my bladder about three months to recover from my hysterectomy and when I started leaking again, that was completely unacceptable.  The other problem was the extreme sleepiness.  On the second day of not taking this drug, it was like a fog had been lifted.	F	52	3  days.1 MG 2X D	4/26/2010Email
1	hypertension	I'm only taking 0.5 mg and very dizzy , chill,ringing in the earrash around forehead hair line especially, danderruf , eyes are burning like exposed to tear gas,blood streams in my hand and feet hurts, my rectum burns like my eyes and etc. I wonder how people stay on this med with side effect.		M	54	10  days	3/1/2009Email
5	high blood pressure	Dry mouth	I have tried about 6-7 BP drugs. All either gave me a rash, headache. or just didn't work. Clonidine HCL began working right away....and no side effects except a little dry mouth. And it's a generic drug. A dose of .1 mg three times a day brought my BP from 210/100 down to 150/75. To say I am happy would be an understatement.	M	61	30  days	1/19/2009
5	High Blood Pressure	Mild face flushing.	I take this drug "as needed" for when my BP spikes. I take Atenolol and Cartia every day, but still my pressure spikes at times. Clonidine brings it right back to normal in no time. Also makes me sleep like a baby that night! Love this!	M	45	1  years	11/25/2008Email
5	Hot Flashes	Hot flashes from menopause/adjuvant breast cancer medicine - Femara	The Clonidine eliminated them completely.  Miracle Drug. Have been on every medicine known to man.	F	52	 	2/11/2008
5	Insomnia (natural/adderall-induced)	Dizziness, clouding vision, beginning to black out if getting up too soon after taking it, for longer than it otherwise would have kept me asleep. When waking more than 5 hours after taking it, no side effects noticed. I have normal blood pressure, and it does not lower my blood pressure overall.	I was prescribed this as a nightly sleeping pill (because that side effect of drowsiness is so high!) I had occasional trouble falling asleep that was exacerbated by my new adderall prescription. I take it every night, and until I started taking antidepressants, I couldn't fall asleep without it (or a substitute, like alcohol or ambien.) Antihistamines, valerian root, and other over-the-counter remedies don't help at all, except for NyQuil. Clonidine eventually was not strong enough to counteract the Adderall, and I now take Ambien in addition to a half-dose of Clonidine when I take Adderall. I start feeling drowsy with a strong urge to sleep about 40 minutes after taking it, which lasts for about 20 minutes. If I'm not asleep by the time this feeling wears off, I need to take another dose. However, if I wake up less than 5 hours after taking it, I will be dizzy for several hours.	F	23	6  years	12/5/2007
5	control blood pressure	I get very sleepy. Its great at night. It is difficult in morning. I take .02 twice a day.	it helps with panic attacks I found by accident when starting the drug. I seem to be calmer and more focused. I also take sular in the early evening.	F	47	2  days	11/9/2007
5	Orthostatic HYPERTENSION	This is my 10th. BP meds in the last year and so far, the best one......It's the only one that touches my top number...side effcts are very LOW.....anxiety / stomach cramps......during peak of the medicines that I ease with low doses of Ativan.....tiredness,.. fall a sleep at 9pm, sleep 4 hrs, awake another 2, sleep for 3-5 more......	It's a good drug.....it made my quality of life so much better, I did spend 12 to 18 hrs a day lying down due to the increase in heart rate and BP that literally felt as if I was dying if I tried to stand or walk, even.........sitting.........this has made me normal again......I also can eat again.........

1	Facial Flushing	Started off on .1mg but increased to .2mg 2 weeks later.  It lowered my blood pressure but the facial flushing is still just as bad.  I am going to talk to my Dr. about PROPRANOLOL.	Any suggestions to control facial flushing?	M	31	1  days	5/22/2005
