3	Discoloration from acne/ Mod. Acne	Noticed great improvements within the first couple days! My skin has never looked so beautiful. :) But the second night I felt slight burning around my eyes, and area around my mouth was extremely dry. Now the burning is horrible! I'm scared to keep using it, because I'm afraid it'll get worse.		F	15	4  daysSample	6/24/2012Email
2	Moderate Adult Acne	week 1 - progressively drier, then red, burning skin almost immediately/small breakout (I don't get enormous zits, but it almost looks like a rash on my face from tiny bumps - so increase the amount of bumps by at least 80% during week 1)week 2 - burning hurts so much more, when i'm not wearing makeup, my skin is red like the worst sunburn you've ever had in your life/3 good days of great skin, no acne, but red as hell, and patches of dry, dry skin that moisturizer doesn't help for more than 5 minutesweek 3 - apparently i'm supposed to notice some results by now if my body is taking to the medication? (according to my derm), but i've read it could take longer. it must be taking longer... skin redness is not as bad for the first half of the week, but then it's read and irritated again, esp. when I wash my face. dryness has spread down neck, to sides of ears, and to my chest! i have always washed my hands after using product, but somehow it is spreading... i also am getting acne on m	I am not sure what to tell you. I am a very patient person, but I was prescribed this medication after using a low dosage of Retinol-A for about a year. It was too intense and I saw no relief.Now, this seems to be far worse than Retinol-A because the dryness is even worse and it SPREADS!!!! I have no idea why. I probably will give this a few more months if my dermatologist says "hang in there", but after reading reviews, staying optimistic doesn't seem worth it.	F	21	35  days.5% 1X D	6/13/2012Email
4	Acne and blackheads: face and back	So for the first three or so weeks I had horrible, horrible burning, feeling and redness all over my face. Not really much reaction on my back. I suggest for the initial week, start with putting some Cetaphil or other light moisturiser underneath before the Differin.After that, slowly (after what felt like honestly, years!) the pimples started clearing up all around my forehead and down the hairline oh my face. I kept applying it for about 3 more months and it definitely kept the large pimples at bay. before I got lazy and stopped for a while.	So far, I'm fairly happy with Differin, it takes some dedication to use it erryday for a few months, but it does make quite a difference. I find it only really clears up the acne bumps extremely well and not really blackheads that much, but that's alright.	F	15	6  monthssmall blob 1X AN	6/3/2012
3	Surface scarring from electrolysis	Just started so I'm hoping all will go well.	I have scarring from electrolysis years ago and now adult acne. I have a few sort of open pimples on my nose - anyone out there experience problems with open 'sores'?  I haven't used it on my nose yet - I want to see how it works on my upper lip first.

5	Acne	I am 55 years old and have suffered from acne since I have been 13.  Retin A never helped. But I loved accident and gave taken it at least 6 times. Accident is the best for cystic acne. But after I would stop taking accutane, I would always return to retin a, benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. With accutane, I rarely get big sits, just little ones.  It is much more effective than retin a and I will never need accutane again. I have the oiliest skin known to man kind. The only good news is that I look 45, not 55.		F	55	2  years 2X D	2/27/2012

1	Acne	Extreme burning and peeling!	Well, I'm 14 years old and I started using differin (adapalene gel 0.1%)to cure acne and that's what the derma told me to use, in fact it was so expensive and takes time for me to buy it. I applied it nightly and didn't even last at least a week! On the first day after I use it, seems like nothing just happened but just drying of the face (the parts where I applied it). On the second day, I notice some parts of my face got red and acne got worse!(probably, this is where I applied the differin). Then after the third time of using it, my face really did hurt a lot after taking a bath and putting some products like vaseline men etc. on my face. In fact, washing it with soap also hurts and causes peeling of the skin. I would really not recommend it to you 'coz it will really cause an extreme burning and peeling of the skin. Now, I don't know what to do, but just wait for the time for my face to be back to it's normal color again. I regret using this product and I will never ever use this again. I just wasted my money, I wish I just bought some clothes. :))	M	14	3  days1 1X D	2/13/2012Email
4	moderate acne	I am now 13 years old and am on this medicine again. I used this about 6 months ago. I experienced redness, redness, redness, redness,redness,redness, and dryness. I discontinued use becuase of how red it made my skin. Later, i reliezed i was using too much of it a nights. I ran out of the differin every 2 weeks which proves that I used WAY TO MUCH. you are only supposed to use a pea size amount over your acne. I wouldnt reccomend putting it all over your face if u want a sunburned, dry, and burning face for the next week or so. DO NOT STOP USING THIS. Iknow it seems worse before its better, but thats the point. It makes acne come to the surface so it comes out. The side effects are not great and I know how it is to feel very selfconsious about it, but take a deep breath and be optimistic towards your acne getting better. do not pick or pop zits unless their at the surface, (when acnes infected)  I would reccomend a mild face wash. DONT USE U HARSH PRODUCT WITH BENZOIL PEROXIDE. trust	please be very patient. this will work	F	13	8  months0.3 1X D	1/4/2012Email
5	moderate adult acne	very mild dryness	I had perfect babybutt smooth skin until about 23 yrs old, I began seeing a dermatologist after about a year of suffering and my acne was scarring my face. I can't remember over the course of ten years all the RX and OTC's I tried and went to  aprox. five different dr's. I even did a round of accutane which made my moderate acne so much worse , I began getting cystic acne sometimes with cysts the size of a plum. At 33 I went to a new dermatologist this was my first visit in five years after the accutane nightmare, I was skeptical  but wanted to try one more time, She prescribed Differin gel.I applied a pea sized amount every nite and a moisterizer, I didn't notice any changes for weeks, after about a month or so I was still breaking out but also noticed some small hard whiteheads . Around the four month mark BAM! perfect skin ,no zits, blackheads or whiteheads after six months my acne scars were nearly gone. From that time on it just got better my face looked perfect . unfortunately I can't afford it anymore,after stopping use for a year and ahalf my skin stayed clear  for about two years and then the acne returned , I still don't have insurance (it's been about four years) and when I do have the ability the first thing i'm doing is getting an RX for differin again .

4	Acne, scarring from folliculitis	Burning, scaly, itching, dryness, sensitivity to light.	I've been using retinoids since I was 13.  The retinoids today have less side effects if used correctly.  There is less scaling and burning if you wait 20 minutes to apply after washing your face.  Mix only a pea sized amount to a moisturizer and apply.  There will be side effects for the first few weeks and results may not appear for 1-3 months.  Be patient and DO NOT use too much.  Differin helps clear acne, fade acne scars and even improve the appearance of scars over time.	F	35	30  days 1X D	1/1/2012
3	Mild acne and small cyst	Mild, passing burning, particularly around the eyes. Mostly went away when I increased avoidance of the eye area. Some mornings after applying it I will wake up with very oily skin, but it wipes off easily. Caused some mild  flaking when I used it in combination with my make-up which contains salicylic acid.	I have seen a marked improvement in my mild acne, but so far have seen little to no change in the small cyst on my face which is what it was primarily prescribed for. However, I haven't been using it for long.	F	29	10  days 1X D	11/21/2011
1		Extreme burning! Where ever I used the differing gel my face completely peeled; it felt like a constant sun burn. It was sore to touch and it hurt even if I didn't touch my face.	this product is so something I will never use again.	F	19	  1X D	10/23/2011
4	Hormonal Cystic Acne, Blackheads	I have very sensitive, oily skin.  At first, my skin looked horrible, but once the top layer started flaking off, things got better.  Now I can put it on my forehead, nose and chin without irritation.  I have dermatitis on my cheeks and above my eyes, and I have constant flare ups, so unfortunately I have to avoid those areas of my face.  However, I am able to use it where the acne is (my T-zone & chin) so I'm happy with it.  So far I can tell it's working on clearing up those stubborn blackheads that I haven't been able to get rid of since I hit puberty!  I'm 30 now, and I wish I had used something like this early on because my pores are severely damaged now.	DO apply it every other night, or even every 2 nights at first.  If your skin is irritated, wait until the irritation goes away before reapplying.  Your skin will get used to it eventually.  For me, it has only taken 2 weeks.	F	30	30  days 1X D	9/27/2011
1	Acne	Dryness, peeling skin, redness, itchiness, soreness and slightly swollen skin.	Used this product 3 times, a thin layer just before going to bed each time. The third morning when I woke up, my skin was extremely sore, peeling, and irritated. When I washed my face, it felt like extreme burning for most of the day. Applying makeup wasn't a good idea as it irritated my skin even more and removing the makeup caused for pain. I won't be trying this cream again.	F	16	3  days30mg 1X D	9/25/2011
2	Acne	Extreme burning sensation, dryness of the skin.	Although Differin did aid my fight against acne, it didn't go without consequences. My face is so sore, I can't apply makeup or aloe or even touch my face without it burning. When I sleep, I have half my face against my pillow, but it even hurts to do that.	F	16	2  months 1X D	8/3/2011
2	cystic acne	After the first week my spots seemed smaller, but now they seem to have evolved a little bigger in diameter, but not as puffy, however redder. I have been applying Differin Creme (must act differently from Differin Gel, dont know) but apply aloe vera gel over it once it has dried. My skin isnt too oily, so after having read the reviews am worried about the extra dryness. I cant say Im satisfied with the results just yet, however will try to see if it works.	Differin is said to promote the formation of collagen which helps not to scar. Thats why I have read its good for wrinkles in some cases. Then I guess its worth the long process, just hope it works for me. Good luck to all!	F	38	2  weeks0.1% 1X D	7/14/2011Email
5	Mild, Moderate, and Hormonal Acne	Burning and dry skin	PLEASE PLEASE READ!When I first started using Differin, I was using it incorrectly. This may be the issue with some of the dissatisfied reviews. Yes, this is an annoyingly lengthy routine, but it works. In most cases your acne will get worse before it gets better. This wasn't a selling point to me, as I'm *very* self conscious about my acne, but I tried it.I have sensitive skin, so I know how the burning side effect can be an annoyance, but please read.AT NIGHT, THIS IS MY ROUTINE1. I wash my face with Fragrance-Free Neutrogena Original Formula. This is the bar soap for sensitive skin.2. I PAT my face dry, wait a few minutes (I usually brush my teeth during this time).3. I apply Tea Tree Skin Clearing Toner (from the Body Shop). Here, you'll notice all of the excess dirt/oil that is hindering Differin's effectiveness.4. I wait 20 minutes and apply a pea sized amount of Differin all over my face.5. I wait another 20 minutes and apply Neutrogena's Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin. It is absolutely imperative that you use a moisturizer. Small whiteheads will start to appear after using this product for a short time. This is the medicine working. Your pores are finally expelling all of that embedded oil. If you have moderate acne, I strongly recommend this product. It is worth it.	F	25	2  months.3% 1X D	7/11/2011Email
3	mild acne	i have some white heads here and there and redness. My skin also got very sensitive.	I barely started. but so far so good. I was worse before i started and thats because i don't even have a week using Differin. :)	F	17	6  dayspea sized 1X D	7/6/2011Email
4	Adult Acne	Burning (feels like face is on fire), face and neck feel hot (even though I don't use it on my neck), rash on neck, dryness, minimal redness & swelling (I have a darker complextion) peeling, breakout of small pimples.	Besides all the side effects I described, I do feel like Differin is working. I used to get several red pimples that left scarring. Since using Differin I have not had anymore red pimples just a breakout of little ones which are now slowly going away. My scars are starting to fade thanks to the peeling of the skin. I have noticed more blackheads I guess that is just the medication drying and pushing the pimples out. I use the Differin 1x every other night (pea sized amount) over cheeks and chin only. I also use another medication Finacea twice a day. I am going to continue to use the Differin and see if things continue to improve. So far so good!	F	29	3  weeks 1X O	6/11/2011Email
5	mild acne	redness, burning, really dry skin	i love this product. i've used this product for over 4 years and i dont know what i would do with out it. Yes the side effects are horrible BUT they only last a few weeks. remember it has to get worse before it gets better. its all worth it in the end!!!	F	19	4  years 1X D	6/8/2011
4	moderate acne, mild wrinkles	Itching, burning, red and swollen eyes with increased sensitivity to any other products. Miserable.	Have experienced these awful side effects off and on during my usage; could not understand why as I never apply the differin to the eye area. Still, excellent results-acne is gone, so was hesitant to give it up completely...have pinpointed the problem. NEVER apply differin to any area of the face before engaging in any activity that induces sweating. It will run into and around the eyes causing these horrible side effects. Apply only at night and wash off before engaging in strenuous activity. No more burning!!!!:)	F	23	4  months 1X D	6/1/2011Email
3	Acne	Itchy and red, puffy eyelids. Itchy, bumpy, rash on neck. Face seemed a bit puffy as well.	Differin did appear to help with my acne. However, due to the side effects described, I decided to discontinue use of it. I tried stopping it for several days and restarted it using it less frequently several times. Each time I tried this, my rashes would clear up and then got even worse each time I restarted it.	F	56	21  days.3% 1X D	5/15/2011

I've had acne for years now and unfortunately I also have eczema which gave me a lot of trouble as a teen.  Fortunately, I was able to find a balance... I use Differin every night and use a Gold Bond skin therapy cream during the day to help with the dryness. I would recommend this product to anyone!

4	Hormonal Acne	redness, drying, flaking	I've only been using Differin for two weeks.  So far the only difference I see is in the texture of my skin. I had to add my comment to stress how important it is to keep the ointment AWAY from your eyes, corner of mouth, and nose.  I look like I have the strangest sunburn and the peeling is a bit embarrasing.  Make sure to pick up a moisturizer to stick in your purse while you're out.  Neutrogena sells a travel size oil-free mousturizer with SPF that work great for my dry skin.	F	23	2  weeks 1X D	4/4/2011

5	severe acne	My acne worsened during the first three months, but it was already so horrible before I started, that I decided to stick with it, and I am SO glad! During the fourth month my acne started improving. The biggest change occurred around month six. My cheeks, chin, and forehead used to be completely covered in small white bumps, and I also had large painful pimples on my face and back. Now my skin is completely smooth and the scars have mostly faded. I feel grateful every single day that I found Differin and that I didn't give up on it during those first 3 months.	Make sure to follow the instructions and keep using the product for at least 6 months before giving up. Differin saved my skin and my life!	F	23	9  monthspea sized 1X D	1/9/2011
2	acne	everyone here is being effected by dryness of the skin but to me I am only getting oily skin a couple minutes after I put it on in the late evening and all night long so of course I am waking up again with more pimples. Is this just my pores being flushed out by the product?	I know four days is not a lot of time for the product to take full effect but I am wondering why I am getting oily skin from it. I am also using Benzoyl Peroxide creamy face wash 4% and doxycycline hyclate pills for acne.	M	20	4  days45g tube 1X D	12/29/2010
3	moderate acne	redness, burning, scaling, extremely dry skin, and a few new deep breakouts	There was very painful dryness and my entire face looked sunburned. I have had scaling around the scrap/hair line. After a week the redness has began to subside, but still very dry skin. Moisturizer has seemed to help, but only minimally. I have seen a few new break outs in areas I don't normally get them, but my problem area (chin and neck) seem to be progressively getting better. I started out with twice a day, but needed to reduce it to 1x per a day because the burning was severe.	M	26	2  weeks 1X D	12/8/2010
4	Severe Acne	For the first 2 weeks I had really painful, dry, and itchy skin. Afterwards it went away but redness didn't go away for about 2 months or so.	It has REALLY helped, I recommend this because it's a topical that actually gets rid of the acne instead of temporarily making it disappear. I do admit, though, that it does take a while- I'm halfway into my fourth month and I have very little acne but it's close to going away. I visited my dermatologist last week and she said I was doing really well; I still have about another 6 months until I can go off of Differin but other than that I'm really happy that it's actually doing something. Looking at my pictures from several months ago I see that it really has made a difference, although I couldn't tell before (since it took so long).	M	17	4  months45g 1X D	11/23/2010

I stopped using it and it's been over a month and my eyes continue to flair up.

4	mild acne and brown spots	drying and flaking of skin	I was not happy at first, due to the drying and sudden appearance of lines around my eyes.  After reading the comments by other readers I realized this is the product working well.  I have begun to use a stronger moisturizer for dry skin and that helps.  I have noticed that several of the brown spots have already begun to fade!  I hope the pronounced wrinkles are just the "snake skin" getting ready to peel and reveal younger looking skin!

1	Severe Teenage Acne	Extreme dryness, extreme itching, Sun sensitivity, red patches all over my arms, redness of the neck, burning, prickling.	This medicine is horrible, never take it. When I was about 11, I started developing severe acne on my forehead, cheeks,chin, forehead and back. They where large, painful cysts. I went to the derm after about a year and she has done nothing but torture me, the whole visit she tried to sell me acne pills that you have to take a pregnancy test to be on (nothing doing!!) and told me that my acne was horrible!! She perscribed Differin and the first couple of months it worked pretty well, it got rid of the painful cysts and a lot of the redness, but then the side affects hit. They are even worse than the acne was, I have to put on lotion and sunscreen 2 or 3 times a day to avoid killing my self for the itching on my upper arms and neck,if I get the lest little bit upset, that makes it itch too, and if I sweat, it burns like crap plus all the other effects I listed above. I am currently not taking it and praying that my acne won't come back.I'm going to make and appointment with ANOTHER derm and get perscribed something different. Please, for your own sake, if your doctor ever wants to put you on this medicine,say no and get something else, you'd probably rather have the acne.I hope I helped someone.

4	moderate to severe acne	I am on Differin for the second time in my life. Had to stop taking it before because I did not have insurance. This product initially causes flakiness and sensitivity but it gets better the more you use it. You can start by using it every other day or so and use it nightly after your skin gets used to it.	My doctor specifically said only a pea sized amount and only at night. The sun makes the medicine ineffective so if you are putting it on in the morning, you are wasting your time! Also you MUST wear sunscreen with this product - it makes you very sensitive to the sun. My doctor also told me that when you apply it, the differin spreads itself once your skin absorbs it. so AVOID ANY AREA BY YOUR EYES! you have to account for the medicine spreading to this area on its own so be careful! Differin changes the direction in which your skin grows, so it is less likely to be clogged by dirt and oil. It is a prevention medicine that only works while you continue to use it!

The only bad experience I had was after using it a few days I had a facial and the products used did not react well with the Differin, causing very red sore skin which took about 4-5 days to heal.

I stopped using it in August(may right now) and my acne slowly came back because I irritated my skin while shaving to much and started takin protein which made my hormones crazy and caused me to break out. Now my acne is SEVERE. I used retin-a for a week n almost cried when i put my face on a pillow because it hurt so bad!The first 3 days of using Differin once again my face felt like a face again and not an open wound.

The product dries out the skin's upper layers as it is supposed to.  The aging appearance is your skin drying out like a layer shedding snake skin (a little embellishing)  that needs to shed to reveal the new skin.  If you can endure the burn torture it is well worth the youthful look you get in a week or two, if you are over 35.  If you are younger you might want to try something else.  As for the acne, mine did get worse over the first 1-2 weeks but dried out and is now healing.  I am on week 2 still.  I think it shows promise but Differin def has a price to get you where you want to go.  Oh, just a good laugh for you: I was chopping chiles the other day and rubbed my cheeks on accident.  Now that together with the 3rd day on Differin and my face was red like a sunburn and wow did it hurt.  I guess the days following that were nothing compared.I did use this product years ago in my early 30s for spot treatment during PMS.  It worked really good.  When I was pregnant at 34 I stopped, as you have to.  It really did not get bad enough to retry meds until now.	F	38	14  days.3% 1X D	3/5/2010

4	Teenage Acne	Inflammation, Flaking, Dryness	Over the last 4 years or so dealing with acne I've tried many prescriptions. Many of which either relieved my acne on a short-term basis or simply none at all. My dermatologist prescribed me differin. As a tip, follow the instructions except for one thing: it is not necessary for you to apply 3-4 pea size drops as it mentions. You only need enough to cover "affected" areas. For me it's one and a half pea size. Combined with a moisturizer such as cetaphil is highly recommended otherwise you can expect excessive dryness and a lot of flaking during the next few days. Dryness and flakes gradually reduce over the course of usage. I apply differin every three days or so ever since I had experiences similar to another user in regards to swollen eyes. Keep it as much as away from the eyes, that includes washing your eyes after applying as you might scratch your eyes or something while sleeping. When my skin started burning I stopped and waited until most of it subsidized and I reapply. Also apply a layer of 30fps sunscreen as any long periods of sun/light source exposure can further make your skin burn. Overall, your skin will get better. I've seen major improvement and there are areas of my skin where it has become smooth. Patience is the key to differin.	M	18	2  months	12/1/2009
2	adult acne-chin and cheeks.	The first two weeks were hell. Couldn't even touch my face or apply make up.My skin was tight and sore and my eyes looked weird! I reduced to putting it on once every three days and then built up to daily use relatively quickly. Apply a very thin layer.	Less is more with this cream. It hasn't made any difference to my skin so far...I still find the creases at the side of my eyes are really sore even though i dont put the cream there at all. Seem to have extra wrinkles around the eyes. Due for a review in january. Dont expect the dermatologist to continue with it. It's not working for me at all.	F	27	4  months	11/22/2009

				F M	 	 	    
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out!

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.	F	38	2  months10mg 1X D	1/24/2011
2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

I cant afford a lawyer or I would sew. SERIOUS BRAIN DAMAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!	I wish i could sew them and make it to where these companies can not sell their poison to another child teen or adult.

Worst feeling ever-it made me not able to think clearly, and keep my train of thought. I got off of it within 1-2 weeks	Spare yourself and don't try it	F	18	2  weeks 1X D	1/9/2011
2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010

I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
