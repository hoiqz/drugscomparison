1	Sinus infection	Diarrhea, SEVERE hives all over body! Had to go to the ER twice.	The hives were so scary (in hair, on face, legs, chest, sides, back, legs) I would NEVER take this product again.	F	37	7  days250 2X D	2/11/2013
1	Bacterial lung infection	On the 4th day into cefzil I suffered a minor stroke, which luckily caused no permanent damage. It probably would have been way worse but it happened at the right place at the right time with someone who knew the signs and symptoms of a stroke.		M	21	10  days500	1/29/2013
1	Ear infection	I would get very nauseous and uncomfortable after taking this pill and I'm almost done my dose and my ear infection still hurts! Didn't work, just made me feel worse.		F	21	8  days500	1/16/2013

1	Pneumonia	My son started taking this after azithromax did nothing.  After the second dose on the first day he had a massive bloody nose and started throwing up.  The second night woke up throwing up again.  Third morning had horrible diarrhea gave him a dose and he threw up again.  He refuses to eat so that' makes everything worse.  I called the doc and they basically said too bad that's what happens with a strong antibiotic.  I try to give probiotics but he refuses.  It is only day 3 and I am scared of how long this will continue.  I can hardly get him to drink water.  I have to say his cough has gotten much better.		M	2	10  days1tsp 2xd	12/2/2012

1	Ear infection  in my daughter	After one dose my 5 1/2 year old daughter was extremely irritable , crying easily , not even going to take the 2nd dose . Asked the dr to switch it .	The same thing happened 2 months ago she was also prescribed cefzil for an ear infection and I didn't pick up on it til  we were a week into the medication but she acted the same way for 10 days . I will never use cefzil again ......	F	5	 250mg 2X W	1/20/2012
1	tonsilitus	Began w/ horrible anxiety and crying and led to feeling of complete depression- dis-connected and lack of emotion. Horrified.	Called dr. on 5th day, did not take it again and he called in augmentin.	F	36	4  days500mg 2X D	4/15/2011Email
3	pneumonia	My daughter is on day four of her prescription.  So far, the only side effect I've noticed is increased moodiness - generally unhappy mood.  She gets upset more easily and cries more easily.		F	6	3  days250 mg/5ml 2X D	4/13/2011
3	sinus infection	first meds didnt work so perscriped cefzil.Almost done & daughter has been feeling ill, headaches daily, anxiety, tired, moody. Other symptoms are better.	When very young experienced a rash with this medicine. Dr. wanted to try again since it was in the second family of penicilin. I am discontinuing & not finishing this medicine. Has any one else have the anxiety & moodiness?	F	16	14  days250mg 2X D	3/15/2011Email
1	sinus infection	Within the first few days of taking the medication I had some small bumps (what I now know were hives) on my lower scalp. I did not realize that I was having a small allergic reaction to the medicine when I noticed these so I continued taking cefzil. I had skipped a few doses by accident and when I finished taking the medicine my lip had a huge hive on it and so did my right arm. I took my prescribed allegra and they went away within a few hours. Later that night it returned and I had hives all over my body. Less than a day and a half later the hives merged into huge patches covering my whole back, stomach, chest and neck. They also covered my whole scalp and spots on my face. My eyes became extremely puffy and then my lips became so swollen they were numb. The doc recommended benadryl and allegra. I took it and a few days later the hives subsided but my hands and feet became swollen and itchy which later subsided.	If you feel anything unusual happening when you take this medicine stop taking it IMMEDIATELY. This allergic reaction was the most horrible thing I have ever experienced.

1	Early Strep Diagnosis	On morning of 8th day 10 year old daughter woke with itchy uncomfortable hives - freaked me out - thought some bug had eaten her alive!!  Turns out totally allergy to Cefzil.  Had no idea it would take days to identify a reaction...only had 1.5 days left on the meds.  Doc prescribed steroid, allergy OTC zyrtec, pepcid and new antibiotic.  She has taken penecillin, amoxicillin with no problems.	Also, not sure if related to this antibiotic, but while on it developed sleeplessness at night and inability to fall asleep which developed into pattern of insomnia.  Never have experienced this problemn with her either.	F	40	8  days150 2X D	9/16/2010
2	BRONCHITIS/SINUS INFECTION	HORRID CHEST PAINS I CANNOT TAKE THIS ANTI B ANYMORE. AT FIRST I DID NOT ATTRIBUTE THE CHEST ACHE AND PAIN TO THIS DRUG AS I AM ON A FEW OTHER THINGS AS WELL BUT IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THE LAST 2 DAYS OF TAKING IT THAT THE PAIN WOULD HAPPEN SHORTLY AFTER MY DOSE AND MY OTHER PILLS DO NOT GIVE ME CHEST PAINS. IT GTO SO BAD THAT LAST NIGHT THE EMS CAME I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I HAD A HEART PROBLEM, THEY CHECKED ME OUT AND OTHER THAN SINUS TACH THEY SAID I WAS OK AND IT PROB WAS THIS ANTI BIOTICCANNOT TAKE IT AGAIN. IN ALL FAIRNESS I AM VERY VERY SENSITIVE TO ANTI BIOTICS, I HAD A SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION TO LEVAQUIN AND NEARLY DIED. THE ONLY ANTI BIOTIC THAT I THINK IS SAFE (AND CAN TAKE)IS AMOXICILLIN BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE DR SAYS THIS IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR WHAT I HAVE AND I DON'T THINK IT IS EITHER. IF ANYONE HAS ANY SUGGESTIONS PLEASE EMAIL! THANKS :)		F	30	4  days500 MG 2X D	8/1/2010Email
1	UTI and possible Strep	HIVES	My daughter is allergic to Penicillin and Sulfa, but the doctor assured me that there is really only less then 10% chance that she would be allergic to this.  She had a very bad UTI and possible Strep. 8 Days after she started taking it, I noticed some hives on her legs. We stopped taking it immediately and now, it's been 3 days since we stopped and it has gotten 10 times worse! The hives on her thighs are very severe and I'm hoping it doesn't spread anywhere else.  I started to see a few on her face.	F	6	8  days250mg 2X D	5/20/2010Email
3	sinus infection/ear infection	nausea, headace, fatigue, irritablity, mucle weakness, aches...feel like I have the flu...feel absolutely horrible..	First time I have taken it...thought I would feel better by now...on day three and think I will call Dr. on Mon.	F	36	3  days	1/24/2010
1	UTI	Horrible hives all over my body, swelling of hands, feet, eyelids and lips, and aches all over.	Hives got so bad I had to go to the Emergency Room where they gave me steroids to help my inflamation. Took Benadryl and Pepcid which helped the itching and reduced the hives. I would not recommend this to anyone, I was very miserable.	F	14	7  days	1/24/2010
4	Infected Lymph Nodes	Horrible Yeast Infection		F	31	6  days	12/19/2009
4	post-H1N1 pneumonia	ANXIETY!!!  Effective, but definite nervousness noted!	Cleared up 6 year old's pneumonia really well, but he developed anxiety "I'm scared" was the refrain from about day 3 thru day 10.(I noticed by mother also became anxious when on the same med a few months ago)	M	6	10  days	11/16/2009
1	ear infection	severe hives and rash over entire body, extreme swelling in hands and feet, fever		F	7	8  days	3/25/2009
1	swimmer's ear	EXTREME nausea within a few minutes of taking.	I took one dose of this medicine 13 years ago, and my life has NEVER been the same! I have suffered from nausea ever since.  I have even had to go to a university medical center, where they blame this medicine for disrupting my stomach.  Cefzil has forever changed my life.  Please, NEVER take this medicine!	F	27	1  days	1/4/2009
1	ear infection	severe itching, rash, severve hives on torso legs arms, tops of feet, esecially under arms, back and neck	Doc rec benadryl to combat the alergic reaction and to notify my child's pharmacist that he cannot take Cefzil	M	3	7  days	12/9/2008
1	sinus infection	Severe vomiting and diarrhea	My daughter had taken cefadroxil a while ago, prescribed by her dermatologist.  She experienced vomiting with that drug.  Her doctor prescribed cefzil, and I didn't realize it was similar.	F	17	5  days	11/11/2008

1	Sinisitus	Hives, severe headaches, dizzy, nausea,swollen ankles, feet and hands, rash all over body after being on the medicine for the 10th day.	It cleared my sinuses, however it had severe side effects.	F	43	10  days	10/8/2007
2	ear infection	Severe hives on torso, primarily under the arms, and fever for 2 days of 102 FIVE DAYS AFTER starting the medicine.	I am terribly allergic to penicillin, so I do not understand why my doctor prescribed this medicine.  I am finding out now that people with penicillin allergies should not take Cefzil.  The hives are severe (I still have them) and had they presented inside rather than outside my body I would have been in real trouble.  Even though I finished the medicine for fear that the ear infection would not go away, I will never take this medicine again. I really should have stopped it, but my doctor was on vacation, not that asking him would have made a difference.  Make sure that you take the lead on your health care.  When your doctor gives you a prescription, before you take it look up the side effects.  Insist that the doctor makes sure that there are no contradictions with other medicines you take.  Finally, carefully monitor your own progress or that of your loved one.  No one should have to suffer because the doctor is busy getting ready to go on vacation and slips and gives a medicine tha	F	52	10  days	8/13/2007
1	sinus infection	had a pretty severe allgergic reacion.  my entire face blew up like a balloon and did not go down for about 5 days, even after I quit this just one day after starting.  my ears almost felt numb, and they were swollen too.	this antibiotic caused more problems for me than the infection is was intended to treat.  god awful.

1	Celulitis	Severe Vomiting, and diareah. Vomiting upto 8 times a day, and BM upto 10 times a day. Loss of appitite for 3 days after stopping the med.	My son was on cefzil because he had celulitis. As if celulitis was not scary enough, he had problems with the medication. As we were going into day 4 of taking it, he woke up at 4:30am, 5:30am, 6:30am, and then again at 8:30am vomiting severely, to the point of dry heaves. That day when he awoke, he vomited some more and then diareah started. This was a Sunday, he kept doing this until Tuesday, when I finally said FORGET IT, and took him off of it. The Doctor said that since his celulitis was improved, that he did not need anymore treatment unless it came back. I will NEVER put one of my children on this drug again. EVER. It also made him loose his appitite the whole time upto 3 days after. THE SYMPTOMS STOPPED AFTER I SKIPPED THE NEXT DOSE. INSTANTLY.	M	6	6  days	1/12/2007Email
1	sinus infection and other	We gave my daughter the first dose as soon as we got home and fed her a small meal. Within an hour or two of taking it she went into a hard seizure. She has never had a seizure ever.She was still in it when we got to the hospital which was only 5 minutes away. That was 3 years ago and we steer clear of all ceflaspore products.		M	4	1  days	12/24/2006
5	sinus infection	light diarrhea but not enough to warrant not taking it again.	I have chronic sinusitis from allergies, but one time it got very severe.  My doctor gave me Cipro, didn't work, then after having an allergic reaction to Tequin my doctor gave me Cefzil.  The sinus infection that had gone on for months causing a great deal of anquish and scorching pain with every breath was made clear within a day of taking it.  After taking the full course, I felt alive again.  It's helped cure two more severe sinus infections I've had over the last few years.  It really works better than anything else with me.	F	36	10  days	11/10/2006
5	strep throat	Vomiting after the first dose, more likely due to high fever or the aweful taste of the oral suspension.	After two doses and a good night sleep the fever of 103 was gone in the morning and only a slight sore throat remains. Very satisfied with the speed of relief of symptoms.	F	6	1  days	11/3/2006
1	Animal Attack wounds infected	severe reaction.  Swelling, hard to breathe, stiff and achey joints.  Continued effects 1 year later.	After being attacked by a wild cat, within 12 hour all wounds were infected.  The doctor said I needed a "gorilla antiboitic" and put me on cefzil.  I took cefzil for 1 week, 1 week after I quit taking the medicine I swelled up like a baloon.  I have never had this happen to me before I took this medicine.  Now roughly 2 times a month I swell up for no reason at all, I'll wake up with swollen lips, stiff joints, shortness of breath.	F	25	7  days	9/18/2006Email
3	pneumonia	No problems until day 3. By night 3 I experienced diahrrea, by morning nausea both day 3 and 4. I was previously on Zithromax with terrible side effects and allergic reaction, then they wanted me on Levaquin, I said no way! Cefprozil (Cefzil) so far has been the only one I can possibly tolerate. But I question it has further assisted my pneumonia, I feel the original Zithromax for 3 days of pills got me on my way well...I still have rumbling and fluid in my left lung. Will be talking to doctor about weather this drug really is going to cover and cure my pneumonia. It's better than Zithromax regarding side effects for me.	Diahrrea, nausea. Still hasn't further gotten rid of my pneumonia. Also have lower back pain that was going away, and is now back on my left lobe (lung). Not sure how much good has really accomplished, but has been the only drug I have been able to tolerate for the pneumonia. No hives for me as I read for others, but some itchiness on my face. No anaphalactic shock like the other drug I took by dy 3.	F	46	4  days	3/20/2006

4	low grade temp 4 days, weak, tired	Taking 250 mg twice per day for 10 days.  Feel slightly floaty like I'm on medication.  No other noticeable symptoms.
