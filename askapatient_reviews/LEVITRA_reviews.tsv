2	ED	Headaches, nasal congestion, coughing, overall flu-like symptoms for days afterwards.	The erection it helped produce was great, so it did what it was supposed to but the side effects were brutal. It would be impossible for me to take this medication and function on a daily basis.	M	44	1  days10 MG 1X D	1/19/2013
5	My erections don't last.	I sometimes have a dull headache after, but nothing serious. Also, for about a day after I get impromptu erections.		M	48	2  years20mg	12/21/2012Email
1	Why does anyone take an ED pill?	No side effects.	Actually no real effects at all. I have tried Levitra several times only to disappoint myself and my wife. Tried again tonight, took one-half and gave it an hour, didn't work so I took another. Little effect. What now?	M	64	2  years10MG 1X AN	12/2/2012Email
5	Erectile Dysfunction	Stuffy nose, LSD like high with regular dose. Makes me extremely horny.  It gives me the BEST hardon of any of the choices. Much bigger and harder.  It lasts in my system 5 days.  Ready at anytime I want it and sometimes when I am not :-) I cut the little pill in 1/4s.  One quarter still does the trick for me and the good effects last for about 4 days. The bad effects, like the trippy feeling diminish considerably. I take care of the stuffiness with Afrin.  Viagra makes me terribly sick with absolutely no hardon.  Cialis works ok but not as well. I have to take Cialis the day before so it will work when I want it the next day. Gives me a headache also.		M	50	10  months	7/27/2012
4	Post Proton Beam for prostate cance	The usual side effects, such as nasal congestion, slight headache, but nothing too dramatic.	I tried the Cialis for daily use.  Not effective unless you take four tablets and then wonder why you are doing that, especially at the cost.  Went back to Levitra, told my wife when I took it, and then we planned sex accordingly.  I do wake up with morning hard ons, and a little masturbating helps, so I am pleased o really.  At 67 I am doing fine and still enjoy a good romp in the sack, even if it is not spontaneous.  We all wish the little man could stand tall on a moments notice, but . . .	M	67	 20 mg 2X W	3/18/2012
4	E.D.	Slight headache.minor stomache upset,moderate stuffy nose	After trying viagra and getting the "blue haze effect,tried Vardenafil. Worked best for me after waiting 90 min. before sexual activity. No visual side affects. Works well, but stuffy nose makes sleeping difficult afterwards. Will try nasal spray to overcome this(?)	M	67	60  days20Mg. 1X D	2/13/2012Email
5	Looking for a boost	Stuffy nose, headache. Relatively minor muscle ache.	I really didn't think I needed it, but I wanted a boost, and I talked my doctor into writing a script. Worked fast and it induced the biggest erection I've  ever had. I didn't measure it, but it was noticeably bigger, especially in girth. seems to work longer than advertised.Will definitely use again.	M	49	 10MG 1X AN	1/23/2012Email
5	Erectile dysfunction	Some nasal congestion and much less often, a minor headache.I had tried using Cialis, but a cumulative overdose left me severe back pain that lasted for weeks. I've never had anything comparable happen like that with Levitra. Just wish it was cheaper.	The effectiveness of Levitra is DRAMATICALLY affected by whether or not you have food in your stomach. Especially oil or fat in the meal. Taking Levitra on an empty stomach, like when first waking up, has the most dramatic effect on good sexual performance. However, taking it after a full meal gives me little effect at all, at 10mg. So now I make a point of having a mostly or completely empty stomach before taking it and then the effect is rapid and strong.	M	55	3  years10 mg 1X W	6/28/2011Email
3	More Reliable Erection	Slight headache, "foggy"-headed.	For me, 1/4 of a 20mg (highest dosage pill for Levitra) pill didn't have the effect when I was tired that 1/4 of a Viagra (100mg) has. Took the 1/4 Levitra, and getting an erection was the same as not taking anything, whereas 1/4 of the Viagra gets me very hard and allows for a stiff one for the next 12-24 hours. (No, the erection doesn't last 12-24 hours, but it's available when needed.) I recommend Viagra over Levitra since it can be cut into quarters and still works. Emails with comments/comparisons/questions welcome.	M	58	1  days20 1X D	2/12/2011Email
4	ED	Flushing face. Nasal congestion or maybe slight swelling? Very bad headache.	The side effects were pretty intense, and the headache lasted for ten hours after originally taking the pill. However, I was able to prove to my lady that I truly am into her. She had been depressed as she thought it was her fault. Started working within 15 minutes of taking the pill, and I lasted for an hour and a half. Twenty minutes later, we went for five minutes before I had an orgasm. However, this time, I was able to let her keep going while, and after I got off. She and I both liked that. It felt just as great as normal, except I wasn't extremely sensitive as I always am after an orgasm. Overall, it worked amazingly. Although the headache was very bad, and I couldn't breath through my nose at all, I'd say it was pretty much worth it.	M	27	3  weeks20MG 1X D	1/18/2011Email
1	ED	None	Just didn't work at all.Switched to Viagra and it worked.	M	64	30  days20 1X D	9/10/2010
4	ed	None other than sone spontaneous erections.	Levitra worked fiarly well for me.  About 30 minutes after taking I would get a hard dick and be able to maintain a good stiff dick for some long term healthy sex. If my girl friend was willing I was usually up to a second round within 30 minutes.  The effects would last 10 - 12 hours. so sometimes I wake in the morning at home with a rock hard and have to do a little hand work. Do not recommed to take during the day due to spontaneous erections.  I had this happen at the gym once and it can cause more than little embarrassment to have 9" boner jump out in the shower with 5 - 6 other guys.  No way to hide it...  All in all very good pill if you need help to get and keep erections.  Just be ready to have sex soon after you take or else you will have to take matterd into you own hands.	M	52	6  months20 mg 1X D	7/5/2010
5	Impotence	Flushing but no negative side effects.	The quality of my erections had begun tapering off before I reached middle age. In middle age erections mostly useless -  I was having about a 25% success rate as far as penetration was concerned. In my middle fifties Viagra came on the market and for about ten years I enjoyed a success rate of about 60% - 70% (funny how you tend to remember the failures). Now that I'm in my late sixties I find myself having fewer successful attempts than a few years ago and have been experimenting with all the meds - including the "generics" online. I definitely get the best - serviceable if not dependable - erections from Levitra.  Although Cials is definitely the longest working Levitra is good for at least 12 hours and because it gives me firmer - if not exactly ridged - erections I'm going to stick with Levitra..	M	69	7  years20 Mg 1X D	5/23/2010Email
4	ed	Stuffy nose, fatigue.	Good stuff, lasts about 3-4 hours after waiting 40 min. Viagra was weak and got teh blue haze thing.	M	50	1.5  years	1/31/2010
4	ED	Severe Stuffy Nose	I realize I'm quite young and shouldn't have to take something like this, however, I've had severe erectile dysfunction for two year before resorting to this pill for help. From my experiences, Levitra takes 15 minutes to start working, 30 MINUTES for full results. I have experienced no side effects other than a SEVERE STUFFY NOSE. Usually taking only half the dosage two hours before the second will prevent this. Effects tend to last 10 HOURS or so for me. I am very pleased with it.	M	24	6  months	11/30/2009
4	ED	Stuffy nose. Slight headache sometimes.	Don't take after drinking coffee or anything caffinated. The stronger the coffee the poorer Levitra acts, with shortened erection time frame and it can make one very sleepy if too much coffee is consumed.	M	63	3  years	11/18/2009Email
5	ED	I am a diabetic and 20 mg did the trick. It lasted to the next day for me. I got facial fushing which you know it has kicked in and headache afterwards but it is all gone by the next day. I have cut the 20 in half and it still works fine with less side effects.		M	49	6  months	10/3/2009
1	Lack of quality erection	I switched to Cialis and it works for me.  Levitra caused my ears to turn red, itch and burn.  Facial flushing was horrible.  It looked as though I had a really bad sun burn.	I have tried all 3; first Viagra, then Levitra, and now Cialis.  I am staying with cialis, on 10MG as needed.	M	47	3  years	6/4/2009
2	ED	About one hour after taking the headache began.  For 24 hours after taking had bad headache, general fatigue and generally felt like doing nothing.  I won't say I wouldn't recommend this just because it doesn't work for me, but the side effects far, far outweigh the benefits.		M	55	1  days	6/2/2009
5	Age related ED	Slight facial flushing as the med takes hold; a good indicator that it's about time to get my money's worth.  Nothing else except maybe a slightly stuffy nose, but it's less a problem than my normal alergies.	I changed to Levitra after finally (after three years) realizing that the Cialis was causing my heartburn and seriously exacerbating what had been minor back pain.  So far the Levitra is working exceptionally for me.  Phew!	M	63	3  months	4/16/2009
2	performance	Massive headache 2 hours after taking levitra.	I noticed a small improvement in performance but had a terrible headache later on.I tought my head was going to explode. Sensitive to light and sound. Not fun. Killed the evening. I won't be taking Levitra again.	M	48	1  days	3/20/2009Email
5	ED	Blurred vision, stuffy nose, light sensitivity.	Works great for me.  Cialis nor Viagra did a thing for me.  The Viagra caused the worse headaches I have ever had.  There was no way I would have wanted sex even if it had produced an erection.  Which it did not.  Cialis did absolutely nothing.  Levitra, even if I cut it into quarters, works for me even 3 days later.  Hardon anytime I want one too.  Very happy with it.The stuffy nose is easily taken care of with Afrin spray or something similar.Love it.  I just wish that it wasn't so expensive.	M	47	2  years	2/4/2009
5	ed	Headache morning after and flushed face.	This ed medication has allowed me to experience multiple erections and orgasm within 2 hours for first time since in my 30's. Wife is pleased with the results! Have used Viagra with less side effects but did not produce as hard an erections or same staying power.	M	56	45  days	1/27/2009
5	Anti-psychotic induced ED	Zero.	Zero side effects at 20 mg.	M	34	3  months	6/16/2008
3	ED	moderate flushing, headache,stuffy nose, nausea	Took less than the required dose & it worked but the side effects were too much to continue taking it. Viagra works so much better for me with very minimal side effects. Levitra lasted longer but Viagra was much less a problem.	M	44	2  months	5/6/2008
5	ED	Stuffy nose and congestion	Great stuff!  Aside from the stuffy nose, I am very satisfied with this medication.  I was reluctant to take a medication, but with a little prodding from my girlfriend, I finally decided to try it.  I am so glad that I did!  I take it about an hour before sex and have had absolutley no letdowns!	M	35	3  months	3/29/2008
5	E. D.	Mild facial flushing, thats it.	Restored my sex life. Take about 7 mg (break 20mg tablet up), works in 15 min to 1 hour depending on how full my stomach is, very, very happy. Does seem to last longer than 4 hours.	M	52	60  days	3/19/2008
5	ED induced by SSRIs	Blurry vision that lasted less than a few hours... but after all, I'm trying to read after taking the drug.	Works fine...  great for the ED.  Did not help with the ejaculation issues by my SSRI.  I didn't need the drug after my SSRIs were regulated and could gain an erection on my own.	M	31	4  weeks	2/23/2008
5	E.D.	Just the usual stuffy nose.	GREAT STUFF!  No bad side effects like the other two e.d. meds. out there.	M	42	4  years	2/1/2008
5	Offset antidepressants	mild facial flushing, tolerable heachache that lasted about halfway into the next day.	taken because of lack of sex drive and erections havent been the same on the antidepressants. took about 15 minutes to kick in on an empty stomach and lasted well into the next 24 hours. saved my sex life.	M	24	6  months	12/9/2007
4	ed			M	75	 	7/1/2007
5	Age-related Impotence/Venous leak	NO SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS! Facial flushing(slightly more pronounced than facial flushing I get from Cialis). Small price to pay when compared to the red face a guy gets when he can't rise to the occasion. Bonus at 66: morning erection next day even after ejaculating the night before.	Powerful stuff! Originally labeled effective for 4 hours. In Europe the label reads 7 to 8 hours and now it seems to be regarded as at least that or longer in USA. I use it in conjunction with Cialis. A couple of Cialis a week - works for maintenance (morning erections for 2 days after each dose) and a Levitra just before show time.	M	66	3  years	5/15/2007Email
