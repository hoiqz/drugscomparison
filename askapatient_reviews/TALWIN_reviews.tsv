1	herniated disk pain	It doesn't help with severe pain, and makes me jittery with lots of energy..Can't stay still, blurry vision, irritable, can't get comfortable...but it's only sometime		F	35	10  days50	3/29/2013
1	Surgery on finger	Extreme nausea and vomiting.	My Doctor recommended taking this medication immediately after my surgery. (Stay ahead of the pain). I followed his instructions even though I wasn't in any pain. Immediately after taking one pill, I became sick and vomited.  I waited the required hours before taking the second pill, which caused the same reaction. I will NEVER take this medication again.	F	63	1  days 2X D	7/11/2012
2	Surgical Tooth Extraction	Tired and nauseous		F	34	1  days5	5/11/2012
5	To geT reAlLY sTonEd	I can't talk walk or walk in a straight linee or evenn type this messege lol       These are aaaaaaaawesome!		M	23	1  days.50 MG	1/25/2012
4	To get really stoned	Can't walk a straight, can barely type this message lol and I have a head high		M	23	1  days.50 MG	1/24/2012
4	1. Shoulder injury, 2. Depression	Taking a full 50 mg pill leads to increasing disorientation and tiredness. 1/4 pill (12.5 mg) usually has no side effects except the occasional upset stomach.	Although I started with Talwin for pain (worked very well), I have mainly used it (unprescribed) to help with depression. I am also on anti-depressants. When I am extremely depressed and non-functional, 1/4 pill (12.5 mg) gets me out of it. There is the temptation to continue taking 1/4 pills, but I can limit it to 2/day for 3-4 days. By then, I'm ok.	F	48	10  years12.5 2X D	7/13/2010Email
1	migraine rescue medication		Might as well have taken nothing. Absolutley no relief.	M		7  days	11/12/2008
5	Fibromylagia and lumber pain	Makes me hyper and sweat	Im using talwin with tylenol allready added. Its the best pill I have found. Regular Talwin made me have vision problems.  I am Pain free finally.	F	54	30  days	8/8/2008Email
5	Gunshot Wound to shoulder	I had no side effects at all using this. I was taking so many vicodin 750 that I had major allergic reaction.	This is the best pain killer I have ever used and did not make me stupid or dizzy or high.. If you are in severe pain and I mean severe, this works wonderful without any side effects used as prescribed. Also because I took 1 per day and it killed pain all day til the next morning, I had no withdrawals.	F	43	5  months	7/13/2008Email
5	Headaches	None	It was the best thing I have ever taken for headaches	F	55	20  years	6/27/2008Email
1	dry socket	extreme disorientation, passed out, the "fuzzyness" lasted for over 24 hours and couldnt walk or stand without falling down.		F	26	3  days	4/18/2008
5	severe pain (kidney stones)	Talwin takes the edge off the pain for me but doesn't have the mental confusion side effects many narcotics have for me.  I can still function on it.	I have had probably half a dozen or more Talwin prescriptions since my twenties and prefer it to Percocet or Vicodin, which make me nauseated.  I have never taken it longer than three or fours days at a time, however.  I keep it on hand for horseback riding injuries.	F	53	30  years	10/28/2007
5	back pain	Do not drive until medicine wears off.  Similar to 3 martinis.	My back hurt for 2 years, related to deformed vertebra. I slept next to a back brace which I needed to strap on before I could stand up. Over 2 years, doctors prescribed a long list of medicines which only ruined my digestion.  A new doctor prescribed Talwin for 6 weeks.  Following 6 week course, back pain remained gone and has since been kept under control with regular exercise and occasional use of Talwin, a couple pills per year.	M	40	6  weeks	10/17/2007
1	infection from bone graft in finger	Fever, extreme nausea & vomiting (even with food), heart racing, extreme dizziness & vertigo, couldn't sleep but was in this weird 1/2-dream state with really fast & often disturbing images/thoughts. It's supposed to last 4 hours but after 8 hours I could barely stand.	This was the worst medicine experience I've ever had! I'd much rather have the pain, & I hate pain. It takes longer to metabolize than stated on the label (in my case & it looks like some others, too).  I switched to plain old regular Tylenol... scared of pain killers at this point.	F	30	1  days	10/11/2007
1	shoulder pain	I had severe vomiting for 3 days, extreme restlesness,suicidal thoughts. No pain but I stopped cold turkey and had the worst week of my life. This drug is dangerous.	I ran out of the drug after 1 week and before I could get more I went into withdrawal. In less than 24 hours my body reacted severely to the chemical dependancy.	F	45	8  days	6/23/2007
1	pain reliever	Paranoia which lasted for 3 days. Very disconcerting!	Would never take it again	F	84	1  days	8/11/2006
1	Knee surgery	Began vomiting within an hour, vomited for 24 hours. Didn't realize this was what caused it until I took a second one and vomited for 18 hours. I will never take another one. The Doctor said put these on your allergic list.	I reccomend that you do not buy this.	F	68	2  days	6/22/2006Email
5	Dry Socket - tooth extraction	I am highly codeine intolerant.  I was in such pain from a condition I got after a tooth extraction called Dry Socket that the dentist called the pharmacist and he recommended this.  Combined with a few Advil it got me through the nightmarish pain I was in with no bad side effects at all. It had a relaxing effect which was helpful due to the pain I was in.  It was a lifesaver for me but I could see how it would be addictive over a long period of time due to the relaxing effects the drug has.  I am glad to have finally found a painkiller that actually works for me though, to be taken only when I really need it!		F	45	7  days	4/13/2006
1	shoulder pain due to surgery	sever abdominal pain and cranmping and vometing	2 Trips to the E.R. for severe pain. Why is it still available?	M	45	3  days	12/16/2005
5	back pain	high energy	i think its a great drug my back feels good and i have energy	M	42	2  months	11/29/2005
1	hip pain	extreme dizziness--extreme nausea--could hardly stand up.  thought it had worn off the next morning but i vomited until my chest hurt.		F	35	1  days	7/22/2005
5	back pain	inncrease in energy.		F	43	1  days	5/16/2005
1	Hip surgery infection	after 2o minutes - good high. But - my doctor had me on it for 1.5 years. Highly addictive - caused depression,halucinations and took a long time for withdrawal.		M	32	1.5  years	5/13/2005
1	abdominal pain	vomited for 6 hours until it wore off. mild hallucinations (waking nightmares?). The vomiting was so painful to my already-sore abdomen that it counteracted the pain relieving effects. I was so dizzy I could hardly stay upright to vomit.	I was given this because I'm allergic to opiates. The pain would have been better.	F	37	1  days	3/22/2005
1	back pain	Years later Talwin caused me permanent damage - physical, finanicial and emotional.  It is highly addictive.  I can't understand why this drug is still on the market.	DON'T BUY THIS DRUG!!!			 	1/7/2005
1	For a toothache	Took one pill..immediate dizzyness...passed out and saw black whirlpools...could not wake up enough to call my husbands name!..Finally awoke and vomited. Now it is on my allergic list to all doctors and hospitals.		F	40	1  days	10/1/2004
4	Hernia operation	I actually took Talacen, similar to Talwin but with the analgesic part being asprin. The drug worked well to control pain, caused a warm fuzzy feeling without any negative side effects.	Seemed to react well with caffeine? Strange but true.	M		 	1/16/2004
1	Surgery;  Rotator cuff repair	25 MG every 4 hours;Instant nausea, vomiting, sweating and hallucinations.... Only took three doses.	The nausea, vomiting an hallucinations were worse than the pain I was trying to relieve.	M	73	1  days	9/21/2003
5	stress	dizziness after prolonged higher doses	awesome	M	26	3  months	7/25/2002Email
