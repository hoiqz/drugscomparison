5	dyshidrotic eczema (Pompholyx)	none? (when using 0.05 % hydrophilic cream on fingers for 3 nights max only)	I used 0.05 % hydrophilic cream / Use for 3 nights in a row max, then 5 nights rest & apply again if necessary / for better effect apply and cover with plastic (only do this on strong, thick skin such as our fingers) / do not apply when skin is open / only apply at night; give skin rest during the day / plastic-trick not advisable on other body-parts. / be careful, extremely strong medicine. / hydrophilic cream (white, NOT the petrol jelly type) works best/stronger.

5	Hair Loss	I had hair loss in Qaurter size area, Dermatologist injected hair growth solution under my scalp (some sort of Rogain maybe), and then prescribed this topical solution.  I used it only at night on the bald area.  I soon noticed hair stubble growing and then before too long, my bald area was full.  I did not have any side effects at all.  I still use it when my hair thins due to stress.  I hope it works for you.		F	36	3  years	1/28/2009Email
