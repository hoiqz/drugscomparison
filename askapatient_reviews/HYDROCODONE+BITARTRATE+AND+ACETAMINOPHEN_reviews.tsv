2	knee surgery and other pain	Have had this drug on and off for years for varied pain.  It does not work anymore.  It takes 15 MG MINIMUM to help me with the pain.	I am trying to avoid pain meds all together these days even with my chronic pain. It's addictive and I got used to it really fast.

4	moderate-severe neck pain	euphoria, lightheadedness, itchy nose, mild drowsiness	(Generic) Vicodin is the ONLY thing to take away the excruciating neck pain that I've had for the past month as a result of a muscle spasm. I tried various NSAIDs in high doses & two different muscle relaxers to no avail. This is the ony drug that helped significantly with the pain. I don't mind the side effects at home, but at work they are a little distracting. It's worth it for the relief of chronic pain!	F	39	2  days5-500 2X D	6/29/2011
1	Moderate back pain	This drug did not provide ANY noticeable pain relief. Instead, I experienced headaches, drowsiness, mild depression, numbness and feeling "stoned."	Everyone's body chemistry must be different because this drug worked wonders for my mom after she had a total knee replacement. As for me, it did nothing but add to my problems. Will not take again.

4	Torn rotaters cup	Very itchy all over. Dizziness. stomach aches sometimes. vomiting.	When starting to fall asleep at night, just when i began to go into a dream I would hear a really loud popping noise and would make me jump right out of bed. every night this would happen, I know you may look at it is as if it were maybe because of how many i was taking at a time, but i really couldnt help it everyday i would take more and more because i kept gaining a high tollerance to them after a couple of months i started to realize that this was probably do significant damage to my body and havent took them sence. I got so bad into taking them i was taking over 17 aday at one time, i was surprised i never came close to an overdose.	M	18	2  months1000 Mg 10X D	3/22/2011Email
3	Kidney stones	Itchy nose(!) and nausea / lack of appetite	I had to take this for pain due to kidney stones.

5	post surgical hip replacement	Constipation, loss of appetite, withdrawal	I'd still be taking this if my surgeon would let me.  I started out taking 8 a day, and eventually weaned myself down to one per day.  Withdrawal lasted for about 1.5 weeks.  It's great for surgical recovery until you have to give it up.  Milk of Magnesia worked for me for the constipation and I lost 15 pounds from loss af appetite.	F	50	2  months 1X D	1/24/2011
4	Fibromyalgia (daily widespread pain	None.	I have daily widespread pain, in various locations in varying intensity every day since 1998. I wake up in pain and go to bed in pain, sleep is even painful. I do not have a propensity for addiction. I have used the same dose (5mg) and frequency of this drug for 10 years. It still works the same as it did 10 years ago. It doesn't take all my pain away but it helps a great deal and allows me to make it through 2/3 of the day without being severely limited by pain, hold down gainful full time employment and lead a somewhat normal life, for that I am very grateful.

4	Back pain	Works wonders for my back pain, best to take with food to avoid nausea.	Found myself taking it more often than prescribed because it kills the pain and makes me want to do stuff. The euphoric rush that gives you energy feels great, however tolerance builds and you need to take more and more. Sometimes have strange dreams, however I actually enjoy bizarre dreams and just laugh it off. Overall a wonderful drug, try to get it with the least tylenol mixed in such as 5/325mg or 10/325. Tylenol can cause liver damage over years of usage	M	43	1  years5/325 3X D	12/29/2010
5	Neck/joint pain + Chronic head ache	A little foggy at first, But zero sleep issues. Puts me in a great mood, Most likely due to the fact that I'm virtually pain free for the first time in 15 years..	I had been living in vegas for awhile, And finally decided it was time to look into some other options for pain treatment. I had done everything I could to avoid having to depend on RX drugs. Unfortunately after 15 years of trying everything else, It just wasn't enough anymore..After having a couple of visits with my families dr, We decided it would be worth a shot to start on a low dose of hydrocodone, And it was truly a life saver!..Sadly I had to move and am now stuck having to deal with dr's who are scared to RX a narcotic and I'm back having to try all the other crap that doesn't work first! I've even been given multiple urine tests all of which have been negative for every possible drug! So expect to jump through a few hoops and try a few different dr's before given an RX for this medicine..Bottom line, is it actually works!..	M	28	3  months 2X D	10/24/2010
4	shoulder surgery	I was taking 1 pill 2x day off and on for 2 yrs. In the last 2 months i started taking 2 pills 2x day. Boy was that a mistake. I experienced insomnia for 2 months straight and didn't feel like i could function without the pill. So, a week ago i decided to stop cold turkey, another major mistake.  After the 2nd day, i started experiencing chills, couldn't sleep for 3 days because my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest cause it was beating so fast, i felt like i was having a heart attack, i felt nauseated and had muscle aches. After the third day without any hydrocodone, i had to start taking clonazepam to calm my heart rate down. It did help quite a lot. I won't be taking anymore hydrocodone. Also, i know that clonazepam is very addictive too. I'm only taking .5mg/1x day for about a week until the withdrawal my symptoms subside. After this, absolutely no more prescribed medication for me, period! unless it's life or death.Don't fall into the trap like i did.  I kept t		M	47	2  years7.5/325 2X D	10/20/2010
4	Pinched Nerve/Interstitial Cystitis	None	It took four trips to the emergency room before someone prescribed this. Turns out I have a pinched nerve in my right hip that radiates pain from my hip to my right knee. One to two pills every four hours as needed.  At first one pill was enough to deaden it enough for me to get to sleep. Either the pain is increasing or my body is getting used to the medicine. That is scary because the pain is the kind you actually contemplate cutting your leg off to stop. Interestingly enough, it also helps with my Interstital Cystitis, although it isn't prescribed for it. Kill two pains with one stone?  I'm not complaining. I have had to use it every day for the last couple weeks, sometimes a couple times a day. I'm not noticing any side effects/addictive tendencies. Can't wait to get off it though.  Why take chances?	M	39	3  months7.5-15mg 1X D	5/2/2010Email
3	severe menstrual cramps	drowsiness, mental fog, high as a kite	have tried every possible remedy under the sun for my horrible cramps and asked my doctor for something stronger, just to use a few days a month. This is a lifesaver for me...for the first time in a LONG time, I can be pain free instead of doubled over in pain, missing work curled up in bed, etc. I combined 1 hydrocodone w/ 2 Advils and it really took the pain away. The only problem is I feel so stoned after just taking 1 and I can't be taking that while I'm at work.  I will definitely only be taking it on the severe pain days as I do love the fact it takes the pain away, but don't like the side effects.	F	38	2  days5-500 2X D	4/14/2010
5	post op pain	Sedation/euphoria/itchiness/thats about it	The stuff worked too well apparently so they gave me Darvs instead. It's ok to live with pain, but GOD FORBID if you get some euphoria. The stuff actually worked though, but wore off quickly. I could see how this could be very addictive given world and time enough.	M	27	5  days10-20mg 4X D	2/11/2010
5	chronic headaches; neck pain	felt the 'euphoric' effect of the drug for about the first week, and it was actually kind of nice: a lovely warm glow. wanted to hug everybody, mostly because *the pain was gone at last!* since then, no 'glow', just continued effective pain relief.	this drug probably saved my life. had chronic headaches for *years*, and got no relief whatsoever while the docs danced around prescribing everything except what worked. "try this muscle relaxer!" "now try this anti-depressant!" when i finally met a doc with the guts to prescribe the feared and dreaded narcotic (gasp!) painkiller, i got my life back. yes, it can be addictive. i've gone through withdrawal twice: it was no fun, no sleep/irritable for about 3 days; but certainly nothing like the throes of heroin withdrawal like they show in the movies. comparing the pain of withdrawal to the pain of my headaches (that only this drug can fix) is like comparing an ant to an elephant. alleviation of constant pain is a gift from god; and easily worth the price you *might* pay by taking this drug. can't recommend it highly enough.

5	Fibromyalgia	dry mouth	this is a wonder drug. its the only medication im currently taking that truely helps with the fibromyalgia pain. before being put on hydrocodone I could barely get out of bed, now I can function like a normal person im soooo glad to have my life back. I hear a lot of people talk about the addiction problems with this drug but I think you can only become addicted to it if you have an addictive personality, withdrawl isnt fun but it could be a lot worse and it only last a couple of days. if even that long.

5	Lumbar Spinal Stenosis	Constipation. Drowsiness. Addiction.	It takes the edge off of the pain. Nothing seems to take the pain away completely, but I'll take a reduction any time! Taking no more than 3 a day at most. Average is probably 8 in a week.	M	68	 	3/27/2009
4	Back and Joint pain	The side effects were itching, nausea, sweating,bad taste in the mouth, constipation and fear.	The effects from this medication is almost not worth it. It can be addictive, use with caution. it has the effects of a drug addict!	F	63	2  years	3/9/2009
4	Acute Shoulder pain	Facial acne. Middle of the night erections.	Use sparingly if you must. If you have an addictive personality, I would suggest talking to your doctor BEFORE using it.

5	bleeding ulcer pain	Sometime I feel drowsiness and a lack of energy, I have literally fallen asleep at my desk at work, but I take other meds to and think it was a combination.  Other days I feel great and have more energy than I normally would.	I love it, it helps me get through the day.  I also take an anxiety med daily and if I am having an "episode" as I like to call them and the anxiety med alone isn't helping taking one 7.5 hydrocodone does the trick, I calm down and continue on with my work day.  I usually am more productive after I have taken the combo and calmed down, alone they don't work near as well.  I've been taking hydrocodone for over a year now off and on due to what they thought was pancreatitis and later this summer realized I had a bleeding ulcer instead the whole time.  Needless to say I spent 21 days over the summer in the hospital and am allergic to NSAIDS so hydrocodone was my otpion.  Had morphine the 2nd time I was in the hospital and I liked that I could have that every 2 hours but the hydrocone worked better even if I had to wait every 4 hours.I go to the dr tomorrow and am hoping that after I explain all that has been happening and that our trip to Mexico (probably not the best pl	F	39	1  years	12/30/2008
5	ankle & knee trauma, arthritis	Mild side effects include sweating and occasional stomach upset.  I dont experience the "euphoria" other people report, but this is not a party for me. I use it for pain management only, so I can continue to work and get some use out of my body despite the damage done.	My one regret about this medicine is that it took so long to get my physisicans to presribe it.  There is a stigma attached to these drugs that to me seems ridiculous, it is NOT okay to live with extreme pain when there are options available such as this prescription medication.  People do abuse these drugs, and they are addictive when abused I am sure, but this medication has been a blessing to my life and I am able to do more now than I have for a number of years.  Where nothing else has worked at all, this medicine had made it possible for me to continue being productive and reasonably content despite the damages done to my joints.  It is not a cure, but I dont think many medicines are, it is a means of pushing through pain so I can go live a reasonable life and handle my daily matters.	M	47	2  years	12/15/2008
5	Back pain	Happy, addictive, over exertion since I don't feel the pain so I feel later	I started taking for back pain, then just to get through the work day, then because they make me smile alot and very happy. I get energetic and goofy. I stopped taking for awhile because I realized I was getting addicted and went through the withdrawals. Now, I only take when I need them, but they are fantastic for pain.

4	PERIOD Cramps Endometriosis	Dependency even when I don't have cramps :(	I started about a year ago taking it for menstrual cramps, now I take it for anything. Helps me clean the house and actually feel like doing my chores and going to work.  I am sad I am out and going through these awful terrible withdrawals that I didn't think I would have.  Sweats, my legs and arms hurt when I try to sleep, grouchy as hell, etc.  I love this stuff and that is terrible.  I want more, how do people stay on this for so long I can't get my OBGYN to prescibe it to me and he diagnosed me with Endometrios just yesterday, this is the time I REALLY NEED IT and only my Family MD will give me 30 every two months.

3	Osteoarthritis & Fibromyalgia	I get a headache in the back of my head and neck when I sleep after taking it. It also makes me itchy and gripy. It caused my husband to loose all interest in sex and he became addicted. I do not have addictive personality traits so even with the euphoria it sometimes produces I only take it rarely. It does nothing for my pains. Some people swear by it. NOt me.	I think used in the right way it may help some people. But extreme care should be taken to avoid liver failure and if you have any signs of addiction get off it. Take only as needed.	F	54	10  years	2/1/2008Email
3	Pain from an accident	At first extreme nausea and just feeling horrible all over.	Do not take this drug unless you absolutely have to.

It is not really great at killing pain, it makes you not care as much about the pain	F	55	7  years	12/21/2007
5	WISDOM TOOTH EXTRACTION	While taking these meds, I get an EXTREME jolt of energy...to the point where I can't even sit down. Other than that there are no side effects.

5	Severe degenerative disc disease	Mild constipation, mild disruption in sleep if taken at bedtime, very little sedation unless already sleepy	For 21 years I have dealt with pain in my lower lumbar area. A combination of genetic predisposition and heavy lifting in the gym (since I was 17 years old) resulted in episodes of moderate to severe back pain. It began with episodes every 18 months then became more frequent from 1986 to 2002, when it became more chronic and included severe sciatica in left hip and leg. Three MRIs since 2003 have revealed worsening severe degenerative disc disease in vertebrae T12 thru L5, along with lumbar stenosis, spondololysthesis, arthritis, you name it! I tried Neurontin (too sedating), Ultram (non-narcotic but ineffective), Percocet (too strong), spinal corticoid injections (ineffective), Lyrica (VERY dizzy) and plain old physical therapy - all to no avail. The hydrocodone (either lortab 10/500 or Norco 10/325)work perfectly every time, with very few side effects and no euphoria. Over all these years, I have to have built up some tolerance (I went from 5mg to 7.5mg to 10mg)but am still able to k	M	48	21  years	6/19/2007

Takes two hours w/ 2 tabs to get small amount of pain relief, and but then only 2 hrs of pain relief. Am concerned about acetominophen/liver damage so want to try something that contains no acetominophen. maybe ms contin? i have real pain...did not experience any buzz.	F	39	30  days	4/22/2007
1	migraines and back/shoulder pain	I was prescribed 10/325 potency, 1/2-1 tablet as needed. I took 1/2 last week. It was great at relieving the pain, and I actually felt a sense of euphoria. It wore off quickly, and after that, I felt some mild anxiety, but brushed it off, thinking it was just a contrast to how good I felt shortly before. Last night I took another 1/2, and today I've been increasingly anxious and fearful all day, until right now I'm in an advanced state of anxiety and can't seem to do anything about it. I didn't know anxiety/fear can be a side effect until I looked it up just now. It is unusual but can happen. I'm afraid even more because anxiety raises my high blood pressure. I feel absolutely dreadful and scared. I will never take this drug again.		F	57	2  days	12/20/2006

4	Post surgery pain relief	constipation, itchy belly, vivid and strange dreams - some very sexual, mental fatigue (getting easy words confused, forgetfulness)	This definitely took the edge off of the pain, but I found that I really didn't care about anyone or anything while I was taking it. At this point (6 days in) I want to continue taking this for the pain relief, but have decided to stop since I know that it is already affecting how I feel about my toddler son and my husband.

5	dysmenorrhea	Some drowsiness, sleep disturbance, urinary retention,  constipation, and dry mouth.  Some dizziness and the usual feel of relaxation that comes from opiates.  Withdrawal does happen if you stop use suddenly, but addiction and tolerance are easily avoidable if you take a few days away from it every week.	I say hydrocodone is the greatest medication ever produced. It gave me my life back and allowed me to live normally.  10 -15 mgs will completely knock out even the severe, stabbing abdominal/pelvic pain.    Elevates mood as well to treat the depression that comes with chronic pain.   Before hydro, my life was planned around monthly torture sessions, when I would literally wish for death.  I was so desperate for relief that I turned to alcohol and any drugs I could get my hands on, meanwhile getting ulcers from chronic use of Advil and other OTC meds.   On Hydro I can be physically active and am no longer a prisoner of pain.    This is truly a wonder drug that should be easily available to everyone.  Instead it is tightly controlled and people are living in pain and forced to take dangerous and ineffective nsaids.   Many doctors are reluctant to prescribe it, and that is terrible since OTC meds are so damaging to the liver and kidneys, while opiates cause no such harm.   Someday I hope	F	29	3  years	10/24/2006

5	Breakthrough Pain from AS	mild dizziness if I haven't taken it in awhile.	I take this as needed for breakthrough pain with my ankylosing spondilitis.  I currently use fentanyl patches for round the clock pain relief. This medication works very well when my pain becomes aggrevated because I tried to do too much or I lose control of the pain due to stress.  I use the 10/325 strength and take anywhere from half a tablet to two tablets as needed.  I generally use between 10 and 50 tablets a month depending on the weather and my activity level.  Have never noted any withdrawal symptoms from using the medication at this level.  I have also noted that the Mallinckrodt generic tends not to work near as well as the other brands do though not sure why.	M	38	12  years	1/10/2006Email

When I told my plastic surgeon that the hydrocodone was not working he asked me if I were accustomed to taking lots of pain killers like I was a crack addict.  I told him that I rarely had occasion to take anything stronger than tylenol.  They just didn't work for me.	M	46	10  days	1/9/2006
