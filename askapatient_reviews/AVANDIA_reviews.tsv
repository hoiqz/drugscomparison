1	Told had Type 2 Diabetes	My then 85 year old mother was told (out of the blue)she had Type II Diabetes by a PA after a high glucose reading; no one in our families have had diabetes.  No discussion- no A1C info provided or tested.  She took it for over a year and my siblings and I believe that was the start of her dementia symptoms.  She was told in August of 2010 by a specialists that indeed, she did NOT have diabetes.  She was put on this serious RX when she did not need it.  She experienced headaches, anxiety, confusion.  She seems much better now OFF of Avandia.	This is a scary drug and doctors need to be sure to check to see if some of the old standby diabetes meds won't work just as well with fewer side effects.  They also need to truly verify with proper tests that patients DO actually have diabetes before being so fast with the scripts.	F	85	  1X D	10/4/2010
1	Diabetes Type 2	Extreme weight gain. Rapid heart rate up to 300bpm. Had ablation surgery about two weeks ago. Have already made a trip back to the hospital with severe chest pain and heart rate back at 200 to 300bpm. Not looking hopeful. May have to have another surgery. I have not taken Avandia since 2007. Been going back and forth to the ER since 2006.	I have not found a doctor yet to agree that it was the Avandia caused this problem. They are scared. Glaxo may have threatened to hit them with a lawsuit. My family has no history of Heart disease. I had a CT scan of my heart and was told that I have the heart of someone in there late teens to early 20's. Attorneys will not acknowledge because I did not have a heart attack or die. I was told to come back after I have a heart attack. My quality of life has changed drastically. I have not been able to return to work yet. May not be able to.	M	44	3.5  years8mg 2X D	9/25/2010

1	Type 2 Diabetes	Massive weight gain that i can not get off. Can't walk for very long.  I requested to be taken off the drug 3 times before my specialist finally told me she was taking me off of it.  I have been off of it for over a year and still have the weight gain, trouble walking and have certainly start having my heart race so fast I feel as though it is going to come right out of my chest.	This drug should be taken off the market before it causes more trouble.	F	55	1.5  years2mg 1X D	8/9/2010

1	DM2	I started to experience chest pains a few years after taking this drug. (avandamet) I would describe the chest pain as heaviness and aching that would leave me with a feeling of anxiety. I would also feel palpitations and an irregular heart beat. My heart would speed up and then slow even when i would be sitting in bed or asleep. The pain would not be relieved by rest and would come at any time and last for hours sometimes.	I was having chest pains so severe one day that I checked myself into the ER. I was monitored and had an ECG done along with other blood tests, but they all came back normal. I have been complaining of these pains for years to friends, family and my doctors and all of them accused me of lying or exaggerating! I am so happy to hear I am not crazy! I got off of avandamet let year and since then I have been controlling my sugars with other meds.  The chest pains have started to die down a bit, but they have not gone away! I'm scared!

1	diabetes	heart problems, lack of energy	I was taking Avandia for six months and was very disturbed when I saw the US Senate report that tied Avandia to heart attacks. My family suffers from heart disease and I had been feeling pain in my chest as well, so I talked to my doctor and he took me off of it and put me on Byetta. I found a great website called dgmslaw.com/avandia that has some good information about lawsuits people are taking against the drug company	M	55	6  months8mg 1X D	3/29/2010
1	diabetes	extremely tired most of time.  Much weight gain.  Hair thinning,legs and feet swell,taste buds changed.  Severe stomach aches every time I take this, last all night.	When I first heard about the concern of Avandia side effects (2yr ago)and that anyone taking it should discontinue, I took the article to my doctor.  She replied she was not concerned, in fact she DOUBLED my dose.  I was furious, but I figured she is the doctor, she should know what she is doing.I don't see any positives from this med.

1	type II diabetes	I have gained so much weight and I feel like it is mostly fluid.  My left ankle is swollen and top of left foot is very painful.  I feel as if I have absolutely no energy.  I swear I have been eating small portions and low caloric food but I keep on gaining weight.  My legs hurt in the joints.  I used to love to walk and now I get out of breath and feel as if I cannot go a step further sometimes.	About 6 months ago I told my doctor that I read the warnings about this drug and that I took myself off the medicine.  He told me that the Type 2 was more dangerous and convinced me to stay on the med.  I feel so terrible that I am taking myself off again until I see my doctor in April.  I feel awful.

1	Diabetes Type 2	With Avandia and Metforming:  Swollen right ankle, weight gain, chest discomfort, sensitivity to the sun (pins and needles) . When taken off Metforming and put on  Avandia and Januvia my weight ballooned from 150 Lb. to 171 Lb. I was put back on Metforming but my weight never returned to 150 Lb. (I was eating small meals.)	Even though I clearly had classical Avandia side effects my now ex-doctor refused to take me off the drug. By the way, he did the same thing with Crestor. I had terrible side effects  (shoulder, elbow and left hip P-A-I-N #@%!). Since Crestor was not part of my insurance formulary he had to take me off and put me on Zocor. My pains melted away as if by magic. But I am not done with this so called doctor, yet - for I am reporting him to my Insurance Company (Humana TriCare). I feel he is on the take(kickbacks from drug companies).	M	61	7  years8 MG 1X D	3/6/2010

4	Type 2 Diabetic	No apparent effects.	Initial 2000 mg of Glucophage/Metforin was not enough and Avandia was added to stablize blood sugars.  Never experienced weight gain as attributed to Avandia. Eating habits/exercise and aging have caused me to be placed on Janumet then Glipizide after 5 years from initial diagnosis to stabilize blood sugars but Dr did not want to increase Avandia due to potential weight gain.

First 2 years the dosage was set at 2mg but my doctor was not satisfied with my average glucose levels so he increased the dosage to 8mg. I began retaining fluids and had two incidents of emergency room visits with congestive heart failure. Was hospitalized in the seventh year with the symptoms listed.  At that time I was taken off Avandia (Rosiglitazone) given blood,gamma-globulin, and Lasix.  I strongly recommend this drug (Avandia/Rosiglitazone) be discontinued.	M	68	7  years8mg 1X D	2/7/2010

Knocking myself out trying to control weight and still gained.  This kind of gain is not how I normally gain weight.	Weight continued to climb in spite of increased exercise: 7 days a week with excellent diet control.  Lost weight when Dr. took me off it in '07 scare.

1	Type II Diabetes	I was just put on the avandia about 3 weeks ago along with 2000 mg of metaformin.  At first my doctor had me take 1000mg of metaformin and 4 mg of Avandia in the morning and then again at supper.  After 3 weeks I have such shortness of breath that I can not function, I sit on the couch with my feet up because of the swelling and the inability to move without choking.  I have been off the avandia for about 5 days and i have already dropped over 10 pounds, my ankles are back to normal and i can breathe.  I still have a little congestive heart tickle/cough but that is also improving.  My mother also took this drug 2 years ago and she about died from it.	If you are taking this drug be prepared to feel horrible and you may be risking your life.  I have had no improvement in my daily sugars in 3 weeks from this drug and when i return to my doctor in 2 weeks i will be talking to her about something less hard on my heart.

1	Diabetes type 2	19 pound weight gain (fluid) in 5 days. it.	BP went up, leg pain was significant.  Diuretics (water pill) did not help.  One doctor detected possible cardiac (heart) impact.  I was lucky - it did not happen.  This occured about 6 weeks after starting Avandia.  Came off Avanida, in three weeks total fluid retention gone and weight back to pre-Avandia days.  Will never take again.			6  weeks	5/18/2009
1	Type II diabetes	Stomach pain and some swelling in the extremities	Tried Actos (gave me severe diarrhea and stomach cramps).  Then Januvia (didn't help) and a new dr gave me AvandaMet.  It advises you not to take anti inflametories while on the drug.  More than a year after going off the drug, I still can't take ibuprofen without it causing severe stomach pain.  So I must take medication for the pain in my feet and hands.  Finally ended up on insulin.  Wish I would have started it sooner.	F	48	90  days	5/16/2009Email
1	Type II Diabetes	Right from the first dose, my ankles swelled and the next day blood cells were forced into my skin tissues and my lower legs became cherry red.  I spoke to my doctor and she took me off the AVANDIA.  It is now over a year since and my skin is an ugly, blochey brown.  It seems like it will take forever to clear up, if it ever does.

3	Type 2 Diabetic	I have been taking Avandia for 8 years now.  My legs are double in size now, even though I am taking a water pill.  My knees are constantly swollen, and very painful.  I had an MRI done on them in July, 2007 because my PCP thought I had a tumor growing out the side of my knee.  It was "subcutaneous" fat cells and I suspect it is from the Avandia.  I have gained a lot of weight in the past 8 years, and have tried diet after diet.  I have also been diagnosed with Arthritis, because of the pain in my legs, arms, muscles.  I suspect that is all from the Avandia also.  I tried other meds and none have worked for me like the Avandia, so my doctor keeps me on it.  The Amaryl put me into a diabetic coma after 1 week, and Glucophage didn't work at all.  I tried many others.  I take 8 mgs. daily.		F	59	8  years	12/10/2008
3	Type II Diabetes	Avandia did help reduce water retention.  However, I experienced excessive weight gain, constant pain in the bottoms of both feet, and heaviness in both legs.  Once I stopped taking this med, these symptoms disappeared.		F	55	4  years	11/10/2008Email
1	Type II Diabetes	SWELLING EVERYWHERE	I was a human water balloon even on strong diuretics they kept playing with. My BP zoomed and they put me on meds for it.  Nothing stopped the swelling.  It hurt to walk on my tree stump ankles.  My doctor warned me about the swelling but nothing else on the market has worked for me.  I went back on glucophage and I live now with GI distress but at least I can wear strappy heels again and I can move without the pain of swelling.  Do Not Try This Medication.  It isn't worth it and nothing can be done to stop the intense swelling-not diet and not meds. luckily I quit before I had more health problems as a result.	F	45	90  days	9/12/2008

1	Diabetes type 2	edema (swelling of the arms and legs), hair thinning and loss, swelling of the eyeballs, rapid weight gain, high blood pressure, high cholesterol	After a spike in my A1c test, my doctor suggested Avandia and gave me some samples at first and eventually he wrote me a perscription. I had been working out and had lost 65 pounds (which could have accounted for the spike in my A1c level). After 1-1/2 years of taking Avandia, I had gained all of the weight back plus 10 pounds( I was still exercising 3x a week and eating the same). I had to get my glasses changed twice in a year because my vision had changed (due to the swelling of my eyes). My hair was thinning and falling out. My legs began swelling up. Was told at first that it was due to arthritis or overuse and then it was because of high blood pressure. They put me on a "water" pill to bring down the swelling. It didn't...in fact it made my blood pressure increase.  They then tried to put me on cholesterol medication. This is when I said enough. I started doing my own research and found this website.

1	Lower Blood Sugars	I didn't realize it at the time, but actually caused sever stomach pain which lead to an endoscopy. Couldn't eat spicy foods. Was told my stomach lining was severly inflammed.

1	diabetes 2	before taking avandia I was on a weightloss success, 3 weeks after I was put onto avandia(4mg 1xday)with my metformin(500mg? 3xday)-(1 yr) I gained 15 lbs, my legs felt like lead weights, with water retention in my ankles and feet, and have stayed that way since. 03/25/07 to 02/03/08. I wasn't able to dance at my cousin's wedding and my Mom just didn't understand, she was very upset with me. I really hate how my belly looks pregnant, pants don't fit right, weight loss is non-exsistant even with a strict diet.	with all the scares in the news media over the last year, I'm waiting for some tests at the end of february. I'll decide then to be my own Dr. and halve the 4 mg to 2mg avandia 1xday and then in time ween myself off.	F	46	10  months	2/3/2008Email
1	Type 2	swelling of feet and legs, weight gain, heart palpations,shortness of breath	I actually thought I was slowly dying!  We moved to a new area and new doctor took me off Avandia yesterday!

1	I am a Type II Diabetic	I suffered a heart attack, weight gain, which I have now lost, since being off of Avandia, and edema.

1	Type II Diabetes	accelerating weight gainheart palpitations	The more I restricted calories the more I seemed to gain.  My blood glucose was well-controlled but when I had gained 130 pounds I walked away from the doctor that was prescribing it. I've lost all that I gained (and more) by switching to insulin, diet, and exercise.	F	38	18  months	1/15/2008
1	Diabeties II	sore/swollen feet, calf muscles tight,short of breath, blurred vision. couldnt lose weight as i started working out in ladys gym 5 days a week and watched my diet.	only by chance i stopped taking avandia and within a day my feet no longer hurt me. my vision has improved. i am not taking this drug anymore and just increase my diaphormine to help keep sugars down. not worth taking this drug. side effects are worse then the actual help of keeping sugar levels down. i think more exercise and lower carb intake will help.

1	diabetes	Steady weight gain, water retention, bone density loss, heart palpitations, chest pain.	When I got off the drug, I lost 15 pounds in 4 weeks and the heart palpitations stopped. I found out Avandia makes cosmetic improvements to blood sugar readings by converting bone stem cells in to hungry new baby fat cells that love blood glucose -- but with bad long-term affects on blood lipids, obesity, bone density, heart health.  Not worth it.	F	56	2  years	10/7/2007
1	type2 diabetes	I started taking Actos, Had weigh gain and holding water. I asked to be taken off of it. My doctor switched me to Avandia.  SAME TYPE OF MEDICINE, DIFFERANT NAME. Same symptoms, legs and feet swelling, hard to walk, gained about 30 #s in one year. Doc said you are eating too much" I said "no, it's Avandia. I became weaker, irregular and fast heartbeats. In Dec.,05 went to emergency room with Heart Failure, Doc kept me on Avandia. On July 17,2007 Doc increased my Avandia to 8 milligrams and told me to take insulin with it. I decided, NO MORE, with hearing all the news about its safety.	In Sept,2007 I went to a diabetes specialist and he took me off Avandia immediately. A week later my blood sugar has not gone up without Avandia. I don't know how things will go from here but it is too late for me to repair my heart failure. The only thing that I would say is, Do a lot of research FOR SIDE EFFECTS, IF YOU DON'T FEEL WELL AFTER TAKING A MEDICINE, GET A SECOND OR THIRD OPINION , before it is too late.

1	type II Diabetes	Sporadic intense flushing and sweats, sometimes as many as 15 a day. Rapid weight gain, extreme tiredness, and swelling hands and feet	My doctor kept telling me there was nothing wrong with avandamet, and after exhaustive tests to determine the cause of my sensation of being on fire 15 times a day, after reading the forums here i told my doctor i refused to take it any more. i stopped avandamet 2 days ago and have been prescibed janumet, 1000 mg 2 times a day and the sweats stopped immediately. i've been on the new regimen for 3 days now with no side effects so far. I feel rejuvenated and much better. If I had listened to my doctor i would still be burning up while more tests are run. sweats started 6 mos. ago after being on the drug for 1-1/2 yrs. I also had a stent put in my left anterior descending artery last yr. i'm wondering now if avandamet might have helped that along since i'm only 51. I would urge anyone who has been having problems with this nasty drug to ask for another alternative.	M	51	2  years	8/12/2007Email
2	type II diabites	Swollen painful feet and legs, Shortness of breath.  Did not realize how short of breath I was until I came within inches of drowning.  I turned over in a canoe in very deep water.  When I came up the canoe was twenty feet away and floating upside down with one life preserver and 3 seat cushion preservers under it.  Foolishly I was not wearing one.  I swam towards the canoe.  I was immediately gasping for air. By the time I got within two feet of the canoe I was completely exhausted, out of breath and could no longer keep my face above water. I managed to reach out and grasp the rail of the canoe, barely having the strength to hang on, gasping for air. If the canoe had been two or three feet further away, I truly believe I would have drowned.  If I had went down one more time I would not have the strength to swim back to the surface. A very scary situation! I am asking my doctor to take me off Avandia.		M	70	3  months	8/11/2007Email

2	Type II diabetes	I was diagnosed with type II diabetes in January 2004 and started treatment with Avandamet in March 04.  I am an avid bicyclist and continued cycling as a routine form of exercise.  In November of 2006 I started running in hopes of building up to a marathon by the summer of 2007.  Between February 2007 and May 2007 I completed three half marathons.  In late June 2007 my ankles and lower legs started swelling. I tried to run and was only able to make it about 300 yards before running out of breath.  Additionally, my systolic pressure jumped approx 35 points.   A routine nuclear stress test demonstrated an  abnormal EKG and some artery blockage. My regulary doctor  took me off Avandament and prescribed Janumet.  Withing a week the swelling went away.  Due to the abnormal stress test, EKG and shortness of breath the cardiologist did a cardio cath.  The cardio cath verified the blockage 30% to 40% in the lower portion of the Anterior decending artery and no other blockage or prob	I believe the avandia did a good job keeping my glucose in check.  However, I believe the swelling was caused by the avandia.  I spoke to a doctor at the intake before the cardio cath and was advised a drug can be tollerated for years but, then cause an allergenic reaction. SIDE COMMENT:  Cardio caths are painful.

2	Type II diabetes	Shortage of breath and some water retention. HEART FAILURE?	My doctor prescribe the medicine to improve my HbA1c. I did notice some improvement but not until Januvia was added to the mix. I did not have any concern until I developed heart failure and my heart doctor can not determine the cause. I'm not sure if it is the medicine that cause it but I got off Avandia at my request because of all the bad publicity it receive recently. Believe it or not my doctor put me on Actos. He knew I had heart failure, so I'm even more confused of what he was thinking since this medicine warning states if you have heart failure you should not be taking it. I'm changing doctors. I was unaware of the issue of heart failure until I heard it on television last month. I recommend that anyone that is put on this medicine be closely monitor. If they notice any signs of water retention, shortage of breath or being extremly tired, I would talk to their doctor immdiately about changing to another medicine.	M	58	2  years	7/6/2007

1	diabetes	I acquired what looks like a "tumor" of fat.  My gut just kept growing after a total of 7 years--6 on avandia and one on avandaryl.It was the avandaryl that caused the huge weight gain.  I would say nearly 35 pounds in one year.  Unfortunately, this web site does not list Avandaryl as one of its drugs to rate.My mother finally said that I looked odd, that the fat didn't look like fat from overeating.  and I do NOT overeat!!I have this distended stomach and now my hips are widening!	It is ironic that if "one" is diabetic, weight loss is the most important thing one can do.Yet here we have a pill for disbetes that causes one to gain even more weight.One might think that the drug manufacturer wanted "cusotmers" to gain weight so they would need to keep taking the drug.But, surely, drug companies care about our best interests, right?  They would never hurt us so they could make a profit, would they??!!

1	diabetes 2	unsatiable hunger/always felt hungry; no energy; fatigued, sluggishness, always tired; absolutely exhausted for no reason at all; swelling; bloated feeling; breathing got much worse - was very very short of breath; even going up one set of stairs caused heavy shortness of breath; I went to a different doctor for breathing problems which weren't that bad before Avandia; very blurry eyes at times; tired eyes a lot of times - my eyes felt like I'd been up 24 hrs or so yet I was getting enough sleep; ongoing very blurry vision; legs were SO HEAVY and TIRED constantly - from nothing; felt insecure on my feet - like I might trip and fall and I didn't know why 'til I stopped taking Avandia. Depressed for no reason at all; this was ongoing; down in the dumps feeling a majority of the time.  Peripheral neuropathy seems to be worse - only had it slightly in one toe previously; some muscle pain for no reason;	I just went to my endochronologist.  I had stopped taking Avandia 1 wk before the warnings came out because of how bad I was feeling and the excessive weight gain. I had managed to lose some weight prior to Avandia. He still thinks Avandia is great since "it hasn't been proven yet".  I don't want to keep taking it 'til I have a heart attack or other health problems.  Avandia has too many side effects.  Who knows if they'll be the next victim of Avandia?  Why take the risk?  There has to be better medications!  Had a family friend who died from Vioxx caused heart attack.  She died shortly after Dr. gave her Vioxx.  I don't think Avandia should still be on the market.  How many more need to die to prove a point to the FDA and Drs who insist on continuing prescribing Avandia.	F	68	3  years	6/19/2007

2	Diabetes	Been taking Avandia for 6 mths now.  I have experienced a significant weight gain and I am already considered obese.  My feet are swollen and hurting even though I take Gabapentin (Nuronten).  I have decreased energy and feel too tired to even walk.  I have suffered migrane-type headaches in the morning. After taking this drug for two months, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure.  A month ago, I had a bad respiratory infection and when I went to the hospital, I had an irregular heartbeat.  This drug is very scary and I did not put two and two together until I read this website due to the increased media attention.  I am requesting a medication next week on my next doctor's appt.  By being overweight, I already have enough problems.		F	38	6  months	6/11/2007
3	Diabetes Type II	I felt Avandia helped overcome resistance to insulin allowing me to use less Humolog than would otherwise be the case. Recently however I've noticed that my use of Humolog is up, so apparently the drug is not working as well as it did for the first few years. For the first year and a half to two years I didn't notice any side affects, then, about a year and a half ago I started experiencing swelling in my feet that has gradually gotten worse and now my legs are also quite swollen. Over the past year I've put on almost 50 pounds and couldn't understand what had changed to make this happen. For the past six months I have also started experiencing upper respiratory problems. I was very very surprised when I found this web site and read the reports from all those people that have experienced the same side affects. My doctor just told me to stop taking the drug to see how I do without it.	I never suspected this drug was possibly a problem, I took it for almost two years with no noticeable problems - then all of a sudden my problems started and I had no clue why, now I think it was this drug. I look forward to seeing how I do off this drug, which I only stopped taking one day ago.	M	61	4  years	6/9/2007
1	to lower blood sugar	I have Irregularity of heart beat.  My blood sugar is very unstable.  Sometimes high, sometimes low. I have muscle pain.  I find it hard to walk.  Thinning of hair.		M		2  months	6/6/2007
3	Diabetes	None that I know of.	Added when the metformin I had previously taken wasn't enough.  Took a while but with a later addition of glyburide my glucose levels have come down significantly.  Not sure how much of that is the Avandia though.			 	6/5/2007
2	Type II Diabetes	First, almost an 80-pound weight gain.  That was followed by anemia, and then edema in lower legs.  I have no energy, am tired all the time and what used to be daily activities are now beyond my ability to do.  Just getting out of my chair seems to be a major job, and that was not my normal lifestyle 3 years ago when I started taking this medicine.	My doctor has not taken me off Avandia yet; as a matter of fact, he hasn't even mentioned the excessive weight gain, the tiredness or the edema.  So yes, I am looking for a new family doctor!  I don't believe that the advantages of taking Avandia even begin to outweigh the disadvantages.	M	61	 	6/2/2007
1	diabies	fluid around the wall of the heart, tired blocked in one artuy ,contuios fluid ,and then the fluid left after 6 weeks after taken off this medaction had no prombles.... has any one had any of these prombles		M	60	2  years	5/24/2007Email
3	type 2 diabetes	edema and weight gain	Taking avandia for 8 yrs,4mg.,2x a day... Last yr. had swelling in ankles and legs and gained 40 lbs. Dr. cut me back to 2mg., once a day and 5 mg. glipzide. Swelling gone, went on glycemic index diet and lost 20 lbs., and still losing.	M	75	8  years	5/23/2007Email
2	Type II Diabetes	Last year went for a physical and had to have a ekg  very erratic heartbeat.  Dr didn't remove me from avandia but I decided to cut the dosage in half.  Heart beat seemed to have improved. Recently started the Neil Bernard regimen of  reversing diabetes the natural way.. essentially this is a vegan diet with low fat -the real culprit. Dramatic lowering of blood sugar from AM high 200s and low 300s to middle 100s in am before meds and excercise--after meds and excercise (swimming) a mile) sugar goes down to below 100.  very pleased-- will now stop all avandia in light of the news today. !!!	I have had suspicions about avandia and its lack of safety since I started using the drug.  I'm convinced this is a dangerous drug, and that diet alone with glyberide will accomplish the same thing without side effects.  diet and excercise is all important for type II. Dr. knows only one  game and thats to give a pill.  Take care of yourself and be your own best Dr. The makers of this drug should be prosecuted and the feds repriAmanded. Obviously this is one more proof that the Food and Drug Adminsitration operates at the pleasure of the drug companies and not in the interest of protecting the public.  I hope there is a class action suit. I dont like my life being played with at all and this isn't going to go away.	M	66	5  years	5/22/2007

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!	M	37	21  days10 1X D	2/24/2011Email
5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.
