5		I took many birth controls before this that made me have serious mood swings, irregular periods, TERRIBLE swelling in the breasts, acne problems..basically all of the side effects from hormones that arne't balanced. I've been on Femcon FE since August of 2009 and love it. I have lighter periods that only last about 4-5 days, no irregular bleeding, no weight gain, and has helped with acne.

3	Bleeding on other pills	I was on other birth controls (5 different pills) and was constantly bleeding for weeks and weeks at a time to the point I was anemic. I also had horrible cramps and mood swings so my dr put me on femcon fe. It stopped the bleeding and helped a bit with the excruciatingly painful cramps BUT within 6 weeks I gained over 15 pounds and am still gaining weight!! I am so bloated I can't fit into anything! My thighs have gotten so thick I am miserable!! I've never been embarrassed to be naked in front of my boyfriend but now I want to cry everytime I look in the mirror and hate taking off my clothes in front of him :( which is definitely affecting our relationship in a bad way		F	26	2  months	12/16/2011
