3	blood pressure	dizziness after taking, very low BP readings in a.m.	Acting on instinct, I cut the 10MG pill in half and take just 5MG at night --- and even with reduced dosage, my BP in the morning is quite low (112/64 for example).  It does rise to normal levels later in the day, fortunately.  In the meantime I feel tired and a little disoriented.  But if it takes the BP down to normal levels I'll stay on it unless unacceptable side effects occur.  Amazed at how fast acting this stuff is; was initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide and it was awful, awful stuff.  So am hoping the Lisinopril actually works with minimal problems.

5	High Blood Pressure	NONE	I can't believe people are reporting all these bizarre side effects -- I've taken this drug for 20 years without a single side effect. It's a fabulous medication.	F	60	20  years20 mg 1X D	3/31/2013

5	High blood pressure and PKD	I have experienced dizziness, joint pain, depression, and so forth over the years and depending on my prescription.  Keeping myself hydrated lessens or eliminates the symptoms.	Am involved in a PKD kidney study which requires I keep my BP very low....hence the 30 mg instead of 10. Am also taking 80mg Telmisartan or placebo (do not know which). Have found that the side effects lessen (or disappear) if I keep myself hydrated.  I take the pills in the morning with a full glass of water and continue drinking water throughout the day (not too much water but just enough to keep the urine clear). At night I drink a full glass of water before bed, get up in the night, void, and drink another glass of water before going back to bed.  This has been recommended by my nephrologist.  It sounds like a pain but it is worth the effort.  I am a much happier and productive person if I follow the hydration schedule. Always tell your pharmacist if ALL of your medications before taking Lisinopril.  Also it is NOT recommended for women who are planning on becoming pregnant.  If you do become pregnant, stop the medication and contact your doctor immediately.	F	43	10  years30 MG 1X D	3/11/2013Email
1	for high blood pressure	I had asthma most of my life.  After starting lisinopril I started getting more frequent asthma attacks, I started throwing up huge amounts of thick mucus  and food.  I eventually had full blown anaphylatix shock.  I was in the hospital for one week.  They had to put me on a ventilator for three days.  My IgE levels were 1,795.  My mast cells 80.  I have not been able to go back to work.  My potassium  levels and calcium levels in my blood went through the roof.  I am now seeing several Dr.s to get my system back on track.... And of course I am not taking lisinopril	Linsinopril is a dangerous new drug designed to make the drug companies rich and people very sick.... I am waiting for more  blood work to come back before I take action.  I took ateninol for 20 years and never had a problem....My new doctor said " Why are you taking ateninol, that is an old fashion drug.  There is this great new high tech designer drug called lisinopril I would like you to take instead".  I said OK.  Little did I know that in less then 6 month I would literally be at death doors.  When the paramedics got to me I was told I had no blood pressure and was turning blue......	F	60	6  months5mg 1X D	2/20/2013Email
2	High BP	Depression, anxiety, loss of appetite, dry cough, tachycardia, felt itchy from the inside out, swimming head, poor digestion, thinning hair.	This is the cheapest first line defense BP med in America, and thus is most prescribed to the poor (uninsured or underinsured).  It is brazilian snake venom and if you are in tune with your body, you will FEEL snake bitten.  I was on very low dose but I only weigh 95 pounds.  This stuff hit me like a mack truck.  The worst was the depression, almost suicidal in nature, the anxiety: worry about EVERYTHING.  Not worth your peace of mind to have well controlled BP in my book.

3	High Blood Pressure	Night sweats, hair loss, anxiety, dry cough	I would like to add that I took this medication for 6 years with no noticeable side effects.  After my hysterectomy, maybe it was the change in hormones that caused the Lisinopril to turn on me, I developed what I had thought were menopausal symptoms.  Night sweats, hair loss and anxiety.  After 5 years of those symptoms along with extreme hot flashes, I developed the dry cough that can go with this medication.  After my doctor switched me to another High Blood Pressure medication, the above symptoms stopped.  I do occasionally have a hot flash but not like I did before.  If you are on this medication and are blaming your symptoms on menopause or getting older, check with your doctor.	F	55	11  years20 mg 1X D	12/17/2012Email
1	Hypertension	Progressive nausea. Muscle fatigue and general malaise. Felt extremely exhausted without doing anything. Mentally foggy all day, hard to maintain conversations. Severe dizziness that left me spending most of my time lying down so I didn't fall over, and this was not because of hypotension either.	Sadly I hadn't found this site before I started taking this medicine. It took me a few days to figure out what was wrong with me. I just started having all these symptoms and then they just kept getting worse. Thank goodness that I put it together after 5 days, that was long enough of this medicine.

1	Hypertension	Severe coughing to the point of my throat bleeding	I was prescribed this drug by my primary care physician.  I told her right away I was coughing, but she told me that (at the time) this medicine was only known to cause coughing in men.  What?!  I was young and not pushy enough, so I continued taking the drug.  It got so bad I would have to chug cough syrup at night to knock me out so I could get some sleep.  I was buying my cough syrup at Costco because I was buying so much of it.  Finally a little over a year later my doctor realized the Lisinopril was making me cough and she took me off the drug.  It took about six weeks for the drug to get out of my system, but the coughing stopped.  I started to sleep again and my throat stopped bleeding.	F	41	1  years 1X D	12/8/2012Email

1	High blood pressure	Cough like crazy that produces a thick metallic tasting mucus. Feel like I am choking. Cannot sleep at all.  Cough is horrendous!	I have asthma as well and this is really raising cane with my asthma.  Nothing helps the cough. I have tried virtually everything and nothing works. I can temper an asthma attack, but the severe coughing has such thick nasty phelgm I feel like I am choking and cannot breathe.  It is the worst medicine I have ever been on.  Thankfully, I have a dr. who took me off of it right away, but I am still suffering the effects of it! I feel like I am trapped until this goes away.	F	64	40  days10 MG 1X D	8/7/2012Email

2	High Blood Pressure due to Cymbalta	Dizziness. BP was high due to taking Cymbalta. Water pill was not enough, so Dr. scripted Lisinopril. First day I almost passed out after standing up. (Sudden drop in BP). Called pharmacist who suggested taking it at night. Did this for remaining 6 weeks and still felt dizzy often. BP was not lowered by much (Cymbalta, again, I think). Also felt really tired from Lisinopril for a few weeks, but that seemed to go away. Dry cough was bad for a while, but slacked off after a few weeks too. Cough never totally went away though.

1	High Blood Pressure	I didn't realize all the bad side effects this medicine had until a few weeks ago when I decided to read the side effects to see if this was what was causing my hands to be swollen & crippled for the last 8 months. Sure enough it was. Had a nurse one time tell me to never read the side effects, cause if you did you would never take any medicine. She is right about that, because after going to the hospital twice in 3 years & being plagued with fatigue, depression, anxiety, numbness on my entire left side of my body, not being able to use my hands for 8 months, swollen joints, inflammation, dehydration & many MANY other side effects, I will never EVER take any man made medicine for anything unless it is a life & death situation, because I am convinced that a couple more months on this medicine & I would be dead. If you read the side effects of this medicine, most of the side effects themselves would probably CAUSE High Blood pressure.	This drug is like most other man made drugs. It might help you a wee bit with one problem, but the side effects are much worse than the problem you had.  I guarantee ya someone at the FDA is getting a lot of money & kickbacks from these drug manufacturers that are selling this kind of poison to people & destroying their lives. Just like the rest of our government, they are corrupt beyond words. Cigarettes are also FDA approved if that tells you anything. If anyone knows of any Class Action Lawsuits or any other Lawsuits against the makers of Lisinopril, its generic, Lisinop, or its brother Benazepril, please contact me.   Exercise, Eat right, Change bad habits like tobacco etc, do what ever it takes, but believe me, you do NOT want to take this drug or any like it.

1	elevated blood pressure	It began with flu like symptons, chills, sore throat, body ache & fatique, it was flu season so I made no connection to the drug. Later, my left arm and shoulder began to hurt, then it was a severe aching, burning, stabbing pain. Dr said I must have pulled something. Iced shoulder, took pain meds some days better than others. Then in a few weeks my Rt arm developed same symptoms (left shoulder now frozen). Dr said that I was compensating by using that arm more and pulled something. Finally I could not raise either arm to even comb my hair and had trouble dressing! I started researching arm pain and it led me to Lisinopril side effects! I am angry to have been in so much pain and continued to take this poison (the majority of side effects listed do not include severe arm/shoulder pain). I have missed work, sleep, caring for my home and family, and suffered a daily torture of pain, chills and fatigue. I began to worry that I had a very serious muscle/joint disease, I am so lucky to f	Mine was a gradual onset, and just kept getting worse. The pain was unbearable when I quit taking them and I am sure it will be a few weeks before it is gone. I quit without my Dr.'s knowledge or permission, I do not want another med like this. I will go holistic from now on! The FDA is asleep in this matter, I agree there should be a black box warning! If it helps some people, I am happy for you and you should have access. For those of us who cannot take this drug - we needed to be warned of the seriousness of these side effects!	F	63	90  days10mg 1X D	4/26/2012Email

I let my doctor talk to into taking this medicine at I have had nothing but health problems for the last few months.

I sure don't want to have a stroke!  dr told me long-term rating for this is good vs. other BP meds. About all of my Boomer girlfriends are now on BP meds, quite shockng.

Metallic taste in mouth.	After only one day of taking lisinopril, anxiety was so extreme had to be prescribed ativan to control anxiety until the lisinopril was out of my system.  My doctor took me off immediately and switched BP meds.	F	35	3  days10 MH 1X D	11/24/2011
2	hypertension	After several months on this medication my right eye began to twitch.  This occurred mostly in the muscle below my eye. Symptoms came and went. Worsened when tired or under stress.  Reduced my lisinophil medication to every other day after reading it could be an underlying factor. Almost immediately I noticed an appreciable improvement. Improvement has lasted three months.	I took it for 2 years.	M	64	 10 1X D	10/24/2011
3	High Blood Pressure	Excess mucus (cough) at night, headaches, nasal congestion (I was taking afrin everynight just to breath), loss of sensation (I could feel the pressure of someone touching me but I didn't really "feel" it), sexual issues (like I said earlier, no sensation).	Some times it worked, other times it did nothing for my bp. The best thing I did was lose 150# and stopped taking all my pills ( Lisinopril, plavix and htz). The side effects went away and I started getting some feeling back in my skin. I realized this pill was my issue because I only restarted it because I was going back to the doctors and he didnt know I had stopped taking them. The issues came back. I probably wouldnt have connected the side effects with the pill if it wasnt for me noticing the loss of sensation.	F	33	10  years20 MG 1X D	10/9/2011
3		Very rapid heart rate and extreme fatigue with only moderate exertion in moderate sun.	I started Lisinopril at age 59. I was in very good shape and generally could outwork a lot of workers half my age. Over the next two years I started noticing that I became physically exhausted much sooner than before with moderate physical exertion. I wrote it off to getting old fast when only trying to work hard a couple of times a month. At age 59 I used to be able to work hard all day outside (like getting in firewood). Now at 61, I had pretty much decided I couldn't do that work anymore because about 3 months ago, I had to stop and let my heart rate slow down about every 10 minutes when cutting wood in about 80 degree heat. It took about 3 1/2 hours to do the work I normally would have easily done in an hour or so. After resting for the 1/2 hr drive home, eating something, taking a shower and laying in bed for 15 minutes, my heart rate was still 100 bpm. I then tried an experiment and tapered off the lisinopril over a two week period. It was amazing. This week I put up firewood two days in a row in high 80 degree heat and was able to work like I used to. Even though I would get winded from the exertion, at no time did my heart rate become a problem, and at no time did I get physically fatigued. All of that was clearly a lisinopril side effect.

1	High Blood Pressure	Mental fogginess, fatigue, dizziness, swelling of eyes, hands and feet.	Lisinopril seemed to be working very well in lowering my blood pressure, but I felt horrible from the first day I started it!  The dizziness, fatigue and fogginess were very troubling. The 2nd day I took it, my eyes felt like sand was in them to the point I could hardly open them...started using eyedrops and that helped but my eyes still felt odd.   The third day, within an hour after taking it, I experienced the swelling of my eyelids, hands and feet. I took a mega dose of Benedryl and contacted my Dr. the next morning.  She gave me a steroid shot to counteract the allergy and changed me to Norvasc.   So far only a little bit of dizziness with it, but its only been 1 day.	F	52	3  days5 MG 1X D	7/25/2011Email

It hurt to walk.  3 days after starting, toes separated from foot. 3 days later, wrist and elbow pulled apart carrying groceries.  3 days later hip joint dislocated walking in the garden, stepping on a stone.  Not a big enough stone to have been the real cause.  Spent an entire summer disabled.  When hip finally healed and I was mobile again, when going back to routine, shoulder pulled apart cleaning gutters.....no real reason.   Almost every 3 days I was straining a joint or getting injured......for  18 months.  Bones in hands separated doing housework and cutting vegetables.  I was crippled and in pain.  Didn't touch my blood pressure.	Since stopping Lisinopril, I have had no joint injuries while maintaining usual routine/active gardening, home maintenance, exercise.  It took about a week for my digestive system to get back to normal and it has remained normal since stopping.  I'm afraid to try anything else.  It seemed the medication relaxed my muscles and joints so much that they were giving out.  I could feel the weakness generally while on the medication.

After the doctor changed the dosage to 20 MG I developed a severe chronic cough, and it took several weeks of hunting down information before I figured out that this was the medication that was causing it.

Gradually my negative effects included watery eyes and worst of all my skin became very irritated, starting at my shoulders and after three months all my skin felt a irritation.

My allergies were so bad I spent $250 on a mold specialist to come to my house to search for mold, I spent another $250 for a room air purifier.  After feeling like crap for 4 months I decided to stop taking any pill I had started new in the last 4 months.  I stopped taking LIsinopril and within 3 days ALL MY SYMPTONS stopped!!!!!  Lisinopril should be taken off the market....it damn near killed me!!!!!	M	60	4  months30 mg 1X D	8/30/2010
5	HBP	none	Does a great job of lowering my bp without side effects.  It is wonderful for me.	M	51	18  months10 mg 1X D	8/18/2010
3	hypertension	Occasionally have a little cough.  The drug reduced bp from 140/90 to 128/85.  Because of the cough, the doctor decided to discontinue using it and is now trying hydrochlorothiazide.		M	67	5  months10 mg 1X D	8/15/2010
1	hypertension	muscle pain elbows and forearms and haven't been to gym. hurts to extend both arms.	switched from diovan due to calf muscle and lower back pain. immediate improvement from 1 mi to 4.4 miles of painless running daily...but began to develop arm pains in both arms. started on cozaar and developed abdominal cramps immediately. these high powered drugs should be removed from the market.	M	55	30  days20 1X D	7/25/2010
4	Hypertension	None	Drug did very little to lower my BP initially. It wasn't until it was used in conjunction with Aldactadize (25/25) that things worked out fabulously!	M	47	10  years30 1X D	5/21/2010
1	high blood pressure	Chronic SEVERE coughing resulting in gagging and vomiting. After stopping Lisinopril, vomiting stopped in 1 day, but cough continued for 8 weeks. Went through course of antibiotics, 3 bottles of cough syrup, a chest Xray, a diagnosis of allergies and of acid reflux (neither true)! Should have searched on line. I had no idea about side effects! Cough is quite common with Lisinopril.		M	54	45  days 1X D	5/7/2010
1	HBP	Severe throat and sinus infection resulting in laryngitis and deep, toe curling dry cough	This is the second time my doctor has changed my BP med from Avapro to an ace inhibitor.  Each time I experienced flu-like symptoms and would rather take my chances with nothing than to ever have this poison pass my lips again!!!!  The other toxic pill was called cozaar...I am now back on Avapro, but still fighting the throat and sinus infections.	F	60	60  days 1X D	5/2/2010

5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.	F	52	8  years20 MG 1X D	1/13/2012Email
2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email

Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify.

I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
