4	MS	Breathing problems (2 weeks)Weight gain (10 months)Receding MS related symptoms	Initial side effects were trouble breathing, similar to chest pains or a slight asthma attack for about 2 weeks.  This receded and hasn't come back.  I feel great overall, however; I can really tell a difference if I forget to take my pill til later in the day.  Also I gained 15 pounds the first month with no change to diet or exercise.  Two months later I lost almost 10 of it, again, no change in diet or exercise.  Since then I keep gaining.  I have gained a tolal of 20 pounds, mostly in my waist, butt, hip area.	F	28	10  months 1X D	1/18/2012Email

5	MS	headaches for first two days, since then nothing	waited 11 years for this pill..been on Avonex for 7 years, Rebif for 4... In past, I seemed to feel like crap for 5 of 7 days a week..never knew if it was the MS or the interferons...Now I Know ! Its only been three weeks but I dont feel like I am walking around with that lead jacket any longer...Still have my MS related spasms and "electrical shocks" but none of those "flu like" sysmptoms or red blotches any longer...Hopefully wont grow a third eye in a few years !! LOL   but seriously, I would recommend to anyone with MS	M	45	3  weeks 1X D	3/6/2011Email
4	RRMS	GOT FAT	It seems to be working.  Beforehand, I had experienced 3 exacerbations within 5 months while taking Copaxone.  I haven't had any attacks in the 5 months since starting Gilenya. No side effects at all. HOWEVER, alot of weight seemed to appear out of nowhere...and quickly attach to my hips :(  And when I say alot, I mean +/-30 pounds, which is significant. I can't say FOR SURE that it's from this medicine, but I can't find any other cause.  I suppose it's still better than the alternative--I choose fatness over numbness.  If you are considering this drug, take heart; I seem to be the exception rather than the rule.  Weight gain is not considered to be a side effect, so please don't let my experience stop you from trying Gilenya--it could change your life!	F	42	5  months12.5mg 1X D	2/28/2011Email
