1	Type 2 Diabetes	Lumps at injection sites (The size of a jellybean)	I've taken Byetta for some time, injecting it twice daily. I'd sometimes forget, or would be somewhere, without my pen, and would miss my injection. When my doctor told me that Bydureon was a weekly version of Byetta, and could be injected without regard to having eaten, I was all for it. One inject a week, instead of 14 injections? Yes! Then, I found hard lumps had formed at each injection site. I didn't notice them right away, but when I did, I was alarmed. I discontinued Bydureon and use Victoza now. Weeks have passed since I last used Bydureon, but the lumps are still there. I've read that they will dissolve over time, and I certainly hope that's the case. I wish I had done more research on this drug before using it.	M	40	4  weeks2 mg 1X W	2/21/2013
1	type 2 diabetes	Besides the fact the needle so big and painful to inject, I now have lumps where I injected the medicine. Did not see any changes in my blood sugars. This medication is extremely ridiculously high!		F	44	1  monthsnot sure	12/20/2012Email
