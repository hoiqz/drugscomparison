5	Fluid Retention	None	I have used the brand name only. Despite being told they are the same, after 2 weeks on a generic,I ended up in the ER with a question of congestive heart failure. Moduretic has saved me. Thank God for Moduretic 5/50.Sadly and scarily, I have a hard time finding pharmacies that carry it and have to drive at times 200 miles. But I cannot be without it.
