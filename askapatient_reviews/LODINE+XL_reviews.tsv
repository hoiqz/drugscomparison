3	arthritis, fibromyalgia, foot pain	Constipation. I went from Relafen which was giving me diarrhea and cramping to Lodine which is giving me constipation. As far as pain relief its about as good as over the counter NSAIDS.		F	55	2  months	6/16/2007

4	Osteoarthritis	None with Lodine XL.  The generic Etodolac caused intestinal distress - cramping and diarrhea.  Are there compounding differences?
