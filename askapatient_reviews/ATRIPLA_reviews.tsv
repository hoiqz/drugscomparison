5	hiv	I've always taken atripla then gone to bed. Tonight I took it then stayed up to finish watching a movie.... Now I know why they say take it at bedtime..... I feel sort of drunk or slight lsd-type feeling..... Not bad, but I wouldn't want to have to try and function at 100% at the moment  LOL		M	50	3  months300	7/14/2012
5	HIV	Dizziness, headache, nausea, depersonalization, short term rash.	All side effects tapered off after my body adjusted to the new medicine. Still feel woozy sometimes, but it's rare!	M	28	4  months 1X D	12/31/2011
4	HIV	severe hallucinations blur between conscious and non- consciousness. Sometimes nasuea.	Started 4 months ago with viral load of 500000. I wa so worried. Now I am undetectable. I feel so blessed to have atripla. However... The price is so high I have exhausted most optins to get it, even state funding has started to cut back. My work insurance is giving me fits...1950 a month and a 100 dollar copayment.	M	23	120  days 1X D	7/10/2011Email
4	HIV infection	Super-personal, bizarre, lucid and sometimes instructive deep subconscious 'core' nightmares; Brain zaps when sleeping face down or when generating negative thought patterns about harming oneself or others (i call it Atripla positivity training); feeling of Godlessness / a stark feeling of existential emptiness / meaninglessness leading almost to a sense of but not a full fruition of depersonalization; malaise; fuzziness/tinnitus associated with eating high fat meals; increased flatulence; decreased ability to maintain continuous thought or deep concentration; sometimes turns you into a catatonic / zombie for an hour, an hour after taking it (efavirenz/tenofovir) as it is hallucinogenic (alters your perception/expands space), increased sensitivity to light; the first week i was on it I thought i had superpowers because i had a 'different energy'...tried to lift my car (delusions)	Although these side effects are life changing and frustrating to adjust to, this drug is remarkably effective.  Undetectable within one month of taking it from high viral load and low t cell count, essentially i had aids and now i don't.  people think, you get aids, you die.  not the case.  modern drugs are amazing.  aids is not any one thing but an indicator of low t cell count coupled with high viral load and usually some kind of symptom like pneumonia or cancers or other complains.  I know folks who've had aids several times over 20 yrs and keep bouncing back.  Atripla also scores high because it's a one a day formula.  There is big benefit in this.  I just wish I didn't have to get high every night on a hallucinogen.	M	37	2  years1100mg 1X D	3/17/2011
4	HIV	Lucky I was a child of the sixties. The first week was rough vivid dreams, insomnia and just generally exhausted. Viral load went from 140000 to 63 in the first 3 months and CD4 from 230 to 385. Stick with it!!! Don't miss! Ambien helps with the sleep problems.		M	62	7  months600 1X D	10/4/2010Email
5	HIV	Dizziness, Vivid Dreams	I take Atripla right before bedtime so the dizziness sometimes aids in sleeping, but sometimes the dreams are really bizarre and vivid - not nightmares - just strange.	M		2  years	5/10/2009
5	HIV	dizziness, trouble concentrating, anxiousness, indigestion, vivid dreams	First week, I thought I would have to quit, but the effects are wearing off, and I can even make it through the day if I forget at night then take it in the morning, but it requires concentration. Viral load tanked to undetectable and CD4 over 700. Try to stick it out for a few months--it got better for me.	M	51	3  months	5/6/2009
5	Hiv	dizzy	I have only been taking atripla for 6 weeks. I just went into the doctor Nov. 19th to get bloodwork done. I started meds with a cd4 of 242 and viral load at 47000....We will see what happens after 6 weeks. I feel healthy and look good, so I am staying as positive as I can. I went to the doctor in the nick of time.	M	41	6  weeks	11/20/2008
5	HIV...What else?	Dizziness and fatigue. The first week was rough. You learn to adjust.	This combination is a lifesaver and convenient with one pill a day. The side effects have never really gone away, but like I said, you adapt to the new normal. I've done very well with this drug. Undetectable for 3 years and CD-4s in the 800's.
