5	acute dermatitis	slightly oilier skin	This shouldn't be used long term. I've been on it for about 6 years but I don't use it everyday. I get a rash of tiny bumps all over my face that makes it's way down my neck. It itches, is very uncomfortable and unsightly. Usually when it starts I use the cream. It relieves the itching immediately and the the rash is gone within 2-3 days. It IS a must have medication for me.	F	34	6  years	11/29/2006

4	Psoriasis	none	Is effective, I just hate taking steroid based meds  for temporary treatment, rather than curing the condition. Are there alternatives?	M	32	2  years	10/8/2006
