4	Low T	Hair on my chest. Occasional prostate pain (kinda like "blue balls") but prostate is normal.	Switched to T injections because I had to cover myself with 6 pumps of androgel to get T up to normal. Gross at first and difficult to do. (Check youtube for instructions.) but actually more convenient than the gel.The main effect is on mood and I'm satisfied with that.  T has eliminated depression. Hasn't turned me into a sex machine or gym rat. Maybe slight increase in libido but I still need an Ed drug. No dramatic change so rate it 4-Satsified. But you must have a responsible doctor who will check your PSA, do blood work etc. T helps my other vitals, but it can have serious adverse effects for some people.	M	60	2  monthsmg 2X M	4/9/2011
