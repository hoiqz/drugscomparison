1	rhinitis	Unexplained anger, irritability, anxiety, blisters in nose,	I am not usually the sort of person to fly into a rage but the slightest thing makes me angry, I am raging at my family and they are suffering due to my extreme mood swings. This site and patients comments have shown me that the medication is causing the problems as I have so many of the same symptoms as other people who have rated this drug on this site. I will no longer be using this nasal spray.	F	78	9  weeks50mg 2X D	12/20/2011
1	Allergic Rhinitis	Inability to deal with even low level stress. Panic attacks, general anxiety, insomnia, immune system down.	Was put on beconase aged 11 as the then latest "miracle cure' for allergies. 2 doses a day and told to take it for life. No-one monitered my condition. Developed above symptoms after aproximately one years use. No-one really took much notice as it was put down to "teenage neurosis" (even though it got worse with time, not better) and just a poorly functioning immune system in teenage and adult years. Not long ago, a doctor friend of mine found out about this and was horrified - result gradually reduced dosage and stopped using it. Apparently adrenal gland damage is possible and also irreversable. Would recommend the monitering of anyone on this, as people react differently to medication. It did help the allergy, but given the choice, I would rather have stayed on antihistamines.

3	Nasal Polyps	excessive weight gain, cant lose weight anymore just keep on piling on the pounds around 4 LB per week	doesnt appear to be shrinking my nasal polyps	M	62	120  days200MCG 2X D	3/19/2011
4	Hayfever	My tendons all over my body are getting inflamed at the slightest work/lifting.	I am getting weak tendons all over my body - legs, arms, hands, feet. Had cortizone steroid injections in my thumbs for 'Trigger Thumb' (damaged tendons) but the consultant said next time it would be an operation as too much steroid weakens tendons. That made me wonder because I've taken Beconase for at least 15 years (only spring and summer) and it did cure my severe hayfever, but at what cost if it's messed up my tendons and I can no longer work? Has anyone else had similar experience or is there no connection?	M	41	15  years	9/16/2009
5	Hayfever	None	I was a sneezy, itchy, runny mess for years, relying on the old-fashioned antihistamines for relief nearly every day, until I found Beconase.  I pump once in each nostril each morning - voila!  That's it.  No more allergies.  Very safe, very effective.  I have been using Beconase for about 18 years.	F	52	18  years	6/25/2009
1	asthma	insomnia	I went on and off this drug several times over about a 1 1/2 year period. It has a 100% correlation with insomnia. My doctor claimed it could not possibly cause insomnia and that it is safe enough to give to children. Based upon my experience, I consider giving it to children as child abuse.

1	hayfever	angry stressed confused can't solve simple problems extreme temper panic attacks throwing things across rooms not exactly a saint mormally but never this bad don't take this crap again.		M	27	1  months	6/26/2006
4	Hayfever	Headaches, extreme anxiety, agitation, indecision, confusionand unable to focus on things. Also a 'hyper' feeling.	beconase did help my hayfever, but I went through a very bad spell recently with the above symptoms. I reasoned Beconase was to blame, and stopped using it. I already feel less anxious. I have spoken to my doctor who says he has not heard of this phenomenon. I then discovered this site when looking for more information. This confirms my thought that Beconase is capable of causing *serious* problems.	M	35	 	6/2/2006
4	Allergy	I do not feel it has any of the effects mentioned by the other people talking about the drug here. It makes me breath and it's price is right compared to similar drugs. I try to stop taking it and then find my self unable to breath or sneezing my head off		M	46	4  years	12/11/2005
3	Rhinitis	I found myself getting agitated, angry for no reason.  Then I remembered that Beconase has steroids in it so I went on web to check side effects which match my symptoms.  i am normally on non reactive, calm, easy going person and i am behaving like a stressed person.  Stopping Beconas immediately.	They should make people aware of these symptoms.	F	41	7  days	4/11/2005
1	rhinitis	anxiety,agitation, restlessness, panic		F	37	3  days	1/15/2005
1	Hayfever	Stress, anger for no reason. Normally nothing bothers me at all, but I've been having trouble getting small work problems out of my mind when I get home.	I was glad to find someone has put similar feedback on this site, so I'm not alone	F	34	7  days	11/30/2004
1	allergies	Insomnia, agitation, anxiety.  I felt angry and hostile for no reason.  Did not realize it was the medication until it happened on several occasions.  Several doctors have assured me it is "not systemically absorbed, there is no way it would do this with such a small amount of steroid", etc. etc.	The toxicologists I have consulted have explained to me that there is no more efficient method of getting a substance into one's system, and that is in fact quite possible.  This type reaction to steroids is considered quite common, but the drug literature for these nasal sprays does not acknowledge it.	F	42	3  days	4/19/2002
