3	Breast Cancer Stage1,Her2+,PR+,ER+	Joint pain, trouble sleeping, bone pain, foggy brain, slight nausea, weakness and blurred vision.	considering how bad chemo and radiation was, I am pretty sure I can deal with this for 5 years if it will in fact keep the cancer from coming back. Not a great feeling but there is light at the end of the tunnel. At 45 years old I have a lot of living to do and am not going to let the SE of this drug stop me!!

1	post breast cancer	jaw pain became so severe I couldn't chew.  then it hit my right leg, couldn't put any weight on it and limped for about 3 months.  Oncologist recommended an mri and that said I had bursitis which never happened before.  Liver functions became elevated and oncologist took me off it.  Then tried another aromatose inhibitor with same effects.  Then tried Tamoxifen and took myself off that.	Quality of life counts!  I read that only about 20% experience side effects and apparently I'm in that group.  I eat real food, go to a personal trainer to keep my muscles and bones in shape, and smile and laugh with my wonderful husband as much as we can.	F	67	15  months1 mg 1X D	3/3/2013
2	Breast cancer	painful, ankles, painful hands, itchy scalp and hair loss, leg cramps, lichen sclerosus, general stiffness	I am 72 years old but have always been active.  I enjoy walking and gardening, or did until recently.  I was dignosed with breast cancer in August 1999. Grade 3 Invasive Ductal cancer.  I had a mastectomy and was prescribed Tamoxifen.  This caused problems with my uterus and I had a hysteroscopy and biopsy in January 2003.  I was taken off tamoxifen and put on arimidex until September 2004.  Some time after I experienced painful ankles but did not associate it with my treatment.  Then I experienced pain and stiffness in my hands.  Every morning I had to spend a log time stretching my fingers before they worked properly.  My doctor suggested that when I was gardening I was using my trowel incorrectly.  I started using Glucosamine and Devils Claw. After several months the stiffness passed. I have been off Arimidex for 8 years and would not have associated taking it with the problems I am having but on reading other ratings on this website I am now convinced that Arimidex has caused them.  I had terrible itching and was treated for Lichen Sclerosus in June 2010.  I have to wash with a special lotion in sensitive areas.  More recently I have had pains in my left upper arm, right side of my neck and right hip. These problems are very similar to the lady's who rated the drug on 24 May 2012. I feel like a very old woman and I have difficulty getting in and out of cars.  I have discussed this with my Doctor but she does not think my problems are due to taking Arimidex.  .  I have tri	F	72	2  years 1X D	2/20/2013Email
1	Breast Cancer Stage 2	joint & muscle pain. Vaginal pain.  the feeling that I had a UTI although I didn't. Severe back pain. Always feeling lousy.	Totally stopped Iscador and every other pharmaceutical suggested by oncologist. I completed treatment (chemo, radiation, surgery)for stage 2 breast cancer 5 years ago.I've been  taking  supplements prescribed by my Functional Medicine Dr(such as Broccoli seed extract)  and  I also have been injecting Iscador for the past 5 years and continue to do so but at a decrease frequencyIscador was prescribed by my homeopathic/anthroposophical dr.  Iscador has been used in Europe for more than 80 years as a cancer treatment.. no side effects from anything I've been taking.  You can find info at Weleda.com   Iscador is a mistletoe derivative. I heard it mentioned on the radio 5 years ago butnever again. I believe it was squashed by the oharmaceutical companies.I am not alone in my belief that a cure for cancer  will not be found in this country because the business of cancer treatment is too profitable.  You have to be your own advocateCheck out what Dr. Christiane Northrup has to say about mammogramsFor the most part Arimidex can destroy your quality of life.There are other alternatives. Check them outGood luck!	M	70	2  months 1X D	2/20/2013Email
5	Grade 1, stage IIa,ER+PR+HER2-,4cm	night sweats and hot flashes not as bad or frequent as menopause. headaches, no bone pain yet, they keep asking me if I have any. slight weight gain, totally no libido.	I have totally changed the way I eat. Only whole foods, no processed foods, only whole grains, fruits veggies nuts and seeds. switched to e-cigs(weight gain attributed to this) Had a second MRI in Jan. my tumor has shrunk to 2cm. I have refused chemo because of my results from the Oncotype DX Assay tests. My number came in at 12 which means chemo would be unlikely to help shrink my tumor. I will keep taking this pill until my tumor is gone, and I will not have surgery. My surgeon says that new studies have found that it will be more effective to take this med for 10 yrs intstead of 5. I will continue taking it.	F	54	6  months1mg 1X D	2/19/2013Email
3	B/C Stage 2  ER positive	At the beginning, some joint pain, mainly knee and hip. Little brain fogginess, but not too bad. After a few months, most of the pain subsided and energy and stamina thru the roof.  :-)	I attribute my health and wellness, and high energy levels to my nutrition program. Almost all of my pain have subsided.  I have a lot more mental clarity, energy and focus now.  If anyone here is interested in overcoming and combating much of what you are going thru both mentally and physically, please send me an email. I would love to share some information on what has been an absolute blessing and miracle for me going thru this !  Hugs and blessings to all	F	52	4  months 1X D	2/18/2013Email
4	Grade 3, Stage 1a,ER+,PR-,Her2-	I had arthritis prior to L mastectomy, but knees, wrists, ankles and sometimes hips ache.  Knees are the worst.   Hair a little thinner but not breaking or coming out.  Some depression; very emotional, cry easily.	I elected not to have chemo based on my pathological results and other tests.   Research indicated that for my particular case, chemo + arimidex was no more effective than just arimidex alone for 5 years.   Three lymph nodes were removed and were negative at mastectomy and no signs of cancer spread since L breast removed in 8/11.   Really can't say if my arthritis is just worse or if arimidex is contributing a little.   Hope I am cancer-free at 5 years.	F	67	15  months1 mg 1X D	2/5/2013Email
5	Stage 3C Her2+ Breast Cancer	Dec. 2012 I started with pain in my feet and then in my hands.	I feel very strongly that arimidex has helped to keep me in remission. I had mild side effects in the beginning, but nothing I couldn't handle.I have been on arimidex for 6 years 7 months. I am going for acupuncture and it's helping. Thankful for this drug and blessed I am still here!!! My oncologist would take me off in a heartbeat if it was necessary.	F	61	6  years1 mg 1X D	1/31/2013Email
1	Stage 3C Breast Cancer	I took Arimidex for 5 years (there was no 5 under length of time, so I selected 6).  I stopped in July of 2012.  I have suffered from joint pain the entire time.  My oncologist assured me the pain would go away when I stopped the medication.  It has not.  I feel like I'm 80!		F	56	6  years	1/24/2013

1	breast cancer	Hair texture change finer softer but thinner looking. 10 days ago started having numbness and pins and needles in left hand, seems this is a side effect...though Cancer Care says both symptons are unusual and not seen often. Strange as my friend also has breast cancer has same symptoms and also body aching., and reading other peoples comments it is not so uncommon.	I have written here before I have had breast cancer twice same breast., now a few months ago have found out I have Bladder Cancer seems early stage, Firstly they thought Kidney stone no pain just lots of blood in urine. clears up then comes again. Ugh!! ..Will know more after operation this Thursday. Makes you think what am I taking these pills for. I feel we all have these cancer cells wandering around in our body...but no one seems to know what triggers them to start activating inside us. I was persuaded to go back on Arimidex by my friend who's attitude is I hate taking them but what alse have we. Well now with this new lot of cancer I really wonder if it's worth while. Somewhere there is an answer , but I really think something better and probably quite simple could stop these cancer cells activating and attacking our body.			 1mg 1X D	1/12/2013Email
2	Stage 1 BC	I had 3 years on Tamoxifen and was changed to Arimidex in May 2012. Fine for a month or two, then lots of joint pain. Severe carpel tunnel, painful finger joints, hip ankles and sometimes knees. I am very down-  and sleep poorly.I am struggling to keep up with life- have had my children home for the holiday season and I'm just not the same Mum anymore. I stopped taking the drug on Nov 8th 2012 and went back on Tamoxifen. Joint pains and general misery not much better- although I have had some relief from carpal tunnel with wrist braces. I am keen to find out if this will go away, how long it takes and natural supplements which may help bone pain.		F	54	6  months	1/10/2013Email
1	Stage 1 Breast Cancer	I have pain under my feet, it feels like its on fire,  My legs hurt so badly,  that I am unable to stand.  I ache in my neck and shoulders.  My vision is so blurry and sometimes my eyes hurt.  I have gone thru swelling in my face and tongue and horrible acne since I have been taking this pill.  I have gained 30lbs after loosing 80lbs months prior to my surgery.  My breast still hurt where the incision was made, even through its been over a year, not sure if this pill has anything to with it.  I must say that I am no longer taking this pill anymore.  My doctor told me to stop taking this pill, just like the first cancer pill tamoxifen.  I hate that I can not eat and I am limited to what I can eat.  The joint pain and sleepless nights are the worst.  Oh, and my mind has changed, I forget what I wanted to say.  Its horrible to be in this position.	My children hate the person that I have become because, I am unable to be attentive to them.  My thoughts regarding this drug are1.  Stop taking it.2.  Check with your doctor to see if its worth taking the pill vs taking the pill.  3.  If your life has changed, well BC is not fun, but enjoy your life and what is left of it.  I will be seeing my doctor soon and will discuss if there are other drugs (which I am not willing to take) but will listen and update you to any information I might received.  This pill changed my life for the worst, and all I am hoping for, that the cancer will not return.  I am prayerful, that everyone of you who have suffered from taking this drug, remember you made it through the BC and your life is not over.  Enjoy	F	54	5  months1 1X D	1/10/2013Email
1	breast cancer stage IV	headaches, aches and pains, insomnia, night sweats, hot flashes, cognitive deficits	cannabutter at night helps with sleep and means I have some quality of life - without it, I would not have any quality of life and would no doubt be in a psychiatric facility or worse	F	54	2  years 1X D	1/4/2013Email

Poor memory, insomnia, sexual desire (next to none) and blurry vision	I am taking an Omega3 trial as recommended by my oncologist. I must be taking the placebo because the symptoms seem to be getting worse by the week. My oncologist says he can change it to another medication if I want, Aromasin.	F	52	6  months1 1X D	1/1/2013
1	BCstage1	At first emotional roller coaster, then agitation..Now I hurt all over, my shoulders, my hands go numb, they burn until they get over the numbness. weight gain after losing 150 lbs which is bad , I have 40 more to go. My mind is the worse, I can't remember from one minute to the next, then I get so panicky over just trying to find keys to car. I'm 56 I never experienced anything like this drug. I've took myself off for awhile and felt like myself...It's so hard to decide to take or not to. My hair has thinned. It's like the side effects get worse as the days go by. Now I know why my oncologist kept asking if I was still working. All she'd say was these drugs are bad!!!!!  She was very truthful held nothing back. Although she believes it works..	Cancer changes your life so much, unless you've experienced it you have no idea. I didn't. The feeling that no one understands the side effects how bad they are. I understand now , Wondering how much to tell your employer when you can't move or remember like you use to . I'm on new job and not able to keep things in my head because of the fog, what to do?  that's all I keep asking .... Good luck to all on this drug I pray you have no side effects..

I am willing to put up with these awful side effects if it means no more BC but it is very rough. I have 3 years to go and that sounds like an eternity. Not many men would put up with this. Cannot believe there are no better options for us. My brother is an oncologist and says this is the best there is for now. Blessings to everyone out there.

1	stage 2 breast cancer	greatly diminished quality of life.bone and muscle pain. always felt like I had UTI. Weakness. big problems that lasted months after I stopped taking it	Taking Arimidex for 2 months, my quality of life took a nose dive. It will be 5 years in january since I started treatment for stage 2 breast cancer.  Finished treatments the following August. After surgery chemo and radiation, I went to a doctor of Functional Medicine who had first been recommended by an oncology nurse.The doctor is a biochemist,   internist and then an oncologist for 13 years. She is now a doctor of Functional Medicine. Which uses scientific methods to determine root causes and treat with natural supplements and vitamins. Stopped taking arimidex prescribed by oncologist Functional Doctor prescribed broccoli seed extract and other supplements to prevent recurrence without the debilitating side effects of pharmeceuticals.. Thoroughly researched, She gets the highest quality for her patients at cost.Also been using Iscador that I get through Weleda.(Prescribed by homeopathic doctor ). you can check it out online. Its an injection that  used in Europe the past 80 years to prevent cancer. I also used aromatherapy for the problems caused by chemo and radiation. eat mostly organic foods, yoga etc. My philosophy has been, It is what it is. Do the best I can and NOT TO WORRY. For me the term "cancer survivor" puts too much attention on a negative experience.Having had cancer is just another one of my life's experiences. I do not let it define me. .

I just stopped taking it.	This drug is vile.   From what I can see it does not substantially improve upon the survival rate when compared to tamoxifen.  I think it needs to be reevaluated by the FDA	F	71	10  months1 mg 1X D	12/1/2012Email

2	Stage 2 lumpectomy nodes clear	Hot flashes worse than with menopause, foggy thinking, trouble getting thoughts out, extreme weakness in legs at times, energy level gone. Started riding recumbent bike 10 miles a day within a week of my surgery. Now all I seem to be able to do is stare at it. I don't want to be miserable for something that "MIGHT" prevent cancer from coming back. If the side effects are already this bad after only a month I can't imagine what it would be like in a year. After reading all of these comments from others I think I'll be saying NO to Arimidex.		F	57	1  months1MG	9/29/2012
1	BC Stage 1 Lumpectomy, Radiation	Started with hot flashes (never had them during menopause) so severe they caused painful boils to occur in armpits first, then groin/crotch area, under breasts which was controlled by treating topically.  Eventually got painful boils inside nose, ears etc, which couldn't be treated.  Started getting weak in joints, especially pain in knees, thighs, and general fatigue, didn't realize this was connected to Anastozle/Arimidex until I read other comments on this site and cried for myself and others who felt like a 90+ woman.  Always active before, doing Zumba 2-3 x a week to walking with a cane in 1 year. Did research online and found out drug was not a cure, it was just a drug that MIGHT keep breast cancer away, but meanwhile not having estrogen could be and was worse for quality of life.  Mother and grandmother had b/c so I thought I had to keep taking it so I could live longer, but this wasn't living. Stopped taking it 7 months ago and most symptoms have stopped.  Can think better--not	Stopping Anastozle/Arimidex was VERY difficult.  Suffered with pain and symptoms longer than I should have--at least a year and a half, didn't believe there was an alternative, oncologist told me it was my decision. Decided to take chance, wanted my life back. I try to eat healthy (always did, but more plant based diet/organic as possible now--less chemicals--minimize processed food--try to eat more raw food.)  Everyone should watch documentary "Forks over Knives" to learn how bad meat and diary products are for us.  Haven't decided yet if I will get annual mammograms, not sure if more radiation is good.  Mother died of heart problems at 89 after having a mastectomy at 55 and kidney removed for kidney cancer at 75.  I hope to live to dance, do Zumba and watch my grandson (he's 5 mo. old) get married.  Drugs can do a lot, but I don't think they are always the best for us.  Nature has the best pharmacy, and positive actions will hopefully produce positive results.  Love to all who are suffering.  Hopefully you can make the right decision for you.  THANK YOU FOR THIS WEBSITE!  It really helped to hear what others were experiencing and that I wasn't crazy or just getting old.

1	Stage 1 Ductal Cell Carcinoma, DCIS	Joint and muscle pain and stiffness.  Weight gain - not always hungry, but never felt full.  Trouble sleeping.	I was on Tamoxifen for almost 2 years with no side effects.  Had a total hysterectomy in Nov. 2011, and started Arimidex in Jan. 2012.  I was on it until June when my Onc took me off to see if side effects stopped.I was off almost 4 weeks and felt a little better, so he put me on Aromasin.  Joint/muscle pain and stiffness immediately got worse. Stopped that after a week and went back on Tamoxifen.  It's been 3.5 weeks, and I am a little better, but far from where I was when I started Arimidex.  It seems odd to me that I'm not feeling better since I wasn't on Arimidex for very long.  I am interested in hearing how long it took others to feel normal again.	F	54	4  months 1X D	8/10/2012

1	Breast Cancer	tiredness and hair coming out when combing or shampooing	Had breast cancer 23 years ago. Due to a mix up in lab they couldn't tell which sort of cancer I had, so other than radiation I took no pills for over 20 years...then my oncologist put me on Arimidex I took it for a few months then my hair started to come out, also felt tired so told oncologist and was taken off itThree years ago years Breast cancer came again in same breast...and I had another lumpectomy, not much of a breast left. Cannot have radiation as it is in same breast. ( no zapping of same breast allowed). Anyhow have been fine and not taking any medication....but the last time I saw my Oncologist she suggested I try Arimidex again......well having read all the side effects and your comments have decided not to take it.. I will just eat healthy and look up what herbs etc will control producing female hormones. Also if I get rid of the roll of fat around my stomach which I am sure is making my extra female hormones. ....I would be a happy woman... just thought I'd throw that in. ....age 75 but really new 55. I really think there will be a completely different kind of treatment for breast cancer  eventually.....who wants broken bones...etc..and all the other possible side effects with this and similar medication.

1		Palpitations, plantar faciitis, carpal tunnel, excruciating joint pain in hands and hips, interrupted sleep patterns, debilitating hot flushes	All of these side effects disappeared within months of ceasing Arimidex.(taken for two and a half years).  Tamoxifin (two years and 9 months) caused trochanteric hip bursitis and painful arthritis in hands and feet.  All of these side effects have gone over a period of three months.  Hopefully the medication has done some worthwhile good but the last (nearly five years) have been a nightmare of pain and discomfort.	F	68	2  years 1X D	7/15/2012

1	Breast Cancer	I was bed ridden for three years my oncologist did not want me to stop taking the drug.  I was in severe pain.  What happen that I hada an ulcer in the right groin.  And the Arimidex, was not allowing the sore to heal.   I was bleeding from the skin and the tissue.  I could feela wetness between the tissue and the skin.  I went to the Oncoligist he again denied me the right to get off the Arimides.  During the time I was taking the drug I, was getting off the car and my foot broke.  I, developed two herinas from the fall.   As a result of the herinas I got a pinched nerve talking about pain.  I was inso much paid no pain pill would help.  This drug is not fit for humans.  I went off of the drug on my own.  I don't if I have cancer.  It has now been almost five years.  I am in limbow I don't if I have cancer or notI would rather be dead then to take that awful medication again.  I could write a book on the side effects.  	I do believe arimadex definitely need more research.  If would have kept taking the pill one more month I certain would have d0ed.  I could not eat I could not drink water very bad taste in mymouth.  I did not have pain  in breasts but I had pain all over mybody.  I had a horrible oder.	M	71	3  years1mg 1X D	6/29/2012Email

Took nearly a year after stopping Arimidex to feel normal- but hey, I'm still here enjoying life.Take heart, I was sure my life was over when they told me, now I realise it had just started. cancer (always with a small 'c') taught me what matters in life, it was a tough journey, but not one I regret. Good luck to those of you just starting your journey, be strong, it is not the length or your life, but how much you get out of it. Live, love and laugh.	F	68	5  years30 1X D	6/23/2012Email
2	Stage IV breast cancer	Pain in shoulders, hands, arms; legs feet are numb; difficulty sleeping; always eating even when not at all hungry; flu-like symptoms (nasal drip, throat feels raw).	After chemo./radiation, declined Tomoxifen back in '99; then in December 2010, Stage IV diagnosed when I began what I thought to be low back pain and arthritis; then began Anastrazole in 2011 for 3 mos. and was in remission but I thought pain side effects excessive and I asked to go on Tomoxifen; after 3 mos. Petscan showed cancer active again; so went back on Anastrazole (4/2011 to present); Since I am in my late 70's, thought ALL pain a combo of age, arthritis, Anastrazole, but my body hurts so much I'm convinced the MAJORITY of my discomfort is Anastrazole!!  Do not have a high opinion of Oncologists - feel they are useless [the Radiologists do ALL the reporting from the scans), they just READ them and then just barely do a one-word report (i.e., "progressed", "I don't see anything" = meaning "you are in remission").  I'm thinking of stopping the medication to see if I can feel 'NORMAL' again!	F	78	14  months1 mg 1X D	6/21/2012Email
5	Breast Cancer Stage 2, Double	I had very mild side effects, very blessed for great onc's Dr. Some joint pain, Ulastis used during Chemo was much worse bone pain then Aremidex. Chemo saturation after 5 months caused numbness is both feet so bad I was falling almost constantly for months. Then numbness in both feet subsided except my toes 8 years later still get numbness if my feet when cold only(wear socks). I have been off Aremidex for over three years and Thank God Cancer FREE. So please be careful with just dropping medication it could be your life.	Every person is diifferent and my prayers and heart goes out to you patients may God Be With You.

2	er+, st2(3cm), 0/n	severe joint pain last 2 weeks. couldn't standfrom sitting. poor QOL. mild before that; mental fog, memory problem, etc.	Decided to stop arimidex 1st sign serious SE's. A dr.-johns hopkins site says- it's unknown how arimidex causes joint pain. Another dr on web states: 'I have fear about someone not having estrogen in the brain for 5 years'. Up to everyone to decide what the risk/benefit ratio is and make informed decisions based on all available data. Statistics do not necessarily indicate your individual situation regarding risk of recurrence.  I choose to put my faith in God or however you choose to define that. There are amazing natural remedies that Nature provides to help us survive; substances which people have claimed-and been proven- as potent for destroying cancer cells and conducive to healing and recovery. More than 2 years of toxic treatments I feel is enough(tc x4, rad, ai). Goal: aid my immune system in what it does well-defense against toxins,support for life. Check out important supplements. Lose weight, if necessary. Plants, herbs like green tea and essiac. Do not be sedentary (cancer hates oxygen)- get adequate exercise, manage stress and anger, enough sleep, and importantly- focus on food; becoming more conscious of i.e.- raw garlic and jalapeno peppers. Buy organic as much as possible. Let's work to change this toxic environment (pesticides,etc) which contributes to our misery. And medical/pharma system. More work needs to be done.

2	stage 2 breast cancer	All of them except weight loss. (ironic)	After reading some of these comments I am once again rethinking about how much time this drug "buys" us and if it is worth it given the quality of life, if you can call it that, that it leaves you with. I want to be one of you who just says no but I am scared, just as the entire cancer 'business" is counting on. One big money maker isn't it?..I think I was almost getting used to the joint pain and the soaking sweats but recently my hair has started falling out AGAIN and I cry way too much.  I hate to admit it but sometimes I just think this isn't worth it, at all. Very depressed. Not a shred of dignity left.  I am a bloated balding fat cow with a botched implant job...and a very very bad attitude!  My heart goes out to all of you and hope you all beat this crap called cancer.

2	stage 1 bc	Dried out like a raisin.  Joint pain, especially hips and feet.  Hair thinning and hair loss.  Some sleep interference but not as bad as I feared it might be.  Although now I think that symptom may be increasing.	This website is awesome, as the kids say.  I read it last fall when I couldn't decide what to do about the side effects.  Dry skin everywhere.  My scalp itched and I thought I had lice.  I thought I had yeast infection.  And I had to change to softer toilet tissue.  I mean everywhere!  Hair thinning and falling out.  joint pain.  Increasing foot pain to the point of almost falling when I got out of bed.  Yes, I felt 80+.  So talked to onc. No sympathy.  But willing to switch to Femara.  Off of everything for a couple of weeks and others commented that I "seemed myself again." On Femara one month.  HORRIBLE!  The pain was better and the dryness.  But total brain fog.  I made a hotel reservation that I still can't remember.  Interfering with work and home life.  That's when I found this site.  Read someone's comment about going on 1/2 dose.  I liked that idea.  Didn't want to risk going off altogether.  Doc arranged estrogen level test off of all meds and then back on 1/2 Arimidex.  Off of all meds, level higher than expected for postmenopause.  On 1/2 pill the estrogen level was "negligible", in other words, they couldn't measure it because it was so low.  Have been on 1/2 pill for several months.  Hair grew back.  Still some hip/joint pain but none in feet.  Minimal dryness.  But brain fog from Femara never oompletely lifted.  Am deciding about trying Aromasin.  Am going off for a couple of weeks again and will try to figure it out.  The postings on Aromos	F	59	30  months 1X D	5/24/2012

1	Yes	Were on arimidex for 2 yrs, then femara, then tamoxifen.  My side effects were substancial,  got to a stage of not walking etc. So made the hard decision........	Arimidex, gave me no brain, (were in corp world)  stopped me from walking. I liked gym...  I made my own choice albeit to me. Hmm lets give to the cause, in time will get better and better with funding...Do not like to put down, the levels, we are lucky things have come along way. Living is great......... OK, I had really bad body responses to arimidex. If a family member asked should they take it, I would advise NO.  And risk the aftermath, as I am... Yet after, everything, then recently carpal tunel etc cannot pick up or use my hand, 4 yrs later  and everything this drug has done to my body.  Just think there needs to be more research...... FOR the next generation. 	F	51	2  years30 1X D	4/13/2012Email
2	Breast Cancer, Stage 2,estrogen pos	Joint pain, numbness, extreme fatique, insomnia, spacey brain, poor memory, difficulty breathing, unable to walk or bicycle - leg muscle weakness, thinning of hair, weight gain	My first cancer was Stage 1 BC. Had a lateral mastectomy followed by chem, no radiation, followed by Tamoxifen.  After 3 1/2 yars, I had a TIA, and asked the ono. to take me off of it, and refused to go on anything else.  In 2008, I got BC again in remaining breast - stage 2, lymph node involvement, estrogen positive.  Went thru 6 months of chemo, 6 weeks of daily radiation, put on Arimidex.  After a few months, I noticed extreme joint pain in hands and feet, insomnia, weight gain, thinning of hair.  Talk to Dr., and he said he was sorry, but I needed the med., so I had to suck it up. Almost two years of taking it, I  found myself losing energy - like when I was in chemo.  After Christmas 2011, I was in a chair unable to get up to do anything like walk or daily household tasks.  I was so tired.  I just couldn't imagine staying liked that, so I got out, joined the gym, tried to walk, bicycle, anything.  I couldn't do it, couldn't breathe, heart pounded.  I ended up in the hospital thinking I was having a heart attack - but no, heart is fine.  Thought maybe the cancer was back.  Dr. thought it might be Arimidex.  Have an appt. coming up - he suggested a drug holiday- I feel uncertain about it, but I can't live like this.  I am 70, I don't want to spend my remaining years unable to enjoy children and grandkids.	F	70	2  years1 mg 1X D	4/11/2012Email

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span.

We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .

This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me.

Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.

I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed.

3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight.

3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011

I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010

1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated. Who knows if it "helped my depression" because it made me an absolute basket case!	F	21	14  days2.5 mg 1X D	9/27/2010
2	GAD	RAVENOUS, INSATIABLE HUNGER!!!!	When I see my Doc I have to tell him I MUST come off this med or I will be the size of a house in a month!	M	33	2  weeks 1X D	9/25/2010
2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).	F	42	16  months30 mg 1X D	9/7/2010
3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010

3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped. Abilify worked immediately and I haven't been depressed since.	F	24	3  weeks5mg 1X D	5/9/2010Email

Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal.

1	Bipolar spectrum disorder	Restlessness, anxiety, drowsiness, face rash	I went on Abilify at the start of an up period, so I don't know how effective it would have been in treating depressive spells. However, it did counteract some of the effectiveness of my lithium, and I was falling asleep during the day more frequently than usual. Had to go off it because of a rash on my chin/cheeks/ears.

I got depressed due to weight gain, but after several months I feel medication ceased to be effective. This time  was very reluctant (2 yrs later & different Dr. & different anti-depressant medication-Prozack-2 yrs ago) but I am trying it w/ a different antidepressant than previously-Taking now w/ Wellbutrin.

4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue. Negative - I find myself much more emotional - memories, key phrases, smells, songs, pictures, etc.can bring me to tears.	M	50	9  months50 MG 1X D	4/11/2010
2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now.

2	depression	Nausea the first few days, some constipation, cloudy thinking, increased appetite	Combined with Wellbutrin XL which suddenly stopped working for me after 3 years. After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

5	Major Depression, Anxiety	Have had some problems concentrating.  Although I love to read, it has been a struggle to focus for a sustained amount of time.  Mild weight gain.  Insomnia (but the Seroquel has completely cured that.)	Abilify has helped me like no other drug.  I am on it along with cymbalta, deplin, seroquel and ativan.  Within just a few days I was feeling better and am now able to exercise, clean my house and just moved across the country-something I could never have done during my depression.

Then still have little to no energy for the rest of the day.  I was previously, taking 60 mg. of Cymbalta for almost 2 years, but my dr. switched me to this when I started to feel like dying again.

3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!

2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010

Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.

I am taking cymalta but after about a year, it didn't work. My MD RX'd 5mg of abilify along with my cymbalta every day. In my opinion, it saved my life.

That night she experienced indigestion/heartburn. She vomited. Sleepy but couldn't sleep. Feeling scared for no reason. Next day she passed out after being awake for 15 min. I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug. I got home and looked up the side effects and all of these were listed.  I can only say that we are glad we found out so quickly about this drug.	F	12	2  days	12/19/2009

3	bipolar	stopped after 14 months due to heart pulpitations, memory loss, trouble sleeping, slur speach due to excess syliva, after 12 months these things started. At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying. I am very uncomfortable giving a child this age any drug that is diagnosised by trial and error.	M	8	14  months	12/17/2009

I am taking 50 mg of lamictal concurrently with 7.5 mg abilify.  Affect is flatter, less mood swings, but more non-reactive than anything.  I'm not sure this is where I want to be. I have been able to get projects done that I had difficulty starting.  Some days I have energy, some days I don't.  I a fasting blood draw yesterday and haven't heard the results yet.  Continuing to take abilify is a quandary -- do I feel worse or better if I factor in all the weird side effects?

4	autism spectrum disorder/ bipolar	Weight gain - up to 30lb	My daughter has had tremendous improvement in energy, concentration, and mood. Before taking Abilify she was on Geodon and had terrible akathisia. It also interfered with her ability to learn, and she had to withdraw from college courses to avoid failing. (She wound up finishing college with a B average, so you can see she's normally able to learn. ) Once she got off the Geodon, the irritability and stupidness went away but she became suicidal and self-injured. Since starting the Abilify she hasn't tried suicide even once. (Before that it was 14 times in six years.) I am grateful to the Abilify, but I wish she wasn't so hungry all the time.

I take Cymbalta 60.mg and now 2 mg  abilify.I would stick with it since it works within 2 weeks.I sleep better, and  am more focused.

4	major depression and anxiety	the first night i felt like i was coming down from meth. i adjusted the times i took my meds, because i take asprin, reglan, nexium, and effexor 75's.  i took the asprin, nexium, and reglan with dinner, and the effexor and abilify, plus a half of a klonopin at bedtime, and i sleep through the stomach upset.	the second day i felt much better.  i was able to clean a room, take care of bills, and just never thought of negative things more than twice.  this is my third day, and i was able to joke around with my husband at the store, and though i still haven't showered, i may do that tonight, after i clean the bathroom.  i have great hopes for this med, and hopefully, i won't have to take it very long.	F	47	3  days	11/8/2009Email
5	Bipolar depression	Some weight gain and insomnia.	This drug saved me from the darkest, deepest depression I have ever had to endure.  For over two years, I lost my will to see people, clean house, get dressed, etc.  After just three days on Abilify, I was able to get up, shower, go visit friends in New England (I live in South Florida), clean up my messy house and talk on the phone again.  I have gained a great deal of weight over the years from all different types of medication.  I accept the fact that medication makes me heavy and I am grateful to be heavier and sane than thin and crazy.	F	54	30  days	11/2/2009
5	Depression/Anxiety	Occasional headache.  Woke up in the middle of the night a few times but that got better.  Still sleeping well.	Doctor added 2 mg Abilify to my 10 mg Lexapro because I was still having suicidal thoughts despite the Lexapro.  Its worked great so far and has been a real boost in energy and mood.	M	17	5  weeks	11/2/2009
4	anxiety, paranoia and major depress	restlessness at 20 mg, eye tic at l5 mg, now down to 2 mg daily.  No weight gain at all on any of the doses.	Because of side effects including diabetes risk tried to go cold turkey at l0 mg.  Okay for about 2 weeks then experienced major nervousness, disorientation, jaw clenching, etc.  Now taking 2 mg. daily and feeling much better.  Still worried about side effects.  Not taking any other drug along with it.  Still experiencing anxiety but it is manageable.  You must wean yourself off this drug and not try to quit at once.	F	62	3  months	11/2/2009
3	ADHD	uncontrollable muscle movements, especially when in the car.	My son has been on Abilify (1 mg) for over a year.  We started on .5 mg because of his weight.  I did not want to medicate my child but I had no choice.  He was diagnosed at 2 with ADHD, but I didn't believe the psychologists because it's hard to diagnose something like that at age 2.  He is also ODD.  Last summer he was almost kicked out of daycare because of impulsivity, aggression, and inablility to sit still.  The Abilify worked for him then and continues to work.  I would love, however, if he didn't need it but now he's in kindergarten and has to take it to get through the day.  I was also able to get him a 504 plan with the school since I got another diagnosis at age 4 which was ADHD.	M	5	1.5  years	11/2/2009Email
2	add on for depression	none except rapid and major weight gain	I was very hopeful at first. I felt improvement after the 3rd day when this was added to my Wellbutrin. But in 5 months time, I gained 40 lbs on a petite, 100 lb frame!! I'm really struggling to lose it, and am currently discontinuing because of it. People that I bump into at stores and such ask when I'm due!!Really too bad, I had no other side effects. but now I'm left with this big mess with my weight to clean up.	F	34	5  months	10/29/2009
1	GAD/Depression	weight gain, extreme fatigue, depression worse	I was taking 2 mg of Abilify last Spring after Paxil didn't seem to be working as much any more. I felt ok then I felt bad again. Dr put me on 5 mg of Abilify. I feel terrible!  Extremely tired- so much so that I can barely move. I am going to ween my self off immediately.	F	47	6  months	10/28/2009
3	Mood stabilizer along with Zoloft	I took 1 mg daily and it helped but caused too many side effects. I'm very med-sensitive. I've stopped Zoloft at this point.	I was on Zoloft and Abilify but stopped both due to weight gain. After a lot of research I'm adding Abilify back at 1 mg every three days. I'm very med-sensitive and tend to respond at lower doses than other people do. Will be back to post how this goes. Something has to help. I'm a wack-job right now. Can't control my thoughts and I dwell on bad stuff too much. Can't get sad events out of my mind etc. I have to give Abilify another chance at a reduced dose.	F	62	 	10/27/2009
4	Oneiric states	jittery at low doses, sleepy at high	It has helped me stop feeling like I'm in a dream all the time                                   but my mood is only a little better so far	F	59	3  weeks	10/25/2009
2	Depression	Insomnia, chest pain, blurry vision	Only on 0.5 mg. for three days.  Horrible insomnia no matter what time of day I take med.  Makes me drowsy during the day, hard to tell if my mood is improving due to the side effects.	F	35	3  days	10/24/2009
5	major depressive episode	Energy and hope restored.  Insomnia, head ache, speedy, shaky,visual disturbance,constipation.	Hopefully the side effects subside as my body gets used to the med.  I'm not willing to stop taking the med as I feel so much better with just 2mg of Abilify as an adjunct to Lexapro.  I have hope again.  I got my butt out of bed by day 3 (went shopping) then cleaned the house on day 5.  What a change from the depths of deep epression to my old self in less than a week...WOW!	F	46	10  days	10/23/2009
3	bipolar II	agitation, shakiness, acne, loss of libido, weight gain, inability to urinate	This med helped stabilize my mood a bit, but I could not get the full benefit because I could not increase the dose.  Every time I would go up on the dose, I would be hit by an avalanche of side-effects.  Had to get off eventually.	F	26	5  months	10/23/2009
3	To help my mood	Strange itching in my nose. I made myself bleed by trying to scratch it but couldn't help myself. It tasted good so I'm okay with it.	I've had depression of one kind or another most of my life.  I wanted to feel normal.  But, I ran out of samples after a week.  It wasn't long enough to find out if it would help.	M	56	7  days	10/22/2009
3	Mood Disorder	My son is 9 years old. He started in June on a mood stabilizer.  Abilify 5 mg, worked on mood, however he has gained 25 pounds. He can not stop eating.  He even sneaks food!! I don't know what the doctor is thinking.  We are taking him off.		M	9	4  months	10/19/2009
5	Bipolar Disorder	Very hungry, but able to manage it. Some difficulty sleeping, usually for an hour in the middle of the night. Spending money a little more than usual. Initially had a few days of headaches, not major.	This drug immediately snapped me out of low-grade depression that was steadily worsening. I started taking 2 mg of Abilify each morning and all of my depression symptoms lifted. I only realized how bad my concentration had been because it was so improved on this drug. Like others have said, I lost my hyper-sensitivity to people and situations and replaced that with a high tolerance for life's challenges -- big & small. The side-effects are very minimal at this point, but I'll be paying attention to see if this continues. Lastly, the fact that it works so quickly is a powerful asset if it works for you.	F	39	2  weeks	10/17/2009
1	depression/schizoaffective	can't stop pacing, feel like someone is inside me trying to get out of my skin, insomniac, no sex drive, having to put car into park at stoplights to keep from ramming into someone in front of me; insane.	i stopped taking this today and hope to G-d it doesn't last long in my bloodstream.	F	29	2  weeks	10/16/2009
2	possible bipolar	feel like a crack addict, hard to even sit here and type, hitting wrong keys, clenching jaw, restless beyond belief	on 10 mg...gained about 5-7 pounds, doc swears I need it, am bipolar but w out mania, just very low lows.......need to get off this but afraid of geodon...feel like a speed freak.  sleep is my only relief.............	F	38	6  weeks	10/7/2009
1	Mood stabalizer	makes me gain weight, tired, not sure if it is what causes memory loss, fatigue, moodiness, irratability.		F	35	2  years	10/7/2009
5	Anxiety, depression, mild mania.	Jitters, sleepiness, stomach distress.	This drug is very strong and very good.  I am taking 2 mg in conjunction with 7.5 mg of Lexapro.  It has reduced my severe PMS and helped me with my previous need to sleep 11 hours a day.  Note that I am on one tenth of the recomended starting dosage for someone who is bi-polar; I can only imagine the side effects, however for my purpose it has been a god send.	F	29	1  months	10/3/2009
1	Bi-polar	pacing, high blood sugar, foamy urine, severe thirst, fatigue, pancreatitis, kidney damage	Please stop taking the Abilify immediately.  My husband was prescribed Abilify and it almost killed him. He was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis for 10 days and then on home care hooked up to ivs for another 2 weeks. He is now diabetic and needs to take insulin shots 4 times a day. He is on a very strict low-fat no-sugar diet and may never have even a sip of alcohol ever again. His pancreas is permanently damaged. We are very lucky he is alive. Abilify is evil. Please do not take it. It will kill you.	M	30	 	9/30/2009Email
5	depression, OCD	more alert, motivated, racing thoughts greatly diminished, some nausea, no weight gain!	I was leery about taking this, others make it sound like a nightmare drug. I have no doubt that it affects some people badly, but for me, it made a huge difference. I do wonder if this will wear off after a few months, but so far 5 mg have allowed me to think clearly, get off the couch and accomplish things. No weight gain but dr has me on Metformin to regulate blood sugar and cravings, so that might be the trick there. Important for everyone to monitor their own reactions carefully, or ask family members to help, because every drug works differently for every person. YOU know best what helps YOU.	F	45	2  months	9/19/2009
3	depression/ bipolar	flattening/apathy, word-finding problems, short-term memory loss, trouble concentrating, not able to articulate thoughts and feelings, muscle weakness. To be fair, it made me manic for the first month I took it, which was wonderful, and I say I'm not depressed now, but is apathy really that different from depression?	When trying to stop taking 5mg, severe akathasia that literally kept me from sleeping at all. I'm tapering, now on 2.5mg, but still fearful that I will have the same symptoms when I discontinue again. Feeling a little trapped.	M	35	7  months	9/17/2009
3	Childhood Bipolar, ODD	WEIGHT GAIN, MUSCLE PAIN/STIFFNESS	My son has shown improvement in mood, decreased mood swings, more even temperament, however, he constantly complains about pain in his feet and legs. He describes as burning, stinging pain, mostly in his feet. We have observed more nasal stuffiness. He appears short of breath, at times, however, we are linking this to his weight gain (approx 12 lbs) and history of asthma. We are still observing and waiting to gauge any affect in cognitive abilities (school grades). Time will tell if the side effects are actually worth taking the medication.	M	11	3  months	9/16/2009
1	Bipolar 2-PTSD	Eating abnormal amounts - lethargy - no libido - no personality - sweating	This shit, and yes I say this profanely because that's what it is. It made me more depressed than ever. Yes the headaches and voices went away. But it made me socially anxious , paranoid , ripped me of my self esteem and made me gain weight because all I did and wanted to do was eat. I am an athlete, model, and full time mom. I kissed my life goodbye when taking this shit. Desparate, I stopped taking it. Which made life even more worse. I wanted to kill myself so badly because I wanted the pain to go away. It's all in my head. Mind over matter. I'll be the moodswingin crazy gal I am than risk my life. Also causes muscle weakness. Lucky to be able to carry anything up a damn flight of stairs. All in all, just stay away!!! Spent the whole summer in bed sleeeeping getting fat and suicidal. Whack!!!	F	25	2  months	9/14/2009
1	GAD/BPII/PTSD/OCD	Severe depression/out of touch	I was on Abilify for three weeks.  I started with the 10 mg for two weeks and up to 25 the third week.  On the 10 mg I started feeling "funny" and experiencing some side effects.  By the third week I was self mutlilating (something I have not done in 15 yrs.  I was so depressed I could not function at any level, very irritable and people just were too much to deal with.  All I wanted to do was sleep and just disappear.  My Therapist said it was like I did a 180 in two weeks and was so concerned she called my Psych.  After seeing my Psych, she immediately took me off it and put me on Geodon...not sure if that is a possitive change or not.	F	37	3  weeks	9/14/2009
3	Bi Polar 2	Akathesia, insomnia, anxiety, weight gain, head aches	The Akathesia was awful.  I would lie in bed thinking I was weak or flu-ish, but once in bed I could not get comfortable.  My workouts decreased as I felt weak, dizzy, short of breath, lost balance while stretching. My face would sweat way more than normal.  I could tell I was starting to gain weight and would pack on the pounds rapidly if I did not stop taking this. Since exercise is therpeutic for me, the abilify took that away from me.  BUT it did help control my mood swings (by making me feel like an emotionless zombie) and the need to act out my irritability. However, inside I felt increasing anxiety and irritability.  The side effects just aren't worth it.	F	30	2  months	9/8/2009
3	Depression/Anxiety	I have gained 20 pounds and am not eating any more than normal.  The medicine definitely lifted my depression, but the weight gain now has me looking like a pig.  And, it seemed to increase my libido.	Started off with 5 mg; now am down to 2.5... but, because of the weight gain, I am asking to get off of this medication.	F	40	4  months	9/5/2009
1	anxiety	Akithesia	Do not take this med. I had severe akithesia whereby I had a constant feeling of having to 'move' It was exhausting and I thought it would never leave which made me feel even more panicked. It was the most scared I'd ever felt on a medicine. Before this I truly never paid attention to side effects on labels, now I do.	F	38	 	8/29/2009
4	Bi-Polar	Akathisia, increased libido, insomnia	Loved it the first week until the Akathisia kicked in.  Then I wanted to jump out the car while it was moving... Halfed my dosage, no help.  Halfed the dosage again, no help.  Now I am on 1/8 of the pill.  Akathisia is gone, but increased libido went away.  Still have insomnia taken care of by Ambien.	F	46	1  years	8/28/2009Email
5	for incentive, to mk decisions	none except lots of hope, energy, lack of fear,loss of procrastination, able to make decisions, ability to focus just an all around zest for life with unlimited happiness	If your anti depressant or anti anxiety meds work but you still have no energy, ask your Dr to add Abilify. I had never heard of it but now instead of thinking of everything I need and want to do I am optimistic and bubbling with enthusiasm and energy. Now instead of reading all day long I am cleaning and doing hobbies, kyaking, running, dancing and marching with my grandchildren Whats next a sea plane ride and travel. Was just weeks ago I was close to Agoraphobia. If your meds only get you to the bottom of the mountain looking up and wishing you would, try Abilify, you will climb that mountain, maybe even run up it and then dance on the top!!!	F	62	3  weeks	8/23/2009
2	bi polar 2	weight gain, sugar cravings, excessive sleepiness, inability to exercise (no stamina, gasping for breath)	It helped with irritability (because nothing seemed to matter) but left me unable to live normally and my friends all asked if something was wrong because I was so quiet and getting more quiet with each passing day.  Because the side effects were so crippling, I have stopped taking Abilify and switched to Geodon.	F	60	4  months	8/18/2009
1	Bipolar I	Akathisia, loss of interest in life, Always sleepy, high anxiety, catatonia	Got really bad Akathisia after only 3 days on 10mg. Was taken during a bad manic/pschotic state so was forced to stay on it. Initially was bumped to 20mg which made me catatonic. Back to 10mg kept hallucinating. Added Cogentin, made Akathisia go away but severe anxiety came in it's palce along with lack of motivation and no interest in anything. Severe confusion followed. This sucked my will to live. The Akathisia was so severe I was suicidal.	M	32	7  months	8/17/2009
3	depression; withdrawal aid	VERY rapid weight gain (10 lbs in a month!), constipation, swollen legs and feet, back pain	GOOD NEWS: This drug helped me in the horrible phase of discontinuing Cymbalta.  I was no longer moody and nasty-tempered.  BAD NEWS: the fact that my face is so puffy I now look like a fatter, older version of myself and I now have GOBS of fat in places I never gained weight before (back of arms, waist) proves this stuff is POISON.  It may inhibit thyroid function, because I am not eating more than I usually do (in fact my appetite is less than normal--wierd!) yet I am piling on weight. The constipation, nausea and fatigue aren't fun either.  And I look like CRAP: bloated, haggard, pale, and unhealthy. Phasing off this med asap!	F	31	2  months	8/14/2009Email
5	depression	I have experience swelling of the calves. This may not be related to the Abilify, as I have had a kidney transplant.	My family has a history of serious depression to the point of being institutionalize. For many years now my brother and I have tried one drug after another. Nothing helped us 'open the curtains'. Two mg of Abilify each morning, after just a couple of days, has given us our lives back. This is a miracle drug for both my brother and my self. I must include, we have only been on this medicine for two or three weeks.	M	60	18  days	8/8/2009Email
5	wellbutrin	somewhat more tired, some difficulty urinating..	A Great help.. relieved pain in my shoulders and elbows.. and has rid me of most of my suicidal or weird thoughts and voices.	M	57	25  days	8/5/2009
4	bi-polar 1 disorder	nausea, vomiting, insomnia	I am 5mg, for just about a week, first 2 days I was very hostile, last 4 days restless with insomnia and cant eat much.However I have energy, I get things done, I am back to being social which I was not for over a year and half. No fears of public and can focus to read, play games etc.  My patience level is much better.  Just would like to know when the insomnia and nausea will pass.	M	41	1  weeks	8/5/2009Email
2	Possbile Bipolar 2	Extreme sweating, extreme nausea, weird chest movement, insomnia	Been on Celexa for 10 years now, up and down in dose as lifes stresses went up and down... 40mg now for past 2 years. Doctor added abilify for possible Bipolar 2. I took at 7pm and within 2 hours I was sweating profusely and kept doing so for the next 24 hours, then it started to go away. I wasn't hot, I even cranked up the air conditioner, didn't help at all. I soaked my clothes and sheets. This caused some dehydration which didn't help the nausea. That was also extreme. I never actually vomited but still laid on the bathroom floor just in case. The first few bouts of it I could barely move. I was flushed and weak and trembling it was so bad.I also couldn't sleep, which I'd already been fighting insomnia the past few months. But this made it worse as I couldn't sleep more then 10-30 mins at a time. The constant sweating didn't help when trying to sleep.I'm not saying don't take this med. I dealt with bad nausea for weeks when I first started it, and also when I went without for over a week. Just wanted to share what happened to me	F	32	1  days	8/2/2009
5	major depression/Bipolar	None really..Some initial insomnia but got better with time. Sexual sides are minimal and never a problem	A great medicine.It worked the 1st day I took it (5 mg)..I felt so much better..NOTHING has worked for me except Abilify and Parnate. People love to rant and rave when something is not working for them. Fine. But please don't tell other people to stay away from the drug because it doesn't work for you. If your having a hard time finding something that works, try this med. It works quickly so you'll know if it's for you without having to wait 2-4 weeks.	M	49	60  days	7/31/2009
1	Bipolar Disorder	Weight Gain	I was taking this medicine for about half a year and was recommended to not go off of it. In this six month period I gained 67 pounds. It also made it very hard to lose the weight afterward. Here I am almost two years later, and I am five pounds away from getting rid of the 67 I initially gained. Although the weight is gone, the stretch marks remain and still will. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE.	F	22	6  months	7/27/2009
5	schizo personality disorder	I LOVE ABILIFY!!  It is my favorite antipsychotic.  Side effects range from mild tiredness and hunger spells to insomnia at bed time.  But that helps with Ambien CR which my doc loves to prescribe like candy to me!  Abilify helps tremendously with voices and does not give me the akathisia movement disorder like the "dones" risperidone and ziprasidone antipsychotic do 100% of the time.	This medicine is a mild antipsychotic when it comes to side effects when compared to other antipsychotics.  I would recommend ABILIFY (aripiprazole) over the other atypical antipsychotics any day.	M	29	6  years	7/23/2009
1	Schizophrenia	Couldn't stop moving, couldn't sleep.  Paranoid, anxious.	This is hell.	M	18	4  weeks	7/22/2009
1	major life long depression	I had a STROKE after 9 days on this awful medicine. I've been on wellbutrin for years and started to feel a deeper depression than normal. My psychiatrist put me on Abilify as a boost. Within 3 days I became very confused and very tired. It was the weekend, on Monday I called the doctor. He said it was the side effects and would clear up, that I had only been on it 6 days. On Thursday, I called and told him that I was stopping it. In addition to the confusion, I was having a hard time talking. He said the side effects would probably be gone by my appointment. They got worse! I couldn't remember how to use my utensils, my toothbrush etc. I couldn't spell or write, was mixing up the phone number even if I was looking at it. Monday, he still felt that it was side effects but at my insistence he sent me right to a neurologist, who ran me through a number of tests. He agreed that it was side effects. If I wasn't better in 3 weeks, he'd do a CAT scan. After 1 week insisted on the scan and lo	I was 62 years old and do not have dementia. My doctor did not consider me elderly. At what age does the drug company consider elderly? My doctor said that this shouldn't have happened. I am better but not back to the way I was before Abilify and the stroke. After 13 months I don't feel that I am getting any better and I honestly feel the problems I am still having are permanent. But it could have been worse, I wasn't paralyzed! Even with the computer, this write up has taken me 2 1/2 hours to compose.	F	63	9  days	7/15/2009Email
2	Some psychotic disorder	Akathisia. Insomnia.	Tried Abilify for a while and was hoping the initial akathisia and insomnia would go away, but after a month there was no change, so I gave it up.	M	34	1  months	7/14/2009
1	depression	I had bad nausea and vomiting. Very bad acne. Super drowsy.	It didn't even help with my condition. I have been trying it out for about 4-5 weeks and the side effects are horrible. I was still the same person I was before takin Abilify if not worse.	F	21	5  weeks	7/10/2009
2	Depression	Nausea, vomiting, anxiety, restlessness	Only took 2.5mg and had horrible first day so I decided not to continue taking it.	F	33	1  days	7/9/2009
1	Bipolar	Explosive headaches, sexual dysfunction, blurry vision, muscle stiffness, indigestion, nausea, loss of concentration and memory impairment	I am a heart patient and have also experienced sky high BP. I have no idea why this drug would even have been prescribed to me. I agree it is a poison.	M	51	1  months	7/5/2009
4	Pediatric BP rapid cycling	tired, sleepy,	9 yr old boy, started on 10 mg then increased to 15 mg. Takes 900mg lithium and 15 mg Abilify. Takes all at night due to sleepiness. Is a bit far away during the day on the 15 mg. Hardly any mania or outbursts. No complaints of inner restlessness. No weight gain. Appetite is normal.	M	9	1  months	7/3/2009Email
1	Bipolar	Miserable, horrible drug: extreme fatigue, bloated face, mental sluggishness and confusion.	NO theraputic effects whatsoever for me. Useless. I took it for about 6 months in 2003 and was taken off it by my psych. at my sister's urging. She came to see me at Christmas and was shocked at what she found. I was not even aware of how bad it was until I was taken off it.	F	41	6  months	7/3/2009
1	BiPolar II	Severe headache, tooth pain, muscle aches, depression, lethargy, trouble sleeping, jaw pain.	Called doctor and she said I had an allergic reaction to Abilify and to discontinue use immediately.  If you have any of the symptoms listed above, contact your doctor ASAP.	F	35	1  days	7/1/2009
5	Schizoaffective Disorder	I initially experienced Akathesia, Nystagmus and sleepiness. Then my dosage was recently upped from 20 mgs to 25 mgs due to break through depression, after that I did feel some nausea. Other than those few side effects I've felt fine on Abilify. I would recommend Abilify to others who are being carefully monitored by their Psychiatrist. I just happen to have an excellent Dr., which does make a difference.	I take Abilify along with Divalproex Sodium ER 1250 mgs for migraines, Clonazepam, Cogentin 1 mg for Akathesia, 2 grs of Armour Thyroid for Hypothyroidism.	F	47	5  years	6/28/2009
1	deppresion and anxiaty	facial tics, my daughter eyes are moving without control. Her tongue is heavy like if she is drunk, she gained 30 pounds. This medication is a poison I will not give it to my daughter anymore.		F	16	2  years	6/23/2009Email
3	anxiety/pmdd/depression	I have tried all the SSRI's and am currently taking Cymbalta 60 mg daily.  I was told that abilify helps so many people in my situation but so far the side effects have been miserable.  Yes, I am more mellow and not as irritable, but I have a constant headache/eye pain (like a migraine), I cannot sleep and I'm nauseous.  I'm reading all these other comments and I'm terrified of gaining weight, so I think I'm going to stop.		F	39	3  days	6/21/2009
1	misdiagnosed	SEVERE AKETHISIA- I had to walk out of the class room daily and skip class because I COULD NOT SIT STILL TO SAVE MY LIFE i felt like something was inside me trying to come out...my mind could NOT control my body, SEVERE WEIGHT GAIN ..and I used to always be thin) made me OBSESSED with food...I would do anything to get to food and i would eat and eat and eat uncontrolably. Never have I been suicidal, but I wanted to die just to get rid of the akethisia it was LIVING HELL. I have permanent side effects... i'm way slower in the head...memory loss...stuttering... I would lie down and not be able to get out of bed I was SO tired at times.	POISON! google AKETHISIA and read the hell it could bring you and your loved ones.DO NOT TAKE ANTI-PSYCHOTICS ... they WILL make you CRAZY so they can keep giving you more pills when you complain about the side effects they will more than likely tell you it's symptoms of something else and just put you on more medication that will permanently damage your brain and life. I can't believe they give this to people knowing what harm it can do.	F	19	6  weeks	6/18/2009
2	Major Depression	weight gain, fatigue/tiredness/drowsiness, loss of concentation	I have ADD and even though I am on Adderall the abilify counteracted it and I had a lot of trouble focusing in school. I am tired all the time getting 12 hours of sleep a night and still taking a 3-4 hour nap in the afternoon. It did help with my depression but recently I have been having suicidal thoughts. I also gained 15 pounds in just a few weeks.	F	20	2  months	6/15/2009

4	Schizophrenia	Problems with my legs. Sometimes they are restless, other times I can't feel them. I go to the gym a lot and have found I cannot perform as well with my legs. There are no problems with my other body parts.Blurry visionRandom changes to my tone of voiceFeeling sick (this went after a couple of days)	Works well so far. My symptoms are not as bad, I just hope the side effects stop	M	26	2  weeks	6/8/2009
1	schizoaffective	I gained 55 pounds in the 3 months i was on abilify! i have been thin my whole life now i no longer have a functioning metabolism. and am unable to loose all the weight		F	26	3  months	6/8/2009
2	Anxiety	Hallucinations, seeing spots (colored), toothaches (the whole right side of my mouth) I know this because when I stopped taking, it was way improved. Headaches, angry outbursts, very very tired 24/7.	Did help the anxiety. However, I couldn't tolerate the side effects I listed. It seemed each day was worse than the day before.	F	35	1  months	6/7/2009
1	Depression	Insanity. I know that sounds wierd, crazy or whatever, but that is the closest word I know to describe it. For three days I went into a world where I couldn't understand what was going on aroung me. I would start to speak, the words were clear in my head, but gibberish would come out. I was terrified for much of the time, curled in a ball, feeling I was about to die at any second.	This drug is now advertised as an add on supplement to anti-depressants. This is crazy! It's an anti-psychotic! It has a side affect profile that if fully revealed to patients would sent them running for the nearest exit.	M	28	4  days	6/7/2009
1	wrongly diagnosed	So, I am posting this message mainly to help others with their emotional/psychological struggles.  I would like to give people who have been put on anti-psychotics some pointers and guidance that might help.  I was on abilify for six years and regret it completely.	Honestly, Abilify works wonders for some people and for many others I can make matters worse.  I have a strong desire to help others so they hopefully don't have to go through what I went through to get to a state of well being.  Everything is anonymous!!  E-mail me if you would like some help with your situation.  Especially if you feel like you are just stuck.	M	23	6  years	6/7/2009Email

4	Bipolar II	Love this medication.  I finally feel like me again and can handle things.  However, I am EXTREMELY hungry.  Does this go away?  Also experiencing severe muscle aching.  I don't want to go off the Abilify, but can't take the hunger pain.		F	43	4  days	5/30/2009Email
4	Major depression w/ psychosis	Something similar to restless leg syndrome, fidgeting	I've now been diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features along with some other things.  Abilify was prescribed to me because my initial diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder. The two disorders are somewhat similar.  Abilify has more or less completely eliminated my psychotic symptoms and I do well on this medication.  I have not experienced any negative side effects in the past 2 years.  For the first 6 months I had restless legs and some fidgeting problems where it was hard to sit still.  Those symptoms passed and I feel pretty much fine at this point.  I also take Effexor XR, Lamictal and Librium.	F	31	2.5  years	5/29/2009
4	Depression & Paranoia	I've been taking 2 mg Abilify for 2 weeks now, along with my usual 40 mg Prozac and 900 mg Lithium. I feel like I'm on speed or something with abilify! I have no appetite (a good thing-could lose a few lbs), I feel restless, but I feel like I see things differently now. I also have a "full" sensation in my head and a little shakiness. I'm scared, because I keep reading all these bad things about Abilify, but I feel soooo much more alert & interactive now. If only the restlessness would go away, this is a miracle med for me. How long until these side effects taper off?		F	28	14  days	5/28/2009
3	Bipolar Disorder (rapid cycling)	Weight gain (about 20-30 pounds in a six months...without changing eating habits), extreme tiredness, lethargy, shaking/tremors, increased levels of insulin (blood sugar).	It helped my manic episodes and leveled out my mood. However, I don't feel it was worth the weight gain and increased blood sugar levels, which contributed to reoccurring, prolonged (and quite painful) yeast infections.	F	20	6  months	5/23/2009
1	bi polar	This was the worst medicine ever. I tried it for 6 weeks, starting at 2mg, and by the end of the time taking 15mg. My body would not stop moving. I couldnt read a book or watch TV. I found myself taking too many sleeping pills (and i never take sleeping pills) to counteract the movement so that i could fall asleep. This medicine should be used as a torture technique!!. The the doctor gave me sleep meds, and blood pressure medication to help with the Abilify side effects.(the blood pressure meds were supposed to make me stop moving...) So she had me on three medications! (NOt to mention this medicine is extremely overpriced!) You couldn'tpay me to take this medicine again. I am on Lamictal 25mg (a very low dose) and its a miracle. I bet this medicine will be pulled soon. It was just like a poison! Be very careful trying this medication.		M	39	6  weeks	5/19/2009
2	depression and ptsd	inner restlessness and desire to drink or eat	i took this for about two monts along with wellbutrin and at first had a hard time staying awake during the day.  after that passed i began wanting to drink so badly it was driving me nuts.  i began to drink to control the restlessness i felt because i was climbing the walls in my house just trying to get away from myself.  i quit taking it a week again and with just the wellbutrin i feel much better.	F	29	7  weeks	5/18/2009
5	Depression	Feeling a little "speedy" mentally, waking up early (4am), weight gain (about 10-15lbs) in 2mos.  Sometimes I feel overtired and not able to sleep enough to catch up.	I was depressed and Cymbalta was not helping---I could not motivate myself to do anything, even just taking a shower was hard.  Went back to Effexor XR (150mg) which had helped before with 5mg of Abilify and I could almost immediately feel the difference.  Wish I felt a little more energy physically, but I do feel a lot better.	F	48	2  months	5/16/2009
3	psychosis/spirit possession	weight gain, perhaps constipation, perhaps insomnia	I've been taking Abilify for 3 years and liked it the most of all the anti-psychotics I tried. Resperidol made me gain a lot of weight quickly. And Haldol was abominabal - I ate constanly and got ridid muscles, but that was also from all the anti-psychotics I tried. The key for me was finding the right DOSAGE, which was much lower than my doctor put me on originally. 5mg Abilify was just right, but I've been gaining more and more weight over the years and want to go off it due to this serious problem. It did however, protect me from the spirit invasion or what others call "voices" or "hallucinations". The risk of psychosis is one problem by going off of it, but so is diabetes and obesity, as well as other side effects from staying on it. I have weighed the consequences and made my choice. I will add that I'm perturbed with my doctor for not monitoring my weight while I've been on this drug. I think he doesn't want to see that it causes obesity.	F	46	3  years	5/13/2009Email
5	Bipolar Disorder	None that I know of	It has saved my life.	F	42	2  years	5/12/2009
4	Schizofrenia/Severe Anxiety Mix	Extreme dizziness & Muscle Tremors.	It works well, don't get me wrong. I switched from Invega. I'm on only 10mg and will probably switch to 25mg by next fill up. Totally helps with the anxiety and works well as an antidepressant. I've been able to focus more, but i'm also on Vyvanse for ADHD. I've had no suicidal thoughts what-so-ever. 10mg is a bit low, in my opinion anyway. Also, if you take any anti-psychotics, through my experience, for a month straight, the side effects generally seem to wear a bit off.	M	15	1  weeks	5/8/2009
1	Depresstion	Facial tics - blinking, tongue thrusts to the point where I had sores in my mouth, muscle stiffness, joint pain.  Uncontrollable muscle movements, twitching, jerking. Fatigue.	This medication was the worst thing that I ever took.  I had "parkinson syndrome" from it.  The facial tics & tongue thrusts lasted over a year.  I had to take Vitamin E for the past 18 months to get rid of them.  I still have blinking tics.  My daughter's doctor wanted her to try it(in small doses) but I refused. This was a horrible experience for me.	F	44	6  months	5/8/2009Email
4	bi-polar depression	Week 1: very slight weight gain -- about 2 lbs. that seems to have leveled off; a few days of extreme fatigue. Overall: slightly irritated stomach (I believe this makes me eat more, and is responsible for the weight gain), lighter sleeping, more sleep disturbances. I used to sleep like a log. Now I sleep like a cat. I miss my old sleep.	I was on abilify once before. The doc took me off due to my "speedy" response. But I have ADD, and I really liked the abilify. New doc is a-ok with my response, so long as it works for me. I'm also on Adderall and Welbutrin. Since starting this drug, I actually feel like doing things rather than just thinking about doing them and then thinking that I'll never finish and then getting depressed and hating myself. I'm more social. Self esteem is better too. Disruptive and ruminative thoughts are way down. Overall, I like.	F	33	16  days	5/7/2009
5	Bipolar 2	Initially stiffness and emotionless face, subsided within weeks.	This drug is a God-send to my 9 year old without it he would likely be in the hospital.  Almost totally normal with it.	M		15  months	5/6/2009
1	depression	facial tics where my left side of my face moved with my inability to stop it, my legs felt like they were filled with lead and I didnt want to work out anymore, my feet tingled and my toes hurt this was the creepiest drug I have ever taken	I felt happy but the side effects were so horrible it wasnt worth being happy (and that says a lot) I'm on wellbutrin and pristiq and this medication was a nightmare. My psych really pushed for me to take it and I had to really stand up for myself to say no. Dont let the commercial fool you and keep trying other drugs cuz abilify is poison	F		2  months	5/6/2009
3	anxiety, bi polar, chest pain	i can barely do anything...i just want to sleep until it hurts.  while sleeping i feel as if i am on a trampoline, i just toss and turn and bounce.  today(day 4) i feel jittery.	i was put on abilify because i was having panic attacks and feeling as if i was having heart attacks.  tight chest and trouble breathing, er visits.  doc thinks its in my mind and that im bipolar.  i cant believe that chest pain so severs is mental.  i havent had a bad attack yet but i feel as if i will collapse, i hope this tired dead-battery feeling goes away or i cant take it, i have a 2 month old.	M	36	4  days	5/4/2009Email
4	Bipolar Disorder	weight gain, inner restlessness.	I've been on lamictal, seroquel, and geodon since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder two months ago.  Each of those medicines gave me horrible side effects.  Abilify is the only medicine that has helped.  I am calmer, do not have my angry and irritable outbursts.  I'm also a self-injurer and haven't done anything since a couple days being on this medicine.  The downfall, I've been on this medicine for 2 weeks and I've gained 12lbs.	F	23	2  weeks	5/3/2009
2	Bipolar 2	Insomnia, wide awake every hour or two; impulsivity, shopping, eating, speaking; 15lb weight gain in 1 month; became nearly inarticulate, could not convey my thoughts or feelings very well at all; hypomania	I took Ability for a month as an adjunct Zoloft 100mg, which has stopped working.  In term of relief from the depression, the Ability worked wonderfully.  Because of the side effects, I dropped from my initial dose of 5mg to 2mg, and the depressive symptoms/suicidality returned nearly immediately.  After bumping back up to 4-4.5mg, the side effects returned.  This med may be tolerable for others but the side effects were intolerable for me.	F	36	1  months	5/2/2009
5	Bi Polar Disorder, Psychosis	Weight Gain (15 lbs in 6 months)	My daughter is doing EXTREMELY well on Abilify. Her rapid cycling is nearly zero. Her psychosis is also tremendously better. The change is almost as if she is a different kid. She went from extreme  mania episodes that cycled at times within minutes. To near stable in her moods in just days after beginning this medication. Her doctor wants to change her to Geodon due to the weight gain. Weight was never an issue for her until she started taking Abilify. But I think with the improvement in her mental stability a little weight gain is not that significant. I love this medication. She was on 5mg per day up to 7.5 per day after 2 months. It's effectiveness wore off at about 2 months in. No problems since upped to 7.5mg a day. She has no trouble sleeping. I didnt realize how her mania was affecting her sleep until starting this medicine and she is actually tired when it's time for bed. No complaints from me.	F	7	6  months	4/26/2009Email
2	Bipolar	Severe akathesia!  The restlessness drove me up a wall.  I also experienced word loss, short-term memory loss, stiff muscles and joints, tremors in my left hand (I'm left-handed), raised body temperature, weight gain (15 pounds in 4 months), no sex drive, increased breast size with milk coming out of them, fatigue during the day and sleeplessness at night. I took Abilify before I want to bed.  I have tried almost every dose: 30mg, 20mg, 10mg, 5mg and 2mg.  At 5mg and above I experienced euphoria that made me feel like I could probably jump off of a building for fun and be o.k.  At doses below 5mg I still experienced all of the side effects (except for the euphoria)and became extremely irritable and hostile, but otherwise I had no emotions.	To be fair, my paranoia went away. This was the only medication I was taking.	F	45	4  years	4/23/2009
2	Bipolar Disorder	Brain fog, Stiff muscles, inability to ever sit still or relax,	Abilify caused me to not be able to relax my muscles and I was always uncomfortable.  I had a hard time sleeping at night.  Wasn't what I expected. I had to go off of it becuase my grades in school started to drop.	F	23	2  weeks	4/17/2009
5	Mixed bipolar		I have been on Abilify for 2 years with no side effects. It has stabalized my mood along with Tegretal and Pristiq. While my antidepressant often stops working or has to be adjusted in the dose, the Abilify 10 mg has worked for me. I take all my meds at bedtime and sleep well, have no appetite increase or weight gain(terrible wt. gain on Depakote that I have since  lost), no nausea, dizziness, or vivid dreams. For me it's a life saver and I'm able to continue to work at a high functioning capacity.	F	60	2  years	4/16/2009
4	Suicidal thoughts	My mouth is dry and i've noticed i'm not hungry but my muscles ached terribly for the first two weeks.	I'm glad I didn't listen to the scary potential side effects. On abilify I feel even but I still feel emotions only I dont think about how much I hate myself anymore. I'm surprised at how this has worked so far.	F	35	2  months	4/16/2009
3	depression, over fatigue & stress	at first my husband take zyprexa but his doctor changed it to abilify due to gaining his weight. after a week i notice that my husband became restless and move or walk like a robot, though he can sleep he always tell me that he tired very easy as well his muscles. his craving more than before so his cholesterol became higher. so i decided to stop taking abilify and i noticed that my husband movement became normal.		M	33	13  days	4/16/2009
3	aggression & phycotic eppisodes	Tiredness, sleeplessness, extreme fluid retention. pain in the left side of neck	My son has DownSyndrome and a level of Autism, he has also been diagonised as having Psyschotic eppisodes, He gets very aggressive He has been on Risperdal(disasterous). Zyprexa(worked on the outbursts, but huge weight gain,and the threat of him developing Diabetes) He's been on Abilify now fo thirteen days but I'm getting very concerned about side effects, So I'm now considering stopping the drug, It has helped keep him calm, but at what risk to his health,We are running out of options for him	M	18	13  days	4/15/2009Email

5	mind racing, bi polar	none	completely made me a different person, I felt normal after 20 years of struggling with depression and paranoia. I also use this with celexa which works for me too	M	37	1  months	4/7/2009
3	Resistant Depression/Anxiety	15 lbs weight gain.  Restlessness.  Chronic insomnia.  Night binging (and subsequent purging to curb weight gain).	Ironically, this drug (5 mg to 2 mg with 150 mg of Wellbutrin XR and 20 mg of Adderral XR) helped my self-confidence in social situations by minimizing my anxiety and shutting off my self-critic -- despite shattering my self-image (as a result of relentless weight gain).  At my best, I didn't care.  I shopped nonstop -- because I was constantly gaining weight (in reality) and my clothes no longer fit me.  In my case, my doctor did not listen to my threshold for weight gain.  In two years, I gained 20 lbs with various antidepressants.  Desperate to gain some resemblance of myself back, I began purging.  In the eight months that I have been (on/off) the Abilify, I have vacillated from hypomanic (on) to hopelessly depressed (off).  In fact, the spiraling phase upon quitting the drug (without compliance) has translated to increased anxiety (and dependence on Xanax) and debilitating depression. I do not recommend this drug to young women whose self-image is inextricably related to their appearance in anyway.	F	33	8  months	4/1/2009
3	Depression	Speedy manic feeling, shakiness, feeling like I couldn't sit still, a little nausea in the beginning, craving for sweets at night, WEIGHT GAIN.	I was already taking Prozac for depression but still having depression symptoms, so the Dr. prescribed Abilify to supplement the Prozac. In the beginning, this medicine really helped to pull me out of the funk that I was in.  I felt energized, productive, and like my overall attitude was very much improved.  After a couple or 3 weeks, however, I noticed that I was gaining weight at an alarming rate.  In the 2 months that I took this drug, (at a low dose of 1mg/day) I gained over 15 lbs!  I also felt strangely like shopping and spending money all of the time, almost like I was having a manic episode. All in all, I felt much less depressed, but stopped taking for fear of becoming REALLY overweight. Note: after I stopped this drug, I felt more depressed than ever and almost suicidal.  If you stop, you should probably taper off gradually!	F	45	2  months	3/29/2009Email
5	pediatric anxiety/possible bipolar	nausea & headache for the first few days. Also, tired during the day for 1st week. otherwise, none.	This medication has worked wonderfully for my daughter. She has been on it 3 weeks and for the first time in her life I heard she had a "wonderful" week at school. The side effects are most definately tolerable and my daughter says this medication changed her life. Parents-don't be afraid to try it. I know everything on this site sounds bad, but it has been a Godsend to my family.	F	8	3  weeks	3/20/2009
3	Post Tramatic Syndrome & OCD	I wake up several times in the night and am not able to go back to sleep usually for an hour or so.  I have never had this problem in the past.  I have also been very restless and am not able to stay focused on one task for two long.  I have to be doing something that is keeping me very busy.  I have also noticed increased anxiety with this medication.		M	36	1  months	3/15/2009

5	manic/psychotic episode	restlessness at first, waking up several times in night	Switched to it from risperidone, 4 months after a manic/psychotic episode. I was depressed on the risperidone but depression lifted on aripiprazole (an antidepressant was also added). Didn't have the demotivation and lethargy I experienced on risperidone.	M	24	9  months	2/24/2009
3	autism  bipolar	painful erection of penis	My 6 year old son never had a problem with erections until taking Abilify.  Then it happened all the time and was very painful.  The doctors would not believe me that this was happening - even though it is rare side effect.  His behaviour settled down on the abilify; but we have not seen an increase in bad behaviour since taking him off the med.	M	6	3  months	2/21/2009
1	Bi-Polar	Could not sit still.  Felt confused.  When I say I couldn't sit still I mean it.  This drug had me jittery, and it was the worst feeling I have ever had in my life.  Sit down to watch TV, standing up thirty seconds later.  To come off the drug was worse then the side effects of the drug while taking it.	Be very careful of this drug, it is very powerful, and it takes a good month to get it out of your system.	M	38	4  months	2/21/2009
1	Depression	I went from being moderately depressed, to feeling suicidalwithin 2 weeks. Acute anxiety and paranoia followed.	This is a very dangerous drug.	F	41	16  days	2/20/2009
4	Depression	Insomnia	I started taking this b/c my regular depression just wasn't doing the job. Now I take 2mg of abilify and 150mg of Effexor XR and I haven't felt this good in months. Absolutely no side effects from the abilify except difficulty staying asleep during the night. That's why I gave it a 4. It did exactly what it was supposed to do! Thank goodness!!!!	F	31	20  days	2/13/2009
4	Bipolar and Schizophrenia	None that I can directly attribute to Abilify	I have been taking Abilify for over 2 years now. As a result, I can no longer remember what it felt like to not be on it or what it actually does for me when I take it. It is just another drug that I pop twice a day. 15mg twice a day for a total of 30mg. I do know that my hallucinations are very minimal from what they used to be. But I still hear voices and see things on occasion that are very disturbing.	M	36	2  years	2/5/2009
1	depression	weight gain	I gained 35lbs in 6 months... it helped with my mood swings but when my psych told me it was why I was gaining weight, I went off it.... i hate it =( Now I'm left almost 40lbs overweight	F	22	6  months	2/5/2009
3	depression	weight gain = 60 lbs in 1 yr, craving sweets, developed pre-diabetic condition, BANKRUPTED ME AS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE	I've suffered with intractable depression for decades and have been on just about every medication ever made.  After years of working with an extremely competent, caring psychiatrist, he placed me on a 2 drug combination of 60mg/daily of Cymbalta and 15 mg/every other day of Abilify and, for the first time in a very long time, I do not experience the terrible lows which with I previously struggled.  Now, if I could just lose the weight I gained.....I'd feel much, much better.  Please do not construe this medication combination as a CURE.  I AM better; BUT, I still struggle with depression...just not as often.

1	Aspergers, depression, anxiety	My 10-year old son was put on abilify to quell his anxiety and depression.  He has gained over 40# in 3-months, he beats his head, calls himself stupid and begs to go to God where the pain will be gone.  We are in the process of weening him off this drug for good.	Scary...We were told it did not promote weight gain in children..yet our son gained 40#.  Did nothing about his depression and anxiety and actually made him more manic and out of sorts...Did not work for our child.	M	10	4  months	1/30/2009Email

1	Bipolar	After two days on this stuff, I've got a terrible headache that won't quit and I feel like I need to vomit.	I'll give it a few more days until I see my doctor next week, but I'm not sure if this is worth it.  Hopefully the side effects wear off.	F	39	2  days	1/26/2009
1	Bipolar II, insomnia	This is one of the worst medications I have ever taken.  I took 1 2.5 mg tab and started experiencing extreme anxiety and insomnia.  This developed into a hypomanic state and I have been lucky to get 3 hours of sleep a day.  I had to start taking Seroquel (which I also hate because it leaves me hung over) and I was able to sleep 6 hours.  Now, I have to take Seroquel to get any sort of sleep.  Also, benzos did not counteract any of my anxiety.		F	34	2  days	1/21/2009
4	head banging	slight weight gain (now taking 1 mg per day with 25 mg Zoloft)When on 10 mg (in error)had severe muscle stiffness and zombie effect.	This has helped enormously-feel less anxiety, more cheerful and outgoing, can speak more slowly and clearly-and head banging only once mildly in 9 months (full moon). I have developmental disabilities and, probably, autism.	F	63	9  months	1/18/2009
3	Severe Depression	Last year, I was started on 2mg and was very irritable...my doctor increased me to 4mg a day and the irritable feelings went away.  However I have gained 50 lbs in one year.	Abilify in conjunction with fluexotine has helped my depression.  However the weight gain is very discouraging...I am trying to lose the weight but it is very hard to on this medicine.	F	23	1  years	1/18/2009
1	halucinations, anxiety	My 10 year old daughter has been on abillify for a year and she had gained weight.  Also, her inner cheeks were sore as if she had began to bite them (unknowingly).  She complains of stomach aches sometimes.  Lately her cheeks, chin, and lips have swollen as a result, I am weening her off.  I am looking for a natural alternative with minimum side effects because my daughter asked me why must she keep suffering.		F	10	370  days	1/16/2009Email
4	Depression	Restlessness, can't sleep very well	I'm taking Cymbalta and Wellbutrin and still was in a fog or in low gear all the time.  My psy thought Abilify would be a good catalyst for the two and it has worked great.  No more fog, I want to do more and wake up getting going.  The only issue is waking up too early; sometimes 3 and 4 am.	M	50	30  days	1/15/2009

1	Clearness of thoughts, focusing	Severe restlessness at 15mg, some at 10mg.	It may have helped in some ways, but the increased restlessness is nuts.  I can't stay still and can't relax.  Also take Effexor twice a day.	M	53	6  months	11/5/2007Email

5	bipolar	none	this med saved my life	M	39	13  days	10/23/2007
4	bi-polar, depression, ADHA	Weight gain, tired	My 12 year old son was prescribed this and it completely changed our life!  I had my child back ... no more screaming rages, no more fights in school.  This is a wonder drug!	M	12	5  months	10/16/2007
1	Bipolar II	EXTREME mania, severe throat swelling starting within 24 hrs of first 2 mg dose, sweating, uncontrollable tremors, twitching, headache, tiredness, blurred vision, nausea, agitation, dizziness. I ended up in the hospital after 4 days on the drug. I was severely dehydrated.	I would NOT take this drug. Even if you are having few side effects now I would say it's extremely dangerous and not worth the risk. Especially do not give this drug to children! There are bound to be long term effects that are irreversible. I will have to see if my muscle aches, tremors and twitching will subside permanently. Not a good experience!	M	25	4  days	10/13/2007Email
5	Bipolar	constipation, incresed energy, suppressed appetite.	i love it! on 5mg for past 2 weeks. I used to sleep 10 hrs a day before meds, and now I'm wide awake after 5 hrs. I have so much energy right now. I had taken Depakote, which was awful, I slept 12+ hrs a day, and still felt drowsy. Lost 5 lbs in past 2 weeks.	F	28	2  weeks	10/12/2007
3	Paranoid schizophrenia	For a short while, I experienced akathesia, but this has now gone.	Abilify has stopped auditory hallucinations, which is a great blessing. Sleep is interrupted, but I find that useful for reading and studying assorted Christian publications and the Bible early in the morning when all is quiet.  My appetite is enormous, so am constantly struggling with the temptation to gluttony and "making a god of the belly". So the challenge is self-control to avoid putting on more weight. I can thoroughly recommend the book "Strength for His People - A Ministry for Families of the Mentally Ill" by Dr Steven Waterhouse, Pastor of Westcliff Bible Church in Amarillo, Texas since 1985, (published by Westcliff Press - www.webtheology.com; e-mail is westcliff@amaonline.com; Ph: (806)359-6362). His brother Mark, suffers from schizophrenia and he wrote the book  in honour of him and to help ordinary people who may also suffer from this awful condition, and as a guide and consolation to families who may be the primary carer.(125 pages; Bibliography has 1	F	53	69  days	10/10/2007Email
1	Depression	RESTLESSNESS RESTLESSNESS RESTLESSNESS, dizziness, tiredness, nausea, anxiety/panic, flu-like symptoms	My psychiatrist prescribed this medication for me to help the Prozac work more effectively, she said. I HATE this medication, and after three days of taking it I WILL NOT take anymore. I could cry- I've never felt in such a way in all my life. It was like the walls were closing in. EVERYTHING was too boring to hold my attention! All I could think of, and I mean ALL DAY, was how GOOD it would feel to just run around my neighborhood screaming at the top of my lungs. It was IMPOSSIBLE to get comfortable, and I felt panicky, as if I were going to suddenly run out of oxygen. It was horrible. I've never experienced such crippling side effects before from any medicine like this.	M	18	3  days	10/8/2007
5	Bipolar Disorder	Fatigue, but it's fine since I take it at night and it helps me sleep.	EXCELLENT! So far, so good! I have more energy and motivation than I have ever had. I also have little to NO obsessive thoughts, practically NO racing thoughts, and my mood has been greatly improved. I can't say enought about how great this medication has been for me. I actually feel normal!!	F	34	9  days	10/3/2007
2	Bipolar II	Jittery, manic frenzy, sleeplessness	If this doesn't make you want to jump out of your skin, I don't know what will. I felt like I could scale the walls.	F	24	7  days	9/21/2007
2	Bipolar I Disorder	Tremors, insomnia, headaches, agitation, increased energy	This seems like a medication that might work for major depression, but I just don't see how it works for Bipolar Disorder.  It's so stimulating I had to take it as early as possible in the morning to avoid sleeplessness at night and it caused me to shake and have WAY too much energy during the day.	M	22	2  months	9/21/2007
4	Anxiety/Depression/Paranoia	Some blurred vision and dizziness when driving.	Everything seems to be working well and I feel Abilify has helped me tremendously!	F	30	1  months	9/19/2007
3	Anger/Rage/Paranoid Thoughts	Extreme tiredness/exhaustion.  Blurred vision and body aches.	It has made me calmer and I feel a little aloof so I'm not worrying about things as much.  I don't know if the side effects are worth it though.  I'll give it another week and see.	F	30	2  weeks	8/23/2007
5	bipolar w/ anxiety, hallucinations	some tummy upset when starting the meds but otherwise none so far.	Abilify was a miracle for my 8 yr old. After 4 years of searching for something that would help with his panic attacks, terror, anxiety, audio and visual hallucinations and frustration/aggression as well as his hyperactivity he was ultimately prescribed abilify 7.25 mg.  This was a miracle drug for us and alone has solved all of his issues. I'm so happy my son feels as he says "calm and happy" and isn't afraid of simple things like rain and leaving the house. He has been on it for 2 months now and the change is so dramatic. I'm one of those who tried so hard not to put my son on medication but he is a different child now, happy and no longer unable to function. As another mother here said, it gave him his life back.

2	rapid cycling bi-polar disorder	have gained 10 lbs in 4months, urinate frequently,no sex drive, blurred vision, makes me intensely hungry after i take it.unusually tired	I'm on lamictal and klonopin and have been on both of those for almost 10yrs, drs have been trying to add something for a boost as the lamictal makes me a little blah feeling. I have tried everything and just started the abilify 4 months ago and i felt like it worked great at first then the longer i take it the worse my side effects have gotten, i thought something new was wrong with me since it worked well in the beginning it seemed but have been so tired its ridiculous. i'm glad i went back and researched my meds just in case and found all my problems are side effects of this med.	F	34	4  months	8/22/2007
5	BPII, BPD	In the beginning I had some "wooziness," but that passed quickly.  Overall, I've had no real side-effects.	It has helped tremendously with my moods and I am able to take it during the day, which is a great thing (I don't tolerate medications well, and most tend to make me very sleepy).	F	26	3  months	8/15/2007Email
5	BIpoalr disorder	The main side effect is not being able to sleep for very long, but I also have more energy and get more things done.	I have taken almost every depression drug out there, and thought that I was just supposed to feel detached or apathetic. Abilify has been a miracle for me. I have a sense of humor again, lots of energy and the negative critical side of me is GONE.	M	35	30  days	8/12/2007Email
2	OCPD, anxiety, mild depression	Listlessness, lethargy, fatigue, reduced libido, ambivalence, lip sore (?), weight gain (?).	I was feeling highly motivated for two weeks before starting on Abilify. I started 5 mg for 5 days, then ramped to 10 mg for another 2+ weeks. All of the side effects started out barely noticeable. Over the last 5 days or so, the side effects have intensified. [Note: Taking 30 units Lantis(insulin)/dy for Type 2 diabetes; My BMI is 38;  I'm also on 40-80mg/dy Prozac for depression/aggression, the last 10 yrs., w/ no side effects.] I suspect Abilify is slowly turning me into the PillsBury Dough Boy. So, I'm not waiting another 2 weeks to get the shrink's opinion. I'm stopping taking this Rx cold turkey-right now. Of course I'll call the shrink to let him know I'm stopping this med.. All side effects w/ no noticeable benefits for me (unless you like feeling like a human marshmallow). Of course, your experience may or maynot be positive, unlike mine.	M	53	3  weeks	8/11/2007
4	Bipolar 2	VIVID DREAMS (things I think about during the day, i dream about at night.  These dreams feel very real)  K.O. component (I fall asleep within an hour of taking abilify)	I take Abilify with LAMICTAL(mood stabilizer) & Remeron.  I have nothing bad to say about abilify except it doesnt give me the desired effect i'm looking for which is the semi-resurrection of my mania so i am able to be an intellect and have a personality.	M	24	2  months	7/21/2007
3	Schizoaffective	I'm on lots of meds, so I'm not sure what side effects are caused by abilify; I haven't noticed any.	Abilify helped things make more sense. It helped a lot with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. I stoped wearing sweatshirts in the summer shortly after the drug was started but didn't realize until later that the abilify was why. I would recommend this drug.	F	19	2  months	7/21/2007Email
1	supposed bipolar disorder	Mental "fog," totally detached from everything, and severe--and continuing, even after 18 months off Abilify--movement problems akin to Restless Leg Syndrome.	Despite 30mg being the maximum dosage, my psychiatrist had me on 45mg, and did not listen when I told him about the side effects.  So, after about a year on Abilify (as well as Seroquel and Lamictal) I took myself off the two neuroleptics.  And yet I still have moment problems, increasing when tired or stressed, all this time later.	F	26	1  years	7/21/2007
2	Aspergers Syndrome, Tourette's	Intense sleepiness for first day, then after second dose, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, intense akathesia. Four days after discontinuing, the akathesia is subsiding, and the insomnia is lessening, but still present. Also: intense feelings of hunger.	This drug was supposed to calm me, help me to focus, control repetitive behaviors and tics. It did the opposite. It made it very difficult for me to sit still and write or type.	M	45	3  days	7/9/2007
1	Bipolar 2	Tremors in arms hands.  Two right fingers don't function normally. Restless legs.	The restless leg thing was bad.  I felt like a hyper 5 year old.  Tremors in arms and hands almost as bad as Katherine Hepburn.  Two fingers on right hand don't function normally.  Since I throw freight as a package handler, I'm useless at work.  Also have the urinating issue, I wait until I HAVE TO GO, otherwise not much happens - unlike normal.  Took 10 mg without Cymbalta, then with it again.  I have stopped takeing Abilify on 6/30.  It is now 7/5 and side effects haven't stopped.  Tremor has actually worsened.	M	36	5  days	7/5/2007Email
2	Bipolar II Disorder	Constant mouth ulcers, toothaches, muscle pain	It helped control my disorder better than most medications, with a minimum of other side effects, but the mouth ulcers are too much when you can't even eat a decent cheeseburger without being in pain.  The toothache was from a still-growing wisdom tooth that only seems to come in when I've taken it.  My mother has reported similar symptoms, so I figure it's just a hereditary thing.	M	28	3  weeks	7/3/2007
1	depression, irritabiity	extreme nausea, I took 1/2 of this pill and vomited all night, dry heaves, you name it.  It was the most horrific experience, I will never,.. ever recommend this med, please beware!  I was also prescribed a 30mg tablet a day, and in doing more research found out that is the highest dose!  I think this nurse practitioner is a quack!		F	49	1  days	7/3/2007
4	Psychosis from PTSD	weight gain (despite claims that it doesn't cause weight gain)	Abilify has helped me think more clearly, rationally and aside from the weight gain, I've had no side effects at all.  I take the Abilify in the morning, as it tends to be a bit stimulating.	M	46	3  years	6/11/2007Email
5	schizophrenia	this drug is going to be similiar to the drug named BIFEPRUNOX(chemical name)coming out soon maybe end of 07 or 1st quarter of 08 it has a good side effect profile NO WEIGHT GAINNO INCREASE IN PROLACTIN LEVELSNO ADVERSE EFFECT ON BLOOD LIPIDS NO ADVERSE AFFECTS ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS NO QTc PROLONGATION	i will be taking my ABILIFY at 15mg until this drug called BIFEPRUNOX becomes availableI hope soon!	M	29	13  years	5/30/2007
5	BP w/psychotic episodes; autism	My son has been on this med for two years and his only side effect has been minimal weight gain (about 20 lbs. in two years).	This medication worked very well for my son - stopped his visual and auditory hallucinations completely, decreased his motor tics, reduced OCD-like behaviors, and greatly reduced his aggression. This medication gave my son his life back; he is now able to function & communicate well and he is excelling academically.	M	12	2  years	5/17/2007
3	schizo/bipolar/depression	This medicince by far is the most effective when treating symptomsit has low impact on weight gain.  i recommend this drug if you have experienced weight gain with other anti physcotics such as seroquel and  zyprexa, i believe those drugs are linked to DIABETES, WEIGHT GAIN, and OVER EATING AND UNCONTROLLABLE HUNGER the dosing is very easy with abilify starting dose 15mg and that is the recommended dose you stay on according to my shrink abilify has not been found affective at higher does due to extreme side effects	this medicine made my eyes roll in back of my head once	M	32	14  years	5/14/2007
4	bipolar 1 disorder/mood instability	extreme tiredness, upset stomach, blurred vision, cold sweats, tremors (uncontrollable shaking) in hands.	I have been on and off this medication for 4 years and today is my first day back on it in 8 months. I feel very ill but I remember from all my past experiences that it takes a few weeks for your body to get used to and to respond(I just want to make that clear to the people that quit taking it after one day). I am taking 15mg but I'm pretty sure I'm going to start cutting my pill in half to lessen the side effects. Abilify has been highly effective in treating my irritability and mood swings, making me a pleasure, rather than a monster, to be around. Personally, I would rather have an upset stomach for a few days and be happy than to be constantly angry for the rest of my life. I took abilify with effexor a few years back and it sent me to the ER because I was shaking so badly I couldn't stand up. I am told it is dangerous to mix abilify with anything. Hopefully the side effects go away soon!	F	19	4  years	5/1/2007Email
5	bipolar/schizo-affectiver	As I went slowly up from 2.5mg to 15mg,- I experienced poor night vision;loud noises startled me at night;muscular aches and pains; always want to eat; tired all day but can't sleep through the night; restless, but tired.  Agitation, anger and anxiety came back if I didn't increase my dosage in about 4days.  I just began 15mg today. DR. said may go all the way to 30mg if we need to in the future.	Now, the good stuff--I'm calmer around people.  My anger is much reduced.  Oversensitivity is reduced. I'm able to cope with daily frustrations.  I'm no longer so irritable and impatient with people.  General anxiety, and nervousness to be around people is gone.  Bipolar mood swings are completely minimized and I recover from any emotional upset faster.  AWESOME drug for me personally!	F	38	1  months	4/25/2007
4	bipolar depression	weight gain (it was lithium's helper) spasming jaw, chattering teeth, tiredness, "wired, but tired"	This drug has kept me from falling any deeper into depressions. Both times it has rescued me from hospitalizations.  However, I do not like having to take two other drugs just so I can continue taking this one without the side effects.  Have to take cogentin and inderal both for the jaws and limb jerks.  Don't like that.	F	50	15  days	4/25/2007
3	Schizophrenia	increased sex drive, some tiredness, restlessness	Aripiprazole has being used to decrease the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and it has being effective at doing so. In my case, the side effects close to outweigh the benefits of this drug.	M	32	2  months	4/23/2007Email
1	Cyclothymia	Intense pain with muscle stiffness.  I might be diagnosed with Lupus now.  I never had these problems before I took Abilify.	I still have to have more blood tests to determine what is going on with the muscle and joint pain that I am experiencing.  I took 2.5 mgs. of Abilify for about a month and then felt like I was coming down with the flu.  It turns out that it was a rare side effect from this medicine, so I stopped taking it.  I am still in pain and it has been over 2 months since my last dose.  I am convinced that whatever my blood work says that I have it came from taking this medicine.	F	44	30  days	4/23/2007Email
5	schizophrenia	vivid dreaming, insomnia for the first four months	I lost 87lds on this drug and it gave my life back to me. No voices, no paranoia, no psychosis!!!	F	47	3  days	4/19/2007
1	bipolar disoder II, depression	I was vomiting the whole night after taking the first pill, the next day I was feeling sick that the only thing that I could do is just lying down in my bed; wasn't able to eat. I was feeling really sick, no drug made me fell that way	I took this medicine just for 1 day, and it was enough for me to decide that I wasn't taking it anymore. I was feeling really sick, just the same as when I was pregnant and having severe toxicosis , no drug made me fell that way. I'm going back to Depakote.	F	21	1  days	4/10/2007
2	schizoaffective, bipolar type	About three weeks after I started taking it, my entire body started gradually swelling up like a balloon, and I had this uncontrollable, horrible burning sensation in my legs and ankles. It got to the point where the swelling was so bad that I could barely move. I couldn't button my shirts anymore, my feet wouldn't fit into my shoes, and I had to go up a whole bra size (band AND cup). I found out, though, that only about two percent of the subjects in the clinical trials had this problem (and it's often an allergic reaction), so I must be special. ;-} Oddly enough, when I went off this, I got onto Risperdal, only to have the exact same reaction.	I was REALLY disappointed that my reaction was so bad, because it otherwise worked very well. I felt better than I could remember feeling in about 20 years. My mood swings went from every several minutes to ... not at ALL. I felt stable for the first time in a VERY long time, like I was finally on solid ground. The really WEIRD thing, though, was that for the first four days, I couldn't feel ANYTHING -- it was like someone had flipped a switch inside me and turned me off. After that, it took about another week to level out completely, but once I did, I felt GREAT.	F	28	5  weeks	4/5/2007Email
4	bi p[olar disorder	Tired. Very tired at first; now I don't even notice unless I stop taking it...then I'm a real c*nt to deal with and I am very irritable and angry.	When I started taking Abilify with Zoloft, I was very tired all day.  I felt like I had a wet blanket wrapped around my head, then they lessened the dose to 5 mg a day, and I'm fine.  It's subtle, I can't tell any effect at all from it unless I stop taking it.  Then it is like an immediate PMS.	F	37	1  years	4/1/2007Email
1	bi polar disorder	Started out on 5mg daily and over a period of 2 months was "upped" to 20mg.  By the middle of the third month, I developed the most horrible feeling, like wanting to jump out of my own skin, could NOT get comfortable, caused restless leg syndrome to go totally bonkers, made me pace and feel horribly panicky ALL THE TIME!  I had never in my life felt such an awful feeling!  Raging insomnia accompanied the whole ordeal, as well as vision trouble, completely unable to write a sentence or write my own name, for that matter due to hand tremors (which I still have sometimes to this day), constant feeling that the "dying to get out of my own skin or run screaming like a madwoman" feeling would NEVER go away.  It finally did, but golly did it ever take time.  That's the only thing that will help with the akathisia (acathesia)...time.  It took the same amount of time that I was on the drug, about 3 and a half months, for the feeling to finally start going away.	In all honesty, through bi polar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, severe panic disorder, visual and auditory psychosis at times, depression, etc., the ONLY time I ever truly even considered suicide was during the akathisia (acathesia) ordeal I went through, all due to the Abilify.  You don't know what utter hell and torment is until you've gone through the nightmare of akathesia, which for me was completely due to taking Abilify!  If it works for you, great, but be warned...try to stay on the smallest dosage that works for you...upping the dosage over a period of time can have this horrible effect on you too and I wouldn't wish the feeling Abilify caused me on my worst enemy!

5	BP 1/possible schizoaffective/PTSD	vertigo,(room tumbling end over end) one episode lasted two days, the other lasted one week, other than that no side effects. cannot be certain this medicine was to blame	abilfy helped me come down out of the sky, gave me very crisp feelings and perceptions of reality.  It dimmed out the white noise in my head, and for the very first time i can remember felt no noise in my head, just peacefulness.  Being numb from years of emotional shutdown, i actually had feelings surface for the first time, and had to start sorting through them and dealing with them.  sometimes it was painful at first because the pain was acute, but Id much rather feel now than be numb.  Ativan in combination helps deal with the tremendous anxiety.  Also take seroquel for sleep, and lamictal for the depression.  Overall, a good mix for me.  I would never want to go back to the worst moments of this illness before Dx and treatment, and for that I am grateful.	F	37	17  months	3/25/2007
5	bipolar1/ schizo	Restlessness   Severe at times.  strangeley, tiredness can acompany this or exist independently of it.  I feel agitated but clear headed.  i will accept the trade-off but feel that I must do something about side-effect.  Benzo helps. I forsee weight gain because I am hungry again.	I am only in the first week, but needed to speak of the progress I have made.  At just 5 mgs. I notice a substantial reduction in the chatter in my brain and I am better able to perceive and respond appropriately to social scenes, leaving me less sacred of people.  Paranoia is under control. i have been on several meds in my 20 year struggle with bipolar 1/schizo. disorder.  i am just coming off a psychotic break that lasted very long on and off.  I am what they call a quick responder when a med works for me.  So far wellbutrin (which i still take) Lamictal (which was like a god-send and then pooped-out, and now Abilify has improved drasticaly the picture in just 5 days.  Last night I could concentrate long enough to put a desk from Ikea together and I even cleaned my room.  Now i still have the memories of some terrible behavior and the knowlege of such negative poop-out tendencies of meds.  But for today I am grateful.  More later.  John. R.B. CA.

1	anti pyschotic, not needed	this drug made me walk like a zombie, slur my speech, I couldn't use my hands and fingers - it was like I had a small stroke, I couldn't lay or sit down - relaxing was very unconfortable, very nervous, loss of concentration.	I din't need anti-psychotics and was prescribed and administered them illegally.  I tried geodon, respirdal, and zyprexa too.  The abilify was by far the worst!  I was only taking 15mg., and I still had horrendous side effects!  This is a terribly dangerous drug.  I see no worth in any anti-psychotic or anti-depressant drugs, these drugs really mess with your mind and body. If you are having psychotic, bi-polar, depression, or whatever, and desire to take something.  Only take small dosages of anything, 10mg. or less.  These drugs can cause more harm than the disease!		41	18  days	3/12/2007

3	social anxiety,  ADD	Mood lift, more energy (too much at 1 mg), got very restless, felt calmer around people, woke up earlier with energy, became to restless and had to stop taking Abilify.	I would recommend this to anyone needing an AP. I just got too restless and would lose my train of thought in mid- sentence.  Not for me!  Abilify may work really well with you.  Try it out; you'll know very soon if its for you or not.	M	32	21  days	2/22/2007

F	40	1  days	2/22/2007
3	Non-Specified Psychotic Disorder	My 17 year old has been taking abilify for 3 months.  The sleepiness disrupts his daily functioning terribly.  He leaves school early every day, sleeps several hours and gets about 8-9 hours of sleep every night.  He never feels well rested, but has no problem falling asleep.  He also experiences some muscular discomfort and dehydration.	We are currently weaning off of it.  He would rather deal with his symptoms then the side effects.  Doc has prescribed Luvox..hard to find info on it.  Not sure what we are going to do.  The abilify decreased his symptoms by about 90% on 10 mg. per day.	M	17	3  months	2/13/2007
5	Bipolar 2	weight gain/sweet cravings	Abilify has done wonders for controlling my aggression and irritability.  I am already taking Topamax and I have noticed  a slow weight gain from craving sweets since on Abilify (1.5 years) and Dostinex (3yrs).  I am going to try to give up sugar and junk to see if the weight comes off.  I am also coming off the Dostinex too to see if it is effecting my weight. I really need the Abilify.  I could tell a tremendous difference in my anxiety level when I went from 10mg - 15mg.  I take 15 mg. of Abilify every morning.	F	41	1.5  years	2/7/2007
2	BP1, SAD	jittery, wanting to crawl out of my skin.  can't sleep at night, can't take it during the day because then i can't work.	i would NEVER try this drug again....ick	F	25	4  weeks	2/5/2007Email
1	schizoaffective and OCD	terrible shaking, teeth chatter, neck pain, inability to stay in my seat, kept falling asleep, waking up in middle of night, lip quivering, lights bothered my eyes really bad, loud sounds bothered me bad.	I wish it had worked.  It really helped a lot with my illness.  But the side effects were impossible to handle.  I couldn't so much as eat dinner or read a book in any normal sense.  I wanted to just crawl out of my skin.  However, I must add that I take Paxil as well.  However, Paxil has never caused me any problems.my friend (same condition) also takes paxil and abilify.  both of us agreed that once we tried Abilify that mania was brought on.  For the record, Paxil has never done that to either of us until we had Abilify.	M	32	2  weeks	2/4/2007
4	Autism and Tourettes Syndrome	I was on Abilify for about 5 years and then had to go off of it.  I lost a great deal of weight when I went off of it, but my behaviors got worse. I could not think clearly. I recently went back on the Abilify and I have gained a great deal of weight in a very short period of time. Not happy about that.  Also, my appetite has increased slightly, and it makes me extremely tired.	This truly gets rid of tics (from Tourette's) and controls alot of the behaviors from Autism, but the side effects are just awful. There really is no drug out there that works as well, and that is a shame. Wish someone would develop a drug that didn't have so many side effects.	F	15	 	12/24/2006
5	Bipolar I Disorder	None whatsoever.	Silenced the voices, no more paranoia,able to think clearly, able to SLEEP, no weight gain here.No drowsiness as experienced with Seroquel.	F	42	4  months	12/23/2006
1	Bipolar I disorder - manic episodes	Severe eye tremors, double vision, hypersomnia, anxiety attacks, muscle weakness, severe depression, cloudy thoughts, hypertension.	Side effects were very severe.  I had to stop Abilify and increase my dosage of Lamictal.  The side effects completely abated after three days except for eye tremors which lasted about a week, hypertension lasted about another two weeks and then just plummet to normal.  Side effects first noticed at 10mg and then instantly severe at 15mg.	M	24	8  weeks	12/18/2006
5	Paranoid schizophrenia	The only side effects I noticed are a weight gain (40 lbs) and a slight case of insomnia (which could be the result of life stresses and not the medication).  The weight gain could be a result of the Risperdal I was taking in combination with the Abilify, not sure,  but stopped the Risperdal to see if I could lose a few pounds and remained stable on just the Ability (Don't tell my doctor). I have stopped gaining weight. I take the maximum dosage too, 30 MG. 	Since I started taking Abilify, I have the impetus to get up and out.  No other medication has had this effect. No delusions, hallucinations, voices or paranoia.  This is a great drug.	F	56	2  years	12/11/2006Email
2	Bipolar 2 hypomania	I cannot bear the side effects this drug has!  I Have no ability to THINK clearly on this med.  I am confused and retarded physically and mentally.  I am on disability, thank God! The only reason I am taking it currently is becasue I have been RX'd large doses of Prednisone )or a physical problem I have)which within 2 days made me totally manic! As fun as feeling hypomanic is, I didn't want to go over the top! So I reluctantly started taking abilify again during the steroidal treatment. I am in the taper down phase now of prednisone and abilify. I am looking forward to being on Trileptal alone again for treating my Bipolar disorder.	Since 1998 I had taken depakote and prozac, but then after gaining 80 lbs, I changed Doctors.  The new P-doc prx'd Abilify. I was unstable and had a lot of mixed states. I became all messed up---retarded, confused, irritable, sleep problems, inability to function in the medical field as a Sr. Veterinary Technician.  I needed meds to make me sleep and needed meds to wake me up...it was TERRIBLE.  My job performance was ridiculous.  The only reason I wasn't fired is that my boss and I had an understanding---and I was very very open about my BP. My Pdoc kept tweaking up the abilify and I got worse and worse. Finally, I decided he was a quack and I slowly tapered off ALL meds.  I became much better!  I was off meds for 18 mos before I cycled again and went back to the pdco to get treatment again.  I was relived he didn't force me to take abilify again until recently while I was taking steroids for another medical problem.  It knocks the heck out of any manic attack!  That is the one thing	F	42	6  months	12/10/2006
1	Bipolar Disorder II	Literally, I could not pee !  This drug was proscribed to "boost" the effects of other antidepressants, but did nothing at all aside from aggravate me.	Never would I take this medication again.....although, I have been told that I am like 1% of the 1% that have been recorded with this particular side effect.	M	38	1  months	11/13/2006
3	bipolar diagnosis after 25 yr lupus	extreme weight gain combination of depekote and ablilify  and trazadone for sleep severe depression and then slight stroke eight years ago. Lupus flair ups causes pain and not able to sleep i do not think i should have to take ablify medication for all these years, but want to decrease to 15 mg instead of 30 mg.  i went off the drug 18 months ago and ended up anxiety and panic striken and had to go to a week of health care around the clock to get back on medecine and then they added depekote because i was dizzy. during that stay at the help center i evened  out but they added a sleeping pill. I have no desire to do anything and if i let my mind get busy i start a lot of projects that make other family member crazy so it is best for me to  take several naps a day and stay calm. I eat compulsivley with out stopping to think about chewing and walk to the kithen to get a bite of food and would go back often if someone did not remind me not too.I do things in a hurry and shower half heart	has any one taken abilify as long as i have? over 2 years maybe three.and has any one mixed depekote that i have never had a seizure but they think this will control my bipolar actions. I think after my stroke and losing smell for 8 years.I visited a chiropractor last year and got my smell back, made my life a little better.  But i also take plaqenell, generic when my lupus flairs up and i have not had to take it the last three months. but someone said that they take celebrex for their lupus and i have always taken plaqeunell for the last 20 years when i have a flair up and i usually take it for three months untill symptoms subside. but i think when i went off the ablify on my own because of weight gain and being tired all the time is when it was really a bad week.  I was not rational at all and very anxious. enough that i wanted to go to institution and not ever come back home.  Said i would never go off the med again unless under a doctor that understood lupus and i was under 24	F	65	3  days	11/8/2006
5	Bipolar	None	Very good drug.   Feel more energetic than when taking risperdal.	M	51	5  days	10/25/2006
5	Tourettes Syndrome	Slight increase in hunger, Tired during the day-yet restless leading to a constant uncomfortable feeling. vomiting about 3 times a day. restlessness is pretty bad	Wow. this drug has cleared my Tourettes 99%!! My tics used to be severe and constant, now they are rare and minor.  I can't believe I finally found the drug. It's worth the side effects for me. I can now get back to being social and enjoy college life.Only downside is if you dont have Insurance it cost about 750 bucks per month.	M	21	30  days	10/11/2006Email
4	severe depression	Insomnia, tiredness	I have been on Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal and Lexapro for severe depression for a little over a year. Recently, I went off the Abilify for two weeks in an effort to decrease my medication (under my Psychiatrist's supervision, because I want to get pregnant) and immediately became depressed and suicidal. Now I have been back on the Abilify for a week and I feel 'normal' again. The main problem that I am experiencing is insomnia at night and lack of energy during the day. Overall, it has really helped to balance my severe depression.	F	29	1  years	10/1/2006
