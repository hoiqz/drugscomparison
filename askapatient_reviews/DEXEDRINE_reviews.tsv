4	ADHD/Idiopathic Hypersomnia/SleepAp	Inability to fall asleep (until 12 hrs after last dose), clenching of the jaw, and lack of appetite (until medication wears off).	However, although I have some improved focus, I have not experienced the improvement in short-term working memory that I experienced when I was briefly on a higher dose of Ritalin (90mg).  At that point I could hold on to my thoughts longs enough to let someone else talk, and not panic that I was going to forget what I was thinking.  I could also think a couple steps ahead in chess without losing my place.  This medicine, however, appears to be a middle-of-the-road for me (between Ritalin and Adderall).  After two months on this medicine, I still lack both the short-term memory benefits of a higher Ritalin dosage, as well as a sizable improvement in energy, as experienced on Adderall.  Im still hoping for some sizable improvements in these areas, but as of yet, they havent come in any markable quantities.Originally, the side-effects were the following: Inability to fall asleep (until 12 hrs after last dose), clenching of the jaw, and lack of appetite (until medication wears off).  Two months on the medication and the inability to sleep has dropped to around 7-8 hrs, I don't clench my jaw as much, and my appetite is returning.  Originally, the benefits included the following:  Dramatic reduction in mental fatigue, I quit (mostly) interrupting others, increased ability to tune out other stimuli when performing an activity, and a noticeable improvement of will power (when it came to sugary foods).  Two months after starting the medication,	M	42	2  months70mg (day) 3X D	4/3/2013
4	(See my comments below.)	Because my condition is very unique and fairly complicated, it would be inaccurate for me to characterize anything I have experienced as a side effect.  However, I will say this.  For the better part of the last 18 years I've taken either  "mixed salt" amphetamine tablets (Adderall: dextro & levo) or  "dextro only" amphetamine tablets (Dexedrine tablets: dextro only).   For the last 9 years I've only taken Dexedrine (Generic Brand: Dextrostat).  I will always be indebted to the person who posted a "Addreall vs Dexedrine" type of comment on one of the many sites I was using to try and identify individuals with a similar experience to my own.  This one comment would have a significant impact on my life in the years that followed.  This was the gist of the posted comment I read.  ...Most of the negative side effects experienced by people taking Addreall are believed to come from the "levo" side of the mixture (the left-handed amphetamine molecul	So here is my suggestion for anyone out there who has been taking Adderall for any length of time; and maybe you feel like you couldn't function without Adderall now, because it absolutely enables you to "do" what you couldn't "do" without it.  If you feel like there is a lot of other "crap" (for lack of a better word) you've had to manage, or tolerate, because you have just accepted that to get the good effects you have to put up with the bad effects, if this rings true for you, then I would encourage you to try just the dextro-amphetamine and see if you can't do even better than you're doing now.  (If you've ever heard of someone doing better on Focalin than they did on Ritalin, what I've written about here is exactly the same thing.  One notable difference is the fact that Dexedrine came out 40 years BEFORE Adderall, whereas Focalin was introduced roughly 40 years AFTER Ritalin.)  Now my last word, will be to say that I found I needed the same amount of Dexedrine as I did of Adderall.  This is contrary to what the chemists/mathematicians believe.  They say that 20mg of dextroamphetamine sulfate is more active than 20mg of dextro- and levo-amphetamine. (Think of the Adderall as being a little diluted.)  But according to MY BODY, "less" was not "more", "less" was just "less".   If you mention this in the beginning, maybe it won't be a big hurdle if you find that you need more than a "calculated eq	M	47	9  years60mg daily 9X D	8/15/2012Email

5	Adult ADHD, depression, weight loss	Jaw clenching, decreased sex drive, anxious when I dont have something to do, increased need for cigarettes. If I take it after 10AM I cant sleep the whole night	Dexadrine has made such a wonderful difference in my life, I actually have motivation! I get up and clean my house I can focus on my work no matter how tedious it is. I've been losing the weight I had put on with my depression which is a nice bonus. I feel the cons are worth putting up with because it has had such a great impact... I love being out and doing things now but I do feel that its good to take breaks from the pills at times, I do 3 weeks on and one off.		22	1  years20 1X D	4/16/2012
4	ADHD	at the start i had more energy then i ever had b4 in my life. i started to work out regularly and became really focused. i went from d's and c's to straight a''s. Then came the problems, jitters,insomnia, and a massive loss of appitite. for me the positive outweight the negaitve so i have learned to live with sleeping 2-3hrs a day for about 20+years. i must make myself eat because i know i should be hungry, and i try to sleep because i know that w/o sleep is a bad thing 2. After 20+years of meds i have anxiety, loss of appitite, social problems, acid reflux problems, i believe heart problems, "allthough not diagnosed", leg pains everyday, but .. I look great, have a good job and stay focused, have a great family and a super hot wife, you choose.	Im really not sure about longer effects then me but i am starting to feel worn out at times. Im last up and first up everyday. Hopefully i have enough steam in the engine to last another 35+years. lol oh wait i got dex that will do.	M	36	23  years15 1X D	3/20/2012Email
5	ADD/Weight loss	Heart beat increased a great deal, skin picking, anxiety,insomnia (if taken after noon), mood swings, social awkwardness, EXTREME weight loss, psychological problems such as tics, talking to myself and zoning out while doing so. This drug has terrible withdrawal effects such as chronic fatigue and depression. I couldn't get out of bed the whole week that I didn't take it.	The upside of this drug is that it helped me put my life back together and my depression decreased. I lost 20 pounds on the dexedrine spansules because it made me feel the urge to walk everywhere. The spansules last for a long time. Another upper about dexedrine is that after I started taking it I stopped having an urge to drink alcohol. At first I didn't seem "cracked" out on it but I'm starting to feel those effects more recently.	F	24	2  years30-40MG 1X D	2/27/2012Email
2	ADHD, depression, severe anxiety	Unpredictable drug. First time made me feel calm but tierd. Second pill gave me the jitters so stopped drinking caffeinated beverages which helped. After third time came the severe headaches and head pressure usually at end of day and nausea. The most disturbing was (in conjunction with headaches) a mush brain, became even more unfocused and groggy. I could barely keep my thoughts together. I may not be able to take this stuff.	A few good comments. Had more energy, did not oversleep, helped considerably with my depression more than any other drug I've taken.	F	40	2  weeks10 MG 3X W	1/30/2012Email
5	Severe ADHD, Anxiety, Depression	All of them lol. for example though increased heart rate, palipatations, mild increase in blood pressure,wierd taste, head pressure, pulsatile tinnitus, cold hands and feet, weight loss, increased sweating	Besides all the issues above this drug really has changed my life. I can function as a normal human now. I can remember and learn things with very little effort, I can keep in time for my drumming which I have always had problems with and actually memorize full songs, I work in mechanical and electrical design and went from almost previously giving up my career to being one of the best designers relative to my peers. Another big changed is socially, before I couldnt pay attention long enough to have a full conversation with people and now it's like I always have something to say. For me my quality of life went from a 2 to an 8 which i never would have thought possible a year ago.	M	22	6  months15 1X D	1/9/2012

5	narcolepsy		This drug gave me back my life. I was basically inert in a corner, sleeping. I could not function. On this drug, my daytime sleepiness has disappeared as has my hypnogogic dreaming and sleep paralysis. I wake and fall to sleep normally. I can be bored in meetings without upsetting folks by falling asleep. All these good comments are for the brand name. The generic was  useless.	F	56	31  years15 1X D	12/30/2011
5	Complex Sleep Apnea	For the first year, I had zero appetite and dropped a dress size.  After that, my appetite is back with a vengeance and I've gained the weight back.	If I am late in taking my second dose, coming down off this drug is tough. I get severely irritated and rage-y. However - This drug has really made a huge difference in my life. It helps so much with the EDS related to the sleep apnea.  I take it with provigil as well.	F	29	2  years10 2X D	11/4/2011Email

4	Idiopathic hypersomnia	Initially - headache (this went away within the first weeks of use). Now: dry mouth, need more water to stay hydrated, anxiety/panic attack when taken in conjunction with another stimulant such as caffeine (from a strong coffee/multiple cups of coffee). Taken at higher doses it impairs appetite.	This medication has turned my life around. I am now able to study and work (and drive!). I try to keep the dosage to a minimum and have regular breaks from it. It doesn't work consistently well each day (I'm not sure what this depends on), but it does a good enough job.

4	Treatment-resistent depression	Massive head pain like I've never had in my life. Every day to the point it interferes with my life.	This drug is so beneficial that I am willing to put up with the head pain. Nothing works better. I've tried every antidepressant on the market over the last 15 years. Thank gawd for this drug. Before I started taking it, I had NO desire to roll out of bed. I'd stay down for two weeks at a go. When I forget to refill the script on time, it's hard to get up and out the door to the pharmacy. It reminds me how lucky I am to find this medication. Funny enough, I think I must have a severe case of ADD as well. I can't stay focused on anything. I am better on this med, but I still suffer big time. Never realized it till I started reading signs and symptoms/posts by ADD peeps. I have every tell tale S&S in the book...and to the Nth degree.

4	ADD	Dexedrine might be worsening these problems, but for as long as I can remember (since I was a small child) I've had social anxiety, extreme anxiety about my appearance (always wear make-up just to feel "normal", etc.), debilitating anxiety when performing an unfamiliar task while someone is watching (I don't have a driver's license because of this), embarrassing anxiety about encountering spiders/bugs, anxiety when alone in dark places, etc. I over-think everything, worry, procrastinate, and talk myself out of things (my father does this also). I have some milder symptoms of OCD, but I did as a child as well. I initially lost weight on Dex, and with portion control and exercise I've pretty much maintained this healthy weight for 13 years. When I went off Dex for over 1 year in my early 20's, my ADHD was back in full force and focusing was impossible... the Dex definitely helps me focus but usually I can only focus on one step of one task at a time. It takes me a long time to	Big or small, everything I do takes me forever because while on the Dex my brain forces me to do things in a series of steps... what sucks is that it seems as though I am unable to efficiently problem solve, or figure out the quickest path from A to B. I become easily consumed by details. It can be extremely frustrating and hard on my self-esteem whenever I'm trying to get something done fast, because hard as I try, I am still not able to complete tasks as quickly as my husband or my peers (though when I do things, I always do them right... I never make mistakes or forget something like they often do). When I had gone off of Dex for over a year in my early 20's, the ADHD was back in full force and I was unable to focus at all... I always seemed to be doing 10 things at once, rarely ever completing anything. So the Dex doesn't make the ADHD go away, but it seems to give me enough focus to complete a task one step at a time... slowly.	F	29	13  years40MG span 1X D	8/28/2011
5	Narcolepsy, ADHD, low sex drive	NO APPETITE	My Psych. prescribed this to me because of Zoloft I had no sex drive and I am narcoleptic and would fall asleep while driving, riding in anything that moved, watching a movie (even if I really wanted to see it), reading, doing my homework, you name it. I couldnt concentrate either due to ADHD. This has worked wonders! I feel like what I suppose "normal" people feel like. I can stay awake for the whole day, focus on what I need to and have my libido back. The only drawback for me is that I am 5'2" and 106 lbs. I never eat very much anyway and I work out. I am rapidly losing weight and am a muscular 104lbs. I think it looks gross and I have to have a timer to remind me to eat. Being " too skinny" is no worse than being overweight. If you're not healthy, it doesn't matter what you look like. Just be aware of your eating habits on this medication.	F	37	1  years10 MG 1X D	7/30/2011Email
5	ADD, Depression	Trouble sleeping if I take after 2pm. Sometimes heart racing, which is made worse if I have not eaten.	This drug lets me function as a normal human being. 14 years ago when I started taking Dexedrine I was on the verge of failing out of college.  I started taking it in the summer and when I went back to school that fall I got straight A's. I have been on it ever since and could not function with out it. It is prescribed for ADD but it also helps with my depression. I just wish it was not so hard to re-fill. The only problem is that I need to make sure I take the second dose before 2pm or I will not sleep at night. Taking it around noon is usually best.	F	34	14  years40 MG 2X D	3/9/2011
4	Adult ADD	Insomnia, over-focused, less social, skin picking, heart palpatationsExtreme loss of appetite, dry mont,  bad breath	This drug does exactly what I want it to do except... with my social life. My main complaint is that I become irritable and feel apathetic about socializing. That said I get straight-As at College and become  very motivated. It helps my every level whith my child. But, by the end of the day. I'm exhausted	F	28	8  years15 MG 3X D	3/7/2011Email
4	ADD	Generic Barr Dexedrine feels very weak. If you take a lot of it, it feels stronger (duh lol), reason I mention it is because Adderall will cause more side effects, this will cause less of them. It is better in higher dosages, at least for me since I take the XR version. Taking L-Tyrosine as well for the comedowns. It is a very smooth feeling, so its almost unnoticeable. Side effects are minimal, but the effects are also not very strong. Great for mood lift, motivation goes away quickly for me, does not motivate anymore.	Adderall XR is better for me. Write a list of things to do for the day, it will drastically improve your life more than this drug will, but this drug can help that list! This is a very weak medication, it is like Eastern Medicine, except the side effects are more severe since you take them daily. What side effects? Insomnia can be one, but it isn't paradoxically low doses cause me to fall asleep. Appetite loss, but that goes away after a while, I don't lose my appetite anymore. OCD as well, but I am too lazy for that to be a problem. Procrastination occurs for me, I am supposed to be doing something else, but here I am, but that is a habit, not the drug's fault. Do something else besides take the drug, its like giving yourself a black box with no instructions, and the black box controls (overstatement, it modifies) your every thought and action. Everyday use will disable you when you stop, you will be tired, unmotivated and very depressed. Namenda/Memantine will help you if you grow too tolerant, as well DXM, the cough syrup. This is worth looking into, Vyvanse is more likely to be prescribed.	M	20	7  months15-30 1X D	2/12/2011
4	Daytime Sleepiness	Get cranky/ bitchy/agitated when it wears off. 10mg crash= despair!! :-/	I think it's too early to really rate this drug... but so far it's been pretty good. I am sleepy all the time. I pretty much stopped living my life because of it. I couldn't go to the theater for a movie after 8PM. Stopped hanging out at friends because I would fall asleep on the couch. Stayed away from lazy boys and comfy couches and sat on bar stools. Sex? I would fall asleep, wake up in the middle of the night for sex and fall right to sleep afterwards. Once the sun goes down, so do I. Driving was more of an autopilot response. Sometimes I'd get to my destination without really realizing it or I would miss my exit for work. BAD! So, after my MSLT revealed a sleep latency of 3 minutes after almost perfect sleep, stimulants were added to my regime. I take 5mg in the morning and another 5mg as needed. I only take the 2nd dose if I actually have plans. If not, what's the point of being awake?! :). 5mg is low, but it works MOST of the time (which is why i rated a 4). If I wake up excessively excessively tired, I'll take 10mg. But 10mg means a harder crash and a feeling of hopelessness which is why I don't want to increase my dosage (but I've been thinking about adding a 3 pill a day to help the crash). 5mg opens my eyes. I still have really low energy because I've been sleep deprived for a long time so it's going to take a lot more to get my energy up- lifestyle wise, not drug wise. So it doesn't really help me mega-focus or give me crazy energy. Yes I feel a little kick once	F	26	2  months5mg 2X D	2/6/2011Email

2	ADHD	Common Side-Effects: Diminished appetite, minor  insomnia, chronic fatigue, minor OCD-like compulsions, withdrawal fatigue & irritability, increased anxiety, completely lethargic & useless without it.Serious effect, but rare: Severe Depression, hopelessness, feeling out of body, feelings that I do not know when I last truely lived in the moment, feeling like like a ghost, Suicidal ideation (this issue lasted for about two month, but I have been good for 2 years), lethargy, Complete loss of appetite when resuming dosage, increased sexual drive, sexual compulsion and short lived but severe addiction. 	I have been prescribed Dexedrine for nine years. Prior to that I was on Ritalin but I was taken off after experiencing auditory hallucinations, anxiety & paranoia. Late high school I became extremely addicted, the less sleep I got the more I took and the more I took... vicious cycle. By the end of grade 11 I was only sleeping 45 minutes to 3 hours a night, I would usually need to take a double or triple dose to remain functional. At the worst when I was sleep on an hour or two a night I would dose before sleeping so I would wake up when I needed to.  After High-school and university (did not complete), I attempted to get off it, I was off for two years but then I started working in an office environment where I realized I could not function. I resumed my prescription. I have been much more responsible for my dosing, this resulted in less severe side effects. Since I have resumed though temporary OCD like compulsion occasionally develop and I have overcome most of the social life I lost after resuming I have noticed that I am getting less and less of an effect from it though, but I do not with to increase my dose although my professional and home life is suffering. I would like to say that while I would like nothing more than to get off this drug. For all the things I hate about it, without it I could not function. I would jump at the opportunity to try a drug-free alternative. But I do not know where to start.I feel like a zombie, but I feel like I trapped.	M	25	9  years30 mg 1X D	8/28/2010Email

5	Adult ADD	Loss of appetite, excess sweating, increased need for water, occasional muscle spasms.  Effects are increased depending on how much food I've had, and there's a strange combination with caffeine which makes me sleepy.	For me, this was basically a miracle cure.  I went through much of my life without an ability to concentrate, but I also mostly didn't need to concentrate either.  I don't get hyper, so I picked jobs which didn't require much out of me.  I was uncomfortable and bored most of the time but didn't know what to do.  I then started university and found I actually had to be able to concentrate, and after 4 years of unsuccessfully trying to write a thesis I decided to seek help.  I was initially prescribed Ritalin but its effects were not controlled (some days I got anxiety, other days I felt like I had no effect) so I switched to Dexedrine. After doing so, I wrote a 120 page thesis in 3 weeks, and have since achieved so many goals, and have really succeeded in my life and career. This was a life changing drug for me, and I'm really grateful.	M	30	1  years10 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Adult ADHD	Some insomnia, more as I've aged; grinding of teeth; decreased appetite initially but effect diminished over time, now obese.	Ritalin initially but after a couple of years changed to Dexedrine 10mg and then to 15mg spansules which are time release. Prefer name brand but without insurance now can only afford generic. I did notice a drop off in efficacy. Found medication to be MORE than a night and day difference. Heck, before medication, I couldn't even understand analogies. Went from nearly two dozen NDEs (near death experiences) from car crashes, thrill seeking behavior, self medicating aka substance abuse and nearly divorced to soon will celebrate my 29th anniversary!

5	Adult ADD	Before starting Dexedrine, I would fall asleep in movies, operas, driving!, while walking. Dexedrine keeps me alert. I put this as a side effect because it was prescribed for A ADD. I still have no trouble falling asleep, but I can stay awake even during boring meetings. For the last 3 years I've been waking up several times a night, but that is getting better now. I lost some weight when I started, but I was still enjoying food. No other side effects. I'm not hyper or agitated, I just feel normal. No withdrawal when I stop taking it either. The lack of withdrawal is actually a problem when I forget my dosage. I'll discover that I've accomplished absolutely nothing at the end of the day.	Dex, along with Welbutrin, some coaching I had, and a much better understanding of ADD and coping methods, have made a huge difference since my diagnosis 7 years ago.I still procrastinate somewhat, so occasionally I abuse Dex by continuing to take 15mg/4 hours to allow me to stay up all night and meet a deadline. I can only do that very infrequently without getting messed up.I know this drug isn't for all ADD sufferers, but it's great for me and my daughter too. I found that Ritalin had no effect on me. Adderall didn't work for my daughter.	M	50	7  years30-45mg 1X D	3/4/2010Email

Well instead of having tons and tons of new hobbies (basically i was always very impulsive) I'm now a complete workaholic stressed spaz.  I forgot to take my afternoon meds and had a complete meltdown over a hard drive quiting mid movie.  It took my fiance 30 minutes to talk me down.   Later I gave some clear instructions to a friend regarding a task i needed him to do for me...he could not complete it, so i sent a super nasty text message.

4	narcolepsy andrefractory depression	Some bruxism, especially when the dose was increased. If I take the medication even an hour too early I can get a little irritable. Aside from that no problems at all.	I was first on Adderall, then Adderall XR (60 mg/day), both helped but Dexedrine has been better with fewer side effects. I might end up going to 60 of Dexedrine but I would rather stay at 45 mg even though my symptoms are not completely controlled.	M	21	9  months15 mg ER 3X D	2/9/2010
4	Adult ADHD	Insomnia which sometimes can be helpful, slight hallucinations (minor twitches in peripheral vision, etc) but I had that with adderall too, it is rare I guess. The side effects are much more mild than those of adderall even when you convert the doses. Best part is that I didn't lose my appetite, since I'm trying to gain weight.	I guess I have ADHD pretty badly, I somehow got by in school without medication. In my experience dexedrine keeps me mentally awake but still doesn't help my ability to focus after taking even 45mg a day. It hasn't helped my reading rate as much as I had hoped, I still average 5-10 pages in a textbook an hour which sucks because I'm in good shape to get accepted to medical school where there will be a lot more reading. A friend of mine ran out of her adderall during Midterms week so I let her borrow some of my dexedrine, she had 20mg of Adderall XR which is about 30mg of dexedrine. After taking two of my dexedrine she had said that she felt it was too powerful so my dose just may not be high enough.	M	20	4  months	11/17/2009
3	ADHD	None	I've taken dexedrine for about a year now. not as helpful as adderall xr, but still okay. i took the 15 mg spansules twice a day. my concentration was better, but still very impulsive and whatnot. i was taking it cause it was cheaper than adderall.	F	24	1  years	11/12/2009

5	ADD	insomnia if taken after 1 p.m.; diminished appetite; increased energy	generics give me migraines; during the first years I increased the amount periodically but now I've reduced it because of my blood pressure, blurry vision (may not be related) and I suspect I'm allergic; effectiveness declined over the years but I have been able to make permanent positive changes in my life; I don't change my prescribed dosage; my doctor is always supportive; it reduced my fear of prople and increased focus, self assurance, ability to comprehend what I read, ability to type and write without constant errors	F	60	16  years	11/1/2009
5	ADD	Loss of appetite, allergic reaction, minor problems sleeping, slight headache	I was on this medication for about a week.  I had switched over from Concerta, because the price was way less, and seeing as I don't have real insurance, it was a life saver.  The first time I took it, I became very talkative, but after that first day the side effects mostly wore off (except for the suppressed appetite, which was a bit hard to fight against).  What it did for my concentration and attitude was AMAZING.  I felt wonderful, was able to focus on my school work, able to get things done, and all the associated symptoms of ADD that are so hard to control for me (such as impulse control) were just...fixed.  But after a few days, I wound up getting a fever, rash, and wheezing, and it turned out that I was allergic to it.  They use a certain dye in the making of it that I have a bad reaction to, and I wish I could find this medication without that dye.  This worked a million times better than Concerta, was super inexpensive, and I wish that I could have continued to take it!  It improved my mood, my behavior, my concentration - just all around, it was great.  Maybe the effects wouldn't have been as nice had I been on it longer, but this is definitely something I wish I could have stuck with.	F	22	1  weeks	10/4/2009
5	ADD Inattentive + Depression	Upset stomach at night, loss of appetite (great)	Have suffered depression for about 5+ years tried all AD's, work off and on, make me lazy and fat - so adding dexedrine has been great - feet inspired and calmer and my memory is coming back (couldn't remember what happened 5 minutes ago).  Have got lots of jobs that have been waiting years to get to.  Am listening and waiting my turn.  Was just diagnosed with Adult ADD - which explained alot of lifelong issues - so it has helped with both problems.	F	48	16  days	9/17/2009Email
4	Adult ADHD	At first, I had some appetite suppression and diarrhea but those have gone away.  I still have some dizziness and sleep issues but not nearly as bad as they were before. I do get a bit of a racing heartbeat for a good chunk of the day but I am able to sit still.	I still have trouble determining if this is working for me but I think it is.  I tried 30mg today and seems to be a good dose. Will see what happens when I don't take it tomorrow. Hope I don't have to go higher.  I notice a slowing down in my movements and my thoughts (long enough to think before speaking).  Dexedrine also helps me relax.  Interesting how this works.  There's still so much I don't understand.

5	Daytime Hypersomnelence	Insominia if taken too late in the day	I have been on dexedrine for 17 years.  It has saved my life, but now I'm afraid if the doctor takes me off of it, I will be severely depressed.  Also, I'm in a new relationship and I think it causes a low libido.	F	61	17  years	6/24/2009Email
3	Narcolepsy/CNS hypersomnia	Dry Mouth, Dizziness, Headaches, nausea, some numbness and tingling, Debilitaing fatigue with missed dosage and the increased tolerance of medication, recent changes in dental health due to side affects of medication	Works great but may have negative long term affects. Began taking this medicaton in 2002, was grateful because other medications had not worked for me. Increased my alertness & energy levels & I was able to maintain my focus and attention. I was on 60 mg of dexedrine a day, slow release. The benefits far out weighed the side affects until 2007 when the side affects became too difficult to manage. I was weened off the medication for a few months but my fatique without the medication was debilitating so I went back on 15 mg a day. I have been able to function at this dosage for almost 2 years but am now stuggling with severe fatigue even on the medication.  I want to increase my dosage to address the fatigue but the side affects are no longer managable even at 15 mg especially with this recent development with my teeth. I developed additional health issues as well. It appears that although I strictly adhere to my dosage, this medication still has an addictive affect on my body and is causng some additional health issues.	F	42	7  years	5/26/2009
5	Adult ADD	When first getting used to medication I got the jitters and a slight headache.	I was on dexedrine for 6 years with great improvement in my focus and attetion, and without having to increase my dosage. I finished college and began a career with the help of this medication. Recently, with a new Dr. I was switched to Vyvanse. He said it was smoother when taking effect and wearing off. Honestly, I am sure that it helped for the past 7 months that I took it, but it is SOOOO expensive and I feel that I did better on dexedrine. I am now back on dexedrine, having switched my Dr. and it is better than the Vyvanse. I am more focused and attentive on dexedrine.	F	37	7  years	5/25/2009

5	ADD (primarily inattentive type)	jittery, periodic anxiety if I take too much, suppressed appetite,	Works wonders for my ability to concentrate and get things done. I feel I am able to reach my full potential with it. I am on 15 mg once a day but I would like to be only 10mg as I feel with 15mg I get too anxious at times. Switched from Ritalin. Dexedrine has been much better to me. The effects are much more level and sustained than Ritalin. Only have to take one spansule a day. Never have experienced withdrawal when I've missed doses. I am able to express myself appropriately and control my impulses. Without it I am scattered and frustrated person as ADD makes it hard focus your attention and organize thoughts. Its hard to make people understand what your thinking/feeling when so many thoughts are buzzing through you at once. I am thankful for this medication.	M	25	9  years	2/14/2009
4	Sleep disorder	Worsening of pre-existing arrhythmia (tachycardia), periods of agitation, irritability, decreased frustration tolerance, extreme somnolence if I go off it even for a day.	It's the best treatment I've had since Ritalin pooped out on me so I need to tolerate the side effects.	F	39	3  years	8/26/2008
4	ADD/Depression	jittery, mild stomach irritation (diahrrea), great capacity to focus, improved comprehension, **weight loss.	this is a great med for ppl experiencing ADD symptoms and depression, as it allows you to focus in addition to providing useful energy to combat the lethargy of depression. i am a full time university student, and the depression was crippling. not being able to read a single page when weekly readings number up to 350 pages per week was inhibiting my academic performance to the extent i was considering a medical withdrawal in accordance with my psychiatrist. however, i also have a history of eating disorder, and this med encouraged my disorder as it precipitated weight loss. those with weight issues should fully disclose this to their dr. this med got me out of bed, back into working out and being more healthy despite its potential danger to be abused. it must be carefully monitored, as addiction to amphetamines is common. for me, dex improved attention and allowed me to finish my semester. i have energy to workout and the drive to stay healthy, yet this could EASILY be abused by those	F	23	3  months	6/6/2008
5	ADHD	Sometimes when I am busy and someone talks to me, it really really bothers me.	I think this is the best adhd medication period. I tried them all. Hated them all too. I was always encouraged to take my meds and I literally hated the feeling adderrall and ritalin, concerta amonf others gave me. Now each drug varied in its reaction to CNS. I take my dexedrine 5mg IR when I wake up and I am a laser beam all day. ALL DAY. My prescription is for 15mg IR twice daily. I dont even take it. I was taking 20mg of adderrall and ritalin. I have no side effects that are bad either. I would say it makes me very logical, and focused. Small dose too! Love it love it love it love it love it! LOVE IT!	F	22	6  months	5/29/2008
5	Adult ADHD	-Minor headaches after ~12 hours (about 1.5 half-lives for the  slow-release version I think). Not usually noticable.-Subtle increase in motor tics (nail biting, teeth clenching), again concurrent with sleep deprivation.-Subtle personality effects. I don't feel like I'm running higher stress, but I'm less distractable than I'd LIKE to be during my free time. I think my sense of humor suffers a bit also.-Thankfully I have NOT suffered any sexual side effects. Being young and newly married, I was quite apprehensive about this!	Overall I'm pleased with the results. Getting some sort of prescription was a must for me, as I literally had a 15 minute attention span. In a lecture, for example, I was physically unable to take reliable notes beyond about 20 minutes in. Dexedrine allows me to focus for as long as I need to.If you actually have ADD (and I do), forget about using this drug as a stimulant. It doesn't seem to have that effect on me, or others I know who are taking it. I can take two and go to sleep if the mood strikes me.I don't take Dexedrine on the the weekends, as I have no need for the extra focussing power then, and I don't get bad withdrawl symptoms.If you have Tourette's-like tics, Dexedrine will make them worse and you will be unhappy. Unfortunately this won't reverse when you stop taking Dexedrine. If you have minor "habbits" like nail biting, be conscious of them, and make sure you're not picking your nose in public!

5	ADHD	Insomnia, loss of appetite, anxiety/nervousness, anti-social behavior.  When medication is stopped I become ravenously hungry, lethargic to the point of being unable to move, and sleep all day.	This drug is a double edged sword.  I think it just comes down to one question, is it worth it?  The side effects can be managed although I find the only way I am able to fall asleep (and wake up in the morning)is by smoking small amounts of marijuana before bed.  I also resort to marijuana when I get intense hunger pains yet am unable to eat.  Dexedrine affects my appetite by making all food unappealing to me, I find myself trying to eat but just holding food in my mouth, never able to actually swallow it.  On the plus side, because of Dexedrine I completed a University degree, got an amazing job, and am a far better mother than I was when I was not on it.  I'm sure that my life would fall apart without it...so I cope with the side effects.  My opinion-it affects everyone differently if you can't handle it, then don't take it.

1	add	This stuff sucks... and I have also taken adderall and concerta, which either would be better. I felt completely disconnected, numbness, tingly sensation in left arm. Rapid heartbeat, floaty, not on earth feeling coupled with confusion. friends said i was acting really loopy and MORE scatterbrained.	so this stuff is supposed to be like aderall or concerta with a more calming effect, which is what I needed. NOT the case, it made me feel like i was on the verge of a heart attack. confused, numbness in my arm,focus was so messed up, I had to "remind" myself i was driving! I felt like I was tripping in a bad way.When i took adderall, I was superwoman, I got a lot done, but was acting like a meth freak, which is why I stopped taking it, (I was worried what it was doing to my body). I took Concerta for a long time after that, it works great! I recommend it over this. Only thing is, I was up to 36mg a day and decided to take it only when I felt like it, which wasn't a good idea, because I got more heart tightness, rapid beating, sweating, and hard to sleep when taking irregularly. But if you taper up and take it consistently, concerta can be your BFF.... I had no problem stopping it except for slight headache. even though it made me a lil shaky and heart tightness at times,	F	31	1  days	2/19/2008

However- I became VERY dependant on it.

1	ADHD	Headaches, shakiness, extreme insomnia, no sex drive, paranoia, antisocial tendencies, obsessiveness over repetitive tasks, suicidal thoughts, feelings of invincibility, aggressiveness	I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 8, and I've been on this drug ever since. After 11 years on it, I have extreme withdrawals when I run out and forget to refill my prescription. I've contemplated killing myself or someone else over stupid things like dirty dishes. I have no desire to be social, and I'm told that I act like "a tweaker" constantly. Sure, I can crank out 3,000 word essays in 4 hours when I take it later in the day, but then I'll be up until 5am. I usually get 3-5 hours of sleep a night. This drug is EXTREMELY dangerous, and it will become your life. I don't even know who I am naturally, because I'm always on it. I recommend not taking it unless you have a severe disorder. After growing up under the influence of this drug, I feel like I've been robbed of a normal childhood. DO NOT give this to your children. Robbing children of any creativity and impulsiveness in order to "fix" overactive minds is not worth the suffering of trying to get off this dru	F	19	11  years	12/17/2007Email
5	ADD & Narcolespy	depression,loss of apetite, anti social behavior	After taking Dexedrine for 20 years now I've become used to the negative side affects and have learned ways of controling them as well as ways to keep the doses low while not lossing the drugs positive affects. The only thing I will warn of is after taking this drug for a long time you notice that no matter what dose you take the motivational aspect deminishes and after about 3 years you no longer can get SELF motivated. I have gone all the way up to 60mg twice a day(4hour pills) with no motivation still. I started a cardio detox to help bring down my tolerance and after 3 months of 2hours of fast cardio workouts every night(runninig on a tread mill 8 miles)I am now able to get the old effects and motivation, euphoria feelings back with just 10mg taken twice a day.

3	ADD	Depression, suicidal thoughts and wishes, fear	I was diagnosed with ADD (back when it was called hyperactivity disorder) at the age of 6 1/2 and put on dexadrine. Very strange things started to happen. My preformance in school did improve, but I started having bouts of serious depression. I became suicidal at times. In the mornings after taking the dex I would feel nervous, though alert and unusually focused, but rarely if ever "High." By afternoon I would start feeling overwhelmingly sad, often without any cause. In many cases I had suicidal thoughts. When I was 9 the dose was upped from 10 to 20 mg, and the side effects became stranger. I started feeling like I was being watched all the time, and often checked closets and doors to make sure no one was there. Most of the time I knew it was absurd to think I was being watched, but I couldn't get over the feeling. Now, I know that monsters under the bed is a frequent problem with 6 year olds, but it kept going with me until I stopped taking the dex. Fears of monsters gave	M	36	9  years	10/19/2007

I felt "normal" for the first time in a LONG time. I took every psy drug on the planet. Dextroamphetamine is the best! HOWEVER, withdraw effects are HORRIFIC to say the least.  Severity depends on how much and how long you took the drug for. I had been on Dextro for 6-8 months and final dose was 30mg once a day.  I had to stop suddenly for a week and for 2-3 days I had severe depression, anxeity, mood swings, felt suicidal.  Once I found out why I felt so bad that changed my thinking so I lost the suicidal thoughts. Now I know why people who are severly depressed kill themselves.  If I had to live with how I felt for 2-3 days due to Dextro withdraw every day I would kill myself for sure. No doubt about it. Pure HELL...	M	34	8  months	9/20/2007Email

I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness.

We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds.

Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email
1	depression/anxiety	severe muscle weakness, tremors that have yet to stop 2 months in, not sleeping, pacing		M	44	5  days5mg 1X D	9/19/2011
1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email
1	depression	i would studder sweat like crazy eye twitching hyperactive cry for no reason heart pounding out my chest really high blood pressure pass out from panic attacks insomia talk really fast umm flame up inside theres more thid pill sucks i thought i was going to die		M	31	 30mg 1X D	8/25/2011Email
5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!	M	37	21  days10 1X D	2/24/2011Email
5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
