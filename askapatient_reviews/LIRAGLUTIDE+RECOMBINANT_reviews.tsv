Ended with intense nausea, vomiting and dry heaves.	Stopped using Victoza.  Do not use this product.Further research revealed increased cancer risk.

1	Enhance Kombiglyze Effects	Diagnosed Severe Pancreatitis and he stopped the Victoza injections immediately.   Started out with a lot of burping, then diarrhea, nausea vomiting.  Like others, food would not digest, just sit in my stomach and rot until I threw up.  Had to get anti-nausea meds so my body could be fed.	The product worked well and I did lose weight.

5	Diabetes 2	Nauseus feeling first two days right after taking med, light headache,very mild stomach cramps first few days	I LOVE this med so far! I am taking it along with metaforim. I have been diabetic 2 for over 10 years and just the metaforim only was not working lately. The weight loss effect is an added plus! I have lost 9 lbs in 10 days! I started at .6 for a week and then upped it per doctor to 1.2  I have no appetite which is awesome! And I am getting my energy back!	F	52	12  days1.2 mg 1X D	12/15/2012
4	Diabetes	Painful headaches, nausea, diarreha, the medicine does help but the side effects are not worth it. I did the slow intake of the dosages starting at .6 and moving up every two weeks. the headaches grow in pain.		F	40	10  months1.8 1X D	11/20/2012
4	weight loss	diarhrrea, stomachache.  weight loss   5 lbs in 1 week. : )		F	31	1  weeks1.2	10/14/2012
1	Type 2 Diabetes	I developed severe stomach pain followed by nausea and then vomiting and diarrhea at the same time.  The rest of the time I would have severe constipation.  The palms of my hands would become very red, my mouth would get very dry and I could feel the ridges in the top of my mouth. My first episode began on the third day of taking the Victoza, and I had approx. 1 episode a week until I stopped taking it.	My first episode required a visit to the ER and another visit  the paramedics were called. That was the first time I had ever been to an ER or had the paramedics called. Subsequent episodes would leave me unable to work the rest of the day.	F	67	90  days 1X D	9/25/2012Email
5	glucose intolerance/prediabetes	Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches, migraine (usually not all at the same time, thankfully)	I started at loading dose of .6 for several days, then went up to 1.2 which was a bad idea because I got very ill with vomiting and diarrhea , also some muscle cramping in the backs of my legs and even got a terrible migraine. Backed down to .6 and symptoms left. Now I go up a click every few days, working my way up to my prescribed dose of 1.2. Currently on .9 dosage. I lost 10 pounds initially but have not lost any more weight even though I hardly eat at all, I'm just not hungry. I feel more energy than I have for a while so I am quite happy with the drug, but the cost is prohibitive.	F	52	3  weeks1.2 1X D	9/15/2012
5	DMT2	severe diarhea and gass for a week, which my dr says was most likely from the crossover from metrformin to the 1.2 does of victoza. glucose elevels immediately stablized. nausea, tenderness and slight headache continued for a while longer after diarhea stopped. now everything is okay, with slight constipation from time to time.	really works predictably and well, though the first 2-3 weeks were tough. of course regulating your diet is extremely important, especially re fiber consumption. i'm so happy not to be taking metformin, which really didn't work for me, and also gave me very painful/unpredicatble stomach problems.	M	48	12  months1.2 1X D	8/12/2012Email
1	diabetes	Fatigue, nausea,  severe headaches,unable to do daily work, cramps, diarrhea.	Why on earth would the FDA approve a drug that causes CANCER in rats and mice?  And, even more puzzling, why would a physician prescribe a druge that causes CANCER?	M	64	14  days1.2 1X D	8/4/2012
1	Type II Deabetes	Debilitating nausea, vomiting, extreme fatigue. I had a Lap Band, and thought that my symptoms were from that, so eventually I had the Lap Band removed. In the recovery phase from removing the Lap Band, the symptoms intensified greatly. Food made me very nauseated, and I could hardly make it through a day at work.  Then I ran out of the needles for injecting Victoza, and the next day I was much better.  Got needles, took Victoza and the following day I was back to feeling rotten.  So I stayed off the Victoza over the weekend, again felt much better.  Saw MD, switched to another antidiabetic medication and have had no further symptoms!	Victoza, along with Metformin and diet, exercise, did help keep my HbA1c lower, and I was blaming the nausea and often vomiting on the lap band.  I did lose some weight while taking the Victoza, but at the cost of being completely miserable most of the time.  I wonder if I would have needed to have the lap band removed had I discovered this adverse effect of the Victoza sooner?  I guess I will never know.  I would like to emphasize that for me, the nausea and fatigue were not just annoying, they were life altering.  The side effects were often debilitating, and once I stopped taking the Victoza, the relief was amazing.  I realize that the company might say that it was the Lap Band causing the side effects, and that is what I thought, and why I had it removed.  But the symptoms continued unabated, in fact worsened as I was recovering from the surgery, and did not abate until I stopped taking the Victoza.	F	63	2  years 1X D	6/16/2012
5	control blood sugars	the first day I experienced irregular heartbeat about 4 hours after the dose. This lasted till 5am the next day. I took magnesium and havent had that problem since. Day 3 I ate my "usual" amount for breakfast, and later was nauseated, and later had diarrhea, but when not eating my habitual amount I am fine. Today day 5 had a snack in the morning of cashews, and almonds, and about 45 min. later was shaking from low Blood Sugar. Still taking a low dose of Metaglip (metformin and glipizide) which "kicks" the pancreas to produce all day.  Hope to soon get off the glipizide. So far getting used to not wanting to eat as much. very excited about the results so far. minimal side effects!	I would recommend to try this drug. for me it has been great so far!	M	50	5  days.6 1X D	6/7/2012Email
4	diabetes type 2	Bad upset stomach from the morning of the 2nd day. On 3rd day seem to be easing up. Blood sugar level was the same on 8mmol/l the 2nd day but dropped to 7.5mmol/l the 3rd day. I guess it is still very early days and got to get over the side effects however hope this will not be a recurring thing as I hate having an upset stomach. I have heard and read great reports from using Victoza including from my doctor and phamacist. Looking forward to the results for reduction in blood glucost level but especially in weight loss. Main aim for weight loss is due to sleep apnea.		M	41	2  days0.6 mg	4/26/2012
5	Type 2 Diabetes	First week I felt a lot of fatigue. But after that things are perfect.  I have lost 29 pounds in 6 weeks. No appetite. No sugar cravings. Overall fabulous drug!		F	41	6  weeks1.8	4/15/2012
5	Type 2 Diabetes	Some headaches but can possible be blamed on other causes i.e. allergies, stress, etc.  No stomach problems.	Really helps control my hunger.  Have lost 25 lbs so far.  Love Victoza except for the cost.  OUCH!	F	62	1  years1.8 1X D	4/12/2012Email
1	Type 2 Diabetic	Have indigestion but not bad.  When I raised the dosage to 1.2 I started having stomach cramping and diarrhea.  I have called Victoza and they are clueless.  They are of no help.  They claim they have not studied people that have diarrhea and therefore have no info about it.  Victoza is not working alone for me but along with my insulin I do have good sugars but the side effects to me are not worth it.	Not impressed with the company and no one seems to want to try to talk to you.  They are paying a lot of people for nothing.	F	66	30  days1.2 1X D	3/28/2012
5	Lower blood sugar	Little tummy pains nothing excruciating. However; I'm wondering if Victoza causes problems with your menstrual cycle. I am due for my period amd having all the symptoms of being on my period but i have still not started.		F	48	1  days1 X daily	3/20/2012Email
4	type 2	headaches; wicked abdominal pain; N/D; some weight loss; sugars are the best they've been in years.  I need to figure out if the side effects are worth the EXCRUCIATING pain!	I REALLY hope I can stick with this.  It's the first thing that's worked for me in years.	F	45	1  months 1X D	2/6/2012Email
4	Type 2 diabetes/weight loss	So far, no nausea, no headaches.  A little tummy trouble.  Biggest complaint so far is this HORRIBLE taste in my mouth!  Use mouthwash, brush teeth, bad taste always comes back.  Weird...	So far (only 4 days in) I definately notice a difference in my urge to snack.  Will keep using the med, but if anyone has any advice on getting the bad taste out, let me know!	F	37	4  days0.6-1.2 1X D	1/22/2012Email
4	PCOS	Vomiting, nausea, extreme headaches	Although it is the first drug that has helped me be able to lose weight, the side effects are awful. I have been taking it 2 months and still manage to vomit at least 3 times a week. On the bright side, it does work and I have lost 15 lbs. Just rough side effects.	F	23	2  months1.8 1X D	1/20/2012
5	Type 2 Diabetes	Severe nausea and acid re flux like symptoms first 3 week with severe fatigue.   But well worth the pain now.	Blood sugar before startin Victoza average 300 to 480 with taking 2 types of insulin 3 time a day. Blood sugar after starting Victoza on 06/09/2011 now averages 70 to 140.  Awesome.   My weight on 06/09/2011 was 325.  Now after Victoza my weight is 246 as of 1201702011.   I have seen concerns from many on here about thyroid cancer that was seen in lab rats .  Please note that the lab rats were given a dosage 10 times greater than the maximum human dose of 1.8.   No tyroid cancer was seen in the ape study , and non have been reported by humans as of today.   For me the benefits have outweighed the risk !     I will continue Victoza ..   Heaven sent for me.	M	46	6  months1.8 1X D	12/17/2011Email
4	Better BG control.  Weight loss	Loss of appetite	Finally a drug that helps.  I have reduced my insulin  from 50 of Lantus to 24.  My NovoRapid by 50%  I have lost 10 pounds and my blood sugar iss great and quite predictable.  Makes a great change from chasing highs and lows.  I had been on Byetta for 2 months prior but it did not help at all.	F	69	1  months1.2 1X D	12/7/2011Email
1	type 2 weight loss	I had only taken 1 dose in the am and later in the evening experienced nausea.	I am very concerned about the information of victoza that it can cause thyroid tumors and cancer what the insert has said about this medication tested on mice. However, it said its still unknown about its  effects on human studys, but clearly states it can cause pancreatic problems in humans. I beleive even though the FDA has approved this drug, i think its not safe to take this drug yet because of those risks involved. Sorry FDA, but i have quit taking this drug after i have read this information.	M	48	  1X D	11/5/2011Email
3	High bed time glucose readings	At .6 dosage had slight headache and mild nausea..totally tolerableAt 1.2 dosage have gas, fould smelling belching, noisy stomach and rotten breath.  I know this slows down the absorbtion of food in the stomach but I feel like the food is just laying there rottening. I am still having morning lows in the 70s but my bed time numbers have come down to low 100's compared to low 200s.	I will try to stick this out for a couple more weeks as other posts have mentioned the symptoms lessening and I would love to have some weight loss.  If they don't then I will have to stop this drug.  The foul smell and rumbling stomach is really embarrassing!	F	48	18  days1.2 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Type 2 Diabetes	Severe stomach pain, stomach spasms, nausea, diarrhea, headache, esophageal spasms and slight loss of weight.	This drug is not worth the pain you have to go through again and again just to lose a few pounds.	F	47	16  months1.8 1X D	9/19/2011Email
5	Diabetes	Loss of appetite, Headache, nausea, tiredness.	Works wonders for me. Started June 9th 2011.Lost 49 lbs in 3.5 months.Stopped all insulin injections first week. BG was 340 to 400 with insulin injections before victoza. After Victoza BG is 89 to 120. Heaven sent for me.

5	Diabetic	None	Works wonderful!!! Lost 22 pounds so far and have been using it   5 months now.  Would recomend to anyone to give it a try. My A1C went from 9.9 to 7.3 the first 3 months.	F	58	  1X D	8/17/2011
2	Type 2 Diabetter	Severe nausea; diarrhea; stomach pain.	I switched to Victoza from Janumet with hopes of achieving better HgA1C control (mine had been running approx 7.0-7.1).  At my first 3 month check up with my MD after the switch to Victoza, my A1C had risen to 7.7. I asked to stop the med since my quality of life was suffering (ex: constant N/D> immediately having to run to the bathroom after eating a meal). He asked me to continue taking Victoza for another 3 months to see if things improved.  The side effects seemed to improve somewhat; but I would still get occasional nausea and diarrhea, plus also these occasional sharp shooting pains and discomfort in my upper abdominal region. In addition, my weight increased by several pound.  At my next 3 month check up, my A1C had risen even higher to 8.5.  At that time, I asked my MD if we could stop it and and restart the Janumet. He agreed.   Victoza did not work for me at all.	F	56	6  months1.2 1X D	8/8/2011Email
5	TO CONTROL BLOOD SUGARS/REDUCE WEIGHT		LOVE THIS DRUG...NO SIDE AFFECTS AT ALL,IT HASWORKED FOR ME BETTER THEN ANY OTHER DIETS/MEDSI HAVE EVER TAKEN...I WAS SCEPTICAL TO USE AT FIRST BECAUSE OF ALL THENEGATIVE COMMENTS,HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS DRUG FOR ME..........THANKS VICTOZA I HAVE LOST 25# IN ONLY 28 DAYSTHE DOCTORS ARE PLEASED AND SO AM I....

2	Diabetes	Fast heartbeat - tachycardia	Had to stop this drug and go back to Byetta.  Heart rate was too fast.	M	55	2  months 1X D	6/6/2011
5	Type II	First week on .6ml, dizzy one day, diarrhea 2 days, upset stomach 2 days.  None of these affect occured at the same time.  So, basically I was having some kind of a problem for 5 days in the first week.	Endo, put me on Victoza as A1C was 7.3.  He prescribed .6 for 1 week, 1.2 for 2 weeks then onto 1.8.  I never dialed up to 1.2 as I didn't want to get sick again after the first week.  I gradually dialed an extra click past .6 over a 3 week period to avoid some of the problems.  I did -- I stop with only 5 clicks past .6 --- bacically it's 1/2 between .6 and 1.2 or .9.  This is where I've been.  A1C is now 6.4.  Lost 10 lbs. the first week, gained back 8. Probably from not eating from being sick. With summer being here I will be more active -- hopefully I'll be able to lose more weight -- this will help to low my A1C. I've been very pleased with Victoza -- except for the cost.  The drug has helpped me to control my diabeties.	M	62	4  months.9 ml 1X D	5/31/2011Email
2	Diabetes Type II	Extreme nausea, diarerhea, stomach pain, general aches and pains, lost 11 pounds in 10 days	The side effects became more severe as time progressed, I found myself so sick, I didn't want to get out of bed, even slight movement made the nausea worse.

5	Metabolic Syndrome	Nausea which went away after first 10 days, maybe fatique not sure if it is mistakes I have made in diet change.	This medication has changed my life along with a new very strict diet and joining a gym, which is somethimng i would not have been able to do before starting Victoza I am beginning to feel like the old me again!!!!!!

1	Type 2 Diabetes	At first it worked great for reducing appetite and sugars. Very dry mouth, bad taste, and nausea. HOWEVER, developed excruciating upper abdominal pain relieved by leaning forward (definately pancreatitis). Can no longer take the drug and now my pancreas is fried, as I have lost control over my sugars. A1Cs were always in the 5-6 range before Victoza. Now I have to take TWICE the humalog and Lantus I ever did.	I am afraid this drug has seriously damaged my pancreas. I do NOT recommend this drug.	F	51	2  months1.6 1X D	1/19/2011Email
