1	Occular Hypertension	Constant headache, neck  and back of head hurts, tender scalp, joint and terrible back and chest pain, earache.  Went to the Dr. for that and she said my ear was not infected.  Hurts when I cough or sneeze, rashes on hands and stomach, itchy and blurry eyes..	I am taking the generic Lananoprost.  I called the Dr. and he said it's not likely that the medicine is causing these symptoms, ha, because I know my body better than he does because I live with me everyday.  He told me to stay on it until I see him next month and will will prescribe the brand name.  This generic crap is doing more harm than good.  Not worth it.	F	59	3  months0.005% 1X D	4/16/2013
2	Glaucoma	Terrible rash on torso and legs. Eye drops are the only drug I take, I do  not even take aspirins. Doc said it was the eye drops, xalatan. I was on a different brand before and no problems.		M	48	2  months 1X D	3/28/2013Email
2	high pressure both eyes,glaucoma	Pain over both my eyes-it felt as if someone punched me in the eyes, the back of my neck hurt so so bad & it radiated up the back of my head to my forehead down to my eyes & around my neck to my temples around to my eyes.I have migraines & the pain from using this drop super-ceded that  type of headache!! My eyes were sensitive to light. The pain got me sick to my stomach. My eyeballs felt bruised. My eyelashes  were falling out. I continuously had that gook in my eyes.Itchy eyes & my eyes were getting reddish around the outside of upper & lower eye lids. Sleep was a hassle cuz I could not lay down without pain getting worse & nausea setting in.	I MAY ADD I WAS USING THE GENERIC BRAND. I HAD DOUBLE LASER SURGERY IN NOV & DEC OF 2012.. MY EYES ARE WORSE NOW DUE TO THE DROPS. I STOPPED USING & I HAVE TO SCHEDULE APPT WITH A DIFF DR..	F	47	1  months0005% 1X D	2/16/2013Email
5	intraocular hypertension	Eyes seem a little dry when I wake up, I just use an otc mousture drop.	No complaints at all. This has been a godsend for me. I'd had red and painful eyes for quites some time and assumed it was allergies until the eye dr. check my pressure. I'm now around 15 for both eyes, they are clear and bright and I get fewer headaches. A+	F	36	4  months.005% 1X D	6/16/2012
1	glaucoma	With new generic Xalatan, constant watering from eyes, a slightly viscous fluid always present. Did not have this effect with brand-name Xalatan I used years ago.	I switched from Travatan ($42) to generic Xalatan ($8) for cost reasons. Within four months my eye pressures had risen from my usual 17-18 to an unacceptable 25. Back to Travatan. This result may not be typical, but users of generic Xalatan should be aware it is possible. Several companies offer generic latanoprost, and perhaps a different maker would be better, but my pressure control is too precarious to experiment.	F	70	4  months1 drop 1X D	5/6/2012
1	eye pressure/left eye	I could use Xalatan with no problems--have been on it for about two years.  BUT  I was asked if I wanted the GENERIC Latanoprost which just came out a few months ago and I said yes--to save money.  Every morning I would wake up with terrible pain in the back of my neck which would progress into a migraine every day!  This started happening within a week of starting the GENERIC.  I told my doctor and he put me back on the BRAND name (Xalatan) and within two days, my neck pain and migraines went away!		F	61	3  weeks1 drop p.m 1X D	7/29/2011
3	eye pressure	After six months I began experiencing shoulder pain and muscle soreness. I'd put drops in at 11 pm. At 2am I'd wake up with pain shooting down my neck and shoulder. I would get up and take an aspirin. I'd also use a vibrating tool. It would take me two hours before I could go to sleep. I went to my doctor after two weeks to check for signs of a heart attack. He checked me out and said it must be something else. A week later I started with a chiropractor to alleviate the pain. It helped some. I had to open a new bottle of Xalatan. I read the literature. I saw that 2% patients experienced muscle pain and joint pain. I called my opthamologist to tell him. We agreed for me to stop taking the drug for two weeks. Last night I slept through the night again for the fifth straight night after I stopped taking Xalatan. I still have some muscle pain, but it seems to lessen every day.	My opthomologist said he was not aware of any such side effects.	M	71	7  monthsone drop 1X D	6/12/2011Email
4	Control inner ocular pressure	Restasis was used for dry eye prior to using Xalatan.  Using Xalatan at night negated the effect of Restasis at night.		M	56	3  months 1X D	5/5/2011
4	High IOP	Blurred vision, long eye lashes, red eyes in the morning.	I got diagnosed with ocular hypertension in Aug 2010. I always get my eyes checked once a year, but during my visit this year I was told that I had an eye pressure of 38 on the right eye and 32 on the left. However, the doctor did not find any nerve damage and was surprised I didn't have any nerve damages with an IOP that high. I was put on Xalatan and after 2 weeks, my eye pressure dropped to 22 on the right eye and 20 on the left. The doctor was pleased with the results and wants me to come back in Jan 2011 for another eye exam. I was also given a visual field test and I passed it. The doctor commended me for getting my eyes checked every year and that is why we caught the problem early. The doctors aim is to get my IOP to 14 or 16.	M	32	4  months 1X D	12/20/2010Email

5	glaucoma	Mild stinging when using, in fact notifies me if I am using 'old 'stock, none others that I am aware of.	Very rapid results in dropping pressures, from over 20 to 15 virtually immediately. Also have cataracts so don't need any other problems. Had laser surgery in one eye and very confident in treatment I am recieving.	M	62	5  months 1X D	11/10/2010Email
5	High eye pressure	When I started Xalatan: Eye redness, waking up with crusty eyes, runny nose, could taste the medicine.	Within two weeks, Xalatan dropped the pressure in my eyes from a 22 and 19 to 14 and 13! AMAZING!	F	23	2  weeks 2X D	11/4/2010Email
5	Fuchs Corneal Dystrophy	none so far	like night and day: when I started take this medication, the pain I experienced in my eyes decreased a lot.	F	63	17  days 1X D	10/26/2010Email
5	Pigmental Dispersia - high pressure	Long term user with no side effects except red, itchy eyelids.  I live in the South and use it at bedtime.  It sits on the nightstand overnight, but refrigerating it during the day seems to help with the red eyelids.	Pressure dropped from mid-upper 20s down to 18-20 on 1 drop per day.  Love it, except the price.  It goes generic in March 2011 so that should improve too.	M	65	10  yearsdrop 1X D	10/4/2010Email
2	glaucoma	fuzzy feeling, tired, difficult to concentrate, speech difficulty, feel better if I fail to take for a day and at about 2-4 PM on days I do take it.  Opthamologist claims Xalatan should not cause such untoward symptoms!   I'm looking for alternatives to reduce IOP		F	75	120  days1 drop 1X D	7/6/2010
5	open angle glaucoma	This was the 6th glaucoma drug I tried, and I have had NO side effects other than very slight burning occasionally for a few seconds after I put the drops in, especially if it's a new bottle.  Xalatan, for me, has had the fewest side effects of any of the glaucoma drops.	Easy!  Once a day!  Simple!  Effective!  I just wish it were cheaper or had a generic!	F	57	7  years1 drop 1X D	4/20/2010
2	POAG	I complained almost immediately to my opth about the side effects of the drug. I started feeling depressed and later developed headaches, face pain, bad eye pain, sensitive to light, edema in lids, flu like symptoms, and neck pain. The symptoms increased a lot as my green eyes turned to muddy brown. Now looks like my one eye is pulling upwards. Also my blood sugars are extremely worse now. Dr says keep taking the drops. I think he has a listening problem. As soon as I stop taking the med things begin to clear up. He says I have no other option. Thinking of quitting both the Xalatan and going to this doc. The drug itself worked on lowering my pressure to 15. My eye pressure to start was 25 and 20.	Most people seem to do ok with this drop. My dr says other drops have even more side effects. He is unwilling to change my medication.	F	41	2  years 1X D	3/10/2010History
2	eye pressure	sore throat, pain between shoulders, dry skin under eye ducts, vision worse	stopped for 1 day and sore throat gone, hoping back pain will follow	F	51	14  days1 drop 1X D	2/5/2010
1	elevated pressure	Post-nasal drip all the time, stuffy nose, reduced energy, eyes puffy. The drip in my throat was the worst; just stopped Xalatan and it is much better after only a few days. Have had the symptoms for almost 4 months, but had no idea it was the Xalatan. ENT doctors didn't make the connection either.		M	57	7  months	1/16/2010
1	ocular hypertension	Irises changed colour from green to dark brown.  Eyelashes initally grew longer.  Stopped taking drug about 2 years ago but still experiencing unpleasant side effects - eyelashes now grow the wrong way (into my eyes) causing severe irritation.  I had these possible side effects explained to me but I didn't believe it would happen - well, it did, and it looks like I'm stuck with them for life.		F	50	4  years	11/25/2009Email
3	tp pevent glaucoma	extreme heaviness and tired eyes all day	I have to put artificial tears in at least 30mins before as I have no natural tears  - I have cancelled going out in the evening so many times because I cant actually keep my eyes open. I leave them off occasionally so that I can continue with a normal life and go out with friends. I am lucky to have an understanding husband but hey I am not so understanding I hate it.	F	66	2  years	11/16/2009
3	Glaucoma		I have tried other drops to no avail and xalatan is the only one left to me but I am c0nvinced this causes me to have joint pain.very low mood and tierdness.  Just started Pilates to ease my muscles and inject some energy thought it might have been the effects of Pilates but havuing stopped the drops for a while and then continued them again this week on the instruction of my consultant..I am convinced the drops are to blame.  I have had operations..laser..and drops..where do I go from Here??	F	66	6  months	10/22/2009Email

2	Glaucoma	Extreme dry eye. Crusting in the morning.	Pressure has always been between 14-19 in both eyes before xalatan. Basically still the same after using xalatan. Not too happy about being on a regular schedule every 3 months for what appears to be a lifetime commitment. Eye doctor seems to find evidence of diabetes in the eye exam that are not supported by blood test exams. Seriously considering a second opinion.	M	73	1  years	6/22/2009Email

ER MD and doctors blew it off in the hospital.  since i am an ER Nurse i was persistent and seen an eye doc.  Rt. eye pressure 42. and no hx of eye pressure problems. xalantan and combigan (two drugs in one saved my eye sight and my pressure became 26 after two rounds of eye drops 15min apart)  Then i noticed an increase in my heart rate as well as the cardiologist.  i had several test and we couldn't figure out the problem.  then i pulled out the literature in the samples given obove, and behold the answers are there.  Not only did i have an increase in my heart rate w/irreg., dizziness, blurred vision increased, low b/p, low heart rate w/run off pvc's, swilling of the eyelids and orbit and facial swelling in 10-15 min after instilling the eye dr	reluctant to use d/t se w/irreg. heart, swelling to site of instillation and surrounding tissue x5hrs and facial swelling on effected side of installation,and sob.  the other side effects i can deal w/but the other above concern me. all effects resolved when not used for one day.

4	glucoma	no attributable side effects. started having erectile problems at the same time. The doctor put this down to age and disinterest, which I don't agree.	Was earlier on Timoptol. this is better as far as side effects	M	64	4  years	12/29/2008Email
4	glaucoma	redness and puffy eyes,also loss of smell and taste.	Optomolagist is happy with results	M	65	365  days	11/23/2008Email
4	Glaucoma	Slight burning sensation, immediately after administering the drops. Nothing else.	Waiting for a check-up in two months, so can see if this drug works for me. Pressure ranges between 50 and 26 before diagnosis.	M	60	4  weeks	11/15/2008
3	supposed elevated eye pressure	Throat feels clogged up--very unpleasant.Slighty nauseated from time taken at bedtime until midafternoon.Bad taste in mouth and throat.I feel as though I barely drag through each day but do not know whether Xalatan is the cause because I take other medications. However, I do not remember feeling this way with them. Usually feel fuzzy headed and fuzzy eyed and have the blahs, but don't know what to attribute it to. I just know I never before was like this, except with certain pain medications, which I immediately stopped.I already had a pain problem, so don't know if Xalatan contributed.Pressure now lowered enough to partly satisfy doctor, but a second eye drop he added gave sensation of full dilation until late the next day so I am back to Xalatan only. I had no indications of glaucoma except for slightly elevated pressure, so he prescribed Xalatan and labeled me as having glaucoma, despite all other tests being negative for it. He refuses to accept that there are side effect	Too expensive. I am never sure how to insert the drops, and the doctor gives no specifics. I see here the tear duct must be closed, but I was never told this and have never done it. I don't even know where it is. Can anyone explain, please.	F	74	2  years	11/8/2008Email
5	Glaucoma	Possible but not certain these were related: flashing/ribbon of light in vision periphery at times (doc says it's "migraine without the headache"); unusual slight muscle pains.	Lowered pressure consistently.	M	44	2  years	8/17/2008Email
1	high eye pressure	fatigue, chest pain,arrythmias, short of breath, hoarseness, etc etc  opthamologist didn't want to hear it-said I had to continue the med. I thought I was going to die.  had a physical that was normal.  i quit the med(the doc was very unhappy-too bad)and everything cleared up in a few days or so.	I thought it might be the preservatives in the med. i have also had trouble with other eye drops.	F	50	6  months	8/6/2008
1	glaucoma	Increased allergic reactions to many things, chest pain, respiratory infection, asthma-like sensation, bruisings, dry eye, eye pain, feeling of sore/lump in throat, swollen nasals.	This was the only drug I was taking. After many trips to Drs and diagnostic procedures I insisted on stopping this drug and everything cleared up.  I believe I have some permanent damage however. It's amazing what the Drs don't know.  Trust your gut.	F	59	2  years	6/6/2008
3	glaucoma	Burning when putting in. Wake up with "gritty" feeling in my eyes. Tear ducts blocking up and swelling. Blurry vision off and on all day, rubbing my eyes all day to clear up blurriness.	I am wondering what else there is to treat glaucoma. Darn doctor wants to see me every 3 months and repete expensive tests every time and does not listen to my complaints. Is there something else to use?	M	62	3  years	5/9/2008
5	glaucoma	There is a slight stinging after putting it in.  Also my eyes become red, a little swollen, and sore to touch.	Xalatan has kept my pressures down, side effects are worth it.  Just this year i've had to add another drop to my regimen.	F	23	17  years	5/8/2008Email
3	open-angle glaucoma	Some redness around eyes, weird growth of eyelashes	I don't know how well this medication is working, as for the last 3 years I've been taking it in conjunction with other medications (Timoptic or Cosopt).  At one time my eye doctor tried having me use Xalatan by itself but was not sufficiently satisfied with my eye pressures to rely on it alone.  There are few side effects that I can attribute to this drug, and those I mention are not very bothersome.  I would have given it a higher rating if I felt it were more effective in lowering my eye pressures.	F	47	3  years	3/24/2008
1	Glaucoma	Acute episodes of muscular and joint pain,plus migraine attack and dizzy spells, felt unable to walk steadily on some days.	Xalatan only reduced my pressures from 20 to 18.Very unhappy with side effects as usually very fit and healthy,so the unsteadyness when walking was scary. Stopped the Xalatan. Felt better right away.Will not be using this drug again.	F	61	4  months	12/7/2007
4	Glaucoma	started taking Xalatan after surgery - scleral buckle... Started with flashing lights in periphery.  Pulsing with heart beat. One spot has turned into three.  Retinal surgeon - no idea what it is		M	49	8  months	11/28/2007
5	open angle glaucoma	slight sting when putting drops in eye. I take other meds that cause fatigue therefore im not sure if xalatan is a contributer.	Has reduced eye pressure,headaches, and blurred vision frequency.	F	37	15  months	11/2/2007
1	elevated eye pressure	terribly red eyes, blurred vision, so that I couldn't drive a car any more, dizziness,grey pupil became green, painful cough in the morning; after I stopped taking the drug, all the symptoms disappeared, but some blurred vision remained	only lowered pressure from 25 to 23	F	66	4  weeks	10/8/2007
4	glaucoma	I seem to have lost my sense of smell. As I don't take any other medication and the side effect appeared about six months after I started taking xalatan, I am suspicious.	Otherwise xalatan seems satisfactory.	F	69	10  months	9/18/2007
2	glaucoma	chest pain,dyspnea,palpitations,hoarse,extreme fatigue	have been having symptoms for some time but opthamologist said not from eye gtts. I'm also taking cosopt. a physical proved I'm healthy. I decreased drops and felt better. the doc was not impressed, to say the least.	F	60	2  years	9/15/2007
4	elevated eye pressure	Slight burning following application, some blurring of vision at times, some itching around eyes, otherwise no major side effects.	I have a family history of glaucoma. A routine eye exam two years ago indicated elevated pressure (about 22 in both eyes). However, one eye showed slight optical nerve damage already due to the elevated pressure, and my doctor recommended Xalatan. It has helped. My eye pressure is usually around 18 now in both eyes. A recent checkup measured it at 16 and 17, which made me happy. I tolerate the drug well.	F	50	2.5  years	9/13/2007Email
1	Open angle glaucoma	Really bad rash on torso and legs.  Eventually weakened muscles in legs, dizziness, inability to walk without leaning on something.  Hot water made the rash worse.	I did not attribute my problems to the drops for a long time but it was the only drug I was taking.  After I swelled up and my neck and face puffed up, even my eye doctor was alarmed and I was switched to another drug. Apparently I am allergic to some ingredient in the drops. I also wasn't careful about blocking the tear duct while putting the drop in each eye. If anyone has similar experience see your doctor immediately.	F	65	2  years	7/7/2007Email
3	Galucoma	Extreme fatigue, and momentary losses of consciousness.  Cause serious auto accident;  Cough, joint pain (not serious), increased balance problems, fell off bike - I ride 3-4 times a week.  No pain in eye.

5	glaucoma	No side effects at all.	One drop at night keeps my condition totally under control.	F	48	9  years	5/1/2007
5	Glaucoma	The main side effect has been extreme eyelash growth.  I now have long eyelashes, which I don't mind so much ;-)	Lowered pressure from 36 to 19; this is the only drug that has been effective in lowering my pressure.  I just wish the price would come down some.	F	39	9  years	2/26/2007
2	open angle glaucoma	Almost immediately, muscle & joint paint.  Approximately 3 weeks later, extreme eye pain & in surrounding area.  Asked opthamologist to change prescription.	Pharmacist declared he had not heard of muscle & joint pain from Xalatan in all his many yrs of experience, so I did not discuss the eye pain with him.	F	69	4  weeks	1/29/2007
3	Occular Hypertension	Take drops at 11pm. Wake 7am tired red eyes. Difficulty in concentrating, feel light headed, starts to wear off about 2pm, feel OK at about 4-5pm.	Effect on eye pressure excellent, down from 30 to 10 in left eye. Did not want them to be the problem. Occasions not taken feel OK. Currently studying Honours Degree.	M	35	3  months	1/18/2007

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control.
