1	vitamin D3 deficeincy	Absolute dismay when a blood test revealed that I was taking Vitamin D2, named "maximum D3" for maximum deception by the manufacturer!! My doctor prescribed "vitamin D3" and she assured me verbally that it was D3. There was nothing on the patient information from the pharmacy to indicate it was other than vitamin D3. I was scammed!!!	While physicians routinely prescribe vitamin D2, which is made from mushrooms, expert scientists do not considered vitamin D2 to be equivalent to vitamin D3. A recent article, "The case against vitamin D2 as a vitamin supplement", published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition by Dr. R. Vieth, concluded that "vitamin D2 should not be regarded as a nutrient suitable for supplementation or fortification." !!!	F	73	28  days25000 IU 1X W	11/24/2010Email
1	Vitamin D deficiency	Muscular, joint, and skeletal pain; confusion; irritability; fatigue; insomnia; inability to stay focused; increased urination; dry mouth and increased thirst; nausea after meals; difficulty maintaining balance; constipation; shortness of breath.	My symptoms continued nearly unabated for more than a month after I stopped taking the drug; traces linger after three months. While I realize this drug is beneficial to most patients, it should be prescribed with caution.	M	63	3  weeks	7/1/2008Email
5	vitamin d deficiency		muscle aches went away shortly after using. I had severe muscle aches from 17 months on actonel. My bone density went down, went to an endocrinologist who determined a d deficiency and I should have never been using actonel. I would advise a vitamin d test before using actonel	F	64	2  months	1/8/2008
