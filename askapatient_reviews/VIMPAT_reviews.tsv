2	Partial Seziures	Initially, Vimpat seemed to be a godsend. The doctor had added it when my Keppra was not completely controlling my seizures. About two weeks ago, I fell. Not sure what happened. Three says ago, almost went down again. Vision difficulty for the past couple of weeks. Severe headaches. Beginning to have difficulty reading (something that was happening just before I was diagnosed with Epilepsy--it improved 100% with Keppra but now it is back again) and now, I have started hallucinating...first auditory and now visually.  My once laid back personality has become more intense, getting angry and irritable over nothing. My emotions are otherwise flat. Things I should feel happiness, sadness, joy, etc...do not have reaction....irritability and anger are only reactions I have. This is not me.	I am disappointed this is happening, especially after such a good start on Vimpat.	F	45	10  weeks100 mg 2X D	6/13/2013
1	seizures	loss of balance, very sleepy		M	60	60  days100mg 2X D	6/9/2013Email
3	Seizures	Sleepy, blood pressure increase, heart palpitations, balance problems.		F	45	5  months	5/16/2013
3	Seizure Disorder	Very vivid dreams. Often sleepy right after taking in the morning but wears off thoughout the day.	Had 1 break through seizure when I first started this medication so had to increase dosage.	F	45	2  months150mg 2X D	2/3/2013
5	Epilepsy	Dizziness - at first. My doctor was the Director of Research for the VIMPAT study.  The dizziness was controlled by taking me off of an AED, and drastically lowering the dose of 2 others. From 800 mg /d of Lamictal to 15 mg /d and from 1000 mg /d Primidone to 400 mg /d.	The only drug that worked. I had been terminally ill from epilepsy, no medicine to treat me, "Go home and die", they had said. I resorted to marijuana for a while. It works, but being high sucks, because you can not function in a rational world - living as a happy, goofy, blob is no way to live. I gave up marijuana because I hated being fckt up 24/7/365. Vimpat works. The dizziness side effects were controlled by taking me off of Keppra, lowering by primidone to 400 mg/d, and by lowering my lamictal to 15mg /d (going off of it). My neuro was the Director of Research for Vimpat when it was an investigational drug.	M	60	 400 2X D	8/2/2012
2	Seizure control	I was removed from Topamax and began taking Vimpat due to continued seizures.  When I began the drug, I had horrific night panics, headaches and increased blood pressure.	After about six months, I acclimated to the medicine; however, I experienced myoclonic jerks (new to me) and mental confusion about every other month which required Ativan to relieve the symptoms. I'm now titrating off Vimpat and adding Lamictal.  I'm doing much better with Lamictal with minimal side effects.  However, once I began coming off Vimpat, the headaches have returned with nausea...but it's worth it.  Of the three anticonvulsants I have tried, Vimpat has the worst side effects.

1	Seizures/Migraines	Severe nausea, vomiting, dry-heaves.  I recently tried Vimpat again and 5 days into the 50 mg dose once daily (lowest possible, I believe), I began having severe nausea and dry-heaves yet again.  I've never experienced this much nausea in 20 years of migraine and seizure medication.		F	29	4  months100mg 2X D	12/24/2011
5	Epilepsy-"mainly partial seizures"	I've probably tried every seizure drug known to man. I was sick of taking Depakote, due to the side effects, but my doctor told me that it was the only drug that worked good in the past "500mgs. a day". About 5 months ago she called me and told me that she wanted me to try this "Vimpat", needless to say, "Praise God!",I finally found something that works. I have never gone longer than two months without having partial seizures, that are to me, the most horrible. Never have I gone this long without them. I'll be due to drive again by December 2nd. Very thankful.		F	31	5  months150 mg.s 2X D	11/19/2011Email
5	Epilepsy	Hard to say- I am weaning off of Topamax and that is horrible.	I am seizure free!!	F	37	6  months200 mg 2X D	9/17/2011Email
2	Simple Partial Seizures	short-term memory problems, depression	I took a minimal dose of Vimpat for 3 months as monotherapy. No seizures, but began developing depression a week after starting and which got severe over next two months. When I got off, the depression went away. Not for me.	M	60	3  months 2X D	8/11/2011
5	Epilepsy	Slight dizziness with my second dose increase; it was gone in a day though. Since I have been taking it, I seem to be yawning a lot. I also feel very hot/overheated more easily. It makes me want to crank the AC. On the plus side, I have been in a much better mood since starting the Vimpat. Things don't seem to irritate me as easily or as bad.	So far...I LOVE IT! I am also on Oxcarbazepine which seems to be controlling my Grand-mals, but I was having frequent partials on almost every drug I took. My neuro decided to add on Vimpat to see if it would help. I have not had a seizure of any kind since starting Vimpat. He was even able to lower my dose of Oxcarbazepine without any problems. Don't be afraid to try it just because it is a newer drug.

3	Epileptic Seizures	hair thinning, slight balance problems, insomnia	My dose was increased slowly, to see at what point the seizures would stop.  Vimpat took away about 75% of my seizures, but I now also have to take another medicine as well.	F	47	1.5  years400 mg/day 2X D	8/20/2010
5	for epileptic seizures		It has controlled the seizures VERY well!!!!  I have been seizure-free for the first time in 43 years!!  I might be able to drive!!     Is a side-effect of Vimpat Urinary incontinence?	F	47	4  months200mg 2X D	6/19/2010Email
1	myoclonic	Dramatic increase in seizures, sleeping or felt like sleeping, no desire or ability to do simple tasks.	Vimpat was prescribed for my son to control a misdiagnosed seizure type.  It was thought he had partial seizures when he had myoclonic status nonprogressive epilepticus	M	20	3  months150 2X D	6/17/2010
