5	PTSD	Heart palpitations, short term memory loss, increased anxiety the first two weeks. Very vivid dreams.	I started taking 5mg 2 x a day and experienced constant heart palpitations and a feeling of fogginess I couldn't shake. My Dr. suggested I go up to 10mg 2 x a day-after a few days of this I experienced what I like to call loss of impulse control-after having a few drinks in a nightclub I punched a woman in the face for disrespecting me. I went back down to 5mg 2 x a day, and have had no problems since. My anxiety is at a record low, I sleep through the night, I wake up in the morning singing-this medication changed my life. I highly recommend it to those suffering from PTSD. I do have some short term memory loss and very vivid dreams, but I am happy than I have ever been. A fair trade!

5	Anxiety	Tiredness, increased hunger, minor dizziness for about an hour after taking	Works well for me.  Calms me down with out the "brain zapping" I got from paxil and lexapro.  Dosage has been adjusted throughout the years.  I am told 60mgs a day is the maximum dose. This drug works well for me, and I have no issues taking it for the rest of my life.

2	GAD	Headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest tightness, night sweats, insomnia, bloating, nausea.		F	43	1  weeks15mg	3/14/2013Email
3	Anxiety, Post Traumatic Stress	Momentary, but extreme sensation of dizziness, to the point of feeling I could fall, especially sitting at my computer.  Strange lucid dreams.  Headache. Nausea. Hot flashes. insomnia, long term.	I have been taking this medication to wean myself off of Lorazapam, and it did help for a while, but now it seems I have built a tolerance to it.  I went back to my doctor and she told me to go back to Lorazapam, and maybe even take one Buspar and one Lorazapam alternatively (I'm looking for another Dr. by the way).  But I do feel that Buspar lost it's ability to help after a while, so if you're taking it be prepared that it is not a forever kind of remedy.	F	54	1  years10 mg 3X D	3/11/2013Email
3	anxiety	Profound insomnia (72 hours with no sleep), heightened sense of smell	Was very effective for anxiety but the insomnia could not be tolerated.  Had to stop.	F	35	14  days 1X D	3/6/2013
5	complex post traumatic stress disor	None	It's a miracle.  Intrusive thoughts are stopped cold, I can actually feel it working.  I was able to cut back on the Xanax I was taking and will eventually eliminate it, in the future.  I suffer from (diagnosed) cptsd due to extreme trauma and was at a point where I could barely function and was actually considering the possibility that I would not be able to continue living this way.  It can't erase the cause of this horror in my life, but so far it has certainly eased the effects.	F	65	7  days10 MG 2X D	2/25/2013Email
1	GAD, panic	This was prescribed to me by my doc to wean off of Effexor. At first this drug was awesome... Helped my anxiety, I was great. About 4 months ago I noticed my anxiety increasing. 2 months ago started with racing troublesome thoughts horrible Unspeakable thoughts that i would never normally have. I was also taking ambien at the time. I have since stopped. I have started to taper off these last few days and have started to feel slightly better... This was a horrible experience and I will never take another drug that alters brain chemicals again.		F	32	7  months10	2/2/2013
5	Anxiety w/ Peri-menopause	Lightheaded, dizzy, tired, foggy headaches, weird upper back discomfort, muscle twitches, ringing in the ears, very vivid dreams.	This drug has been a lifesaver. Due to some very stressful life events: divorce, custody battle, layoff, move, combined with peri-menopause, I went into full blown anxiety attacks and went to the ER twice in 2 weeks. I was originally prescribed Lexapro and some other drug for my anxiety, but it left me so brain fuzzy I could not deal so I stopped after only 5 days. Spoke w my doctor about the peri-menopause and how my anxiety would worsen at certain times around my cycle. She prescribed be Buspar at 7.5 twice a day to start. It immediately started helping. The side effects did go away after a month, and since that time I have played around a lot with the dosage. I've taken 30 mg a day, but am now taking 7.5 three times a day. My anxiety is still there - it's weird, during stressful times I still will get the rapid heart beat, sweaty palms, etc... but I don't go to that "bad place" of feeling out of control. The physical anxious feelings are there, but the mental, out of control feelings are not - and that is a godsend. Also, I no longer have the constant, crazy, unwanted thoughts that consumed me during the worst of my anxiety and panic attacks. That is gone. I'm now able to enjoy my children, get out of the house and live a fairly normal life. I was also able to quit smoking 3 days after starting this med. I haven't craved a cig since...

4	GAD	Dizzy right after taking my pill. If on an empty stomach I get slight to medium nausea. So I make sure to eat something each time now which helps. Strange long boring dreams. Libido  somewhat down, but really to early to report on that yet.	I just finished tapering off Viibryd which was awful stuff. I was on it for 8 weeks and had diarrhea the whole time. Still some lingering side effects which make it had to know fully what is caused by Buspar. My GAD causes terrible stomach distress if untreated. So far Buspar is keeping my stomach calm. Jaw clenching almost gone. This has been a constant problem with any med I have taken in the past. I will post again in a couple of months with more updates.	M	60	8  days5mg 3X D	1/30/2013
4	anxiety	I have been diagnosed with pmdd and GAD.Right away the doctor had me on 15 mgs  2x a day. I felt sedated and unable to walk or focus. But now i am on half a tab im the am and half a tab in the pm. I feel that buspar has helped me with controlling my anxiety. But if i do not sleep well ever since i have been on this medication, my memory is not as sharp.		F	43	1  days14	1/12/2013

5	anxiety/depression	I did not have any objectionable side effects.  I did feel a bit over sedated at first, I was only taking 15 mg for the first 2 months.  Over that time I gradually adjusted to it, and then increased the dose with nothing but stellar results	This is a fantastic med, In my opinion.  I use it along with 200 mg of Effexor.  I have had nothing but excellent things to say about it.  I have a 20 year history of taking Benzodiaxipines for my terrible anxiety. I have to say, things are finally under control.  I could not be more thrilled.	M	54	 10 3X D	11/13/2012
5	GAD	Insomnia, Dizziness, Trouble balancing- I sometimes almost fall over if I stand to quickly	The first two weeks on this medicine were rough for me, but I immediatley could feel it working. I have had aniexty for years and I never knew what it was. I have taken anti depressants, stimulants, anti phycotics, bi polar medication, you name it... none of that worked for me. Infact it made me more anxious. This is the ONLY medicine that has ever worked for me. I am finally my self and I can do all the things that I have been too scared to do my whole life! I am over the insomnia- as long as I don't take it too close to bed time. I would Highly recommend this medication to any one suffering from GAD.	F	26	1  months5mg 2X D	10/29/2012Email
5		It saved my life.  I take it every 8 hours.  Very sleepy for a half hour after I take it.  I had to bump the dose up from 30 mgs to 45 mgs a day about 5 years ago.  I couldn't last 5 days on Paxil, Effexor, or Lexapro.  My aunt has been on this with success for 20 years. I have missed a few doses in the decade plus I've been on it, I get a little shaky after missing a dose.		M	36	12  years15 3X D	10/27/2012
4	Generalized Anxiety / Social Phobia	dizziness, drowsiness, empathy, occasional cognitive impairment, depression	I used to take BusPar for 2 years when I was 16-18 and had good results in the past. It was so good I didn't have to take meds until now. (As in it didn't make me a complete loon like Prozac, or turn me into a cold, lifeless robot like Depakote) I'm a month away from 21 now, and I've been having severe panic attacks revolving around work, and it's been causing insomnia. (I'll go 3+ days without being able to sleep.) I've been taking it briefly and it's gotten rid of my anxiety, but replaced it with more problems. Instead of worrying about everything, I get put down by everything. I want to go out and look for a new job, but I always get a crippling feeling of depression after applying at one place. Oh well, I guess it's better then being too scared to leave your house for anything other then the most important essentials. I still can't sleep though..	M	20	5  days15mg 2X D	10/26/2012Email
5	anxiety	brains zaps for about 20 minutes after dosage in the beginning, light headed for a short while, headache for first week,  no real side effects after 3 weeks	Excellent drug for my anxiety.  I no longer ruminate obsessively over imagined conflicts.  My mind has quieted down.  My self esteem is back and I look forward to getting out of bed.  Truly has enriched my life.  Colors seem brighter.  I smile and laugh again.	F	59	9  weeks20 2X D	10/23/2012
2	Anxiety	Dizziness up to one hour after taking; headache, nausea, grogginess, vivid dreams.	This appeared to help anxiety but side effects not good; stopped by tapering off; have been off it totally for 2 weeks. Bad effects from discontinuation: severe headache/neckache, sleepiness, depression, nausea, early norming shivers, alternative heat and chills like flu like symptoms.  Would never take this again.		59	6  months15 2X D	10/23/2012

5	anxiety/depression	I have been taking 'psyche' medications for 28 of my 54 years.  I am all too aware of the overly negative side effects that certain meds have caused me over the years.At this time in my life, Buspar is a fantastic med for me.  I always comment that if a medication of this sort is working, but causing you some libido issues, and you choose to discontinue then you do not truly appreciate life stopping anxiety/depression.  This med is a wonderful adjunct with my antidepressant Effexor.	This medication is a wonderful adjunct to my main antidepressant, Effexor.  I take 5 mgs/t.i.d., usually, and I am learn to relax through any situation that previously, would have made me feel so anxious and inadequate that I would just dwell on what a failure I was.  My encouragement for any one who truly has any issue of this kind, is to realize that the process of finding what 'works' for you may take awhile.  If a medication isn't working within a few days, please do not assume that it is useless or a 'spawn' of the devil.  If you think that you truly need to find a doctor that will listen to you, and help you, overtime, find a Med or meds that help you.  I can't tell you how many times I felt that a certain med regimen was useless.  Sometimes it was.  You are the one ultimately responsible for finding what works for you:)  Research on your own is key.  No what the hell you are dealing with, and find a decent physician.  I all to well understand how difficult this is, but please keep working at it.  It is your life after all:)	M	54	90  days5 3X D	10/10/2012

5	anxiety	Initially: dizziness, low-grade nagging headache, tingling. After about a week, these went away. The worst part:  a short but viciously extreme period of anxiety amplification, about a week in.	After two weeks, there is vast improvement. I feel like myself again.  The stresses in my life are still there and unresolved, but I can cope with them, and I feel SO MUCH BETTER.  That being said, it was not a great two weeks of adjustment.  For three or four days, about a week into it, the anxiety was actually increasing.  The physical symptoms: that escalating spine tension, the racing heart, the zero-to-sixty panic--there were a few times when I felt those symptoms when there was just no reason for it--there was a physical anxiety manifestation with no emotional cause. A bizarre feeling.  And worse, there was an incident where there was an emotional cause, and the reaction was so magnified and out of proportion that it was unlike anything that had come before--almost out of control.  That has all passed (hopefully for good), but the anxiety amplification was bad. Very.	F	47	14  days10 mg 3X D	9/27/2012
5	Anxiety	Let me just start of by saying- I hate taking drugs! Ugh. So i have debated and tried so many. Hated everything I took- lexapro, welbutrin and a few others. But when I started to get full blown panic attacks from my anxiety I knew I had to stop being a baby and try something and stick to it. Then I got the Buspar. Since I'm a pill phob, I break my 7.5 my in half. So I really am only taking 3.25 twice a day. It's great. I tried a full pill once and I was too much in a dream state. I want to feel like me! If the Buspar is making u dizzy or tired, your my are way too high!!! Omg I saw some on here for 30 mg???? I'd be in a damn comatose!! And I'm not tiny. I'm 5'3" 160lbs. Go low! This stuff is great. I'd give it a 5 but it's only been a few days. Now mind you, I tried this on and off for about 2 months (remember, I'm a drug weirdo!) but anxiety was so bad I knew I couldn't control it myself. And it's great for depression too! Just try a low LOW dosage. You'll see the difference. Trust me- I hate them all. This is the only one that works! Best of luck to you all. You're not alone!! ;)		F	37	4  days7.5	9/20/2012Email
1	Anxiety	Extremely light-headed and feeling like I was going to fall down	I was put on this for an anxiety disorder and the first night I took it was awful. I got extremely light-headed, it was ridiculous. I tried to read a book and couldn't even focus on the page because everything felt like it was spinning and I couldn't even see the page properly. I'd also get these insane head rushes that would come on suddenly and disappear in a few seconds. It was so uncomfortable that I had to sit down after taking it to make sure I didn't fall down and hurt myself. I thought maybe these side effects would go away, but they never did and after eight days I finally gave up and told my doctor I wasn't taking it any more.	M	27	8  days10 MG 1X D	9/13/2012Email
1	anxiety	Not good at all.Once I got to 30 mg.it affected my mind.I was unsure of my thinking.Then it affects my sensory process.Everything was loud to me.All things in life as very loud.This was awful for me.I just thought it was a panic attack...I wont take another pill in my life time.Busbur was like poision to me...

2	anxiety	sweating, mental fogginess, loss of emotion, poor concentration, loss of short and long-term memory	helped with my anxiety but at price that just wasn't worth it.  no continuity of thought and a feeling of detachment to everything - present, past, future.  if i had life-threatening anxiety, i might make that sacrifice but buspar has been something of chemical lobotomy.  i used to be mentally sharp and my profession requires me to be at the top of my game - not possible on this medication.  i had my first car accident two weeks after starting this - first thing that clued me into something gone wrong.  i tapered off fast and feel about the same after a week.  everything takes twice as long to process, always "double-checking" thoughts and perceptions (is it a green traffic light? is this the right word to use?, etc.)  hoping i get my old self back soon.  didn't realize how much i liked it.		41	70  days5 2X D	9/9/2012Email

4	chest pains (anxiety)	Mild (and completely tolerable) dizziness about 30 min to an hour after taking - doesn't always happen and I haven't figured out yet why it sometimes happens and sometimes doesn't.No stomach issues, but I always take this with food.If I don't take my 2 doses within about 14 hours of each other I shake and get fidgety.So far all the side effects are completely tolerable.	I was prescribed Buspar because the SSRI's made me incredibly ill - I'm really sensitive to most meds. I'm sleeping better than I have in a long time. I also noticed that I don't worry as much as I used to. I still worry about some things, but it is much easier to pull out of what used to turn into a huge downward spiral. For me, this drug takes the edge off the anxiety so I can learn to control it myself and hopefully get off the medication eventually.	F	37	19  days5 MG 2X D	9/7/2012Email
4	Anxiety, Panic Attacks	Sometimes get dizzy after I take.  I also notice that working on things like a computer or iPad can intesify the effect.  Other thing that bothers me is forgetfullness.  I don't know if that is the drug, me or a combination.  I am a Type A, pragmatic, driven individual.  My mind always races from one thought to the next, next task, next job.  Even in the past I would forget one thing because I had already moved onto the next thing in my mind.  I don't think I even realized it was happening in the past, but on the medication suddenly I have become cognizant of it.  Kind of weird and not sure what to make of it.	I had never had any prior medical conditions related to anxiety or depression.  However, due to a very stressful business (I own my business) I started having severe panick attacks and anxiety and I was not sleeping at all.  This went on for months.  I was exhausted, and I was at my wits end, so I finally went to my doctor.  He explained fully Buspar, etc... and with some reluctance on my part he prescribed it to me.  There is no doubt that it helped me.  He see's me every 90 days.   We discuss dosage until I got to my current level.  I'm a pretty big guy having played sports so I am on 10mg x 3d.  On the Buspar I felt more relaxed and at ease and things that typically bothered me seemed to suddenly seem less relevant to my day.  I didn't find myself getting worked up, or agitated as easily, and I am not as quick tempered.  My problem is that I don't want to be on something long term.  I tried to ween myself down and have actually gone off cold turkey twice.  What I found was not necessarily a return of anxiety when I did this but that I get agitated and irritable very easy.  This was a trait I had prior to the medication, but now I actually realize it is happening where in the past I didn't even know I was acting that way.  It was just my personality.  I catch myself being very short and abrupt with my wife and kids.  Not aggressive or physical but just less tolerant eand easy going.  My patience declines.  Bottom line for me is that it works and I actually realize that it w	M	45	2  years10mg 3X D	9/6/2012Email
4	anxiety	45 mins-1 1/2 hrs. after taking I feel dizzy, and sleepy. I notice this more when I take it in the morning.	I've been dealing with anxiety for about 5 years and never really did anything until now. I'm not one to take pills...especially ones for mental type health. My doctor started me off on 5mg twice a day for 3 days and gradually upped it so I'll be taking 30mg a day. I didn't have any side effects at first. Once I hit about 20mg per day I started feeling dizzy about 45 mins after I would take it. It seems worse in the morning and when I would up the dosage. I'm hoping once I'm on a steady dosage the side effects will go away. This medication has helped a lot in the 2 weeks I've been taking it. I'm in college and just sitting in class would spike my anxiety sometimes. Classes start tomorrow so I have my fingers crossed that this medication will do the trick and I can hopefully relax while I'm in class and focus on the subject and not my anxiety. My only regret is that I didn't do something sooner to deal with my anxiety.	F	21	2  weeks 2X D	9/4/2012Email
4	Anxiety, PTSD	I took Buspar because I have terrible nightmares that would keep me up for DAYS sleeping 3hrs in 5 days is never good and I cannot take narcotics. I haven't really had issues except for being tired all the time..... I wish I could take them both at night cause I'd sleep fantastic! after I take it for about a half an hour I'll feel a little dizzy and have to lie down until it goes away. I do have weird/bad dreams here and there but if you knew the dreams i was having before you would know these arent a big issue and most of these people would be like oh these arent a big deal lol all and all it doesnt take away all my anxiety but it sure takes that awful edge off also have been a cutter since age 8 and havent even felt the want or need since ive been on this medication which is an AMAZING thing. I have noticed a little memory loss and sometimes confusion it isnt horrible but for sure noticeable. like not being able to remember my voice mailbox passcode..... i mean really? ive had it for	all and all I would recommend this to someone with anxiety but I would advise to make sure and take it everyday because there is withdrawal and if you haven't had a panic attack and you stop this suddenly without weening yourself off first you most likely will I know many other people on Buspar which is how I found out about it! :) I hope everyone finds something that helps if this doesn't!

3	Anxiety	Dizziness, Forgetfulness, day time sleepiness, confusion, loss of sex drive.	The dizziness was handled by taking it at night, who cares if you're dizzy in your sleep. But a huge problem for me is confusion. This has happened for me on Abilify, Wellbutrin and Buspar. I would say a word similar to the word I thought I wanted to say, but would not be aware of what I had said wrong, unless someone brought it to my attention, like, "Put the milk in the dishwasher." Then I started writing wrong. Writing words with letters in the wrong order. I do have dyslexia, but this was new for me. Also, it's impossible to make it through the day without sleeping and my sex drive is in the crapper. The medicine is going in the trash. I know I'll have restless legs without it, but so be it.	F	47	8  months10 MG 1X D	8/19/2012Email
1	Anxiety	I was prescribed Buspar 7.5 mg three times a day. I took one dose at noon and I felt very dizzy within 15 minutes. About three hours later I had extreme nausea. At around 8 I had uncontrollable muscle spasms and numbness/weakness on my left side. The spasms continued all night and I only got maybe 30 minutes of sleep. At about 5:30 the next morning I had a severe panic attack with more tremors and chest pain. I went to the ER it was so bad. My doctor has since put me back on my Xanax and has me taking 0.5 mg 3 times a day as needed. It's been two days and my anxiety is still elevated but I'm getting better.	This has been the worst drug I've taken for my anxiety. Hopefully it'll work better for other people.	F	24	1  days7.5 3X D	8/10/2012Email

The pharmacist said there can be a 20 percent discrepancy in strength and recommended switching me back to previous manufacturer.  Have been back on the previous manufacturer and my body just can't handle the stuff.  I am light headed, high, there is a weight to my vision, and I have no energy.  Ugh!

1	anxiety	I took it on/off for 1.5 years and do I ever regret it. Buspar nearly ruined my life. It turned me into a different person. I HATED every minute of every day while on this medication. I didn't want to get up in the AM, couldn't sleep, always felt like a zombie, socially withdrawn. Now I have permanent tinnitus. I once had a mind like a steel trap; now I'm forgetful and have difficultly concentrating. I feel very awkward in social situations.	This drug is crap, just like all the rest of them. I will never take another pill for the rest of my life. I think drug companies and doctors alike should be ashamed of the way they push this poison on innocent consumers. DO NOT take this drug or any other anti-anxiety or anti-depressant. They will ruin your life!	M	30	1.5  years15 MG 2X D	6/25/2012

These all wore off.  I still have the dizziness, confusion. off balance feeling, lightheaded and disorientation.  It seems to be subsiding some and I will give it a few more days.

1	ANXIETY	No hot flashes, no dry mouth, no insomnia, no energy, NO ABILITY TO FUNCTION AS A HUMAN BEING!!!!! At the end of 13 days I was unable to bathe, feed or dress myself.	I left my bed in the morning (which required massive effort - equal to climbing Mt Everest), made it to the bathroom, tinkled, cupped my hand under the faucet to get water, exhausted myself walking the 15 feet to the sofa, got up at night, repeated the trip to the bathroom and forced myself to return the additional 20 feet to my bed. This went on for three days!!! At that time, since I did feel no anxiety, it occurred to me that though I did not want to die - not at all suicidal - I still felt as if someone wanted to dig me a 6 ft deep hole and go thru the trouble of placing me in it - I was sure I would have no desire to object!  Took myslef off and went back to the doc.this may work wonders for some - just not for me!!	F	48	13  days5 MG 1X D	6/13/2012Email
4	Bad anxiety during pregnancy	I'm 31 and in my last trimester of pregnancy. After 4 weeks of crippling anxiety and panic attacks that had me nearly agoraphobic, I broke down and started on Buspar 7.5mg/2x day.So far side affects have been mild and seem to be letting up already. I've had  dizziness, restless leg at night, and the last 2 days I've felt agitated/angry and more emotional than usual.My anxiety is not entirely under control yet, but its enough that I'm not missing my doc appts anymore, and can get out a little more and not panic.This is the first and only med I've tried for anxiety, and hope to ween off it eventually. Grateful to have it for now.		F	31	7  days7.5mg	5/25/2012Email

2	Anxiety, Social Phobia	Unbearable lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, and drowsiness 30 minutes after taking dose, and not ending until time for the next dose.	Buspar was prescribed to me because I was trying to conceive, and it is the only medication for anxiety that is acceptable for pregnancy. One month earlier, I had been given a prescription for Xanax, which was a miracle drug for me. I had never had such severe anxiety before, nor had I ever taken any medication more intense than penicillin, so taking Xanax was a strange and yet encouraging experience. At my first month check-in, I was concerned that I might be pregnant, so my doctor immediately switched the meds to Buspar, to help manage my issues long-term. I tried taking it for several days, and was miserable. I live 30 miles away from where I work, and it was impossible for me to drive to work because of the dizziness and nausea. I quit taking it and it took a day to leave my system. Now I want to try taking it again because I have a big conference coming up and I don't want to freak myself out, but I just can't handle the side effects... I can't do two or more weeks of this constant sickness. I will not take it again.	F	30	10  days5mg 2X D	5/11/2012Email
3	Anxiety	No side effects for the first week and a half, then starting getting alot of nausea and an upset stomach.  Can barely eat anything, and this has been going on for 4 days now.  Hopefully the side effects will go away soon.	Other than the side effects I am dealing with right now, I do feel like my anxiety has improved.  I don't think it has helped enough yet to say I would really recommend this, but if my side effects go away and I begin to feel better, than this drug should do the job.

3	GAD	I have only been taking this medicine so far for 4 days. It helps me relax a bit but at times I feel more anxious and irritable and these past couple of days I've had severe headaches. My doctor has me on it for 2 weeks to see if it will help. So far I've had bad experiences with antidepressants so I'm hoping an antiaxiety medication will help me and if not then I'm gonna find more natural ways of handling my anxiety.

4	Anxiety	So far I am well pleased.  Some dry mouth but other than that, nothing major. Has really helped me relax and sleep better.  Only taken for 2 days so far, so we'll see how well it helps me overall on a stressed day.		F	48	2  days5 mg bid	4/29/2012
3	GAD, PD	I was glad to see others describe this same exact thing.  About 1/2 hour after taking it I'd get dizzy but only when I moved my eyes.  The effect is really quite dramatic and if I sweep my eyes across a room it feels like my head is being rolled down a gravel road.  Very disconcerting.  Very, VERY vivid dreams.	Dizzyness is one of my panic triggers so this is a major drawback for this med, for me.  I find I feel like I need MORE klonapin when taking the buspar just to combat the panic from the dizziness.  I'm playing with the dose, breaking the pills in 1/2, etc, to see if I can find something that works.  Because, in a very preliminary way, I can kinda feel like it is easier to dismiss negative thought spirals.  Those negative thought spirals are the source of most of my panic attacks and my anxiety in general.	M	38	4  days5 MG 2X D	4/29/2012
5	Anxiety/depression	I feel exhausted for the first hour or so after I take it, and sometimes I get dizzy. In the beginning it made me nauseous as well. HOWEVER, the drug has helped me tremendously. I still have anxious thoughts, but resolving them is so much easier now... All of the physical responses to my anxiety that I used to experience are muted. Also, I find myself feeling happy on a regular basis.		F	22	4  weeks30mg/day	4/28/2012Email
5	Anxiety	Light headeded for about an hour after each dose; slight headache; upset stomache when taken without food; nasal conjestion	Do NOT consume excessive alcohol while taking Buspar!  In my case, mixing the two resulted in waking blackouts that I never had with just alcohol.	M	60	18  months10 3X D	4/28/2012

2	G.A.D. with Panic Attack	Dizzy, Uncoordinated, Confusion, Forgetfulness, Weight gain	I've taken this medication for 5 weeks and the only thing that's different is the experience of side effects. This medication makes it difficult for me to think about anything. Sessions with my therapist are difficult, because I can't keep focused on one subject, and I'm now very forgetful. To me it has some effect by making it difficult to focus on anything long enough to worry about it. But given the side effects, the therapeutic value isn't enough for me to continue on it, or recommend it.	M	44	5  weeks10 MP 3X D	4/6/2012Email
3	Pure O, Panic, PMDD	So Ive been on it for two months and I just emailed my dr this week about the newer symptoms. I had just seen her about 3 weeks ago since i ended up in the ER with chest pains that felt nothing like a panic attack. It was and still is a shocking type pain, not palpitations or heavy beating like I use to have. Ive also developed some blurry vission and headaches along with the tingling in my extremities. I feel like my ears also drain when I lay back and itch so badly i want to jam qtips in them just to sleep at times. I do, however fall asleep without even thinking now a days. I definately like that, and my dr told me it would get worse in the first few days before it got better. So true. I alsmost ran down my block after the 2nd or 3rd day on it because my panic attack was so bad but luckily my fiance was prepared and after shaking and thnking I was going to die, it didnt happen again. But that may have been the worst ever. Imediately the following day I was feeling great and I wanted	This was something that just started after my miscarriage as well as the severe panic.  I was on a roll.  But then, I had a very bad mental confrontation that made me withdraw for about 4 days with panic.  I keep taking the meds but i havent been right since.  Im shakey all day and nervous and panic is around the corner most times now.  Any pain I feel I think I have a blood clot and its the big one.  I keep flexing my muscles until I realize I need to relax and if I do while Im sitting still Ill fall almost immidiately to sleep.  I dont really think I feel depressed and it is PMDD time but everything is just not right right now.  I may need to up it a little bit because i still have the mental clarity and my sex drive is still up unlike before, I may be able to deal with everything else because its generally mild but the chest pain has to go!  Also, when I smoke pot now i have to smoke VERY slow (and almost un enjoyful) because Ive been panicking since the first day I started the meds.  I was only panicing when I wasnt smoking, not I just panic anytime.  Really sucks because the pot acts like a muscle relaxer i would usually smoke in the tub rught before bed, now Im afraid I will drown so I smoke in the bed most nights before I sleep.  When I smoke slower i dont get as high but I still get sleepy.  I didnt get dry mouth either but now I do and as far as gaining wieght, Im loosing because I dont have an apitite anymore since i dont smoke as much during the day now.

4	Anxiety, Depression, OCD	Dizziness for an hour after taking it, continued for the first 2 weeks and still occurs if I take it on an empty stomach.  Also, very vivid dreams every morning, sometimes nightmares :( I will continue to take it, this drug has greatly reduced my depression and excessive worry. It helped me wean off of clonazepam which I've been trying to do for years.		F	30	1  months10mg	3/20/2012Email

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011

Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011

4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor.

It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010

3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped. Abilify worked immediately and I haven't been depressed since.	F	24	3  weeks5mg 1X D	5/9/2010Email

Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal.

4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue.

2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now.

2	depression	Nausea the first few days, some constipation, cloudy thinking, increased appetite	Combined with Wellbutrin XL which suddenly stopped working for me after 3 years. After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

5	Major Depression, Anxiety	Have had some problems concentrating.  Although I love to read, it has been a struggle to focus for a sustained amount of time.  Mild weight gain.  Insomnia (but the Seroquel has completely cured that.)	Abilify has helped me like no other drug.  I am on it along with cymbalta, deplin, seroquel and ativan.  Within just a few days I was feeling better and am now able to exercise, clean my house and just moved across the country-something I could never have done during my depression.

3	Bi-polar, Depression, GAD	Terrible night sweats, very vivid, bizzare dreams, constipation, twitching, extreme lethargy...	I don't feel depressed and sad anymore.  I feel kind of leveled out, but I hate the tiredness all the time.  I can sleep for 10 hours, take my son to school, come home and go back to sleep for another couple of hours.  Then still have little to no energy for the rest of the day.  I was previously, taking 60 mg. of Cymbalta for almost 2 years, but my dr. switched me to this when I started to feel like dying again.  I also take Valium (5 mg.) when I feel anxious and panic coming on.	F	35	14  days5 mg. 1X D	2/12/2010Email

3	Bipolar II, PTSD	Started with 2 mg... upped my mood considerably, side effects then were indigestion, headache, nasal congestion..  those subsided after a few days. Upped to 5 mg, felt like a ton of bricks at first. Seems to be subsiding.	Mood elevation subsided and went back into the "I don't want to see or talk to anyone" and sadness.

3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!

2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010
1	depression, of all excuses	This is to the PARENTS out there who believe that if their child looks passive on the drug it is a godsend:  Beating someone over the head with a baseball bat can also make them sit still.  Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.  No more for me. Abilify- Forgetaboutit!!!!!!!	F	57	3  days	1/30/2010Email

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.

5	anxiety and depression	increased hunger and increased energy	This is a wonder drug for me. I thought I was going do die due to severe depression and anxiety. I am taking cymalta but after about a year, it didn't work. My MD RX'd 5mg of abilify along with my cymbalta every day. In my opinion, it saved my life. I feel like I have a reason to live and starting to enjoy the things I used to, just after one week of starting the med.	F	42	7  days	1/13/2010

1	anxiety and mood swings	increased heart rate that made my daughter pass out only after the 2nd day.	after first night of taking my daughter missed school the next day feeling nauseated and stomach cramps. That night she experienced indigestion/heartburn. She vomited. Sleepy but couldn't sleep. Feeling scared for no reason. Next day she passed out after being awake for 15 min. I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug. I got home and looked up the side effects and all of these were listed.  I can only say that we are glad we found out so quickly about this drug.	F	12	2  days	12/19/2009
2	OCD, racing thoughts.	drowsiness, leg pains, akathisia...	it is a great drug to calm down mind... seems to be on a "holy peace"... but side effects are too strong, just for me.	M	23	14  days	12/18/2009
3	bipolar	stopped after 14 months due to heart pulpitations, memory loss, trouble sleeping, slur speach due to excess syliva, after 12 months these things started. At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying. I am very uncomfortable giving a child this age any drug that is diagnosised by trial and error.	M	8	14  months	12/17/2009
2	unipolar depression	nasal stuffiness, dyslexia, word finding problems, increased appetitite, change (worsening) of vision, weight gain and wanting to graze constantly, watering eyes, feel like gravity is heavier (I have to sit down to brush my teeth), very restless around people, visual hallucinations (things disappear then reappear right where I saw them last), trouble focusisng while driving  --- weird.	I am taking 50 mg of lamictal concurrently with 7.5 mg abilify.  Affect is flatter, less mood swings, but more non-reactive than anything.  I'm not sure this is where I want to be. I have been able to get projects done that I had difficulty starting.  Some days I have energy, some days I don't.  I a fasting blood draw yesterday and haven't heard the results yet.  Continuing to take abilify is a quandary -- do I feel worse or better if I factor in all the weird side effects?  I will probably cut down on the dose since I really will be suicidal if I gain any more weight.	F	51	30  days	12/17/2009
3	Bipolar	Some weight gain, some restlessness	My 14 yr old son has been on 2.5 mg of Abilify for 3 months now.  He has gained 8lbs. so we are going to be watching this closely.

1	Post-opiate addiction depression	Cannot sit still, terrible anxiety after about 2 weeks, weight gain	This drug should be taken off the market.  After about the 3rd day you will not be able to sit still, ever.  It feels like there is something inside of you trying to get out.  After about 2 weeks I started having severe anxiety attacks almost constantly and came very close to having to be committed/hospitalized.  Smack your doctor if he recommends this.	M	26	 	12/13/2009
5	Depression, bi polar, etc.	NONE, ...perhaps a little sleepy. I only take 5 mg per day.	I know I am lucky for this but I really haven't noticed any side effects. Abilify has been great in that for me it creates a kind of peace of mind by eliminating the aberrant thoughts and whatnot.  I stop talking to myself so much, it helps me get out of my head so to speak...   Based on my positive experience I would tell others to start with no more than 5 mg for the first month...  	M	42	3  years	12/3/2009

But already being overweight, my Doc said the rapid weight gain was unacceptable and switched me to lamictal. Geodon had been working well for me, but the side effect of clenching my left side...mainly leg and toes, leaving my toes red and swollen, led me to stop taking it. Depakote made me a zombie.

4	autism spectrum disorder/ bipolar	Weight gain - up to 30lb	My daughter has had tremendous improvement in energy, concentration, and mood. Before taking Abilify she was on Geodon and had terrible akathisia. It also interfered with her ability to learn, and she had to withdraw from college courses to avoid failing. (She wound up finishing college with a B average, so you can see she's normally able to learn. ) Once she got off the Geodon, the irritability and stupidness went away but she became suicidal and self-injured. Since starting the Abilify she hasn't tried suicide even once. (Before that it was 14 times in six years.) I am grateful to the Abilify, but I wish she wasn't so hungry all the time.

I did experience about 3 days of severe headaches , migraines , but I weathered the storm and  the headaches went away. I take Cymbalta 60.mg and now 2 mg  abilify.I would stick with it since it works within 2 weeks.I sleep better, and  am more focused.

But than within a week my blood sugar sky rocket, I mean I was in the hospital with sugar over 600, my meter couldn't even read it, and the hospital had trouble bringing it down with fast acting insulin. Then my legs started shaking couldn't keep still. I had to go off it cold turkey because of my dangerously high sugar. It might work for some people but be careful of the side affects.

4	major depression and anxiety	the first night i felt like i was coming down from meth. i adjusted the times i took my meds, because i take asprin, reglan, nexium, and effexor 75's.  i took the asprin, nexium, and reglan with dinner, and the effexor and abilify, plus a half of a klonopin at bedtime, and i sleep through the stomach upset.	the second day i felt much better.  i was able to clean a room, take care of bills, and just never thought of negative things more than twice.  this is my third day, and i was able to joke around with my husband at the store, and though i still haven't showered, i may do that tonight, after i clean the bathroom.  i have great hopes for this med, and hopefully, i won't have to take it very long.

5	Bipolar depression	Some weight gain and insomnia.	This drug saved me from the darkest, deepest depression I have ever had to endure.  For over two years, I lost my will to see people, clean house, get dressed, etc.  After just three days on Abilify, I was able to get up, shower, go visit friends in New England (I live in South Florida), clean up my messy house and talk on the phone again.  I have gained a great deal of weight over the years from all different types of medication.  I accept the fact that medication makes me heavy and I am grateful to be heavier and sane than thin and crazy.	F	54	30  days	11/2/2009

Okay for about 2 weeks then experienced major nervousness, disorientation, jaw clenching, etc.  Now taking 2 mg. daily and feeling much better.  Still worried about side effects.  Not taking any other drug along with it.  Still experiencing anxiety but it is manageable.  You must wean yourself off this drug and not try to quit at once.	F	62	3  months	11/2/2009
3	ADHD	uncontrollable muscle movements, especially when in the car.	My son has been on Abilify (1 mg) for over a year.  We started on .5 mg because of his weight.  I did not want to medicate my child but I had no choice.  He was diagnosed at 2 with ADHD, but I didn't believe the psychologists because it's hard to diagnose something like that at age 2.  He is also ODD.  Last summer he was almost kicked out of daycare because of impulsivity, aggression, and inablility to sit still.  The Abilify worked for him then and continues to work.  I would love, however, if he didn't need it but now he's in kindergarten and has to take it to get through the day.  I was also able to get him a 504 plan with the school since I got another diagnosis at age 4 which was ADHD.	M	5	1.5  years	11/2/2009Email

People that I bump into at stores and such ask when I'm due!!Really too bad, I had no other side effects. but now I'm left with this big mess with my weight to clean up.	F	34	5  months	10/29/2009

3	Mood stabilizer along with Zoloft	I took 1 mg daily and it helped but caused too many side effects. I'm very med-sensitive. I've stopped Zoloft at this point.	I was on Zoloft and Abilify but stopped both due to weight gain. After a lot of research I'm adding Abilify back at 1 mg every three days. I'm very med-sensitive and tend to respond at lower doses than other people do. Will be back to post how this goes. Something has to help. I'm a wack-job right now. Can't control my thoughts and I dwell on bad stuff too much. Can't get sad events out of my mind etc. I have to give Abilify another chance at a reduced dose.	F	62	 	10/27/2009
4	Oneiric states	jittery at low doses, sleepy at high	It has helped me stop feeling like I'm in a dream all the time                                   but my mood is only a little better so far	F	59	3  weeks	10/25/2009
2	Depression	Insomnia, chest pain, blurry vision	Only on 0.5 mg. for three days.  Horrible insomnia no matter what time of day I take med.  Makes me drowsy during the day, hard to tell if my mood is improving due to the side effects.	F	35	3  days	10/24/2009
5	major depressive episode	Energy and hope restored.  Insomnia, head ache, speedy, shaky,visual disturbance,constipation.	Hopefully the side effects subside as my body gets used to the med.  I'm not willing to stop taking the med as I feel so much better with just 2mg of Abilify as an adjunct to Lexapro.  I have hope again.  I got my butt out of bed by day 3 (went shopping) then cleaned the house on day 5.  What a change from the depths of deep epression to my old self in less than a week...WOW!	F	46	10  days	10/23/2009
3	bipolar II	agitation, shakiness, acne, loss of libido, weight gain, inability to urinate	This med helped stabilize my mood a bit, but I could not get the full benefit because I could not increase the dose.  Every time I would go up on the dose, I would be hit by an avalanche of side-effects.  Had to get off eventually.	F	26	5  months	10/23/2009
3	To help my mood	Strange itching in my nose. I made myself bleed by trying to scratch it but couldn't help myself. It tasted good so I'm okay with it.	I've had depression of one kind or another most of my life.  I wanted to feel normal.  But, I ran out of samples after a week.  It wasn't long enough to find out if it would help.	M	56	7  days	10/22/2009
3	Mood Disorder	My son is 9 years old. He started in June on a mood stabilizer.  Abilify 5 mg, worked on mood, however he has gained 25 pounds. He can not stop eating.  He even sneaks food!! I don't know what the doctor is thinking.  We are taking him off.		M	9	4  months	10/19/2009
5	Bipolar Disorder	Very hungry, but able to manage it. Some difficulty sleeping, usually for an hour in the middle of the night. Spending money a little more than usual. Initially had a few days of headaches, not major.	This drug immediately snapped me out of low-grade depression that was steadily worsening. I started taking 2 mg of Abilify each morning and all of my depression symptoms lifted. I only realized how bad my concentration had been because it was so improved on this drug. Like others have said, I lost my hyper-sensitivity to people and situations and replaced that with a high tolerance for life's challenges -- big & small. The side-effects are very minimal at this point, but I'll be paying attention to see if this continues. Lastly, the fact that it works so quickly is a powerful asset if it works for you.	F	39	2  weeks	10/17/2009
1	depression/schizoaffective	can't stop pacing, feel like someone is inside me trying to get out of my skin, insomniac, no sex drive, having to put car into park at stoplights to keep from ramming into someone in front of me; insane.	i stopped taking this today and hope to G-d it doesn't last long in my bloodstream.	F	29	2  weeks	10/16/2009
2	possible bipolar	feel like a crack addict, hard to even sit here and type, hitting wrong keys, clenching jaw, restless beyond belief	on 10 mg...gained about 5-7 pounds, doc swears I need it, am bipolar but w out mania, just very low lows.......need to get off this but afraid of geodon...feel like a speed freak.  sleep is my only relief.............	F	38	6  weeks	10/7/2009
1	Mood stabalizer	makes me gain weight, tired, not sure if it is what causes memory loss, fatigue, moodiness, irratability.		F	35	2  years	10/7/2009
5	Anxiety, depression, mild mania.	Jitters, sleepiness, stomach distress.	This drug is very strong and very good.  I am taking 2 mg in conjunction with 7.5 mg of Lexapro.  It has reduced my severe PMS and helped me with my previous need to sleep 11 hours a day.  Note that I am on one tenth of the recomended starting dosage for someone who is bi-polar; I can only imagine the side effects, however for my purpose it has been a god send.	F	29	1  months	10/3/2009
1	Bi-polar	pacing, high blood sugar, foamy urine, severe thirst, fatigue, pancreatitis, kidney damage	Please stop taking the Abilify immediately.  My husband was prescribed Abilify and it almost killed him. He was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis for 10 days and then on home care hooked up to ivs for another 2 weeks. He is now diabetic and needs to take insulin shots 4 times a day. He is on a very strict low-fat no-sugar diet and may never have even a sip of alcohol ever again. His pancreas is permanently damaged. We are very lucky he is alive. Abilify is evil. Please do not take it. It will kill you.	M	30	 	9/30/2009Email
5	depression, OCD	more alert, motivated, racing thoughts greatly diminished, some nausea, no weight gain!	I was leery about taking this, others make it sound like a nightmare drug. I have no doubt that it affects some people badly, but for me, it made a huge difference. I do wonder if this will wear off after a few months, but so far 5 mg have allowed me to think clearly, get off the couch and accomplish things. No weight gain but dr has me on Metformin to regulate blood sugar and cravings, so that might be the trick there. Important for everyone to monitor their own reactions carefully, or ask family members to help, because every drug works differently for every person. YOU know best what helps YOU.	F	45	2  months	9/19/2009
3	depression/ bipolar	flattening/apathy, word-finding problems, short-term memory loss, trouble concentrating, not able to articulate thoughts and feelings, muscle weakness. To be fair, it made me manic for the first month I took it, which was wonderful, and I say I'm not depressed now, but is apathy really that different from depression?	When trying to stop taking 5mg, severe akathasia that literally kept me from sleeping at all. I'm tapering, now on 2.5mg, but still fearful that I will have the same symptoms when I discontinue again. Feeling a little trapped.	M	35	7  months	9/17/2009
3	Childhood Bipolar, ODD	WEIGHT GAIN, MUSCLE PAIN/STIFFNESS	My son has shown improvement in mood, decreased mood swings, more even temperament, however, he constantly complains about pain in his feet and legs. He describes as burning, stinging pain, mostly in his feet. We have observed more nasal stuffiness. He appears short of breath, at times, however, we are linking this to his weight gain (approx 12 lbs) and history of asthma. We are still observing and waiting to gauge any affect in cognitive abilities (school grades). Time will tell if the side effects are actually worth taking the medication.	M	11	3  months	9/16/2009
1	Bipolar 2-PTSD	Eating abnormal amounts - lethargy - no libido - no personality - sweating	This shit, and yes I say this profanely because that's what it is. It made me more depressed than ever. Yes the headaches and voices went away. But it made me socially anxious , paranoid , ripped me of my self esteem and made me gain weight because all I did and wanted to do was eat. I am an athlete, model, and full time mom. I kissed my life goodbye when taking this shit. Desparate, I stopped taking it. Which made life even more worse. I wanted to kill myself so badly because I wanted the pain to go away. It's all in my head. Mind over matter. I'll be the moodswingin crazy gal I am than risk my life. Also causes muscle weakness. Lucky to be able to carry anything up a damn flight of stairs. All in all, just stay away!!! Spent the whole summer in bed sleeeeping getting fat and suicidal. Whack!!!	F	25	2  months	9/14/2009
1	GAD/BPII/PTSD/OCD	Severe depression/out of touch	I was on Abilify for three weeks.  I started with the 10 mg for two weeks and up to 25 the third week.  On the 10 mg I started feeling "funny" and experiencing some side effects.  By the third week I was self mutlilating (something I have not done in 15 yrs.  I was so depressed I could not function at any level, very irritable and people just were too much to deal with.  All I wanted to do was sleep and just disappear.  My Therapist said it was like I did a 180 in two weeks and was so concerned she called my Psych.  After seeing my Psych, she immediately took me off it and put me on Geodon...not sure if that is a possitive change or not.	F	37	3  weeks	9/14/2009
3	Bi Polar 2	Akathesia, insomnia, anxiety, weight gain, head aches	The Akathesia was awful.  I would lie in bed thinking I was weak or flu-ish, but once in bed I could not get comfortable.  My workouts decreased as I felt weak, dizzy, short of breath, lost balance while stretching. My face would sweat way more than normal.  I could tell I was starting to gain weight and would pack on the pounds rapidly if I did not stop taking this. Since exercise is therpeutic for me, the abilify took that away from me.  BUT it did help control my mood swings (by making me feel like an emotionless zombie) and the need to act out my irritability. However, inside I felt increasing anxiety and irritability.  The side effects just aren't worth it.	F	30	2  months	9/8/2009
3	Depression/Anxiety	I have gained 20 pounds and am not eating any more than normal.  The medicine definitely lifted my depression, but the weight gain now has me looking like a pig.  And, it seemed to increase my libido.	Started off with 5 mg; now am down to 2.5... but, because of the weight gain, I am asking to get off of this medication.	F	40	4  months	9/5/2009
1	anxiety	Akithesia	Do not take this med. I had severe akithesia whereby I had a constant feeling of having to 'move' It was exhausting and I thought it would never leave which made me feel even more panicked. It was the most scared I'd ever felt on a medicine. Before this I truly never paid attention to side effects on labels, now I do.	F	38	 	8/29/2009
4	Bi-Polar	Akathisia, increased libido, insomnia	Loved it the first week until the Akathisia kicked in.  Then I wanted to jump out the car while it was moving... Halfed my dosage, no help.  Halfed the dosage again, no help.  Now I am on 1/8 of the pill.  Akathisia is gone, but increased libido went away.  Still have insomnia taken care of by Ambien.	F	46	1  years	8/28/2009Email
5	for incentive, to mk decisions	none except lots of hope, energy, lack of fear,loss of procrastination, able to make decisions, ability to focus just an all around zest for life with unlimited happiness	If your anti depressant or anti anxiety meds work but you still have no energy, ask your Dr to add Abilify. I had never heard of it but now instead of thinking of everything I need and want to do I am optimistic and bubbling with enthusiasm and energy. Now instead of reading all day long I am cleaning and doing hobbies, kyaking, running, dancing and marching with my grandchildren Whats next a sea plane ride and travel. Was just weeks ago I was close to Agoraphobia. If your meds only get you to the bottom of the mountain looking up and wishing you would, try Abilify, you will climb that mountain, maybe even run up it and then dance on the top!!!	F	62	3  weeks	8/23/2009
2	bi polar 2	weight gain, sugar cravings, excessive sleepiness, inability to exercise (no stamina, gasping for breath)	It helped with irritability (because nothing seemed to matter) but left me unable to live normally and my friends all asked if something was wrong because I was so quiet and getting more quiet with each passing day.  Because the side effects were so crippling, I have stopped taking Abilify and switched to Geodon.	F	60	4  months	8/18/2009
1	Bipolar I	Akathisia, loss of interest in life, Always sleepy, high anxiety, catatonia	Got really bad Akathisia after only 3 days on 10mg. Was taken during a bad manic/pschotic state so was forced to stay on it. Initially was bumped to 20mg which made me catatonic. Back to 10mg kept hallucinating. Added Cogentin, made Akathisia go away but severe anxiety came in it's palce along with lack of motivation and no interest in anything. Severe confusion followed. This sucked my will to live. The Akathisia was so severe I was suicidal.	M	32	7  months	8/17/2009
3	depression; withdrawal aid	VERY rapid weight gain (10 lbs in a month!), constipation, swollen legs and feet, back pain	GOOD NEWS: This drug helped me in the horrible phase of discontinuing Cymbalta.  I was no longer moody and nasty-tempered.  BAD NEWS: the fact that my face is so puffy I now look like a fatter, older version of myself and I now have GOBS of fat in places I never gained weight before (back of arms, waist) proves this stuff is POISON.  It may inhibit thyroid function, because I am not eating more than I usually do (in fact my appetite is less than normal--wierd!) yet I am piling on weight. The constipation, nausea and fatigue aren't fun either.  And I look like CRAP: bloated, haggard, pale, and unhealthy. Phasing off this med asap!	F	31	2  months	8/14/2009Email
5	depression	I have experience swelling of the calves. This may not be related to the Abilify, as I have had a kidney transplant.	My family has a history of serious depression to the point of being institutionalize. For many years now my brother and I have tried one drug after another. Nothing helped us 'open the curtains'. Two mg of Abilify each morning, after just a couple of days, has given us our lives back. This is a miracle drug for both my brother and my self. I must include, we have only been on this medicine for two or three weeks.	M	60	18  days	8/8/2009Email
5	wellbutrin	somewhat more tired, some difficulty urinating..	A Great help.. relieved pain in my shoulders and elbows.. and has rid me of most of my suicidal or weird thoughts and voices.	M	57	25  days	8/5/2009
4	bi-polar 1 disorder	nausea, vomiting, insomnia	I am 5mg, for just about a week, first 2 days I was very hostile, last 4 days restless with insomnia and cant eat much.However I have energy, I get things done, I am back to being social which I was not for over a year and half. No fears of public and can focus to read, play games etc.  My patience level is much better.  Just would like to know when the insomnia and nausea will pass.	M	41	1  weeks	8/5/2009Email
2	Possbile Bipolar 2	Extreme sweating, extreme nausea, weird chest movement, insomnia	Been on Celexa for 10 years now, up and down in dose as lifes stresses went up and down... 40mg now for past 2 years. Doctor added abilify for possible Bipolar 2. I took at 7pm and within 2 hours I was sweating profusely and kept doing so for the next 24 hours, then it started to go away. I wasn't hot, I even cranked up the air conditioner, didn't help at all. I soaked my clothes and sheets. This caused some dehydration which didn't help the nausea. That was also extreme. I never actually vomited but still laid on the bathroom floor just in case. The first few bouts of it I could barely move. I was flushed and weak and trembling it was so bad.I also couldn't sleep, which I'd already been fighting insomnia the past few months. But this made it worse as I couldn't sleep more then 10-30 mins at a time. The constant sweating didn't help when trying to sleep.I'm not saying don't take this med. I dealt with bad nausea for weeks when I first started it, and also when I went without for over a week. Just wanted to share what happened to me	F	32	1  days	8/2/2009
5	major depression/Bipolar	None really..Some initial insomnia but got better with time. Sexual sides are minimal and never a problem	A great medicine.It worked the 1st day I took it (5 mg)..I felt so much better..NOTHING has worked for me except Abilify and Parnate. People love to rant and rave when something is not working for them. Fine. But please don't tell other people to stay away from the drug because it doesn't work for you. If your having a hard time finding something that works, try this med. It works quickly so you'll know if it's for you without having to wait 2-4 weeks.	M	49	60  days	7/31/2009
1	Bipolar Disorder	Weight Gain	I was taking this medicine for about half a year and was recommended to not go off of it. In this six month period I gained 67 pounds. It also made it very hard to lose the weight afterward. Here I am almost two years later, and I am five pounds away from getting rid of the 67 I initially gained. Although the weight is gone, the stretch marks remain and still will. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE.	F	22	6  months	7/27/2009
5	schizo personality disorder	I LOVE ABILIFY!!  It is my favorite antipsychotic.  Side effects range from mild tiredness and hunger spells to insomnia at bed time.  But that helps with Ambien CR which my doc loves to prescribe like candy to me!  Abilify helps tremendously with voices and does not give me the akathisia movement disorder like the "dones" risperidone and ziprasidone antipsychotic do 100% of the time.	This medicine is a mild antipsychotic when it comes to side effects when compared to other antipsychotics.  I would recommend ABILIFY (aripiprazole) over the other atypical antipsychotics any day.	M	29	6  years	7/23/2009
1	Schizophrenia	Couldn't stop moving, couldn't sleep.  Paranoid, anxious.	This is hell.	M	18	4  weeks	7/22/2009
1	major life long depression	I had a STROKE after 9 days on this awful medicine. I've been on wellbutrin for years and started to feel a deeper depression than normal. My psychiatrist put me on Abilify as a boost. Within 3 days I became very confused and very tired. It was the weekend, on Monday I called the doctor. He said it was the side effects and would clear up, that I had only been on it 6 days. On Thursday, I called and told him that I was stopping it. In addition to the confusion, I was having a hard time talking. He said the side effects would probably be gone by my appointment. They got worse! I couldn't remember how to use my utensils, my toothbrush etc. I couldn't spell or write, was mixing up the phone number even if I was looking at it. Monday, he still felt that it was side effects but at my insistence he sent me right to a neurologist, who ran me through a number of tests. He agreed that it was side effects. If I wasn't better in 3 weeks, he'd do a CAT scan. After 1 week insisted on the scan and lo	I was 62 years old and do not have dementia. My doctor did not consider me elderly. At what age does the drug company consider elderly? My doctor said that this shouldn't have happened. I am better but not back to the way I was before Abilify and the stroke. After 13 months I don't feel that I am getting any better and I honestly feel the problems I am still having are permanent. But it could have been worse, I wasn't paralyzed! Even with the computer, this write up has taken me 2 1/2 hours to compose.	F	63	9  days	7/15/2009Email
2	Some psychotic disorder	Akathisia. Insomnia.	Tried Abilify for a while and was hoping the initial akathisia and insomnia would go away, but after a month there was no change, so I gave it up.	M	34	1  months	7/14/2009
1	depression	I had bad nausea and vomiting. Very bad acne. Super drowsy.	It didn't even help with my condition. I have been trying it out for about 4-5 weeks and the side effects are horrible. I was still the same person I was before takin Abilify if not worse.	F	21	5  weeks	7/10/2009

1	Bipolar	Explosive headaches, sexual dysfunction, blurry vision, muscle stiffness, indigestion, nausea, loss of concentration and memory impairment	I am a heart patient and have also experienced sky high BP. I have no idea why this drug would even have been prescribed to me. I agree it is a poison.	M	51	1  months	7/5/2009
4	Pediatric BP rapid cycling	tired, sleepy,	9 yr old boy, started on 10 mg then increased to 15 mg. Takes 900mg lithium and 15 mg Abilify. Takes all at night due to sleepiness. Is a bit far away during the day on the 15 mg. Hardly any mania or outbursts. No complaints of inner restlessness. No weight gain. Appetite is normal.	M	9	1  months	7/3/2009Email
1	Bipolar	Miserable, horrible drug: extreme fatigue, bloated face, mental sluggishness and confusion.	NO theraputic effects whatsoever for me. Useless. I took it for about 6 months in 2003 and was taken off it by my psych. at my sister's urging. She came to see me at Christmas and was shocked at what she found. I was not even aware of how bad it was until I was taken off it.	F	41	6  months	7/3/2009
1	BiPolar II	Severe headache, tooth pain, muscle aches, depression, lethargy, trouble sleeping, jaw pain.	Called doctor and she said I had an allergic reaction to Abilify and to discontinue use immediately.  If you have any of the symptoms listed above, contact your doctor ASAP.	F	35	1  days	7/1/2009
5	Schizoaffective Disorder	I initially experienced Akathesia, Nystagmus and sleepiness. Then my dosage was recently upped from 20 mgs to 25 mgs due to break through depression, after that I did feel some nausea. Other than those few side effects I've felt fine on Abilify. I would recommend Abilify to others who are being carefully monitored by their Psychiatrist. I just happen to have an excellent Dr., which does make a difference.	I take Abilify along with Divalproex Sodium ER 1250 mgs for migraines, Clonazepam, Cogentin 1 mg for Akathesia, 2 grs of Armour Thyroid for Hypothyroidism.	F	47	5  years	6/28/2009

3	anxiety/pmdd/depression	I have tried all the SSRI's and am currently taking Cymbalta 60 mg daily.  I was told that abilify helps so many people in my situation but so far the side effects have been miserable.  Yes, I am more mellow and not as irritable, but I have a constant headache/eye pain (like a migraine), I cannot sleep and I'm nauseous.  I'm reading all these other comments and I'm terrified of gaining weight, so I think I'm going to stop.		F	39	3  days	6/21/2009
1	misdiagnosed	SEVERE AKETHISIA- I had to walk out of the class room daily and skip class because I COULD NOT SIT STILL TO SAVE MY LIFE i felt like something was inside me trying to come out...my mind could NOT control my body, SEVERE WEIGHT GAIN ..and I used to always be thin) made me OBSESSED with food...I would do anything to get to food and i would eat and eat and eat uncontrolably. Never have I been suicidal, but I wanted to die just to get rid of the akethisia it was LIVING HELL. I have permanent side effects... i'm way slower in the head...memory loss...stuttering... I would lie down and not be able to get out of bed I was SO tired at times.	POISON! google AKETHISIA and read the hell it could bring you and your loved ones.DO NOT TAKE ANTI-PSYCHOTICS ... they WILL make you CRAZY so they can keep giving you more pills when you complain about the side effects they will more than likely tell you it's symptoms of something else and just put you on more medication that will permanently damage your brain and life. I can't believe they give this to people knowing what harm it can do.	F	19	6  weeks	6/18/2009

2	Major Depression	weight gain, fatigue/tiredness/drowsiness, loss of concentation	I have ADD and even though I am on Adderall the abilify counteracted it and I had a lot of trouble focusing in school. I am tired all the time getting 12 hours of sleep a night and still taking a 3-4 hour nap in the afternoon. It did help with my depression but recently I have been having suicidal thoughts. I also gained 15 pounds in just a few weeks.	F	20	2  months	6/15/2009

2	Anxiety	Hallucinations, seeing spots (colored), toothaches (the whole right side of my mouth) I know this because when I stopped taking, it was way improved. Headaches, angry outbursts, very very tired 24/7.	Did help the anxiety. However, I couldn't tolerate the side effects I listed. It seemed each day was worse than the day before.	F	35	1  months	6/7/2009
1	Depression	Insanity. I know that sounds wierd, crazy or whatever, but that is the closest word I know to describe it. For three days I went into a world where I couldn't understand what was going on aroung me. I would start to speak, the words were clear in my head, but gibberish would come out. I was terrified for much of the time, curled in a ball, feeling I was about to die at any second.	This drug is now advertised as an add on supplement to anti-depressants. This is crazy! It's an anti-psychotic! It has a side affect profile that if fully revealed to patients would sent them running for the nearest exit.	M	28	4  days	6/7/2009
1	wrongly diagnosed	So, I am posting this message mainly to help others with their emotional/psychological struggles.  I would like to give people who have been put on anti-psychotics some pointers and guidance that might help.  I was on abilify for six years and regret it completely.	Honestly, Abilify works wonders for some people and for many others I can make matters worse.  I have a strong desire to help others so they hopefully don't have to go through what I went through to get to a state of well being.  Everything is anonymous!!

4	Major depression w/ psychosis	Something similar to restless leg syndrome, fidgeting	I've now been diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features along with some other things.  Abilify was prescribed to me because my initial diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder. The two disorders are somewhat similar.  Abilify has more or less completely eliminated my psychotic symptoms and I do well on this medication.  I have not experienced any negative side effects in the past 2 years.  For the first 6 months I had restless legs and some fidgeting problems where it was hard to sit still.  Those symptoms passed and I feel pretty much fine at this point.  I also take Effexor XR, Lamictal and Librium.	F	31	2.5  years	5/29/2009
4	Depression & Paranoia	I've been taking 2 mg Abilify for 2 weeks now, along with my usual 40 mg Prozac and 900 mg Lithium. I feel like I'm on speed or something with abilify! I have no appetite (a good thing-could lose a few lbs), I feel restless, but I feel like I see things differently now. I also have a "full" sensation in my head and a little shakiness. I'm scared, because I keep reading all these bad things about Abilify, but I feel soooo much more alert & interactive now. If only the restlessness would go away, this is a miracle med for me. How long until these side effects taper off?		F	28	14  days	5/28/2009
3	Bipolar Disorder (rapid cycling)	Weight gain (about 20-30 pounds in a six months...without changing eating habits), extreme tiredness, lethargy, shaking/tremors, increased levels of insulin (blood sugar).	It helped my manic episodes and leveled out my mood. However, I don't feel it was worth the weight gain and increased blood sugar levels, which contributed to reoccurring, prolonged (and quite painful) yeast infections.	F	20	6  months	5/23/2009
1	bi polar	This was the worst medicine ever. I tried it for 6 weeks, starting at 2mg, and by the end of the time taking 15mg. My body would not stop moving. I couldnt read a book or watch TV. I found myself taking too many sleeping pills (and i never take sleeping pills) to counteract the movement so that i could fall asleep. This medicine should be used as a torture technique!!. The the doctor gave me sleep meds, and blood pressure medication to help with the Abilify side effects.(the blood pressure meds were supposed to make me stop moving...) So she had me on three medications! (NOt to mention this medicine is extremely overpriced!) You couldn'tpay me to take this medicine again. I am on Lamictal 25mg (a very low dose) and its a miracle. I bet this medicine will be pulled soon. It was just like a poison! Be very careful trying this medication.		M	39	6  weeks	5/19/2009
2	depression and ptsd	inner restlessness and desire to drink or eat	i took this for about two monts along with wellbutrin and at first had a hard time staying awake during the day.  after that passed i began wanting to drink so badly it was driving me nuts.  i began to drink to control the restlessness i felt because i was climbing the walls in my house just trying to get away from myself.  i quit taking it a week again and with just the wellbutrin i feel much better.	F	29	7  weeks	5/18/2009
5	Depression	Feeling a little "speedy" mentally, waking up early (4am), weight gain (about 10-15lbs) in 2mos.  Sometimes I feel overtired and not able to sleep enough to catch up.	I was depressed and Cymbalta was not helping---I could not motivate myself to do anything, even just taking a shower was hard.  Went back to Effexor XR (150mg) which had helped before with 5mg of Abilify and I could almost immediately feel the difference.  Wish I felt a little more energy physically, but I do feel a lot better.	F	48	2  months	5/16/2009
3	psychosis/spirit possession	weight gain, perhaps constipation, perhaps insomnia	I've been taking Abilify for 3 years and liked it the most of all the anti-psychotics I tried. Resperidol made me gain a lot of weight quickly. And Haldol was abominabal - I ate constanly and got ridid muscles, but that was also from all the anti-psychotics I tried. The key for me was finding the right DOSAGE, which was much lower than my doctor put me on originally. 5mg Abilify was just right, but I've been gaining more and more weight over the years and want to go off it due to this serious problem. It did however, protect me from the spirit invasion or what others call "voices" or "hallucinations". The risk of psychosis is one problem by going off of it, but so is diabetes and obesity, as well as other side effects from staying on it. I have weighed the consequences and made my choice. I will add that I'm perturbed with my doctor for not monitoring my weight while I've been on this drug. I think he doesn't want to see that it causes obesity.	F	46	3  years	5/13/2009Email
5	Bipolar Disorder	None that I know of	It has saved my life.	F	42	2  years	5/12/2009
4	Schizofrenia/Severe Anxiety Mix	Extreme dizziness & Muscle Tremors.	It works well, don't get me wrong. I switched from Invega. I'm on only 10mg and will probably switch to 25mg by next fill up. Totally helps with the anxiety and works well as an antidepressant. I've been able to focus more, but i'm also on Vyvanse for ADHD. I've had no suicidal thoughts what-so-ever. 10mg is a bit low, in my opinion anyway. Also, if you take any anti-psychotics, through my experience, for a month straight, the side effects generally seem to wear a bit off.	M	15	1  weeks	5/8/2009
1	Depresstion	Facial tics - blinking, tongue thrusts to the point where I had sores in my mouth, muscle stiffness, joint pain.  Uncontrollable muscle movements, twitching, jerking. Fatigue.	This medication was the worst thing that I ever took.  I had "parkinson syndrome" from it.  The facial tics & tongue thrusts lasted over a year.  I had to take Vitamin E for the past 18 months to get rid of them.  I still have blinking tics.  My daughter's doctor wanted her to try it(in small doses) but I refused. This was a horrible experience for me.	F	44	6  months	5/8/2009Email
4	bi-polar depression	Week 1: very slight weight gain -- about 2 lbs. that seems to have leveled off; a few days of extreme fatigue. Overall: slightly irritated stomach (I believe this makes me eat more, and is responsible for the weight gain), lighter sleeping, more sleep disturbances. I used to sleep like a log. Now I sleep like a cat. I miss my old sleep.	I was on abilify once before. The doc took me off due to my "speedy" response. But I have ADD, and I really liked the abilify. New doc is a-ok with my response, so long as it works for me. I'm also on Adderall and Welbutrin. Since starting this drug, I actually feel like doing things rather than just thinking about doing them and then thinking that I'll never finish and then getting depressed and hating myself. I'm more social. Self esteem is better too. Disruptive and ruminative thoughts are way down. Overall, I like.	F	33	16  days	5/7/2009
5	Bipolar 2	Initially stiffness and emotionless face, subsided within weeks.	This drug is a God-send to my 9 year old without it he would likely be in the hospital.  Almost totally normal with it.	M		15  months	5/6/2009
1	depression	facial tics where my left side of my face moved with my inability to stop it, my legs felt like they were filled with lead and I didnt want to work out anymore, my feet tingled and my toes hurt this was the creepiest drug I have ever taken	I felt happy but the side effects were so horrible it wasnt worth being happy (and that says a lot) I'm on wellbutrin and pristiq and this medication was a nightmare. My psych really pushed for me to take it and I had to really stand up for myself to say no. Dont let the commercial fool you and keep trying other drugs cuz abilify is poison	F		2  months	5/6/2009
3	anxiety, bi polar, chest pain	i can barely do anything...i just want to sleep until it hurts.  while sleeping i feel as if i am on a trampoline, i just toss and turn and bounce.  today(day 4) i feel jittery.	i was put on abilify because i was having panic attacks and feeling as if i was having heart attacks.  tight chest and trouble breathing, er visits.  doc thinks its in my mind and that im bipolar.  i cant believe that chest pain so severs is mental.  i havent had a bad attack yet but i feel as if i will collapse, i hope this tired dead-battery feeling goes away or i cant take it, i have a 2 month old.	M	36	4  days	5/4/2009Email
4	Bipolar Disorder	weight gain, inner restlessness.	I've been on lamictal, seroquel, and geodon since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder two months ago.  Each of those medicines gave me horrible side effects.  Abilify is the only medicine that has helped.  I am calmer, do not have my angry and irritable outbursts.  I'm also a self-injurer and haven't done anything since a couple days being on this medicine.  The downfall, I've been on this medicine for 2 weeks and I've gained 12lbs.	F	23	2  weeks	5/3/2009
2	Bipolar 2	Insomnia, wide awake every hour or two; impulsivity, shopping, eating, speaking; 15lb weight gain in 1 month; became nearly inarticulate, could not convey my thoughts or feelings very well at all; hypomania	I took Ability for a month as an adjunct Zoloft 100mg, which has stopped working.  In term of relief from the depression, the Ability worked wonderfully.  Because of the side effects, I dropped from my initial dose of 5mg to 2mg, and the depressive symptoms/suicidality returned nearly immediately.  After bumping back up to 4-4.5mg, the side effects returned.  This med may be tolerable for others but the side effects were intolerable for me.	F	36	1  months	5/2/2009
5	Bi Polar Disorder, Psychosis	Weight Gain (15 lbs in 6 months)	My daughter is doing EXTREMELY well on Abilify. Her rapid cycling is nearly zero. Her psychosis is also tremendously better. The change is almost as if she is a different kid. She went from extreme  mania episodes that cycled at times within minutes. To near stable in her moods in just days after beginning this medication. Her doctor wants to change her to Geodon due to the weight gain. Weight was never an issue for her until she started taking Abilify. But I think with the improvement in her mental stability a little weight gain is not that significant. I love this medication. She was on 5mg per day up to 7.5 per day after 2 months. It's effectiveness wore off at about 2 months in. No problems since upped to 7.5mg a day. She has no trouble sleeping. I didnt realize how her mania was affecting her sleep until starting this medicine and she is actually tired when it's time for bed. No complaints from me.	F	7	6  months	4/26/2009Email
2	Bipolar	Severe akathesia!  The restlessness drove me up a wall.  I also experienced word loss, short-term memory loss, stiff muscles and joints, tremors in my left hand (I'm left-handed), raised body temperature, weight gain (15 pounds in 4 months), no sex drive, increased breast size with milk coming out of them, fatigue during the day and sleeplessness at night. I took Abilify before I want to bed.  I have tried almost every dose: 30mg, 20mg, 10mg, 5mg and 2mg.  At 5mg and above I experienced euphoria that made me feel like I could probably jump off of a building for fun and be o.k.  At doses below 5mg I still experienced all of the side effects (except for the euphoria)and became extremely irritable and hostile, but otherwise I had no emotions.	To be fair, my paranoia went away. This was the only medication I was taking.	F	45	4  years	4/23/2009
2	Bipolar Disorder	Brain fog, Stiff muscles, inability to ever sit still or relax,	Abilify caused me to not be able to relax my muscles and I was always uncomfortable.  I had a hard time sleeping at night.  Wasn't what I expected. I had to go off of it becuase my grades in school started to drop.	F	23	2  weeks	4/17/2009
5	Mixed bipolar		I have been on Abilify for 2 years with no side effects. It has stabalized my mood along with Tegretal and Pristiq. While my antidepressant often stops working or has to be adjusted in the dose, the Abilify 10 mg has worked for me. I take all my meds at bedtime and sleep well, have no appetite increase or weight gain(terrible wt. gain on Depakote that I have since  lost), no nausea, dizziness, or vivid dreams. For me it's a life saver and I'm able to continue to work at a high functioning capacity.	F	60	2  years	4/16/2009
4	Suicidal thoughts	My mouth is dry and i've noticed i'm not hungry but my muscles ached terribly for the first two weeks.	I'm glad I didn't listen to the scary potential side effects. On abilify I feel even but I still feel emotions only I dont think about how much I hate myself anymore. I'm surprised at how this has worked so far.	F	35	2  months	4/16/2009
3	depression, over fatigue & stress	at first my husband take zyprexa but his doctor changed it to abilify due to gaining his weight. after a week i notice that my husband became restless and move or walk like a robot, though he can sleep he always tell me that he tired very easy as well his muscles. his craving more than before so his cholesterol became higher. so i decided to stop taking abilify and i noticed that my husband movement became normal.		M	33	13  days	4/16/2009
3	aggression & phycotic eppisodes	Tiredness, sleeplessness, extreme fluid retention. pain in the left side of neck	My son has DownSyndrome and a level of Autism, he has also been diagonised as having Psyschotic eppisodes, He gets very aggressive He has been on Risperdal(disasterous). Zyprexa(worked on the outbursts, but huge weight gain,and the threat of him developing Diabetes) He's been on Abilify now fo thirteen days but I'm getting very concerned about side effects, So I'm now considering stopping the drug, It has helped keep him calm, but at what risk to his health,We are running out of options for him	M	18	13  days	4/15/2009Email

3	Resistant Depression/Anxiety	15 lbs weight gain.  Restlessness.  Chronic insomnia.  Night binging (and subsequent purging to curb weight gain).	Ironically, this drug (5 mg to 2 mg with 150 mg of Wellbutrin XR and 20 mg of Adderral XR) helped my self-confidence in social situations by minimizing my anxiety and shutting off my self-critic -- despite shattering my self-image (as a result of relentless weight gain).  At my best, I didn't care.  I shopped nonstop -- because I was constantly gaining weight (in reality) and my clothes no longer fit me.  In my case, my doctor did not listen to my threshold for weight gain.  In two years, I gained 20 lbs with various antidepressants.  Desperate to gain some resemblance of myself back, I began purging.  In the eight months that I have been (on/off) the Abilify, I have vacillated from hypomanic (on) to hopelessly depressed (off).  In fact, the spiraling phase upon quitting the drug (without compliance) has translated to increased anxiety (and dependence on Xanax) and debilitating depression. I do not recommend this drug to young women whose self-image is inextricably related to their appearance in anyway.	F	33	8  months	4/1/2009
3	Depression	Speedy manic feeling, shakiness, feeling like I couldn't sit still, a little nausea in the beginning, craving for sweets at night, WEIGHT GAIN.	I was already taking Prozac for depression but still having depression symptoms, so the Dr. prescribed Abilify to supplement the Prozac. In the beginning, this medicine really helped to pull me out of the funk that I was in.  I felt energized, productive, and like my overall attitude was very much improved.  After a couple or 3 weeks, however, I noticed that I was gaining weight at an alarming rate.  In the 2 months that I took this drug, (at a low dose of 1mg/day) I gained over 15 lbs!  I also felt strangely like shopping and spending money all of the time, almost like I was having a manic episode. All in all, I felt much less depressed, but stopped taking for fear of becoming REALLY overweight. Note: after I stopped this drug, I felt more depressed than ever and almost suicidal.  If you stop, you should probably taper off gradually!	F	45	2  months	3/29/2009Email
5	pediatric anxiety/possible bipolar	nausea & headache for the first few days. Also, tired during the day for 1st week. otherwise, none.	This medication has worked wonderfully for my daughter. She has been on it 3 weeks and for the first time in her life I heard she had a "wonderful" week at school. The side effects are most definately tolerable and my daughter says this medication changed her life. Parents-don't be afraid to try it. I know everything on this site sounds bad, but it has been a Godsend to my family.	F	8	3  weeks	3/20/2009
3	Post Tramatic Syndrome & OCD	I wake up several times in the night and am not able to go back to sleep usually for an hour or so.  I have never had this problem in the past.  I have also been very restless and am not able to stay focused on one task for two long.  I have to be doing something that is keeping me very busy.  I have also noticed increased anxiety with this medication.		M	36	1  months	3/15/2009

5	manic/psychotic episode	restlessness at first, waking up several times in night	Switched to it from risperidone, 4 months after a manic/psychotic episode. I was depressed on the risperidone but depression lifted on aripiprazole (an antidepressant was also added). Didn't have the demotivation and lethargy I experienced on risperidone.	M	24	9  months	2/24/2009
3	autism  bipolar	painful erection of penis	My 6 year old son never had a problem with erections until taking Abilify.  Then it happened all the time and was very painful.  The doctors would not believe me that this was happening - even though it is rare side effect.  His behaviour settled down on the abilify; but we have not seen an increase in bad behaviour since taking him off the med.	M	6	3  months	2/21/2009
1	Bi-Polar	Could not sit still.  Felt confused.  When I say I couldn't sit still I mean it.  This drug had me jittery, and it was the worst feeling I have ever had in my life.  Sit down to watch TV, standing up thirty seconds later.  To come off the drug was worse then the side effects of the drug while taking it.	Be very careful of this drug, it is very powerful, and it takes a good month to get it out of your system.	M	38	4  months	2/21/2009
1	Depression	I went from being moderately depressed, to feeling suicidalwithin 2 weeks. Acute anxiety and paranoia followed.	This is a very dangerous drug.	F	41	16  days	2/20/2009
4	Depression	Insomnia	I started taking this b/c my regular depression just wasn't doing the job. Now I take 2mg of abilify and 150mg of Effexor XR and I haven't felt this good in months. Absolutely no side effects from the abilify except difficulty staying asleep during the night. That's why I gave it a 4. It did exactly what it was supposed to do! Thank goodness!!!!	F	31	20  days	2/13/2009
4	Bipolar and Schizophrenia	None that I can directly attribute to Abilify	I have been taking Abilify for over 2 years now. As a result, I can no longer remember what it felt like to not be on it or what it actually does for me when I take it. It is just another drug that I pop twice a day. 15mg twice a day for a total of 30mg. I do know that my hallucinations are very minimal from what they used to be. But I still hear voices and see things on occasion that are very disturbing.	M	36	2  years	2/5/2009

3	depression	weight gain = 60 lbs in 1 yr, craving sweets, developed pre-diabetic condition, BANKRUPTED ME AS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE	I've suffered with intractable depression for decades and have been on just about every medication ever made.  After years of working with an extremely competent, caring psychiatrist, he placed me on a 2 drug combination of 60mg/daily of Cymbalta and 15 mg/every other day of Abilify and, for the first time in a very long time, I do not experience the terrible lows which with I previously struggled.  Now, if I could just lose the weight I gained.....I'd feel much, much better.  Please do not construe this medication combination as a CURE.  I AM better; BUT, I still struggle with depression...just not as often.

He has gained over 40# in 3-months, he beats his head, calls himself stupid and begs to go to God where the pain will be gone.  We are in the process of weening him off this drug for good.	Scary...We were told it did not promote weight gain in children..yet our son gained 40#.  Did nothing about his depression and anxiety and actually made him more manic and out of sorts...Did not work for our child.	M	10	4  months	1/30/2009Email

1	Bipolar	After two days on this stuff, I've got a terrible headache that won't quit and I feel like I need to vomit.	I'll give it a few more days until I see my doctor next week, but I'm not sure if this is worth it.  Hopefully the side effects wear off.	F	39	2  days	1/26/2009
1	Bipolar II, insomnia	This is one of the worst medications I have ever taken.  I took 1 2.5 mg tab and started experiencing extreme anxiety and insomnia.  This developed into a hypomanic state and I have been lucky to get 3 hours of sleep a day.  I had to start taking Seroquel (which I also hate because it leaves me hung over) and I was able to sleep 6 hours.  Now, I have to take Seroquel to get any sort of sleep.  Also, benzos did not counteract any of my anxiety.		F	34	2  days	1/21/2009
4	head banging	slight weight gain (now taking 1 mg per day with 25 mg Zoloft)When on 10 mg (in error)had severe muscle stiffness and zombie effect.	This has helped enormously-feel less anxiety, more cheerful and outgoing, can speak more slowly and clearly-and head banging only once mildly in 9 months (full moon). I have developmental disabilities and, probably, autism.	F	63	9  months	1/18/2009
3	Severe Depression	Last year, I was started on 2mg and was very irritable...my doctor increased me to 4mg a day and the irritable feelings went away.  However I have gained 50 lbs in one year.	Abilify in conjunction with fluexotine has helped my depression.  However the weight gain is very discouraging...I am trying to lose the weight but it is very hard to on this medicine.

1	halucinations, anxiety	My 10 year old daughter has been on abillify for a year and she had gained weight.  Also, her inner cheeks were sore as if she had began to bite them (unknowingly).  She complains of stomach aches sometimes.  Lately her cheeks, chin, and lips have swollen as a result, I am weening her off.  I am looking for a natural alternative with minimum side effects because my daughter asked me why must she keep suffering.		F	10	370  days	1/16/2009Email

Recently, I went off the Abilify for two weeks in an effort to decrease my medication (under my Psychiatrist's supervision, because I want to get pregnant) and immediately became depressed and suicidal. Now I have been back on the Abilify for a week and I feel 'normal' again. The main problem that I am experiencing is insomnia at night and lack of energy during the day. Overall, it has really helped to balance my severe depression.	F	29	1  years	10/1/2006

5	Paranoid Schizophrenia	None what so ever.	A great medication for me, reduced the visual halusinations by 100% and less voices too. Recommended!	M		6  months	9/11/2006
1	Bipolar II (very mild)	Made me agitated while taking it. But worse was that anxiety became overwhelming when I got off of it. I stayed off for a month, but anxiety never got better. I really hate this drug.		M	41	90  days	8/29/2006
