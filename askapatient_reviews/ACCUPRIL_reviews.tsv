ACCUPRIL	5	High Blood Pressure	I have been on Accupril and Quinapril HCI, with no side effects.Two weeks ago I started taking the new Quinapril USP and having symptoms of cough, leg cramps, very tired, no energy.Is anyone else having this problem with the new switch to Quinapril made by Lupin?		F	50	10  years40  MG 1X D	5/18/2012Email
ACCUPRIL	4	high blood presure	Only just started taking a few weeks ago dry cough started two weeks ago although annoying I do feel better than I have done for some time		F	52	3  weeks10	1/19/2012
ACCUPRIL	3	for slight blood pressure	swelling feet and shortness of breath i am in a hot climate at present and the swelling did not occur when i was in a cooler climate	i was changed to accupril from accuretic and wonder if this medication is necessary  as my blood prssure is on the high side of normal	F	70	2  months	8/11/2009Email
ACCUPRIL	1	heart hypertension	Dr. changed my dosage of Quinipril ( generic) for Accupril from 40mg.(1) daily to (2) daily. After (2) increased dosages I awoke with much swelling of lips and swelling into the face. Looks like aperson who had a stroke.Truly scary. Being on Easter Sunday, Idid not attend our church service.	Not at all happy with this dosage. Must contact Doctor comeMonday morning, which will be Monday April 13, 09'	M	74	 	4/12/2009
ACCUPRIL	4	hypertension	none	I take quinapril( generic) and by far this is the best bp med I have taken. previously was on diovan, labatelol,procardia. The only down side I seem to have had is that when I started on quinapril I started at 10 mg and that controlled my bp (unmedicated is 150/105) for about 7 months. Now I am up to 20 mg and my bp is 120/85. It seems your body adjusts to it and every so often you need to up the dosage	F	34	9  months	11/11/2008
ACCUPRIL	3	High blood pressure	Dry cough;some joint and muscle pain especially when I take the generic version (quinapril). The pharmacist insists there is no difference in the formula, yet these symptoms decrease with brand, which is much more expensive on my medical plan.I have tried both-and currently take brand.	I take the lowest dosage in combination with other low dosage medicines and my blood pressure is fine.	F	56	7  years	8/31/2008

ACCUPRIL	1	High Blood Pressure	Tiredness, Weight Gain	I have been taking accupril for 12 months; it has done little to lower my blood pressure, but makes me very tired--to the point that I don't get out of bed some days. I also experiences significant weight gain, going from 171lbs to over 200 in a few months, despite working out regularly.	M	35	12  months	8/30/2007
ACCUPRIL	4	High BP	Have noticed some muscle weakness.  Also suffer from Hypothyroid so it may be that.  Beginning to experience bilateral or alternating hip / groin pains which seem to be muscular in origin rather than degenerating joints.  Am beginning to wonder if Accupril is the cause.	I have been on Accupril many years.  At least 7 but probably longer.	F	54	7  years	8/26/2007Email
ACCUPRIL	5	hypertension	None	I have taken this drug for about 10+ years, works good, only problem is if i forget to take it. no noticable side effects.	M	55	10  years	5/16/2007Email
ACCUPRIL	3	hypertension	I have taken the drug without side effects for 2 years.  However, I have recently developed the annoying cough and some shortness of breath.  I am unwilling to stay on it with this symptom.	My BP will still increase to unacceptable levels under stress, so drug is not that effective for me.	F	55	2  years	5/7/2007
ACCUPRIL	4	High BP	I have taking accupril (and/or quinapril) or monopril or zestril for 15 years, although they are effective in contolling my BP the cough is getting unbearable.  Cough seems to be worst with accupril (quinapril).  Use HCTZ to enhance the effect of th accupril.	Doctor took me off accupril yesterday but said it will take two to four years for the cough to stop.	M	62	15  years	5/4/2007
ACCUPRIL	5	high b.p. hemorrhagic stroke	At beginning slight dry cough,as everyone seems to report.	I have been taking 10mg twice daily for the past seven years.controls pressure great.	M	50	7  years	9/5/2006
ACCUPRIL	1	Hypertension	I experienced an acute onset of uvulitis this was very frightening. I have been an RN for 20 years and have never see a more distressing side effect	I literally awoke gasping after taking the drug about 20 hours before I had no s/s of any pharygeal infection or orother health problems	M	56	3  years	7/13/2005

ACCUPRIL	4	high blood pressure	I have been taking accupril for 6 years. I have had dry cough in the past but have not experienced it lately. I feel lightheaded and dizzy at times. Energy level is low and sexual drive has diminished. I also take Lipritor and it may be causing some of the effects. The drug works well for reducing blood pressure as I changed medication on several occassions and my blood pressure became uncontrollable.		M	45	6  years	11/15/2004

ACCUPRIL	4	Diabetic Nephropathy	dry cough	The drug has been succesfull (in my case) by controlling the level of albuminuria and drastically reducing the rate of  damage to my kidneys. I have never seen nor heared of ACE INHIBITORS used this way and dry hacking cough has been present throughout since the beginning of taking the drug.	M	46	7  years	8/31/2004
ACCUPRIL	3	hypertension	About 2 weeks after taking Accupril I developed diarrhea and severe nausea. This same side effect occured with another Ace inhibitor.	Had to discontinue because of the severe nausea.	F	47	3  weeks	8/1/2004
ACCUPRIL	4	high blood pressure	I have currently been taking Accupril for three years. And have recently, again started with an annoying dry cough during thenight and when I am physically tired. This med does the trick,cough, cough.	I stopped taking Accupril for about two years and was on severalother medications, although I no longer had the annoying coughmy bp remained uncontrolled and many of them made me tired andlethargic.
