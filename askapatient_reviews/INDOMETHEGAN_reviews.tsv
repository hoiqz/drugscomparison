1	severe neck and shoulder pain	I felt emotionally out of control.  I couldn't sleep, talking to myself, confused, blurred vision, severe anxiety, auditory hallucinations. I was terrified and out of my mind. I'll never touch this medication again!	Awful side-effects. Truly terrifying.	M	36	6  days	6/9/2008
