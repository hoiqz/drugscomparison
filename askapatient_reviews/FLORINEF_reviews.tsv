4	Neurally Mediated Hypotension	Some water retention in the first 2 weeks, then went away.Some migraines/headaches and pressure in my head, but went away as my body adjusted.Now that im adjusted the extreme fatigue I felt from even minor/moderate exercise is gone.Took me weeks to figure out the correct dosage. Florinef has a long half life and takes your body a long time to adjust.People who complain about headaches should try a lower dose and try again.  Stay on the same dose for at least 2 weeks before changing it again, unless you are in lots of pain from headaches.   Best to start with a small dose and go up until you hit side effects, and then back off a bit. It can take several months to find the right dose for year.Also, I start every day with a big glass of water filled with 1 teaspoon of salt. (non-iodinized)		M	44	60  days.100 1X D	5/31/2012Email
2	POTS	Severe edema of feet/ankles.	I'm not sure this medication helped my POTS much - I was still having some episodes of pre-syncope even after I'd been on this med a few weeks.  After a particularly bad pre-syncope episode I took in extra salt as directed by my doctor and as I'd been doing prior to starting this med - and several hours later my right foot was twice the size of my left.  I never had edema of any kind before this, and the swelling started to go down as soon as I stopped the Florinef.  My doctor later re-introduced this med at a reduced dose, and the edema came right back, although milder this time.	F	35	30  days0.1 mg 1X D	12/27/2011Email
4	POTS - Postural Orthstc. Tacy. Synd	Feel somewhat better; however, my periods are nuts - average bleeding about half of any given month. It's ridiculous. (And I have been on the same birth control for 6+ years; no other med changes)		F	27	3  months10mg 1X D	3/15/2011Email
1	neurocardiogenic syncope	Dizziness, lightheadedness, migraines, nausea	I've been takind florinef for five months in addition to midodrine to treat neurocardiogenic syncope. For the first couple months i took it i honestly couldn't tell the difference, it didn't seem to help or hurt. But, lately i've been getting dizzy spells much more frequently and nothing seemed to make them go away. They would occur for days at a time with migraines and nausea. I stopped taking Florinef 3 days ago and already feel much better!	F	21	5  months	12/7/2009Email
1	Hypotension	After taking this medicine since June, I am having EXTREME muscle weakness. EXTREME		M	24	5  months	10/21/2009
5	Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Sy	fluid retention, a little puffiness	I LOVE FLORINEF! I have been taking it for 2+ years, and I must say, it has saved me. I would love to advise all of you out there trying it for POTS to stick with it. It took me 6 months to feel a bit better, and a FULL YEAR on Florinef to be close to normal again. I Swear by it! My cardiologist told me it can take over 6 months on it until you start feeling more like yourself. I was patient, and am glad I was. I have had no real side effects other than gaining about 5 extra pounds. Who cares when it makes you feel human again! I have tried to stop taking it a few times to see if it was just coincidental and maybe I really was getting better, but I was wrong. It's the florinef. After about 2 weeks off it I feel like I am dying agin. It has really saved me. PLEASE give it a shot!! AND YES YOU MUST STILL EAT A LOT OF SALT OR IT WON"T WORK! There is no point taking it if you don't up your salt volume. I try to eat 3-5 tsp a day. I mix it in my water and juts chug it down.	F	39	2  years	6/30/2009Email
5	hypotension/migraines	slight water retention, not enough to make me stop taking it	After years of searching for a cure for my migraines, i have found it! When I told the doctors I got a headache from standing/sitting, they said it was sinuses. I knew it had to be my low blood pressure and finally convinced one doctor to prescribe this and I finally am migraine free 90% of the time. I am no longer afraid of the throbbing pain I will experience when getting out of bed or standing from a chair.	F	32	6  weeks	3/27/2009
2	Neurocardiogenic Syncope	water retention, but this medication did not decrease or prevent any syncope spells with .3mg a day, so now ive been switched to toprol...we will see if that works		M	21	1  years	11/20/2008
5	Orthostatic hypotension	None.	I have orthostatic hypotension/neurocardiogenic syncope as determined through a tilt table test.  I was constantly having episodes of frequent urination, dehydration and dizzy spells when getting up and standing too long.  While I don't think I will ever be healed, the Florinef has made all the difference in the world.  If I do not take it one day, I pay for it with near syncope spells.  The doctor initially told me to increase my salt and fluids, but that did not work so they put me on 0.1 mg a day.  Florinef has been a miracle drug for me.	F	38	2  months	4/2/2008Email
4	POTS-Postural Tachyicardia Syndrome	None really- fluid retention in legs but nothing significant	Before being diagnosed with POTS (Postural orthostatic Tachyicardia Syndrome) and being put onto Florinef, i was unable to function, i couldnt go to work and could barely leave my house because i was always feeling unwell because of the syptoms of POTS- I was living a very lonely life in my house because i wasnt feel enough to leave it, but since taking florinef i have to certain extent got my life back, im not cured but the medication certainly helps me to be somewhat normal again- i now have a job, even though i have good and bad days, with the medication i now have more good days than i use to have bad!!!

2	hypotension	Horrible headache	I only took florinef once, so I never got to see if it helped with the hypotension. Once my head began to hurt, I called my doctor and he told me to stop taking it.	F	23	1  days	10/14/2005
