1	RA	I'm allergic.  After 2 weeks, developed fever, pressure in my eyes and a 102 fever. My RA doctor stopped it due to allergic reaction		F	60	3  weeks500 2X D	10/3/2012Email
3	psoriatic arthritis	feeling very lightheaded, decreased appetite, some nausea, lotsof fatigue	im just not sure ive been on it long enough to see results. only been diagnosed for a year, also taking naproxen. not sure what to expect for this drug...wanted to see what others say...	F	31	2  months500 mg 2X D	7/2/2010Email
2	PA	Drowsiness within an hour of taking, bad enough to make me stop taking in day time - even though splitting of dose was recommended.I suffer from depression and I am fairly convinced this medication is making it worse - feeling morose, more withdrawn, more negative etc.Am less regular on the medication and appetitite is suppressed. Slight nausia.	One month into trial (recommended for at least 2mths) and no beneficial effects as yet. Only negative side effects! Will try stay on a few more weeks and see what happens.

3	RA	None	THis drug was added to my med list of Enbrel; methotrexate. I developed hip bursitis along with having had RA for 19 yrs.I take 2000mg/day plus cortisone injections in my hip every 3 mos. I noticed a mild improvement. One rheumatologist strongly recomends it and another is strongly against this drug.I plan to wait for additional improvement or I will stop using it.

5	Reactive Arthritis	None	I've been taking this medication for about 14 years, 2000mg per day, but 3000mg per day for the past year. Has worked well for me (in conjunction with feldene and prevacid) in controlling the disease  but I fear its stopped working now, as my arthritis is getting a bit worse lately.

3	Ulcerative colitis	I have had UC since 1973, and took azulfidine for 25 years.  Cause temporary sterility in men; developed chronic venus insufficiency in my right calf, ankle and foot.  The cause was diagnosed as the residual sulfa destroying the valves in the capilllaries.	It stopped working as effectively as it did when I quit smoking; there is a correlation between UC and smoking especially in men.	M	61	25  years	1/28/2009Email
3	Crohn's disease	Started drug less than 1 month ago. Experienced constant headaches, orange urine (like peeing food coloring that stained the toilet paper!) and fatigue. Reduced dosage and headaches were significantly reduced as well.	My appetite has improved and diarrhea slowed down a little?; feeling bloated, don't know if its related? ...joint pain has not really improved yet; I am so tired I am unable to function normally.. I'll see how it goes...	F	36	3.5  weeks	1/26/2009
5	ra	drug has worked well for me, taking 1000mg 2x daily along with 400mg of plaquenil. have noticed some skin discoloration which i suspect may be due to the azulfidine. other than that, no noticable effects.	have a mild case of ra that was beginning to be debilitating around 11 years ago. started on these two meds 10 years ago with little side effects and function pain-free 95% of the time. other 5% 3-4 ibuprofen are needed.

2	chron's arthritis	It dropped my white blood cell count so low that I was in danger of dying.		F	16	2  months	6/25/2008
5	crohns disease	stomach distress, sun burn	After 5 operations and all of the other problems with Crohns disease I started azulfidine and instant improvement. I must take coated (EC) version to avoid stomach problems. Very few crohns problems in 26 years!	M	62	26  years	3/20/2008
3	RA	severe loss of taste; discolored urine	It seems to work for me controlling the inflammation and pain, but I truly cannot taste anything. All foods taste like sand.	F	39	2  months	10/31/2007Email
1	joint pain	dark urine first thing in the am, constipation at first	given for joint pain, pain has increased since i started taking it 8-06. i have established lupus, fibromyalgia. this was given by a new rheum & he refuses to treat any of my other complaints. path shows + for RA, but blood was -neg.	F	36	7  months	3/13/2007Email
2	psoriatic arthritis	severe dyspepsia, anorexia, dizziness, headaches, fatigue	after taking a starting dose of 500 mg. for 6 days I began feeling very ill, and once I figured out it was the medicine (burping sulfer helped) I discontinued; it is four days later and I still cannot eat, though improving.

1	Ulcerative colitis	Very painful urination	I've had uc for over 40 years. My gastroenterologist started me on it originally and I suffered through many summers. I was very active and sweated a lot and if I didn't drink  an abnormal amount of liquids, I would urinate very painful orange urine. It was so bad that I stopped taking it on a maintenance basis and just used prednisolone enemas when I had flareups for many years. I eventually went to a different doctor who prescribed Asacol. What a God-send! No side effects and no more painful urination problems. Anyone having problems with azulfidine should try Asacol. Another plus, the Asacol tabs are smaller. Whenever I get a rarely occuring flareup now, I use Rowasa enemas for a couple weeks and I'm back to remission. Good luck to all!	M	64	10  years	11/8/2006
4	ulcerative colitis	some headaches but not often, light orange semen	I had no distressing events I would take again	M	18	6  months	3/10/2006Email
3	non-specific arthritis	sun sensitivity...i burn easily though i'm of hispanic origin (olive complexion)...my blood tests have returned negative for rheumatoid arthritis  and for liver and kidney adverse effects(so far)...	hasn't kicked in yet..been on it for 3 months now (3000mg per day total).... i'm an x-ray tech by profession...as per doctor's instructions i take naproxen sodium 1000mg per day as an inflammatory and 2-3 tabs of tramadol (per day) which give me very limited relief.. although the recommened maximum dose is 1000mg a day  i have taken up to 2000mg of the naproxen sodium because the pain can be so severe...my predominant (most persistent) symptoms are very stiff hands upon arising...on worse days: sterno-clavicular hyper-tenderness,  stiff right shoulder and general body stiffness ...had also epicondylitis (tennis elbow:another symptom) which stabilised somewhat after a cortisone injection..(i tried physical therapy first: no help)... hot showers also help to take away some of the stiffness...i want to know what others are taking for pain until this medication finally "kicked in"...thanks....speedy recovery to all who are dealing with this condition	M	54	3  months	12/23/2005
4	RA		Though I feel better taking this medication, after reading the other postings, I am a little concerned about my dosage.  My rheumatologist has me taking 4000 mg a day (8 en-tabs). I never knew that was a high dosage, so maybe I should do some checking up.  Anyone have any information?	F	24	2  years	1/29/2005
4	Rheumatoid Arthritis	None	Took 2000mg for two years and am now on 1000mg a day. I take the enteric coated tabs. The worst thing about this drug is the amount of time it takes to work, in my case 6 months! If it wasnt for my Rheumatologist , i would have given up on this drug	M	48	3  years	11/23/2004
1	RA	I found it very irritating to my stomache ( i'm prone to gastritis)Had problems with depression while taking it. Depression cleared up when I stopped it.	Stopped taking plaquenil to start azulfidine.I think azulfidine made me worse.  Had an  increase in muscle pain and a huge flare  of sterno-clavicular and shoulder joints two weeks after I started taking it.By the end of 7 weeks I had such severe exhaustion, I could hardly get out of the chair.  I hated this drug!	M	58	7  weeks	7/21/2004
4	Arthritis	I've been taking Azulfidine for more than a year (500mg a day) it has helped with my arthritis pain however, I've begun to feel lingering headaches and dizziness, I feel as if I'm going to faint. If I stand still I'm fine, but if I bend over to, say tie my shoes, I get very dizzy, if I shift my head from one side to another, I get dizzy. I will consult with my doctor in order to stop taking this medicine.		M	49	1.5  years	6/3/2004Email

2	psoriatic arthritis	Major nausea, reflux, vomiting.	I tried the azulfidine en-tabs as they are suppose to have less gastro side effects, the side effects were too much for me at this time. Perhaps my dosage was too high to begin with. ( 1000 mg) I will try it again in the future starting at a lower dosage ( 500 mg ) and work up to 2g per day (2000 mg) over a four week period. Also on other medication which may have attributed to the gastro effects.	F	45	7  days	11/18/2003
1	Lupus	Constipation, discolored urine	I have been on this medication now for approximately 2 months and it has not helped my pain any at all.  I have svere joint paint which limits my movement.  It may help others out there but it hasn't helped my pain at all.	F	25	2  months	11/8/2003
