5	Migraine disease	feeling cold, very tired, weak, sleepy		F	59	1  years30mg 3X W	2/6/2013
5	Migrane Headaches	I have no apparent side effects.	My "magic pill"! I started taking amerge for hormonal headaches pre and post menopasaul. It is amazing after suffering for years with days in bed; within 45 minutes I can feel the headache disappearing. I am no longer missing work or worrying my family. I usually get a burst of energy for the rest of the day after the H/A is gone. Again it is a "magic pill".	F	59	8  years 2X M	1/22/2012
5	migraine	none	amerge changed my life.  i take at onset and the migraine goes away. i cannot function without the drug.	M	60	12  years2.5 1X AN	2/2/2011
1	Migraine	Extreme drowsiness.	Amerge did nothing at all for my migraines. I had taken Imitrex for years but it stopped working. All Amerge did for me is make me really sleepy and didn't touch my migraine. It may work wonders for some, so give it a shot! I like Frova much better!	F	39	1  months2.5 mg 1X AN	12/24/2010
5	Chronic Migraines	Slight drowsiness, no worse than Benadryl	I call this my "magic" pill! I take it on onset of symptoms (aura, first pain) and the headache is gone in less than 2 hours. It is pricey, and the quantity is limited by the insurance company. But, it is worth it's weight in gold. I highly recommend it!	F	34	4  years2.5 Mg 1X AN	6/22/2010
5	Severe Migraines	The side effects are tiredness, spacy, some tingling in hands and feet, dry eyes, but the side effects are more desirable than the migraine	I have had migraines for a few years now, but in the past year they are severe and have been destroying my life.  With a migraine I lie in bed for 3 days in the dark and vomit.  I have been taking amerge 2.5 MG for the past 4 months when the migraine starts.  Within 2 hours the migraine is just slightly painful so that I can get out of bed and do things.  I can just handle simple tasks until both the migraine is completely gone and the amerge has worn off.  I am very happy with amerge.	F	50	4  months2.5 1X AN	6/11/2010Email
3	migraines	Severe stomach ache:  12 hours after taking, and after I eat a meal, I get a severe stomach ache.  So severe, I can't talk.  Stomach ache is excruciating for about 2 hours and then quickly disappears and I am fine again.	I've been taking this med for 5 years.  First 3 years, no stomach ache.  Now, I get the stomach ache every other time I take the med.  I've had thorough ultrasound to detect gallbladder or other issues.  It found nothing wrong.  Have never had any other stomach issues in my life.	F	44	5  years2.5 MG 1X M	5/19/2010
5	Nothing else had worked	None	I am one of the few "lucky" men to experience migraines and the only thing that had ever worked for me prior to Amerge was a shot of demerol at the MD's office. However, it's important for me to take it right away before the pain comes on (during the visual symptoms that precede the headache).  In the times I've taken it after the headache comes, it hasn't been as effective.	M	39	5  years2.5 MG 1X D	4/3/2010
5	Severe Migraine	Minor side effects: tingling of skin and slight drowsiness.	Absolute lifesaver! After suffering migraines for 15 years, this is the only drug that has worked for me. Maxalt, Imitrex, Vicodin, Zomig and a variety of over the counter drugs didn't make a dent in the pain. My new neurologist will only prescribe 9 per month (as opposed to the originally prescribed 20) and is trying to trick me into taking Nortriptyline instead. After some research I discovered that this is an antidepressant. Has anyone else been given this and does it work for you? What is going on that insurance and doctors are against Amerge. It's obviously a miracle drug!	F	31	9  months2.5 mg 1X AN	3/16/2010Email
5	migraines	mild dizziness, drowsiness, feeling of heaviness in head.  some nausea, but much more tolerable than the alternative!	I have suffered from migraines since the age of 10.  This is the first medication that has worked for me, when taken upon the first sign of impending migraine (for me, I get blind spots) it almost completely eliminates the migraine. If for some reason I am not able to take it immediately, it still takes care of at least 75%.  Wish it wasn't so expensive, but I can't imagine living without it, it is the only thing that gives me relief.	F	36	2  years2.5mg 1X D	2/11/2010
5	Migraine		I was in the middle of a full on migraine when I took Amerge. I wasn't sure it was going to work since I didn't take it before the migraine was full blown, but within an hour my migraine was almost gone.  Within 2 hours it was completely gone.	F	29	1  times	12/2/2009
5	Migraines	I have had migraines for 14 years and finally there is a medicine that makes them go away or mostly away.  I'm so happy with this drug.  I have tried everything in the past, including other triptans, and this is the only one that works for me.		F	37	2  months	9/22/2009
5	Migraine	spacey - tired	Best medication out there! I tried everything the doctors had and nothing worked.. Then she said last resort but it is expensive.. I am so glad I tried this medication.. I generally wait till the migraine is in full swing, I take this med and lay down.. when I wake up a couple hours later.. poof.. migraine gone.. Thank God!I do agree the cost is a bit much.. BUT I only take when I get a strong migraine..	F	33	6  years	7/1/2009
5	Migraines	Brief drowsiness for about two or three hours after taking and a heaviness feeling in my head that lasts about four hours after taking	For the past three years since my daughter was born I have mirgraine headaches and/or bad headaches every day through the months of May and June.  After every test including allergies, taking allergy meds, mirgraine preventatives and a variety of pain relievers (presciption and non)....this is a miracle! Although it takes longer for the migraine pain to stop (two hours) than some other medicines, I will be headache free for up to two days with Amerge.  It is definitely worth the wait...I get back to my old self with lots of energy!  Can't say enough.	F	41	30  days	6/23/2009
5	Migraine	Husband hasn't mentioned any.	My husband has noted that if he waits until he feels migraine pain, the Amerge is unlikely to work at all.  However, if he can take it at the first aura symptom (itching in back of hands, crashing mood, increased sense of smell), the Amerge prevents the migraine entirely, or in cases where we expect a 9/10 level migraine (severe weather), he only reports pain of 3-5.	M	38	1  years	4/25/2009
5	Migraines	Cold extremities (same as all triptans I've taken.  Also tired and VERY spacey, can't concentrate on anything that requires complex or sustained thought.  That said, I can easily do housework, child care, and simple administrative tasks at work--just not complex planning, writing, or analysis (which unfortunately are the primary tasks of my job). Like others, I'll accept this as a trade-in for the migraine pain, no problem!	Like all triptans, Amerge can cause a rebound if you overmedicate (over days & weeks--not a single overdose).  Amerge  works even better if you take it with 1 tab of naproxen (google "NSAID and triptan" and you'll see this scientifically supported. Amerge has worked better for me than any of the previous 5 or 6 triptans I've gone thru over the years.  I am very fortunate that my neuro was able to convince my HMO (wrote a letter) that I should have 18 pills a month instead of 9, same co-pay for me, re: medical necessity.  It's always worth a try to see if that works with your insurer. . . .	F	42	4  years	1/23/2009Email
5	debilitating migraines	mild tiredness	I agree with all those who state here that it gave me my life back!  I tried Imitrex & Maxalt. They made me sleep but did not remove the migraine pain.  When I feel a migraine start, or even if it has already taken hold, it only takes 1 2.5 mg Amerge, and an hour later I can go on with my day.  Before Amerge, I was in bed in a dark,silent room throwing up for the day.  This drug has been a miracle for me.  I have taken it (only when I get the migraine) for probably 10 years.  Long term side effects worry me, but when I have a migraine, I just want that relief!  I have no other known side effects, but if anyone knows of them (because I understand there are always trade offs with drugs), I'd be interested in knowing what they are.	F	57	 	1/10/2009
3	Migraines	Mood Changes, Irregular Heartbeat, Dizziness	It definitely gets rid of the migraine, and it seems like I am the only person who had the really negative side effects.  However, I stopped taking them and I still have a few pills left for my really severe migraines.  The side effects of taking the pills are more dangerous in my opinion, for me, than dealing with the migraine.  I have a high pain tolerance though, but a low depression threshold.  They do work, don't get me wrong.  The other problem is the cost.  And the packaging.  My insurance won't automatically cover it, so we have to pay upfront.  Not worth it to me.	F	21	2  months	8/6/2008
5	Migraines	absolutely no side effects in my case.	This medicine enabled me to function normally for the first time. started having migraines in my mid-30's which lasted approx. three days at a time. Spent the days in bed with ice and in the dark. I take Amerge and the headache is gone within two hours and I very rarely have to take the second one. its been like a miracle for me.	F	52	5  years	6/9/2008
5	Migraine		Amerge has set me free! I have been getting migraines every since I was in high school and nothing has worked. I have been through nearly all of the different migraine medicines and none of them has helped me the way Amerge has.	F	25	2  months	5/21/2008
5	Migraines	Difficulty breathing; frequent urination; some stomach upset; fatigue; poverty (during the time my insurance wouldn't cover the cost!)	Agreed with many people that this drug gave me my life back; without it, I would be completely unable to hold down a job, that's for sure!  I've had migraines since age 8 and tried just about every new drug (and then some) to try & treat them.  Amerge has been the only tryptan-type drug that has consistently worked, although sadly I find I need to take two 2.5mg pills now instead of one as treatment.  The difficulty breathing is not as severe as when I first started taking the drug - and I'll gladly put up with it instead of the migraine.  The only drawbacks come from my insurance company, who at one time refused to cover the drug (and put me in the poorhouse at $30+ a pill) and now will only allow me 9 pills a month - which would be okay...if I only got 4 or 5 migraines a month. :/	F	37	10  years	5/21/2008Email
4	Migraines	None medically, to my observation. Really bad side effect on my wallet though! The drug company should be more considerate +  control their spending on packaging of this drug to bring the price down to a realistic level! (completely immoral,the excessive PACKAGING!! )	Have had migraines since my teens & the regular off-the-shelf pain killers with coffee used to work.  When that eventually stopped working, I was grateful for this drug (& my drug plan!)The generic version can't come soon enough!	F	53	5  years	3/23/2008
5	Migraines	A little drowsy at times.	I have been taking amerge for 14 years.  It works wonderful and gave me my life back.  I have taken as many as 18 in one month with no bad side affects.  Prior to this I took Imitrex shots and pills for 3 years and this lasts much longer.	F	52	14  years	3/18/2008Email
5	Migraine	Groggy, tired, nasueated, at times felt fire running through my viens. Sometimes no side effects.  Depended on severity of migraine. All side effects were worth it and less severe than any migraine.	I have had headaches since I was 15.  Amerge is the only medicine that I felt has helped when I felt a headache coming on. I used to make 3-4 trips in a year to the ER to get a shot, but since taking Amerge, I've had about 4 trips in the past 7 years. The times that it doesn't work are few and far between compared to when it does help.  My mother and her sisters take Amerge also.	F	41	7  years	1/11/2008Email
4	Migraine Headaches	Fatigue (though that could be from the migraine).  Horrible rebound headache - having taken 8 Amerge in one month.	As I've come to my 30's, I've gone from having the occasional migraine that required 1 or 2 Amerge, to having them more frequently.  This month, I've taken 8, and am experiencing a /horrible/ situation with a rebound headache.  That said, I'm also on some other medications for Fibromyalgia, and neuropathy.  Amerge has always been wonderful at alleviating migraines, and I heartily recommend it.  In my case, a medication caused migraines that lasted weeks into months, and I don't recommend trying to treat with Amerge constantly.  You'll get heart dysrhythmias and possibly a relentless rebound headache situation.	F	35	7  years	11/6/2007
5	migraines	It may cause sleepiness, but to go to sleep for a while seems to help the Amerge work better. I wouldn't notice any bad side effects from the Amerge because the migraine side effects are much worse anyway.	I've tried many migraine drugs, surgery and preventions.  The very best treatment is still Amerge.  I only wish it would last longer than 24 hours. I feel like Cinderella! My vision clears up. The brain fog, the intense pain and muscle tension is helped greatly. It is the best day when I finally take the Amerge!	F	57	7  years	10/3/2007Email
5	migraine	A little neck discomfort about 1/2 to an hour after first taking pill which goes away after about 30 minutes or so and doesn't return.	I have never had anything work as well as Amerge.  It lasts a long time - 20-24 hours.  Must take it at first sign of migraine for it to be most effective.  It does make me a little drowsy, but I can function and work and take care of my family.  I don't know what I would do without this medicine!	F	41	8  years	7/28/2007
5	migraine headaches	The Amerge blocked my thinking even more than the migraine did, but it was very effective in getting rid of the migraine.  The following day I usually felt like I'd had the flu, but don't know if that's due to the migraine or the Amerge.		F	50	5  years	5/1/2007
4	headaches			F	23	2  years	4/2/2007
5	Migraines	Tired	I have had migraines since I was a young teenagers. I missed many days of work and school and first tried Imitrex which didn't work. I am so thankful for Amerge as I have been successful with it. I live in Canada and for 6 pills it is about $100 which is expensive but thankfully I have coverage and don't have to pay. Although, even if I did, I would because it's worth it being able to function and lead a normal life. I don't know what I would do if this stopped working.	F	30	3  years	3/31/2007Email
5	Migraines	Cold and tired - but that could be migraine side effects too.	Sometimes it takes awhile to work, and sometimes I need to take a second one 4 hours later, but it usually works very well for migraines.  Imitrex never worked for me.	F	50	7  years	2/27/2007
5	Migraine	None	Have been a migraine sufferer for seven years and was never prescribed anything until Amerge.  It eliminated the headache within an hour and gives me back my life!  I don't know about other medications, but this one helps me tremendously.	F	21	2  weeks	1/18/2007
5	migraine	Thank God for Amerge. Sometimes I get a little spacey or cold extremities, but I can get my kids to school and myself to work. I routinely take it two to three times a month.		F	45	3  years	9/25/2006
5	migraines	I feel tired for the next few hours after taking one tablet	I had tried many different drugs prior to Amerge without success.  Amerge actually stops my migraines within 1 hour - I am ever so grateful and go nowhere without Amerge.	F	44	3  years	9/19/2006
5	Migraines	Some times feel a little spacey, but not drowsy	I have had migraines for over 20 years and Amerge is a god send. It works for me EVERY time that I take it, unlike Imitrex, which I took in the 1990s. I have almost no side effects with Amerge. I can't say enough about how it has positively impacted my life.	F	46	7  years	7/28/2006
4	migraine	none	only lasts 24-30 hours	F	40	7  months	7/17/2006
5	for migraine	by itself I was fine maybe a little tired, when I take it with my Neurontin I feel dizzy and more tired...	I think it works better for menstrual migraines than regular even though I still use it for regular migraine.  It also seems to last longer than most meds I've tried (about 26 hours)	F	40	6  months	5/25/2006
5	Very	None	Been a migrane sufferer all my life. Amerge is the best of the triphans. Best of all, does not appear to cause rebound headache. Also, is long-lasting: 24-30 hours.	M	58	2  years	5/17/2006
3	Tension Migraine	length of time correction	length of time correction		45	8  months	11/19/2005Email
3	Tension Migraine	Hypersensitivity to hot liquids and a little bit of muscle weakness	It takes too long for me before I get any relief form the migraine. Like yestarday it took one around 10:00 p.m. and did not get any relief. I took the second dose at 3:30 a.m. and did not get relief until 10:00 a.m.	M	45	8  days	11/19/2005Email
4	migraine pain					 	11/8/2005
5	Migraine	Some loss of energy, but I have had that problem with all other meds I've tried.  Bottom line I can function tired, I can't do anything but writhe in pain when my migraine hits.	I've tried Malalt, Immatrex and one other, but nothing has worked as well Amerge or as long.  Only wish it came in an other form, pills don't always stay down when I have a migraine.	M	36	2  months	3/20/2005
5	Migraine Prevention	Cold extremities (hands/feet) on occasion.  The drug appears to slow me down, which helps the medicine overtake the migraine.	Take at first signs of migraine pain, and give it a chance to kick-in (slow down!).  Waiting too long to address your pain will cause the drug to be ineffective.  I've suffered from migraines for 22 years, and this drug is a miracle drug for me.  I don't leave home without it!	F	52	3  years	3/13/2005
5	Migrane Headaches	The only side effect I have noticed is feeling tired.  I'll take that over a headache any day.  The first few times I took it, I feel asleep, but woke up feeling great and headache free.	I am greatful for the Amerge.  I've never taken any other prescription medicine for headaches, but this one works for me.  Prior to Amerge, I just suffered.  Now I can function normally again.	M	42	14  months	2/2/2005
5	chronic migraines	I was taking Imitrex shots and pills prior to the Amerge tablets for the last year and they did not always end the h/a pain.  I also had the nasty Imitrex side effect of a worsening h/a for 15 minutes after injection before I received any relief. It was always so nerve racking.  I have been taking the Amerge (almost daily) for a week now and have had no side effects to speak of (maybe a little drowsy). Also, in one instance it only took one pill to get rid of a h/a I almost went to the E.R. with.  The Amerge also takes a little longer to work; 1.5 to 2 hrs for last headache but the h/a slowly vanished. I am thrilled so far and no more shots!		F	34	1  weeks	1/12/2005
4	Migraines	Some	My headaches are slow in developing so the amerge works very well sort of stopping it before it really happens.  I like the duration of effectiveness.  Tried Zomig first. Loved it but not in  pharmacy formulary of my health plan.  Tried Maxalt MLT didn't like it at all.	F	55	4  years	12/27/2004
1	I thought I had a migraine	Loss of feeling on left side	Do not take if you have the worst headache of your life	F	49	1  days	3/15/2004Email
1	migraines	it just didn't work...when it finally seemed to kick in, it made the migraine even worse.  I've used other triptans & all worked better than Amerge.	Tried it twice.  Same results both times.	F	49	 	9/21/2003
5	migrane headaches	It does make me tired, but if I have to stay awake to do my job or care for my child, it is possible.		F	27	2  years	1/20/2003
