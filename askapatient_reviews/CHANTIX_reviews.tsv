1	quit smoking	Felt "flat" - realized it was depression.  Nothing has any stimulating effect anymore...not caffeine, sugar, etc.  Once the dopamine receptors are bound by this drug, there are no ups...just flat.	Never had a depressed day in my life (beyond a normal grief in loss) and now I wake up every morning in a fog...taking an antidepressant which kicks in by afternoon and helps a little.  There needs to be research on how to reverse these effects before doctors continue to prescribe it for patients!	F	63	3  weeksas directe 2X D	3/3/2013Email

1	Dr recomm	I never had depression or pscycho Prob before   Now  i feel this and am on depression meds and counseling  Suicide - mean  - crazy - constant anger  - like a animal.  I now have vision problems. Throat problems which i am on drugs for.  Severe Depression for the rest of my life which i am on drugs for.  I never had any drugs prescribed in mylife.  Now I am spending 200$ a month because I wanted to stop smoking and trusted Chantix.   Do NOT take this ever please.   	FDA needs to take this off the Market  like they have in Europe   please I am begging you. You Are supposed to protect not destroy.	M	44	4  days 1X D	8/26/2012
5	To Quit Smoking	Happiness with a relaxed mind, but restless at night. Dreamed, Little Sleepy in the morning. Other than that, I have had no other side effects.	I think this is the easiest process ever invented, I am Smoke FREE! No cravings, No Urges, No Smoking. I even still hang out with my smoking pals, and it doesn't bother me. I take my 1mg when waking, on empty stomach. Take another 1mg at 4pm, then another before bed. Before taking one before bed, I was restless. This is the miracle pill! After a pack a day for 10 years, I am Smoke Free! Thank you so much Chantix! ZWade-Texas	M	26	29  days1 2X D	8/16/2012Email
2	Smoking	Trouble sleeping, anxiety, restlessness, loss of interest, mood swings, hate towards everything and everyone. Trouble remembering things.	I used to be a very active individual with no underlying mental illness. This drug has made me lose interest in everything I enjoyed. I used to work out everyday. I loved it. Now taking chantix I hate it and can't motivate myself. My relationship is horrible since taking chantix, I think my boyfriend of 3 years is getting ready to leave. My anger goes from a 1 to a 100 in a matter of seconds. This medicine has made me feel bat shit crazy. I still can't give up the smoking. Even though at this point there's no enjoyment anymore.

4	to quit smoking	Third time taking this course and this is first time I have had this extreme fatigue.  No other side effects strong enough to be worth mentioning.  Am quite concerned that other side effects will begin after stopping because of warnings and what I've read here.	took this once and worked like a charm, fell off cigarette wagon at a convention while drinking (still want to kick myself in the butt for that idiot move)  Second try and I thought it was the Chantix giving me terrible headaches so I quit before the first week was out - turned out they were stress headaches.  This is my third try and this time the fatigue is astoundingly bad and the cravings are still hitting me - which did not happen on try 1 or 2.  I'm going to try to stick this out for another 10 days and then wean myself off in  a reverse dose of week one.  Am going to try the reverse dose mostly because of what I've read about after effects and other's experiences ~  figure it's better to be safe than sorry with withdrawing from the Chantix.  I would hate to go through all this fatigue for so long only to go back to uncontrollable cravings and cave in.  Now that would be depressing!	F	58	18  days1mg 2X D	6/26/2012Email
4	To stop smoking	Some dreams, nothing bad. Trouble sleeping at night. Weight gain	Chantix did work for me, i stopped smoking.	F	56	3  months1mg 2X D	6/23/2012Email
5	To quit smoking	HORRIBLE STOMACH ACHES! shortly after taking the medication.	This is my 2nd time taking chantix,, it really does work.. just with the terrible stomach aches,, (even if I do eat prior to taking it) I have to talk myself into taking the pill knowing my stomach is going to hurt so bad. Both times I have used Chantix, I am able to quit after a week of taking the first pill. I've been a long time smoker.. it works great and I didn't start smoking the 2nd time because chantix didn't work. One big stressful event and I think a cigarette is going to help.. I DOESN'T .. looking forward to being a longtime former smoker. Good Luck everyone!	F	42	10  days1 mg 2X D	6/12/2012Email
4	Smoking	Vivid dreams, depression, anger, upset stomach if take without food	This is the 2nd time I have taken Chantix - the first time I was extremely nauteous and was out for about a week. I quit taking the drug and started smoking for 2 more years.  Tried again in March after looking at the pills for 3 months.  It has worked beautifully and was much easier this time - must have been ready. Still have some cravings and have smoked one or two the last  two months but they taste awful and reminds me of how far I have come. Have noticed just recently that I am depressed and angry...hoping that it goes away after my last month. I am only taking 1 pill a day now to try to start weaning. Don't read too much into all these reviews.  The pros greatly outweigh the cons of this drug...I say it's a miracle drug as well. I sure feel better about myself and my bank account is a lot fatter!

4	stop smoking	feeling of intense doom, sleepwalking, anger	4 years smoke free.  I still get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach, almost like I am grieving for cigarettes if I am around smoke now.  Still sleepwalk occasionally...	F	34	  1X D	4/17/2012Email
5	To quit smoking	Week 1: Cigarettes started tasting really bad near the end of weekWeek 2: Did not have a cigarette..no real urge to have one...didn't really think about it....I had REALLY VIVID dreams during this week.  Which included me and my Mom (of all people) fighting ZOMBIES.  (We lost)....no urge or craving to smoke.  i do feel sick when taking meds on a empty stomach.Week 3: No significant urge to smoke.  I have noticed I do like to eat a little more than usual..which I can not afford to do.  I also noticed, I don't drink as much coffee as I use to.  Something else I noticed, (warning TMI) my urine has a really strong (pee-pee) smell to it and it is rather dark in color.	I smoked for 12-13 years.  I am really glad I tried this product! I have never really tried to quit smoking.  However, I have made the New Year's Resolution to quit MANY times and always end up putting it off. It feels good to say "I quit smoking" or "I don't smoke anymore". Overall I am VERY pleased with Chantix!	F	32	3  weeks1mg 2X D	4/12/2012
5	To quit smoking	nausea - HAD to take this with food or I felt sick to my stomachDreams - Yes, what you hear is true.  You will dream more vivid dreams.  Where you normally had 2 to 3 dreams a week that you can recall you will have 3-5 a night and recall every detail	keep smoking while taking something to help you quit?  Awesome!  I smoked around a pack and a half a day, sometimes more.  I haven't smoked a cigg in almost 2 months, now.  This will NOT make you quit, but help you.  I got down to 2 a day and realized I didn't need it anymore.  Only YOU can make the final choice.  If you're not ready to quit then don't bother starting Chantix.	M	29	2  months1mg 2X D	2/19/2012
5	to stop smoking	nausea, some sleeping troubles, feeling yucky, headaches,	I was extremely skeptical to take this drug as I have read some negative feedback from previous people taking it.  But I really wanted to quit and I was unable to do it on my own.  The first week it was hell basically I wasn't myself, feeling depressed, tired and extremely lazy.  The second week it got better.  By the third week while taking 2 x day (1mg pill) I was feeling always nauseas and I hated feeling that way, so I just decided to take 1 x day (1mg) and feel much better.  I haven't smoked since Dec 8th.  I did try to have one just to see if I still like it but the smell and the nicotine did not do anything for me, so I knew that I am slowly weaning myself from cigarettes.  I  think what people need to understand is that it will take some time before you actually start feeling like yourself again.  Any drug out there has some kind of side effect.  I do agree also that this drug is not for everyone.  I'm just glad that I am smoke free and I hope to be this way forever.	F	32	50  days1mg 1X D	1/6/2012Email
1	To quit smoking	Some nausea, loss of sleep, loss of appetite, short temper, gas, vomiting.	My side effects were from when I was on it. Now that I am off it,they are all way worse. I did quit smoking, but the price I am paying now doesn't really seem worth it. I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone.	M	40	8  weeks1mg 2X D	1/5/2012Email
1	smoking cessation	Dizziness, vertigo, depression, inability to feel pleasure, stomach pain, pre-syncope (almost fainting), lack of excitement	After stopping varenicline due to side effects - they side became progressively worse and have not stopped 8 months later.

3	Stop smoking	Depression, Insomnia, Weight gain, Feeling like crap, Sick to stomach,gas , Bad headaches.	I started smoking when i was 16 years old. Its was a habit i enjoyed. But as ive gotten older Ive had children and they hate me smoking. I also started havin the smokers cough in the mornings. But what really made me stop was my Father layin in his death bed with Cancer and he asked me to please stop smoking. I lost my father .He was 60 yrs old. He passed away Sept 14th 2011. I have been smoke free for 40 days!! I want to live to see my great grandkids.  This medicine has made me sick..Its made me want to die. I felt worthless and cried all the time. The first 3 weeks of this medicine Is living hell. Thank God i had family and my boyfriend to help me through. I dont suggest anyone take this medicine and be alone. The medicine works..Im better and im glad im not smoking. But honestley there has to be a better way.	F	37	2  months1mg 2X D	1/2/2012Email
5	Couldn't quit on my own	This is the 3rd time I have quit smoking on chantix and the only reason is because I CHOSE to start smoking again. Not because the pill didn't work. The first two times I had absolutely no side effects, but the 3rd time around I did experience no appetite, really bad dreams, a little nausea and some stomach pain. This was very unsual for me considering I never experienced these side effects before, but I was also under a great deal of stress which could have helped trigger this off. Overall I rate this to be an excellent source to help in quitting smoking, with a high success rate. Not everyone will have side effects, but if you ask me, 1 month of side effects is a small price to pay to quit smoking and be healthy again. I reccommend this product to everyone, if you are serious about quitting. It really works.	Im so proud and happy I quit. My kids are so happy too!	F	29	20  days1 mg 2X D	12/28/2011Email
5	Stop smoking	On day 7 with only a little nausea after I take second pill. Nothing else noticed this time around. This is my second time in about 6 years first time only some crazy dreams that were not out of the norm. Worked great til I ended up drinking at a bar and started smoking again.

5	health worries	I have really bad gas but it's odorless (lucky me)and I really nauseous.I've had some really bad stomach cramps and lots of dreams!!however they aren't bad dreams just really realistic.no suicidal thoughts and no insomnia.I've had loss of appetite with weight loss but I'm extremely happy about that.last time I gained lots of weight.I would recommend chantix.it really has helped my cravings and I do believe the rest is up to me.i smoked for 9yrs.a pack a day or more.thank you chantix.i feel better.i can taste things better.my sense of smell is incredible!!		F	36	8  days1mg	12/10/2011Email
5	quit smoking	Minor hallucinations such as bugs on the floor. However i did take alot of LSD as a teenager. Also when i quit drinking 2+ yrs ago and was not on chantix, i saw bugs on the floor a couple of weeks into sobriety.	I went into taking chantix with a complete positive outlook. I told myself im going to take chantix and its gonna work and im gonna quit and im not going to get depressed or want to kill anyone. And it worked! I smoked for 15 yrs and i loved smoking! But i WANTED to quit. I was ready. I still have the obsession but i get on my knees every morning and ask my God to remove the obsession.  It worked for vodka, im sure he will rid me of the obsession soon. Thank you chantix thank you God. Thank you ex-smokers who support me and tell me why i shoulnt pick up that trashy stinkin good for nothin ball n chain smoke. Good luck to you. God Bless.	F	30	4  months1mg 2X D	11/17/2011Email
1	Stop Smoking	Severe nausea, severe stomach pains, severe constipation, severe diarrhea, severe vomiting. Fatigue, laziness, dull mood. Loss of appetite. Everything tasted funny. Crazy dreams (not nightmares). Joint pain, particularly in right elbow. Experienced a very painful lump behind vein on right side of neck. Memory loss and brain fog	Laid on couch for 5 days straight not wanting to do anything, and I am on the computer usually the whole time I am not sleeping or at work. DO NOT USE THIS DRUG, it may ruin your life. I lost all interest in the things I love to do everyday (hobbies). 2 weeks later and still have a very low interest in these things. .  Memory loss and brain fog --  couldn't spit out a word, like keep saying "hunting" when wanting to say "hinting"   NOTE - This medication DID WORK as it was supposed to.	M	38	 30 MG 1X D	11/11/2011EmailHistory
5	to stop smoking		I quit cigarettes on the 10th day of this medication with absolutely no problem. Chantix is a miracle drug in my opinion. I have been a smoker for about 35 years, and was smoking 1 pack a day when I quit.eta:  Still not smoking 5 months later.  Brief, fleeting cravings only occasionally.	F	54	 1 mg 1X D	10/27/2011EmailHistory
5	to quit smoking	Some nausea soon after taking pill, aggression, agitation, mood swings, smelly urine, vivid dreams, some insomnia.	Ok, so the list of side affects seem a bit excessive but it really isn't that bad.  I have been a smoker off and on for the past 12 years and became more of a heavy smoker soon after meeting my husband (he is a smoker too). With that said, we recently found out that we will need IVF to start a family and smoking can no longer be an option for us.  I want to be healthy and have the best body for carrying a baby.  The Chantix works like a charm. I quit after the prep week 7 days.  I do have some cravings, and at times they are a bit strong but I just feel deep down inside that I don't need the cigarette and the urge will pass.  I also drink a lot of water. If u have your support system in place you can be successful and will be able to get through the rough patches like yelling in the car in the middle of heavy traffic. My husband is completely understandable and let's me know when my mood has taken a bad turn.  The worse part for me is the insomnia...I get very little sleep and this is every single night.  I get up to go to the restroom and then I'm up for the rest of the morning. I'm averaging 4 to 5 hours a sleep every day. I want to be a mother more than anything in the world, so I have to loose some sleep but I working to be a non smoker and I want it to be for a life time and Chantix is helping me get there.	F	33	3  weeks1mg 2X D	10/26/2011Email
4	To become a Non-Smoker	A few vivid dreams the first week.  When I stopped smoking altogether I was extremely sad, depressed, anxious.  Not sure if this was from the Chantix or my body detoxing (I smoked a pack a day for 25 years).  My insurance did not pay for the medicine (which is unfortunate) so I am slowly weaning myself off of the drug (half a pill in the morning, half at night).  I did notice that by doing this, I have had some cravings but nothing that I can't manage.	This drug really worked for me.  I did not have many side effects.  However, it still was difficult to quit (I loved smoking).  Chantix helps with the physical withdrawal somewhat, but for me I had to overcome the psychological withdrawal as well and that was tough.  For those that are struggling, keep going!  For me, things started to get better and now I LOVE not be addicted or controlled by cigarettes.	M	39	60  days1MG 2X D	10/17/2011
4		The first time I had other medical problems and had to get off it to rule out medical problem. This is my second time on Chantix. The last time I was smoke free for 8 months and that was with taking the pills for a week. The mistake I made was not continuing it for the full 12 weeks. So I am back on again to finish it all.	My side affects are very mild; gas and skin kind of breaking out (lightly) but it may be from major stressors in my life as well. I don't like how I feel tired and when I try to nap sleep does not come!! So I just take a sleeping pill at night. I love how I do not have the craving mentally or physically. No bad dreams...just vivid ones. Unfortuantely the drug is not for everyone. But the ones that it does work for...Good luck!!	F	51	10  days 1X D	9/19/2011Email
5	Smoking cessation	Sleep frequently broken leaving me tired in the day.  Occasional insanely itchy forearms!!!  Like right now!  I'm looking for heavy grit sandpaper -- I'm going nuts!  Some gas in the beginning, some vertigo from time to time, dreams have been mild and very pleasant.  I feel very fortunate that my side effects have been minimal.	I know I'm among the very lucky candidates who have had no seriously negative side effects.  The itchy forearms is nearly unbearable when it strikes.  Otherwise, I'm absolutely amazed.  I have absolutely no desire to smoke other than the psychological habit, which is completely manageable since I don't physically crave cigarettes anymore, and I can even hang out with my former smoker friends at work and their smoking doesn't phase me in the least.  And I DON'T nag them, either.  It's a tough choice.  I smoked for about 30 years, about a pack a day.  I LOVED smoking, so the fact that Chantix has worked this well for me really does seem like a miracle!  It's a shame it doesn't work like this for everyone.	F	46	35  days1 tab 2X D	9/4/2011Email
5	smoking cessation	fatigue, vivid (but good) dreams, constipation, gas, smelly urine.	3 weeks in, i am very happy with this drug. yes the side effects are annoying but i can deal with them for 12 weeks if it means i am more likely to stay not smoking for life. was smoking 20 a day for 15 years - quit on day 8 and have not even been tempted to smoke since. after attempting to quit many times before using patches, gum etc..this has been like a miracle drug to me.	F	32	21  days1mg 2X D	8/23/2011Email
5	to quit smoking	First few days I was sleepy and had mild stomach cramps. Still experience mild cramps if take pill on empty stomach. Have had some vivid dreams, but not scary ones.	This drug offered the boost I needed to stop smoking.  I did smoke longer than drug company recommends, but my doctor was very honest with me about having to personalize the pattern of cutting back and not being too harsh about it.  This has worked, and I can hardly believe I can say I've been nicotine free for 9 days and feel great. Started to exercise to control weight gain, though (7 lbs and don't want more!). I would suggest Chantix to anyone as a BIG help once you make up your mind to quit.	F	57	90  days1 MG 2X D	8/18/2011
1	to stop smoking	nausea, depression,anxiety,irritability,sleep problems just about everything..	Very difficult drug to take..this is my third time and I am getting off it tomorrow. I'm afraid I'm going to hurt my kids...	F	45	2  weeks 2X D	8/12/2011
1	Quit smoking	Loss of emotional senses.  Feeling of emptyness. Almost a sense of emptyness in my brain.  I did have dreams while on Chantix, but they weren't horrible...dreams of being with my loved ones who had passed on.	Loss of sense of happiness, severe depression, anger, and hate of everyone and everything around me.  I began to hate my children, my husband, and my 18 mo old grandson, I even avoided my best friends.  I've gained 70 pounds in the three months since I've been a non smoker.  While my smoking habit of nearly 3 packs a day is gone, I'd rather be the person I was before I began my journey with this drug.  My life is really just not worth much anymore.  I wish that I had found this forum and had read the negative effects before hand. I really hope that my life comes back to me someday...	F	43	3  weeks 1X D	8/10/2011Email
1	quit smoking	Lots of side effects for me. Irritability, restlessness,vivid dreams, shortness of breath. So bad I was taken to the ER. I truly thought I was having a heart attack. Turns out I was having a panic attack. Never had one before taking chantix. Doctor said to discontinue the chantix.		F	47	8  days1mg 1X D	8/7/2011EmailHistory
1	to stop smoking	SEVERE Abdominal pain, SEVERE vomiting, SEVERE DIARRHEA, I am no longer taking the drug, but I am left with those side effects...It is so bad, some days I am in the bathroom for hours at a time. I have diarrhea 4-10 times a day, vomit at least weekly and the pain is so bad I have to be put on pain medicine...a high does at that	DO NOT USE THIS DRUG, IT WAS PUSHED OUT BEFORE ANY TEST WERE DONE!!!!!!!! Be warned	M	37	3  weeks 1X D	7/28/2011Email
4	Quit Smoking	First 3 days, during sleep, felt like I was suffocating. Awoke several times thinking I had swallowed my tongue, or couldn't get my breath. Nightmares for first 10 days. The constipation is more than I can stand not having bowel movements for 5-6 days. I've gained 35 pounds as a result.	I find it easy to quit.  I also find it easy to smoke while on it.  None of the usual smoking side effects.  You still need to break the habit of purchasing cigarettes, lighters, etc. But at anytime its easy to stop smoking once you have restarted. Recmmended to me was to take Chantix a month longer than you think.	M	49	120  days 2X D	6/26/2011Email
4	To give up marijuana	Severe inflammation of left side of face and scalp (large amounts of peeling- not sore though just embarressing) including ears (on the third week) . Dark eyes. increased energy. Irritability.Constipation. Severe mood swings. Depression. Extremely REAL dreams. increased heart rate. Extremely talkative (usually a quiet person)Thoughts of questioning my relationship with boyfriend.	It actually works if your willing to put up with ALL these side effects!Gave up properly on the second or third week. Dont give up because it DOES work !	F	19	  2X D	6/21/2011
5	stop smoking	at first a little nausea that stopped when I ate with taking the medication. Vivid dreams (not overly bad) and some gas the 1st week that went away.	I smoke for 27 years and I have been totally smoke free for 17 days and do not miss it. Even though Chantix has a few side effects it is totally worth taking it. I have tried many other ways to quit and have never quit for this long without being totally stressed out. This time it is a breeze!	F	42	3  weeks2 mg day 2X D	5/27/2011Email

5	Stop Smoking	Very tired, stomach ache, some dreams--not bad, though.	Chantix was the only stop smoking aid that ever worked for me. I have tried: patches, gum, lozenges, electronic cigarettes, cold turkey....this is my second time on Chantix--the first time I quit for three months but went back to smoking because I gained 10 pounds. This time-- as I know Chantix will work--I plan to combat weight gain with exercise and diet. Good luck everyone! The effects of smoking no where compare to the inconveniences of Chantix. (I have smoked a pack a day for 37 years--yikes!)	F	52	7  days1mg 2X D	5/2/2011
5		no side effects other than the dreams, which I dont mind... lost a sister a few months back, so in my dreams I am able to see her and talk to her.... so thats a plus in my book	it finally kicked in after about 9 days after my quit date.  Just make sure you get rid of your cigarettes and dont buy any and it will work.	F	47	26  days10mg 1X D	4/15/2011Email
5	Quit Smoking	Lots and lots of VIVID dreams, mostly normal but occassional scary ones in the beginning.  Basically whatever I thought about that day, I dreamt about that night.  Drowsiness, good for night time dose, bad for morning dose.  The worst of all however is the pain and nausea for 15-30 minutes after morning dose.  Have tried everything, with food, w/out food, milk, tons of water, etc...  Just can't escape it.  Will suffer however, because this pill works!	Aside from the gut wrenching pain and nausea during mostly the morning dose, this is a miracle pill.  I took Chantix for 3 weeks before quitting.  The day before my offical quit day, I couldn't even choke down the last 3 cigs I had, and hardly smoked that whole weekend.  So, quitting was easy to say the least.  The cravings are short and with each day, much less.  I am on day 9 and have made it through one full weekend, which I dreaded, but it was pretty easy.  I will obey the warnings from others however not to just go off it all at once.  This has been sort of an anti-depressant for me as well.  I not only quit smoking but have much less desire to drink and have been much more motivated at home and work.  I will ease off the drug eventually and work with my physician to avoid sliding into a depression w/out it.  Good Luck to those out there, I feel like a million bucks not smoking!

5	Quit smoking	The last 2 days, I've had some bloating and gas. Tummy gurgling after eating. I started a blog about my experiences using Chantix because I had read so much about the side effects when I first started using it. http://chantixblog-review.blogspot.com	Overall, I have found quitting to be quite easy on Chantix. I had a firm quit date, and stuck to it. I didn't necessarily wait for the Chantix to really make me hate the taste of smoking. It has really helped with the cravings. I am so firmly resolved in my quit, I feel I could stop taking the Chantix. I hardly have any cravings at all anymore.	F	48	28  days1 MG 2X D	4/5/2011
1	To stop smoking	Excessive gas, bad bloating, nausea, depression, thoughts of suicide, excessive appetite and weight gain, massive constipation, and acne.	I will say, It did stop the smoking.... however, until they get the side effect issues straight, I do not recommend. As of today, looking back, I beleive I would rather die a happy smoker, than a dismal depressed non-smoker. I feel I will be reuming smoking in the future. Hope not, but probably will....

4	Quite Smoking	Dreams pretty much all night, and sleeping much lighter that  usual. Constant fatigue, drowsiness, moody and loss of apetite leading to a little weight loss.  Constantly cold, not to the point of chills, but noticeably right after taking one and then tapering off till the evening pill is taken.	This is the second time after a failed attempt several years ago trying Wellbutrin.  In my case, it definitely curbs any interest in smoking, especiall compared to taking the Wellbutrin.  But the primary, and secondary side effects are a bit difficult to deal with.  Between a strong desire to quit, and the effectiveness of Chantix, I'm pretty sure this will work.	M	42	3  weeks1mg 2X D	3/8/2011
4	quit smoking	Very vivid dreams, about 50% good, 50% horrible.  Feel like i never get a full night of sleep.  Rapid mood changes, agitation, depression sometimes.  Violent thoughts. noticeable Weight gain.	It definitely takes the edge off the cravings and side effects just make withdrawl effects just a little worse.  But I would recommend this to anyone who has smoked for awhile and at least a pack a day.  Only bad part is some insurances cover it some don't, it costs more then smoking a pack a day for a month, but it does work.	M	21	3  weeks1 mg 2X D	3/3/2011
5	Stop Smoking	Dreams.. Sleepiness..Frequent Urination/Bloating/Tingling -Nasty taste in my mouth/Sensation on Tip of fingers..HORRIBLE GAS-Irritable-moody, but I am sure that came from trying to break the habit of not smoking..	I experienced nausea when I first started taking it, but as long as I take it with a meal or a light snack, I am fine. This drug has worked wonders for me. I mean, all the side effects are manageable, I would rather have them than to continue smoking. I had a hard time trying to break the habit of smoking, even when I didnt crave the cigarette. I eat ALOT of ice, carrot sticks and pretzels and I am fine. I havent had a cigarette in 14 days, I started Chantix about a month ago. I stopped smoking fully after 9 days. I am glad I jumped out there and spent that $150.00 it was well worth it. Luckily for me, all the crazy side effects I heard people were having didnt apply to me. I had the pills for a month before I took them because I was so scared I was going to try and kill myself or someone else, lol. But no, I hate having to remind myself to take 2 pills every day, but I love the way I smell,  my hair, my sense of smell, and Im just proud of me!	M	34	12  weeks 2X D	3/2/2011Email
5	quit smoking	terrible smelling gas, VERY bad odor to urine.  Nausea if taken without food and even with food can still have about 30 mins or so of nausea. vivid but good dreams.  was smoking two packs a day easy and now down to about 5 cigs a day. I used this drug about 2 years ago and totally quit for about 1 and 1/2 years and just do to stress started back but this time is for good. I think this drug is awesome!!		F	43	18  days1mg 2X D	2/28/2011Email
5	Quit Smoking	Nausea breifly after taking, frequent urination, gas, VERY vivid dreams.	This is the second time I am prescribed Chantix; the first I stopped taking it too soon.  I have absolutely no urge to smoke, and don't even think about it at all.  I am thankful for this, however I am starting to experience some of the side-effects full blown.  Last night I was up 4 separate occasions urinating, even though I did not drink much the day before.  Every night I am having dreams that seem so realistic, I wake up remembering everything.  Not that this is a bad thing, but I am someone who rarely has or remembers my dreams.  I have been smoking for 12 years about a pack a day.	M	27	11  days1 pill 2X D	2/24/2011Email
3	quit smoking	The first week was actually very pleasant. I enjoyed my vivid dreams and slept like a baby. After the first week i had to double my dos to .1mg bid and that week was terrible. Everyday i was nautious and sick to my stomach. I had taken my blood pressure because i wasnt feeling well and it was sky high.	my face was flush, i was very aggitated. I cannot take a high dose, it doesnt work well with me.	F	42	7  days.05 1X D	2/7/2011Email
5	to quit smoking	mostly anxiety, anger and depression the third or forth week of prescription that lasted for about one week	i have quit smoking and am so very happy that it worked.  i did not have bad dreams,  but the depression and anger was very strong for the week that i experienced it   i am lucky to have a strong support system and supportive husband.  i do think this medication is worth taking	F	45	3  months1mg 2X D	1/31/2011
2	stop smoking/high blood pressure	Anger issues, wanting to cry all the time, nausea for 30-45 minutes after dose, fogginess, tiredness.	Don't know if this will work or not...the rage at everything is almost worse than the smoking.  Will try for the rest of this prescription, 120.00 is nothing to waste!  Absolutely no desire yet to stop smoking.	M	49	3  days.05 mg 2X D	1/29/2011
2	quit smoking	Severe nausea. No other side effects.	I quit without assistance several years ago. Started smoking again during times of stress. Tried chantix to try to take the "edge" off. The pills made me violently ill within minutes after taking them, regardless of what was in my stomach. After eight days, I quit chantix and went back to will power.  Still smoke free with my breakfast intact.	M	37	8  days1mg 2X D	1/24/2011
3	to stop smoking	Horrible constipation, and gas	I had to take this medication for a whole month before I noticed it worked, I did go down to 1 cigarette a day and had no cravings, but I had to stop taking it because of the side effects to my stomach  Also my insurance didn't pay for it and it cost more than what I way paying for cigarettes	M	48	2  months 1X D	1/6/2011
1	Smoking	Worked for me for two months, but, had mood swings, crazy dreams, waking up in night, and major Eye vision problems. Found out as I started when Drug was new on market, there were issues with vision and could even cause glaucoma. Had to have my new glasses changed within 30 days, and was told if still wearing contacts, the doctor would have said I switched them in the eyes! My right eye totally changed, and left one too. Go figure!	This drug worked, but at what cost? Yes, I was thrilled to know it was not putting nicotine into me, but playing with the brain caused many other issues.  Started smoking again gradually 1 to 2 a day then back to one pack.  Decided couldn't handle the eye issues and mood/sleep issues. Would love to quit but will try different route.	F	62	 30 mg 1X D	1/6/2011Email
5	Quit Smoking	vivid dreams, nausea, mood swings, hard time sleeping for first two weeks.	Talked to dr. who also prescribed topamax, a mood stabilizer and helps with migraines, and started taking chantix once a day, in the evening.  Alleviated nausea, vivid dreams and trouble sleeping stopped.  Don't know if it was the combo of Chantix and Topomax, but whatever it is, it's working for me.  It's the first time in 15 years I've been able to quit for this long, usually I've gone 2 months and struggled to make it that long.  No desire to smoke, changed my patterns, and it's been 4 months since my last cig.	F	35	3  months1 mg 1X D	1/1/2011
4	To stop chewing	Red rash on neck at the beginning when I started taking Chantix.Vivid dreams-Not so bad, some were enjoyable since I usually never remember my dreams.	I smoked 1 pack per day for 10 years and to quit smoking I used chewing tobacco as a crutch. Well, imagine this (sarcasim). I became addicted to that for a period of 5 years.  Over the last two years I attempted to kick nicotine altogether by using various methods such as cold turkey, patch, gum, and even a natural herbal supplement.  Needless to say, I failed each time.  I recently inquired about Chantix and my physician prescribed it to me.  To me, it works like a wonder drug. Now, there is still work, YOU HAVE TO WANT TO QUIT.  One must still break the day-to-day routine and association with addiction. No magic pill for changing your lifestyle exists. You just have to do it and want to do it. I have not touched any tobacco now for 20 days which is first time in 15 years.  Couple the assistance of the medicine with my DESIRE TO WANT TO QUIT, and there is no reason I can not be 100% successful. Be honest with yourself, stopping a multiyear daily habbit WILL be difficult no matter what, how bad do you want it?  There are a lot of potential side effects that YOU must discuss with your doctor. For me, I worked with my doctor and wife to closely monitor my behavior.  I would rather have a brief period of discomft and change in my life to add on 10-30 years at the backend.  PS I watched my mom die of lung cancer recently, it iss not pretty.	M	31	25  days1mg 2X D	12/14/2010

2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful.

1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present.

I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie).

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.

Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight.

3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor.

It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache.

3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010

3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped. Abilify worked immediately and I haven't been depressed since.	F	24	3  weeks5mg 1X D	5/9/2010Email

Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal.

I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue.

2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now.

After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

5	Major Depression, Anxiety	Have had some problems concentrating.  Although I love to read, it has been a struggle to focus for a sustained amount of time.  Mild weight gain.  Insomnia (but the Seroquel has completely cured that.)	Abilify has helped me like no other drug.  I am on it along with cymbalta, deplin, seroquel and ativan.  Within just a few days I was feeling better and am now able to exercise, clean my house and just moved across the country-something I could never have done during my depression.

3	Bi-polar, Depression, GAD	Terrible night sweats, very vivid, bizzare dreams, constipation, twitching, extreme lethargy...	I don't feel depressed and sad anymore.  I feel kind of leveled out, but I hate the tiredness all the time.  I can sleep for 10 hours, take my son to school, come home and go back to sleep for another couple of hours.  Then still have little to no energy for the rest of the day.  I was previously, taking 60 mg. of Cymbalta for almost 2 years, but my dr. switched me to this when I started to feel like dying again.  I also take Valium (5 mg.) when I feel anxious and panic coming on.	F	35	14  days5 mg. 1X D	2/12/2010Email

3	Bipolar II, PTSD	Started with 2 mg... upped my mood considerably, side effects then were indigestion, headache, nasal congestion..  those subsided after a few days. Upped to 5 mg, felt like a ton of bricks at first. Seems to be subsiding.	Mood elevation subsided and went back into the "I don't want to see or talk to anyone" and sadness.

3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!	F	38	1  years20mg 1X D	2/5/2010
2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010
4	ocd, agitation, schizotypal	drowsiness at high dosage, jittery at low. however, sometimes i feel my legs very heavy, other times i've a little akathisia. try to manage the right dosage for you, it's the only way.	it get slow my mind, my obsessions get down almost to not have. i take it in combo with Wellbutrin and Gabapentin, and i feel calmer and relaxed than before. it was horrible only thinking about past.

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010
1	depression, of all excuses	This is to the PARENTS out there who believe that if their child looks passive on the drug it is a godsend:  Beating someone over the head with a baseball bat can also make them sit still.  Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.  No more for me. Abilify- Forgetaboutit!!!!!!!	F	57	3  days	1/30/2010Email

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.

5	anxiety and depression	increased hunger and increased energy	This is a wonder drug for me. I thought I was going do die due to severe depression and anxiety. I am taking cymalta but after about a year, it didn't work. My MD RX'd 5mg of abilify along with my cymbalta every day. In my opinion, it saved my life. I feel like I have a reason to live and starting to enjoy the things I used to, just after one week of starting the med.	F	42	7  days	1/13/2010
4	Bipolar and anxiety	restlessness increased appetite inability to concentrate. Not sure if there are periods of anxiety or nervousness. No Mania	Works for mania. My pdoc says there is activation at low doses. My son started on 10 mg and takes 15 mgs. He also takes 900 mg of lithium and 10 mgs of Lexapro.	M	10	6  months	12/29/2009Email
3	Depression	Weight gain and constant appetite, anxiety, inability to concentrate	Worked well for the depression, but the constant appetite and associated weight gain, along with anxiety at higher doses, was not worth it overall	F	39	2.5  months	12/22/2009
5	Major Depression, PTSD	Insomnia, but only compared to previous behavior of sleeping 10-12 hours per day.	It really works!	M	64	1  months	12/21/2009Email
1	anxiety and mood swings	increased heart rate that made my daughter pass out only after the 2nd day.	after first night of taking my daughter missed school the next day feeling nauseated and stomach cramps. That night she experienced indigestion/heartburn. She vomited. Sleepy but couldn't sleep. Feeling scared for no reason. Next day she passed out after being awake for 15 min. I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug. I got home and looked up the side effects and all of these were listed.  I can only say that we are glad we found out so quickly about this drug.	F	12	2  days	12/19/2009
2	OCD, racing thoughts.	drowsiness, leg pains, akathisia...	it is a great drug to calm down mind... seems to be on a "holy peace"... but side effects are too strong, just for me.	M	23	14  days	12/18/2009
3	bipolar	stopped after 14 months due to heart pulpitations, memory loss, trouble sleeping, slur speach due to excess syliva, after 12 months these things started. At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying. I am very uncomfortable giving a child this age any drug that is diagnosised by trial and error.	M	8	14  months	12/17/2009
2	unipolar depression	nasal stuffiness, dyslexia, word finding problems, increased appetitite, change (worsening) of vision, weight gain and wanting to graze constantly, watering eyes, feel like gravity is heavier (I have to sit down to brush my teeth), very restless around people, visual hallucinations (things disappear then reappear right where I saw them last), trouble focusisng while driving  --- weird.	I am taking 50 mg of lamictal concurrently with 7.5 mg abilify.  Affect is flatter, less mood swings, but more non-reactive than anything.  I'm not sure this is where I want to be. I have been able to get projects done that I had difficulty starting.  Some days I have energy, some days I don't.  I a fasting blood draw yesterday and haven't heard the results yet.  Continuing to take abilify is a quandary -- do I feel worse or better if I factor in all the weird side effects?  I will probably cut down on the dose since I really will be suicidal if I gain any more weight.	F	51	30  days	12/17/2009
3	Bipolar	Some weight gain, some restlessness	My 14 yr old son has been on 2.5 mg of Abilify for 3 months now.  He has gained 8lbs. so we are going to be watching this closely.  It has helped him be able to concentrate, and definitely better in school, and social groups.  Smoothed out the ups and downs.  Previously was on trileptal and zoloft.	M	14	90  days	12/14/2009Email
1	Post-opiate addiction depression	Cannot sit still, terrible anxiety after about 2 weeks, weight gain	This drug should be taken off the market.  After about the 3rd day you will not be able to sit still, ever.  It feels like there is something inside of you trying to get out.  After about 2 weeks I started having severe anxiety attacks almost constantly and came very close to having to be committed/hospitalized.  Smack your doctor if he recommends this.	M	26	 	12/13/2009
