2	allergies	nausea, dizziness	In my neverending quest to find something to help my son with summer allergies (itchy eyes, fatigue) we tried Tavist as it listed few side effects but he can't take that either, Claritin was a disaster, guess our only option right now is to try the local honey thing.

5	allergies	none	Was put on clemastine (prescription strength) by allergist many years ago after getting no relief from other allergy medicines.  This is the only drug which has kept away my allergy-related sinus/migraine type headaches, as well as other symptoms.  Strongly recommend it.	F	59	16  years	12/12/2008
4	allergies (outdoor & indoor)	None.	THis works better for me than Claritin, Allegra,or Zyrtec. I personally perfer the flexibility of a 12-hour pill. (I often only need to take it at night.)	F	39	8  years	3/26/2008
