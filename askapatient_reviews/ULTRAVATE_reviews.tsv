4	Eczema	This stuff is one of the most powerful topical steroids and I ended up getting away from it because of dermatitic atrophy (thining of skin). I think short runs for flare ups are better than prolonged use as effectiveness, for me, tapered off and required longer and higher dosage prednisone courses.	It's like lightning: awesome but could be dangerous if not given careful consideration.	M	36	3  years 3X D	6/4/2010Email
5	Psoriasis	Slight irritation when used over prolonged period.	Should not be used for longer than 2 weeks at a time. Works fine at reducing itching and plaqueing in psoriasis, but psoriasis never really heals completely. Far better than most steroid creams, however, and much lighter and easier to use. Switched to Humira with amazing results.	M	38	4  years	7/15/2008Email
