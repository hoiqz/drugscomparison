4	brain mets due to breast ca	some dizzyness - seems to affect balance - read that pt shouldn't drive while on temodar.  nausea controlled by kytril and adivan, works very well. mouth sores, use nysatin, works very well.	I am post brain surgery and cyberknife radiation.  I am on my 3rd round of temodar.  From what I understand, temodar has not been proven to work for brain mets from breast cancer.  My oncoclogist seems to feel that there have been some good results in the past.  I have an MRI follow up every two months and just had my 3rd follow up with no new tumor growth nor residual tumor growth at the surgical site.  I am also on CMF Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, and Fluorouracil one week on two weeks off and Zometa once a month. Temodar round is 300 mg 5 days on 23 days off. It's too early to tell if the Temodar is helping.	F	52	3  months	12/6/2009Email

Constipation. Change in hair texture.	It was easy to take orally at home. Tumor showed above average regression after 2 rounds but then began growing through the Temodar in 3rd month. Toxicity was the same on standard dose as well as daily.	M	11	3  months	8/15/2006
4	Brain Cancer (GBM 1V)	Tiredness, nausea	Large brain tumor right temporal removed surgically, then 6000gys of radiation thenTook Temodar 470mg per day 5 continous days per month x 3years and half then  temodar was reduced to 400mg per day 5 continous days per month due to tiredness, no sign of recurrence so we are not stopping treatment as long as I can take it. This is acting as a preventative treatment since there is no cure to Glioblastoma Multiforme, but the beast has not recurred so it might be working. I have no deficit and doing well	M	27	4  years	8/15/2006
