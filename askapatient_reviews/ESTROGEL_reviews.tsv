1	Hot flashes and vaginal dryness	Rapid weight gain with diarrhea.  Severe bloating and not feeling well.		F	60	4  weeks2 pumps 1X D	2/12/2013
2	Menopause symptoms	acne, weight gain, bloating, rage, mood swings, constipation, hot flashes	Switched from Premarin because of synthetic HRT concerns. I like the ease of use and knowing the drug isn't going through my major organs to do its job. At first I thought it was okay, but now, I am bloated all the time, am constipated, have huge pimples pop up under my skin, and had one moment the other day that caused me to know the meaning of temporary insanity. Might have committed murder - I was so angry. Even my husband who has known me for 20+ years said he has never seen me so angry...and he HAS seen me angry.  I can only attribute it to the switch from Premarin to Estrogel.  I am going to a new doctor to find out what is going on and fix this mess - do I have to have any HRT at all?  I hope I am told no.
