5	SPINAL FUSION L2, L3, L4, L5 & S1	The only issue was constipation, after about one month it subsided and my body adjusted to the medication.	MS Contin 60mg three times daily controls my pain much better than Fentanyl. I am now able to have somewhat of a quality of life and not have to deal with the torture of pack pain on a daily basis. I am now able to walk and spend time with my family. The only bad thing is it took the pain management physician 2 1/2 years to realize I was having issues with the Fentanyl due to the fact the medication only lasted for 18 hours (not 72 hours). He finally switched my medication to MS Contin with some resistance.      	M	59	7  months60MG 3X D	7/7/2012Email
4	Stage 2B T-cell Paransal Lymphoma	The primary side effect was severe constipation. I did not find it otherwise hindered my functioning in any was until i tried to stop taking it.	It does appear to be quite strongly addictive. I was taking the 60mg of long acting twice daily, plus 30 or 40 mg short acting three or four times a day, as needed. As the treatment progressed I gradually reduced the amount without problems, but now at on 30mg long acting tablet daily, i find myself challenged. In the beginning before the cancer diagnosis, i went through all the pain meds starting at T-3, which was useless with severe pain, and I eventually was at the morphine after trying everything in between, which was (fianlly) effective.Can be challenging to stop using it, but if your pain is severe, this works... Good pain management is extremely important for quality of life, and getting off it is a problem for another day.	M	42	8  months60mg 2X D	6/21/2012Email
5	severe lower back pain	constipation is my main complaint	I used to be on 60mg bid, I insisted on going down to 30mg bid, it does not work as well and in more pain, but I would rather not have to take any pain medication if it is not necessary.  I do take another med for break through pain and have for 4 years.	F	46	4  years30mg 2X D	6/13/2012Email

4	Chronic Arthritic and Surgical Pain	Constipation and nausea.	I've been on quite a few different Opiate painkillers. MS Contin is probably the best overall pain med I've tried. It doesn't get me too "drugged up" while still helping with the pain. The temptation to take more than the script is so much less than any other pain med I've been on. I really appreciate that. Running out of meds is truly a nightmare.	M	46	2  years75 mg 3X D	3/20/2012Email
4	Back Pain and Fibromalgia	Have had few side effects compared to other narcotic pain meds. Need to take stool softeners to keep from constipation. Does cause dry mouth so need to drink more often and suck on hard candy. Sometimes get abdominal pain after taking it.	Have problems getting pain medication in my state. Go to legitimate Pain Clinic and still get "the look" from pharmacist at local CVS. They are not to judge me but do so. The state has made it next to impossible to get my pain medication for chronic pain.	F	61	12  months30Mg 4X D	3/20/2012Email

5	Severe chronic pain	Occasional constipation, some withdrawals when managing	c2/3 L3/3/5 S1 due to accident. Had laminectomy, and other surgery. My life, marriage, work, everything was destroyed while I tried to cope for years with chronic pain. Dr's said things like "you walked in here, you can walk out." Yes I have long hair, and I am eccentric, but do not use any recreational drugs. Finally, through a caring nurse friend I found a doctor who was appalled at my previous treatment and gave me MS Contin. I live a reasonably normal life now. Management is important. Each month I reduce my dose to 1 x 60mg per day taken at 10am. Yes I get the flu symptoms and some unpleasant side effects for the 2 to 3 days, but when I get back to the normal dose the effect is dramatic and I have my energy back. It takes management. Constipation is a definite but can be ameliorated easily. I take one teaspoon of Nu-Lax (contains senna, pears, apricot, figs, dates, sucrose and glucose and is a very natural laxative) Also two glasses of Metamucil per day. Pleasant taste, orange or other fruit flavours which will work as a stool softener. I do recommend putting up with the 'cleansing' procedure once a month to flush out the excess morphine. It will be marginally unpleasant, but the effort is well worth it. Ms Contin has given me my life back.	M	63	7  years60mg 2X D	2/21/2012Email
5	Nerve damage from Whipple procedure	Always have to be cautious of constipation. Biggest problem now is DEA cracking down on legitimate cancer centers like Vanderbilt. All of the doctors are scared to death and admit they are no longer in charge of my healthcare. Tried to change and no doctor would go near me. They scraped the sheath of of a very large nerve and told me I would have pain for life. I don't think they thought I would live this long.		M	58	8  years400MG 3X D	2/7/2012Email
5	Spinal fusion of L2, L3, L4, L5, S1	MS Contin has given me my life back. I was on Fentanyl patches for a period of 3 1/2 years and they only provided pain relief for 18 hours.  I am no longer haunted by the never ending pain in my lumbar spine. Side effects was constipation but that has deminished. Overall a good medication.		M	59	6  months60mg X 2	2/6/2012Email
4	Degenerative disc disease	No side effects, it seems very weak and I want more relief. I'm a first time pain med. clinic and want to tell my dr I need more but I'm nervous. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.		F	32	6  days15Mg	1/16/2012Email
5	pain:legs,back;ie too much surgery	rapid speech some contipation lasted 3weeks	as most have said ;oxy's can cause behavorial problems but some euphoria and nausea. you must ween you self off .i did by splitting them taking only one. i never knew i could take lower dose with some other med for break through,after my surgery i got off them but always wanted oycodone. its agood drug and life giver and taker.when flair ups lortabs were prescribed and flair-up was bareable to take advil but last flair-up so bad,but doctor treated me like you dont need medicine but said pain real, i am buddist & i need to chant evryday and it hurts to sit up but i manage to pray and three weeks for help. finally i took friend to his dr and he told about ms and this beats taking 4 -5 loratabs and i feel alot less pain and know when to shut up and happier- cymbalta helps aids in mood stabilization. IAM grateful this is n ot the buzz drug but actually gets to the pain with a norco at some point to make the day. respectfully	M	45	60  days30mg 2X D	11/22/2011Email
5	3 herniated spinal discs; sciatica	Constipation, itching, mild nausea, mild sedation.  No euphoria, and isn't too "loopy" to function.	I love this med - it's made my life partially managable again after a bad fall on my tailbone, which ruptured 3 spinal cord discs in my lower back (L-4, L-5, S-1).  I have herniated disc disorder with sciatica (which is radiating/shooting pains down my legs, usually the left one).  I've got severe nerve damage in my legs due to the jelly from the ruptured discs adding too much pressure on my spinal cord.  MS Contin works even more effectively with Chitosan supplements.  Google it - I speak the truth, from experience.  I prefer ENDO generics, because they seem to release a bit faster.  Mallinkradt (sp?) are annoying because they take FOREVER to kick in but once they do, they're fine.  The other I've had are Watson, which I very much like as well due to earlier feeling of analgesia onset.	F	28	9  months30mg 3X D	11/15/2011Email
4		Basically I have constipation.	It helps to take the edge off of my back and joint pain. The last thing I want to do is abuse it. Having taken street drugs for 14 years I know that I could be addicted to morphine, but this is simply not the case.	F	50	2  years45mg 3X D	10/17/2011Email
3	back and neck surgery went bad	none yet	Need info. I am really scared about drugs. I was on oxy 20mg twice daily for a month. I took it once aday and was scared to death after what I say you all say on the comments about it. I dumped remaining out in doctors commode and he wrote me scripts for mscontin 15mg twice daily. Just wanted to know what you all think. If I stop will I have the withdrawals you all talked about with oxy. I had to give a rating but havent taken it yet.	M	62	 15mg 2X D	9/29/2011Email

1	Kidney Stone	Really uncomfortable, barely took any edge off the pain. Made me feel like my head was swelling and left me nauseated. My pain killer tolerance is fairly high. Any kind of pain relief faded after half an hour.		F	21	1  daysIV ? 1X D	2/16/2011
5	Back injury	Itching, constipation, confusion (at times)	My doctor's decision to prescribe MS Contin is the best advice I have gotten in the 20+ years I have dealt with my back problems.I have had a total of 10 surgeries and more are necessary. However, I have no intention of letting them touch me again. Though I'm only 41, I am considered disabled and receiving benefits, I am relatively comfortable and happy. Mainly due to the introduction of MS Contin to my life. Like many I have read, I was doing oxycontin with dilaudid breakthrough. This went on for about 18 months leaving me with an obvious addiction that began to disrupt everything in my life. With the unbelievable help of my doctor, whom I owe everything to, I was able to stop the oxy/dilaudid Hell after a year or so with the use of MSC. After six yrs, I am maintaining on 150/180mgs daily and leading a pretty normal life. Sure, I have horrible days. However they are greatly improved from how it was. The good days are REALLY good too.	M	41	6  years30mg 6X D	12/31/2010Email
5	S1 nerve damage, 3 L5-S1 surgeries	Slightly drowsy within an hour of taking dose, wake up every morning with extreme hoarseness and dry throat/mouth.  Mild acne again, slight itching.	I was on Oxycontin 40mg 3X a day for the last 2 years and thought it was great.  Little did I know how much different my life would be on MS Contin.  (Plus it is SO much cheaper!).  My husband cannot get over how calm I am.  He describes it as on oxy, there was always a level of tension/possible emotional eruption lurking, but with MSC, I am mellow as can be.  Very happy, he says the "old me" is back, more chatty, happier, overall mood enhancement.  I never realized oxy had done that to me - after years, we forget our former personalities, I guess.  I was taken off oxy abruptly due to severe side effects that came on suddenly, so I am being titrated up slowly on the MSContin.  I am going every 2 weeks until my dose is settled.  I am hoping this dose will be "it" - 100mg 3 X a day.  I take Percocet 10/325 up to 3 a day for breakthrough meds as needed.  I am very glad to have gotten the "oxycontin" burden out of my life - hated ever having to tell any docs, any ER, any pharmacy because of the stigma.  I would have asked to switch years ago if I knew it would be this effective and allow the return of "me" personality-wise!	F	44	5  weeks100 3X D	11/1/2010
4	Severe sciatica, Radiculopathy	Initially I became constipated	I sustained a nursing injury while trying to save a patient. I felt horrible burning up and down my buttocks. I was in PT 5x per week. I got no relief and was finally put on percocet and it did nothing. I became bedbound from pain. I saw a pain psychologist because I became suicidal from intense unbearable pain. I lost my job and lost my home. A psychiatrist evaluated me and asked a pain specialist to put me on morphine. My life was forever changed that day because for the first time in a year I was going to finally get some relief. The medication allows me to function without pain and I have been asked if I "feel high" and the answer is NO! I feel as though the medication allows me to think and function without chronic debilitating pain. I never did go back to nursing because a nurse can not work under the influence of narcotics. A light-duty nurse does not work because they are considered a liability. My pain psych informed me that without pain management I most likely would have resorted to suicide. 	F	45	10  years100mg 2X D	10/28/2010Email
3	multi-level disc disease	SEVERE Anorexia, which continues up to today. I began taking MS Contin 30 mg tablet every 12 hours, and Roxicodone 15 mg tablet / 5 per day, in March of 2010. I really do not know if one, or both, of these opiates, is the problem.	MS Contin 100 mg tablet every 12 hours, plus Roxicodone 15 mg tablet / 5 per day, plus Promethazine HCL 25 mg tablet prn, has helped alleviate my pain somewhat. But I still must be very-careful how I move, walk, and do other simple things, like standing to wash dishes; roll-over in bed; etc.---the simple movements of body which most people take for granted. This back pain is HELL!!! In short, this present medication regimen does not work real well for me. I just began receiving the 100 mg MS Contin tablets 8 days ago, increased from 60 mg tablet every 12 hours. I really think I need my Roxicodone 15 mg tablets / 5 per day, increased to 30 mg Roxicodone tablets, but I am concerned my doctor, who is a very helpful and understanding man, might flip on me, and cut me off. I should add, that my back damage was caused, by my being thrown out of the back of a 54 foot shipping van, when a tractor jerked the van from under me, throwing me to the concrete warehouse floor, on October 07, 2009---I have a lawyer. I have real problems, and I am really afraid of my doctor thinking I am playing him, for a legal high---which I am not, as my January 2010 CAT Scan is plain proof of my problems. Have any of you suffered with the SEVERE Anorexia, nausea, and diarrhea problems, especially the Anorexia? Anyone who has had the Anorexia and lack of analgesia problem(s) got a winning LEGAL drug combination for me to suggest to my doctor? I have not yet told my doctor about the Anorexia problem.

5		nausea	if it hadn't of been for ms contin I not have been able to get out of bed and do my normal daily activities due to a chronic back condition.	F	53	  2X D	8/9/2010
1	IBD	Drowsiness, severe anxiety, gassiness, major constipation	I take this medication mostly in the form of codeine. This horrible drug gives me endless anxiety, as a result, making me lose sleep. It also gives me weird thoughts/feelings that I can't explain. This medication works for the pain; however, it causes extreme gassiness when its effects are over. If I had a choice, I would definitely take fentanyl over morphine.	M	25	1  days10 mg 2X AN	7/7/2010
4	multi level disc, other back, neck	I always have taken added stool softeners, twice a day, in the beginning, oxy days, the doctor failed to warn me, I ended up in ER, I still seem to have depression but don;t think its the drug.	This is a great pain reliever, to bad they give you all the dumb pills first to get there.  Like others expressed, I to felt supid all the time on Oxy pills.  I asked the Pharmisist for a cheaper drug that relieved the pain and was'nt so expensive.I felt my mind clear up, and all round felt better, I do though worry about being failed by my doctor and not having my meds.  He's went on vacations and things without me knowing, went to get my meds and he not their, and know one else to prescibe.  Good luck, with that story and getting someone else to fill in.Some doctors would'nt give you a asprin, thank god for the others who actually help and listen.  Too, many doctors are like going to fast food resturants, in  and out is all they care about.  Mine started out good, but lately I see him starting to slip in this mood, I call it FFRD(fast food resturants doctor),  and everyone knows how hard it is to get a repore with a doctor. excuse some of my spelling..I just worry about future problems, higher doses, side effects, the doctor, not getting the meds all of a sudden, things I don't know about..I do still have pain, but try and just live with it, don't want higher doses,  I relize now that all the pain can't be fixed with the pill,  but they sure help...and with this med, theres no buzz that I feel..	M	52	2  years100mg 2X D	5/17/2010
5	Hip injury	Very mild acne.	The Morphine has helped me to function (mostly) regularly.  I sometimes have unbearable breakthrough pain.  Lately, though, I feel that I may have built a tolerance.  If I take my prescribed dose, I feel pretty much the same as if I hadn't taken the dose at all.  I find that if I take 2 doses at once, I get the relief I used to.  So I am wondering, one: Is building a tolerance normal? and, two: Is there a way to ask my doctor to up my dosage without her thinking I'm addicted?  I don't really know where to go from here.  Thanks for any help that comes my way.  :)	F	26	2  years15 MG 2X D	5/15/2010Email
2	Multiple Sclerosis / Spine pain	Can't poop. :O) Really tired and seem to pee a lot more.	I have been on Percocet for about 5 years . I was recently switched to MS Contin 15mg 1X daily every 12 hours. Not sure if it's the low dosage but it doesn't do much for pain.	F	31	4  days15mg 1X D	5/11/2010
5	Chronic pain; fibromyalgia	You WILL get constipated when you first start on MSContin, but things eventually make their way out, and once your GI tract adjusts to the body's new metabolism, you shouldn't have any problem at all.	A true lifesaver; the original time-released Morphine; ask for it by name.  Could not believed how much of a difference it made to my chronic pain levels.	F	46	5  years15 mg 3X D	5/10/2010
4	pain in hand from injury.	slowed bowel movements, dizzy for first few days of use. Morphine is very smooth and mellow, so for those looking for a pain killer/speed pill, this stuff is not for you.	Wanted off OXY, was up to 80mg a day of OXY and was tired of the devil's venom. I have a VERY good relationship with my Doctor, she said try MS contin, so here I am. Not as strong as OXY, very smooth unlike OXY which is like a hammer to the head. Morphine is mellow, so if you take OXY for the hyped up feeling, MS contin is not for you. I feel ten times better getting off the OXY as I was tired of the ups and downs. My mind is sharp again, my sex drive is back, and my moods are stable. Plus I no longer have to deal with the BS of an OXY script. For those of you on the devils venom, you know what I mean. MS contin is not near the potent mind bender as OXY, but so far has killed my pain and gotten me away from the roller ride of OXY. After being on Morphine now for 90 days, I will never go back to OXY. Take care all.	M	36	90  days 3X D	4/16/2010Email
4	Spinal stenosis, DDD, L5-S1	Constipation. I have to take Senna-S twice daily. When I first started I had very vivid, disturbing dreams	Excellent pain medication, almost no cognitive side effects compared to most other opioids. Over two years I have not needed to increase the dose.	M	21	2  years30 mg 2X D	2/9/2010
4	Fibromyalgia, Lupus, whiplash	the constipation and itchiness are a given if you're already experienced with narcotics and chronic pain. i've been in pain since 2002 and i'm only 24...but i get a freaky-weird side effect beyond the constipation, drowsiness, stupidity, dizziness, etc.  it has MADE ME LACTATE! and there's no way i'm preggers.  Fentanyl did the same thing. also, since i've been taking it, my blood pressure has shot up. i don't know if the two are related, so don't take my word on it.	very effective for my pain, though i'm already tolerant to my prescribed dosages after about a week and a half.  but i've been on many narcotics over the years, so i've come to expect it. i have noticed a little cognitive impairment (i feel "stupid"), and can't do a lot of the intellectual tasks that make me happy, but for the relief it offers, it's pretty much worth it.	F	24	14  days	11/11/2009
4	Chronic Pain Due to a MVA March 09	drowsiness, dry mouth, affected my co-ordination, slurred speech	I had a severe MVA in Adelaide SA on 14/3/09 and was admitted to hospital. Since then i have tried Endone 5mg, Tramadol SR 200mg, Panadine fte, Mersyndol fte, Mersyndol, Deptran 50mg and nothing worked until the MS CONTIN 30 mg 2x a day. I was sick and tired of feeling like a tablet popper, and my pain didnt leave it actually got worse so my doctor suggested i take MS CONTIN 30mg at 8am and 8pm with Panadine Forte as a breakthrough for pain. The MS CONTIN has not ended all of my pain but it has eased it 40% but it makes me a bit LOOPY and un co-ordinated after it starts working.	F	33	2  days	11/4/2009Email
3	kneecap dmg, hypermobility syndrome	Headaches, constipation (preferrable to normal diarrhea), dizziness	I was switched from Oxycodone IR to MS Contin ER about a week ago. My dr. was trying to give me something that would last longer. The morphine helps somewhat with the pain, but not as well as the OxyIR, and I am having excruciating headaches all day. I'm taking 2 Vicodin 7.5/750 just to get rid of the headaches. I would much rather be back on the Oxy IR.	F	26	6  days	8/30/2009Email
5	Raynaud's/CREST Syndrome Treatment	None.	Writing on behalf of my wife who has experienced severe pain due to this autoimmune disorder attacking her fingers.  She got an experimental treatment of prostaglandin infusion via IV and pain has been worse since that was done 3 weeks ago.  That being said, 15mg of MS Contin 2x daily seems to do the job very well in alleviating the pain.  There has been no addiction.  In fact it went the opposite way: she gave it up easily and had no withdrawal symptoms.  But the pain returned with an awful vengeance two days later.  Moral of the story (that prescribing Dr. never told us): you must take it steadily, don't go on and off without supervision. As for the question of pharmacy "attitude", I did experience that the first time I brought in the scrip (they lied and said "we won't have that for another week"), but be persistent and once they know it's for a legitimate need they will be helpful.

5	Spasmodic Torticollis, Disc Probs	In the beginning of using MS Contin it caused moderate, to severeconstipation, which can easily be treated by taking Colace, stool softeners, 100mg, two times per day.	Three and a half years ago my doctor put me on MS Contin and I've had my ups and downs with this med, but am happy to announce that I've been in the process of slowly being weaned off of MS Contin, for the past month. I'm not sure how long it is going to take, until I am completely off of it. What I've learned from MS Contin:  This drug is definitely not for short-term use. It is intended for someone who needs long-term pain management for severe pain only! It is so easy to become addicted to this drug, not to mention dependent on taking it every single day. I have written here a few times before. Some posts were positive and some negative. I met someone from this board and now we are great friends, even though she lives halfway across the country from me! I am just so grateful to God, and to my Dr for being able to take this medication with not too many problems or interactions and that I'm able to go off of this medication as smoothly as possible!

4	L5-S1 disk replacement, now fusion	constipation which actually is preferrable to irritable bowel syndrome that I no longer have	I was taking 120 mg 4X a day after most recent surgery. The pain relief was acceptable. After 6 months on this routine I felt better and switched to Norco during the day for breakthrough and took 120 mg at night. I never felt addicted to this drug but I did notice that I would break out in a sweat for no reason after reducing to 1X a day from 4X. Now Dr, has me on oxy contin 2X a day. I am struggling to get pain free and stop all this poison I am having to take. There is no shame in needing pain relief just make sure you are being honest with yourself and your Dr.	M	45	6  months	2/13/2009
5	Chronic Pain L4-5 surgery, DDD, OA	occasional constipation.	Excellent drug for long term, safe and effective treatment of chronic pain. Because it is slowly released the relief is stable. I have gone through withdrawal of this drug, twice, once w/a MD and once on my own. The time I did it myself I did it gradually but it was still terrible. With the MD it was a switch to another drug and it was HELL. I will NEVER go through that again and only agreed to go back on this medication with much discussion of a gradual and well monitored withdrawal, if I ever do stop it. This is, as one MD put it, a clean drug and has been out on the market for a long time. I trust it.	F	51	10  years	2/8/2009Email

4	Hypermobility syndrome + headaches	Dizziness only when introducing the med.Constipation after months of taking it, only getting worst.Acid reflux.The usual physical addiction. Do not have psychological addiction, but couldn't stop it without major withdrawal symptoms, need to slowly decrease dosage.	It's good, better than many pain relievers and altough can't totally relieve the pain, helps take off the edge. Problem is, needs something on top when real bad pain episode happens. Doesn't seem to have habituation effect even after a couple years, effect is still there and tried higher dosage w/o any effect.	F	29	3  years	11/20/2008
4	back pain of unknown origin	The usual constipation(mild)and some initial lethargy till you "adjust" to good dosing schedule. Your body/head will tell you what they like.	This is a really good pain med. It's "smooth", not over-bearing and quite easily adjustable. The ER Tabs are great as you dose so seldom compared to Percs or other faster acting PK's. My Dr. gave me these because my tolerance for Percocet was too quick and I was quickly eating them like candy & getting minimal relief. The Contin gives you a good steady flow but I'd agree with those that say they don't last the 12 hours the Mfg. claims. Maybe adjusting more towards bed time w/b a help. This is GOOD SENSIBLE MEDICATION and I'd bet under prescribed due to the "Narcotic Stereotype." I know my Dr. told me they raise a flag with the DEA. For those of you being treated like anything other than a decent every day customer at your Pharmacy I'd suggest you tell them to go to Hell and find one where you can build at least a semi-personal relationship with the Pharmacist or even the guy/gal who works the front. ALWAYS use the same store! Ask a BS question of the Pharmaci	M	56	2  months	9/22/2008
4	L4-5 DDD	Been taking for 2 years.  4 x 30mg. Other than occasional breakthrough pain, depending on the level of my activities, I have had no side effects.	I am at this moment on day 4 of a horrible detox by myself.  I am in this situation because I lost a week's worth of pills somehow (can't find the bottle...think it fell out of the car at the gas station).  The pain clinic filled next Rx early but said I had to make them last 5 weeks...I could not (or did not)...afraid to call them again...can get next refill in 3 more days!  Pain is worse than yearning for drug, foggy-headed, weak, and shaky.  Never again will I let this happen.  Help or comments appreciated!!  Also afraid to give email address.	M	55	 	9/9/2008
5	Pancreatic Cancer	Constipation	I am new to MS CONTIN. Only been taking it for 7 days. I had chronic pain for three weeks, I went to the Hospital and they said I have Pancreatic Cancer and it went to the Liver. MS CONTIN works to relieve my pain, But I don't have much time left.

I have tried many different narcotics to control the pain.  I am taking 100 mg MS Contin every 12 hours, & take Dilaudid 4 mg for breakthrough pain.  This combination has greatly improved my quality of life.	M	47	3  years	7/6/2008

5	two neuromuscular diseases.	occasional itching. brief transient nausea.	neurologist also using this med for severe diareah from other meds for my illnesses. I am also on10/500 hydrocodone and robaxin from my psyatrist (sports doc). for scoliosis, bulging discs, and severe arthritis in my spine. the m.s. contin actually keeps me 100% regular in bowel movements, absolutely normal. Satisfied w/pain control.Also stick w/one local pharmacist. NO!NO! walgreens! evil judgmental place. My local drug store knew me before these issues in health came up so when I explained what was going on it was a non-issue. Nothing makes you feel worse than some jerkoff in a white coat intimating your a drug seeking loser. It also helps when presenting these class of scripts to at least look clean groomed and not strung out no matter how much pain you are in. They will call your docs and complain and exaggerate your condition.Thus your out of the meds you need. It,s all a show folks. Like getting a loan if you look like you don't need it you'll get no attitude and get your meds.	M	54	3  days	4/8/2008Email
4	Scolio;L6vertebra;bulging 3 discs;	I have had iv morphine years ago, so I was scared to take it thinking I might be KO'd, but managed ok. I been on Lortab for over 2 years, and didn't work anymore. This was the solution.I agree that if you are active, the drowsiness is not inhibiting. Sitting around is drowsy	I notice that for the first many replies I read, I am the youngest one here. I also take Lyrica, Skelaxin, Mobic, and now started MScontin twice day of 1=2 15 mgs. Only one day, but I didn't know relief like this could be achieved anymore. I recently found out about 3 bulging discs, luckily none ruptured, scoliosis, and an extra, L6 vertebrae which is pinching nerves. I would be happy to contact anyone who had questions for me, or suggestions, if I see them post something here.	F	26	1.5  days	4/3/2008
4	cervical fusion, failed back syndrm	very drowsy,a bit shaky, extreme dry mouth.	I have had a discectomy at L4-5 S1 and have had a a cervical fusion.  I am getting ready for a surgery to remove a bone spur at c4 and then another surgery for a spinal stimulator on the lumbar spine. I was on a low dose of oxycodone for 2 months then it was upped to 5mg.  I was also taking Lyrica for nerve damage in my leg from an injury during the discectomy surgery.  That worked for about 2 months and then stopped.  I was just put on 30mg of MS Contin twice a day and 10 mg of oxycodone for breakthrough pain.  I am also taking 100mg of Lyrica 3 times a day.  The morphine is working great.  I have not had to take much oxycodone since, granted it has only been a week.  I have been extremely tired but I feel it is from the Lyrica increase because the dose was doubled.  Hopefully after my surgeries I can slowly stop taking all drugs except for Lyrica since it is for the permanent nerve damage.	F	37	7  days	3/9/2008Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .

This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.

I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.

I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me.

Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email

Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify.

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie).

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011

Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight.

3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation.

I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor.

It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.	F	36	7  days2 MG 1X D	7/15/2010Email
2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.
