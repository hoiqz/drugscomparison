				F M	 	 	    
5	ADD	Loss of appetite, if you force yourself to eat you will find that you were incredibly hungry. Headaches from not eating. If my dosage was too high I would be very antisocial. It has worked wonders for me. Once I figured out the right dose, I felt like a normal human being.		F	16	10  days40 mg	11/26/2012
2	Abuse	Mania, OCD-like symptoms, insomnia, loss of appetite (until it wore off, then I was ravenous), dissociation, increased anxiety and aggitation, restlessness	At first this drug was great (everything I wanted). Then I realized it was actually sucking the richness out of my life. I became so focused on work and cleaning and getting things "done" that my relationships suffered. And even though I didn't feel hungry, I'm sure my body was actually very hungry because I would feel the crashes at the end of the day and feel very ill and worn-down. On the plus side, my house was spotless. Oh well, I'd rather have a rich, full, beautiful life than live it like a manic zombie.	F		6  weeks60 MG 1X D	10/19/2012
3	ADHD	Negative: significant increase in acne, caused painful cysts all around chin.  Insomnia during the first week or so. Positive: Increase in productivity and attention span, 10-lb weight loss due to decreased appetite.	Much less side effects than Vyvanse. Vyvanse made me sweaty, irritable, and anxious. The Adderall's acne is the only thing that is bothersome, but I think the positives outweigh that side effect.	F	21	2  months20 MG 1X D	9/20/2012Email

5	Adult ADHD	Dry mouth, frequent urination, occasional, mlid jaw clenching, weight loss and decreased appetite.	Overall, Adderall has been very beneficial. Increased concentration, more productive and "on-task."	F	51	3  months10mg 2X D	9/16/2012Email
2	Major Depression with anhedonia	Fast heartbeat	I was taking this due to my anhedonic symptoms of depression (lack of sex drive, apathy, feeling "empty" or zombielike, the inability to feel pleasure, no drive/motivation, etc.). All it did was raise my heartrate without any effect on my mood or emotion. Perhaps this was because of a cross tolerance to Ritalin which I was taking a week before? I took up to 15mg and my heart was pounding so hard it was uncomfortable and I felt light headed and felt tingly/numb at my extremities. Bad on the heart apparently.			4  days15mg 2X D	9/16/2012
3	ADD	Not dry mouth but insanely thirsty. All the water on earth couldb quench my thirst. I still have the same appetite as before but it seems to have blocked my cravings. That may lead to some weight loss in the future but it's only been two weeks. Sleep has not been a problem at all. Today actually I took my adderall at 9am and by noon I had to take an hour nap because I couldb keep my eyes opened. I do not notice much change with focus or concentration. I did notice two days ago when I took adderall that at around 7pm I guess maybe I was coming down from it and I didn't want to ve around anyone. I was antisocial and everything annoyed me. That has only happened once though. I think my dose may be too low or maybe I need a new medication but I am not fully satisfied with adderall XR so far. I'll stay on it until my dr. Appointment a couple months.		F	21	2  weeks20 mg	8/22/2012
5	Failed Macbeth & school referred me	Dry MouthInsomnia (sometimes)No need to eat (definitely a positive during school..I eat lunch fine)	I failed Macbeth and am on the special ed services with a 504 plan.  My school apparently had people watching me and discovered I get distracted...I'm not hyper just "oh look a bird" and that type of thing.  First time I took it....I was so happy and answering questions...it was finally the piece to finish the puzzle for success!	M	17	3  months20 MG 1X D	8/6/2012Email

4	ADD	Dry mouth, increased thirst, increased hyperactivity as soon as medicine kicked in as well as stomach pains and increased need to smoke. Increased ability to focus and concentrate. When medicine was wearing off I would experience a crashing feeling that led me to feel mild irritability and hostility.	After many years of being misdiagnosed, my doctor finally diagnosed me with adult ADD. I was initially put on Ritalin which did not work. After being put on Adderall XR 10mg, I am now on Adderall XR 30mg and I take Adderall IR 10mg when I have classes at night. It has helped a great deal. Most of the time I don't like the side effects but unfortunately, sometimes you have to weigh the benefits and risks and decide for yourself whether this is the right medication for you.

5	Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibrofog	Sometimes feel jittery when the morning dosage kicks in, but that doesn't last long. After a very stressful day I sometimes feel burned out at night.  Decreased appetite.	Despite the side effects I really like this med. It gives me energy and makes me very focused which enables me to work on very complex projects without feeling overwhelmed. I have become my usual happy and social self. The chronic fatigue made me withdrawn and very anxious when I had to partake in meetings or long discussions. I felt so inadequate. Now I present projects with confidence, focus and great energy, and I even have time for friends and volunteer work. I don't take it on weekends unless I absolutely have to. Really love this med.

3	ADHD	At first I loved this med, I lost weight and was full of energy! It did give me head aches often and increase my anxiety but not enough to make me stp taking it! After months went by I start swelling in my hands and face from my blood pressure then one morning I woke up and my lips were swollen so I called my doc and he told me not to take it any more so I have been off of it since then! I Feel like this med is ok for short term us as long as you are  100% healthy before starting it!		F	30	4  months10mg	1/14/2012

2	ADHD	I sweat more, some increased anxiety but overall concentration and performance were enhanced.	I have been on this medication for a while and it has made a big difference in the quality of my life.  However, my insurance will only cover generic if generic is available.  The past two months I have been on the generic and it does not work as well.  My concentration isn't as good, I am having increased difficulty completing tasks.  Yesterday I experienced something strange...out of no where I got really hot and anxious.  It was awful.  Also the generic has caused me to become more depressed.   I like adderall but not the generic.	F	23	4  years30 1X D	1/3/2012

3	Add	When the XR wore off there seemed to be a crash. I was very irratable as this happened. I did find that consuming some caffiene during this time helped ease this stage. One major con to XR is the price, I had to switch to IR just to be able to afford it. This medication was life changing for me! It was nice to find a medication with few side effects that helped control my ADD symptoms.		F	27	1  months10mg	12/13/2011Email

4	ADD, fatigue	Dry mouth, jittery,	I prefer the IR because the xr seems to kick it real hard in about 1 hour which is overwhelming but them it backs off a little and last most of the day. It doesnt seem to work as good as the IR but its close.	M	20	2  months15 1X D	11/29/2011Email
5	ADHD	Vague jittery feeling as drug wears off, like I have had too much caffeine (but no anxiety). Some loss of appetite.	This medication has been a godsend! I felt differently on the very first dose - within 15 minutes I felt very calm, like I had never felt before. I lost my "inner restlessness". Within a few days, I had increased concentration, ability to follow conversations better (so my social anxiety all but disappeared), my handwriting improved (I have something called dysgraphia that comes with ADHD sometimes), and my coordination improved. I do feel some jitters as it is wearing off, and so my nurse put me on 10 MG Propranolol (generic of Inderal) to take up to two times a day as needed.. This is a very small dose of a beta-blocker (blood pressure medication) and it worked like a charm. I could not function before Adderall XR, but I didn't realize quite how bad it was until I took it.	F	43	60  days20 MG 2X D	11/10/2011Email
5	ADD, Depression,Anxiety,Mood Issues	Can concentrate for hours, but huge decrease in appetite which lead to anorexia and my losing tons of weight in short period of time. Also, tolerance develops and you need to take more of this drug to get the same amount of focus as you did at the beginning. Can also cause OCD tendencies. You will not be able to fall asleep if take it within a few hours before bedtime, but if you take it everyday as I do, you will possibly overcome that side effect and be able to sleep while on it (I'm able to since I'm so used to it).

5	Adult AD/HD	Mild jaw clenching, decreased appetite, some insomnia (which is gone now that I just steel myself and get up at 7 every morning)	It is nice to have control over my life.  I have gone on and off AD/HD meds, spent some time buying into the idea that they were somehow "robbing" me of some mysterious elan vital as a teenager, and finally realizing that I deserve to be able to have a zest for life on my own terms.  It helps me to keep track of appointments, keep track of friends, remember what I said five seconds ago (EVER), not spend thousands of dollars more than I have, not have a melt-down every single day I have to get ready for work, and not have to worry about the feeling like I have angry bees in my head when I'm trying to do absolutely anything.  When I first started taking it as a teenager, this drug literally gave me my self-esteem back: I sat down, started a creative project, and saw it through to the end (with no angry bees) for the first time in my life.	F	32	12  years15 MG 1X D	9/28/2011
5	ADHD	When I first started taking it I never wanted to eat. But if I took it without eating I got some pretty serious stomach pains. Nothing uber just felt like crap. Other than that I have had very little to no side effects, except for the cotton mouth daily but its good because it gets me to drink more water	The drug is great if you actually need it. I pretty much hated my job before adderall and with this the CEO could come in and tell me im fired and I would just be like "ok great!" I seem to get more done but it also just generally makes me happier or less anxious. It almost doesnt let me feel sad either. Sometimes I get sad or depressed about a certain thing and a minute later Im like.."fuck it life is awesome"	M	26	3  months20mg 1X D	9/13/2011Email
5	Low dopamine levels, possible ADD	Some anxiety in the beginning or if taken with caffeine (obviously), icy cold hands upon starting the drug, headaches, thirst, fast heart rate, insomnia if taken too late in the day, talkativeness, intense focus and sense of wellbeing, appetite loss, desire to be up and moving. All bad side effects faded after a few months	This medication has been a life saver for me. I lost 30 pounds, not because it is a stimulant, but because it curbed my appetite and finally gave me the energy to work out and not be so lazy anymore. I may not BE smarter on this med, but I feel smarter. It also really helps with my depression and apathy. Just be careful you don't start out your day doing the wrong thing; it makes you concentrate on whatever you start on. I've had too many days where I've begun my day with video games and haven't moved for 6 hours.	F	22	 30 MG 1X D	9/7/2011Email
4	ADD	Racing Heart, Hyper, Extremely Talkative, Dry Mouth, Thirsty, Head Aches, Loss of Appetite (20mg 1xday).Extremely Calm, Occasionally Zoning Out, Sleepiness. (20mg 2xday).	I was recently diagnosed with adult ADD. Initially, my doctor prescribed me 20mg of Adderall XR to take every morning. I started on a Saturday and noticed that I was very hyper, talkative, and thirsty. I did notice that my concentration was much better, and I was able to focus on tasks without feeling like I needed to take a break. I also felt that way on Sunday. When I was at work on Monday, I no longer felt those effects or had the ability to focus. After talking with my doctor, my dose was increased to 40mg a day. I was a little nervous to up my dose by 20mg; I figured that I would be bouncing of the walls on 40mg since I was so hyper on 20mg. The first time I took the higher dose I sat there waiting for my heart to start pounding out of my chest, but I ended up feeling the exact opposite actually.I have only been taking the 40mg for a few days and I can easily say that this is the calmest I have ever felt in my ENTIRE life. Before taking Adderall my head sounded like 10 overcaffienated women in a small closet, all taking as loudly as they could about different subjects, all at the same time (best way I can describe it, as odd as it sounds). Now my head is quiet. I can work on one task at a time, and not be distracted about something I have to do the next week. The only downfall of this serenity is that I am really sleepy. I thought that was weird since Adderall is a stimulant, but I guess when you have ADD it has a calming effect if taken at the correct dose. 	F	23	10  days20 2X D	6/15/2011
5		Thirst, upset stomach for first hour and then it went away,	I was diagnosed with add  as a chid and was never treated. I struggled in high school and was fine after that because I had a job riding horses and it didn't require much effort and besides I loved doing it. Well I decided to go back to school two years ago and it's been aweful! my ADD kicked back in and I haven't been able to organize my life, I had the worst anxiety and depression I would sleep nearly 14 hours a day for a year before I decided to go to the DR. He put me on wellbutrin and xanax, and I had a very bad reaction to the wellbutrin and the xanax makes me feel like a zombie. Then it came up that I was diagnosed with ADD and he put me on adderall instantly I felt normal again! Its been such a blessing for me I was able to focus again and get tasks done. I don't have any of the horrible side effects I've read about, my anxiety and depression GONE!!!! :) I'm so happy again and my friends are very surprised that they have their old friend back! In my un-professional opinion this drug will work just right for you if you truly have add, and not a misdiagnosis, it will simply compensate your lack of dompamine and help you to function like a normal person.

5	ADD	sleeplessness for the first 2 weeks, occasional dry mouth, weightloss, occasional headache.	i started taking this in college. I have struggled with this my whole life but when it came to 40+ hours of work plus 15 credit hours of college i noticed my Add getting to the point beyond control. After taking this for a few weeks my grades improved as well as my homelife/work. I would not reccomend taking this unless it is needed and not just for school but in general everyday life. Also, this condition is biological so it runs in the family.	M	22	3  months30 1X D	4/8/2011Email
4	ADHD	Nothing unexpected in terms of side effects.  Initially, some moderate appetite loss and increased perspiration. Most of this has lessened over the 7 weeks I've been on the med.	While I'm pretty old to finally have a psych doc finally figure out that my lifelong inability to concentrate and focus was only partially due to anxiety and depression and that I have some degree of ADHD. I'm really glad we finally figured it out.  This med focuses me and allows me to concentrate and be far, far more efficient in my work from home job.  Given my age and all, I don't ever see myself ramping up very much dosage wise beyond the current 20 mg/day, if at all.  I take weekend breaks to try to minimize the buildup of tolerance.   I'm glad I got hooked up with a doctor who finally could help me.  We'll see how it goes from here, but for the time being, Adderall is making a big difference in my life.

5	ADHD and Schizophrenia	Loss of appetite.	I was diagnosed with schizophrenia 5 years ago, but I also had severe ADHD as a child. Adderall has helped me organize my thoughts in a way where I am able to distinguish reality from delusions. Before taking this, I could not function or take care of myself. After going vegan, meditating everyday, and taking adderall I now am a Jr. in college with a 3.9 GPA. I was able get off all other psychotropic medication.	F	26	9  months20 2X D	2/15/2011Email
4	ADD	Insomnia, eating problems, rapid heart beat	I've been taking this drug for a very long time. I feel like when I don't take it one day, I eat a lot! I tell people that my body doesn't get that "full" feeling. But I've also realized that it fools your body into thinking you are well rested when your body is actually fighting inside. I have otherwise had a great experience with it - I feel very productive all the time and work out in the mornings. It really helps me get things done and be organized every day. Feel like there's ALWAYS something for me to do. Currently trying to figure out if it's the best drug for me because of my rapid heart beat that bothers me a bit.	F	25	7  years20 2X D	2/6/2011
5	ADHD, DYSLEXIA	My daughter is 14 and started taking this when she was 11, after failed attempts with other adhd drugs. Adderall was like her saving grace!!! Her grades went from all d's and f's to a's and b's and is in advanced courses. He concentration is 100 percent better and she doesn't have to fidget and talk all the the time in class now. She takes 20 xr in the am and another 5 (not xr) at noon to boost her, as it does start to wear off. The only side effect noticeable is her loss of appetite. She has lost some weight on it, however to fine. And she is counter act it, she does not take it on the weekends, so she makes up for not eating much all week. Her doc says as long as she is hydrated and eats one really good meal with her multi vitamin she will be fine. And she is. My 7 year old son with ADHD and Autism just started on it a month ago (10 xr 1 x day), and he is also benefiting from it. His stimming is less frequent, and he concentrates better in class. He follows directions a lot better an	Great for people with ADHD, only drawback is loss of appetite.	F	37	3  years20 + 5 2X D	2/2/2011Email
5	ADHD, excessive daytime sleepiness	thirsty, drink more water.	I started on xr 30 mg 1/day but it was ineffective by 2:00 in the afternoon, so i talked to my dr and we changed to 20mg 2x/day. i still dont think its exactly what i need, but i think 60mg/day is the highest "recommended dose", so we didnt want to go there yet.it has helped my ibs, dealing w/stress b/cm more organized, i wake up feeling refreshed and go to sleep much faster.  i havent had any panic attacks since i started using it and i was having them 3-4 times/month before.overall, it has improved my work life, home life and made me feel more like me. after so many drs trying to push antidep. on me, i am happy that i found something that helps with my extreme daytime sleepiness, lack of concentration and general inability to start something and finish it.the only complaint that i have is that it doesnt last longer than 5-7 hours and if my day isnt over, im exhausted.

4	Adult ADD	Occasional headaches.sweating and dizziness (only when does was too high)	AFter reading many posts I see that I in the minority with my postitve results with Adderall XR. HOwever, I'm obsessed with taking the same dose, same time everyday, NEVER MISS.  I started on 20 xr, caused major sweating, shakes, headaches, very irritable, then dropped to 15 mg, same problems.  Dropped to 10 mg/day , and found the sweet spot.  It works well, but not a cure.  I would say I have moderate add, I have friends that are much worse and I know I'm more "together" than them.  This drug has helped me finish a task and focus slightly better.  My wife says it's been amazing, she doesn't have to remind me of everything 50 times a day.  However, I'm very aware how addicted I've become (physically).  If I miss a pill I have EXTREME fatigue, the most tired sensation I could ever imagine.  Since I know how bad the withdrawl is, I haven't missed a pill in years.  Now I'm a father of 2, 35 years old and feel I must get off since I can't really be on a drug my entire life, seems too risky.  So I'm going to reduce to 5mg/day (fight through a couple weeks of fatigue, then I know my body will adjust. I'll stay on 5mg/day for a month or two, then drop it.  Overall, I think I was the perfect candidate of this drug since I have no prior-addictive habits, don't "like" drugs, and I'm very responsible (as much as an ADD person can be ha ha) but I realize everyone is very different and I can see how some people become abusive with this drug, if you're not very very car	M	35	8  years10 mg xr 1X D	1/17/2011
4	narcolepsy	headaches, irritability, gas, moodiness, upset stomach, little nervous at times, hair loss, loose stools, weight loss, dry mouth, increased blood pressure, anxiety worsened, increased sweating, and sometimes dizziness	Sad thing is Adderall XR has been the best medication that I have tried for my narcolepsy.  Some of my symptoms are mild others are moderate and so on.  They seem to get a little better with time.  Obviously, the side effects were not bothersome enough for me to quit taking it, although I think about it almost daily.  It is just not an option, I am a working single mom and without it I would be on welfare, social security or/and disability....You have to do what you have to do   Hope this helps someone who reads it.

3	Fatigue, Depression, ADHD	Anxiety, Weightloss, Headache	I finally had to stop taking Adderall because the anxiety crept up on me and incapacitated me. The first 4-5 months were great. Lots of energy, able to concentrate, but by month 6 I was having a hard time leaving the house my anxiety was so intense. I also lost about 20 pounds during this time because I wasn't hungry and was so energetic that I didn't make the time to eat.	F	24	7  months30mg 1X D	10/5/2010
3	adhd	Anxiety, Depression, loss of appetite, increased heart rate, trouble sleeping, feeling jittery a lot, made me feel like i had a lot of energy, yet made my appetite nearly disappear.	A great medicine for short term... I had to take Prozac to counteract the depression and mood swings which helped dramatically. One thing with me and this drug is I couln't skip days or dosages or I had severe mood swings.	F	18	8  years50mg 1X D	9/28/2010
3	college, and just to try it out	Bad Side Effects: Slight and/or tense headaches here and  there (these get worse the longer I go without more adderall and I'm afraid they'll eventually get to the point where it'd be the first step towards addiction), small shaking in hands, fatigue, minor loss of appetite, REALLY bad cotton mouth and chapped lips, annoyingly  talkative, nervousness, insomnia, un-rhythmic heart beat, my blood pressure feels  like its high, a random tingling feeling that happens in my:  (joints and/or muscles and/or veins), dizziness/light headedness, when I take HIGH doses (120-240 mg of the adderall xr 30mg pills in less than a 24 hour period), my headaches, tingling, and jitters are the only symptoms left until 5 or so hours after taking it, then all my symptoms are back twice as bad. GoodSideEffects: The main thing of course is being able to concentrate on one task longer than usual, I'm NOT experiencing mood swings (THANK GOD), I'm not losing weight; which for me being 130 lbs	Last week, I got some adderall, I decided to take a pill at 11:45pm, even though I just finished my liter of MtnDew. The MtnDew seemed to make the adderall way more intense than normal, idk for sure. But 5-10min after taking the pill, I had the strong urge to be super talkative, which isnt me. Soon after, my hands started to tremble, but I still was able to play Halo: Reach that night.When I finally went to bed at 3:45am, all I could do was lay in bed and I never once felt tired nor ever really stopped thinking. While my mind was constantly reeling, I remembered the times I'd get high before going off bed. I thought about how there are similarities and yet differences between falling asleep with weed or adderall in your system. Starting first with THC, you definitely can't fall asleep right after getting high because your mind reels with random and unique thoughts, kind of like adderall, except your thoughts arent random or unique. Roughly 30-60 mins after laying down after toking up you should be able to fall asleep, except when you fall asleep high, maybe its just me, you dont dream. With adderall, my mind might also be buzzing like when it is on weed, but my mind was always focused on one thing/idea and I never felt tired enough to fall asleep. So, back to my first adderall night, all I could really do was talk to myself (I am up at college and I couldnt really talk to my sleeping roommate. The sad part was, I had to get out of bed at 6	M	19	8  days30 mg 2X D	9/28/2010EmailHistory

5	ADHD	Terrible fatigue if I go off it for a few days. When I first started taking it, or when I take it after days of not taking any pills, I get very hyper, ready to just go-go-go-go with so much energy I could run a marathon and not break a sweat. Along with that, I get very edgy, often to the point of rage. I now take it regularly (every week day) and I don't have that issue anymore. The only issues I have now are dry mouth/extreme thirst and increased urination due to drinking so much. I also chew the inside of my jaw and it's quite annoying because I don't realise I'm doing it unless I catch myself. The side effects are minor and at least for me, the benefits/pros FAR outweigh the cons.	I have very severe ADHD and this is the only thing I have ever tried that has helped. I've tried ALL the study techniques that I could find, all the time management techniques, work methods, etc. and Ritalin, which messed me up so bad I lost memory of the years I was on it. Adderall XR not only wakes me up and gives me energy, it helps me focus. My attention span has gone from 10 seconds to potentially hours. It doesn't make me lose weight or sleep...in fact, I can nap quite well with it and sleep through the night and not have to worry about my ribs showing because I can still eat a ton. People take for granted the ability to sit down and focus on a task for any period of time and the ability to start something and actually finish it. It's not a "miracle" drug because it doesn't make me want to do it or motivate me in any way, but I do get it done when I need to. I also suffer from low BP so this drug's "side effect" of making your blood pressure increase has actually been a benefit to me because my normal 81/53 blood pressure will usually become a normal or near-normal BP when I take the pill.

3	FM/ CFS	headaches, feeling jittery, burning out	When I started taking Adderall I thought it was the greatest drug EVER. Initially, I started taking 15mg in the morning after breakfast. It would make me very focused, very creative, and very calm. I thought it was amazing, despite the headaches I had on some days. On the weekends I didn't take it because I was afraid of getting too dependant of it. Now, after 3 months of taking 20mg twice a day, I am ready to quit. The calm, focused feeling I don't get anymore; I only felt like using Nitrox in a car that was otherwise a wreck... The Adderall pushed me although my body was already burned out. I would feel extremely drained and exhausted every single day. I switched to Nuvigil which doesn't give me the highs but makes me feel like myself again... Please, don't push it too far as it takes a toll on your body and your mind...	F	40	3  months20mg 2X D	7/12/2010
5	ADD	Decreased respiratory function. Numbness. Loss of appetite. Addictive.	Probably the best drug you can legally be given. I've written 200 songs, earned an ACS Chemistry maintaining a 3.95 GPA, learned C++, read an encyclopedia, and have almost completely learned to speak German in only 5 years since I began taking Adderall XR. This stuff rocks!	M	27	5  years20 1X D	6/30/2010
5	Chronic Fatigue, Depression	Always tired, slight depression.	Great medicine, but not for certain people.  This goes along with my personal, because I'm a passionate and aggressive person so I can 'understand' how Adderall makes you feel.  Some people aren't aware of it and get become argumentative.

4	ADHD, Anxiety, depression	Dry mouth, loss of appetite, paranoia, increased anxiety, terrible headaches, loss of emotion in general, and extreme heightening of any existing emotions, big increase in blood pressure, difficulty sleeping, lots of things.The better things were it felt like my mind was locked into place and I could really focus if I wanted to. Like I could grip my thoughts and use them, not watch them for a split second before they went away.	I would never recommend it. It was a mistake for it to ever be put out there... I'm aware of all the dangers it's causing to me, but I can't stop because I know I need it and I feel like without it I won't amount to anything. Ever since taking this I've gotten straight A's and had perfect attendance, for now three full years, but it does something. I feel locked inside myself when I'm on it. If I get sad for one moment, it really speeds that up and I'll feel almost suicidal over the tiniest things, or extremely excited about stupid things I hardly care about. It changed me from the irritating loud mouth to the kid in the corner who doesn't talk to anyone. It makes me second guess myself and just doubt. I'm starting to think it's the adderall, but after always being a very sweet guy, I've slowly felt myself turning into something else, like a complete asshole. I feel very prude, and would honestly call/consider a girl if she's kissed somebody. I can't eat on it, I just don't want to, I have lethargy. I'm right now doing this when I've told myself to get up and learn a song I have to perform for graduation tomorrow for the past 2 hours and I still am too focused to get up, I just want to keep doing something, I don't want that three seconds of getting up to find my guitar to end the streak, it has to be constant. It's hell, just don't use it.My mouth hurts like hell, I don't know if it smells bad, but I've heard dry mouth leads to that, but it seriously feels like a 20 lb w	M	18	4  years25mg 1X D	6/10/2010
4	ADD/ADHD	Generally no appetite, have lost 30 pounds since December 2009.  Increase in pulse and blood pressure, headache, and nausea.	Overall it's worked pretty well for me, I can usually concentrate better than I was able to without taking adderall XR.  Occasionally I do get stuck on words when I can't think of what I'm trying to say, and I can't really break the concentration that's on trying to remember the word.  I have tachycardia, but adderall xr doesn't always increase my pulse, when it does though, it's not by much. (the highest pulse I've noticed when doing nothing has been 170, but my pulse usually is between 120-135)  As for the increase in blood pressure, that's actually been a big change since my BP was normally a perfect 120/80, whereas now it can range from normal to pretty high.  (the highest I've noticed being 179/119).  I'm really happy with my appetite being almost completely diminished.  It's definitely helped me control my calorie intake, and I've lost 30 pounds in 5 months.	F	21	5  months30MG 1X D	5/4/2010Email
5	ADHD	Loss of appetite.	My little sister (12) was prescribed with ADHD and her doctor told her to try adderall. She's been significantly calmer and concentrates better while on it. Occasionally, she misses a dosage and eats a lot more than she does on the pill and gets out of control.	F	15	5  years20 mg 1X D	4/17/2010
4	ADD	Major side effects: Lack of sleep(daily), loss of appetite(big time!), and loss of wight, dry whitish mouth and bad breath. Minor Side effects: occasional chest pain, easily exhausted when work out, "crash feeling" 9 hours after, less stable bowel movement, "weaker stomach" than before and occasional feeling of sickness and nausea. The GOOD: Great focus, confidence, i do things more easily, and without too much thinking and hesitation as I used to.	I never really believed in psychiatry and almost gave up on my inability to achieve anything in life, until i seeked help and was started on Addreall. Over all, this drug has helped me tremendously and has had a positive effect on my life. I'm now able to multi task, not as easily distracted, and have more confidence in my self. found that the lack of sleep can be overcome by taking your dosage very early in the morning, although you'd have to train yourself to sleep when u really don't feel like it. I didn't find it addictive as some claim; but I do believe that it has a negative impact on the heart. I used to be regular jogger and now find it pretty difficult to run a small 5k, and sometimes find myself fatigued with no reason. Mind you I've been inactive for the last two years. But other than that I think this drug is a great aide for those who've suffered set backs in their life because of ADD crippling their potential.	M	26	5  days30mg 1X D	3/31/2010Email

5	ADHD	in the very beginnning, appetite loss. lost 30 lbs :)	adderall xr saved my life! this is sad to say, but without it i can't function. it seems to diminish most of my adhd symptoms to a functable level. before it, i was very ...how to put it....non observant of my environment which caused me to break my arm twice within three months of each other, on the same arm!! now, i haven't had anything like that. and it's been three years. ican sit and focus on games, my household.

4	ADD	I can't take it in the afternoon if I am going to go to sleep anytime in the following 10 hours. Other than that I have had no negative side effects.	I take 20mg in the morning and sometimes another 20mg around noon.If I don't take it around noon I am typically excessively tired or over active in the evenings and not very productive.I also try to take a 1 day break every 2 weeks or so.
