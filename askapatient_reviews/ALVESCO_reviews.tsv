1	for severe asthma	Behavior outside of the range of normal for her personality.  Fits of temper, irritability, inability to perform simple mental tasks (adding!), Clumsiness, forgetful - inability to follow simple directions, worsening of asthma, foul language, night terrors, not affectionate, depressed thoughts, etc.	My daughter (on Alvesco from ages 7-11) has had times off this medication when her asthma is under better control or when we suspect that the medication was the cause of the behavioral changes in her - so we do see a return to her old self (faster than a calculator in math! affectionate, polite, cooperative, a good sleeper, great sense of humour etc.) but we always have to go back on it because the asthma eventually gets bad again.

2	Allergy Induced Asthma	Made constricted throat much worse. Loss of breath was eventually made worse.	I have a history of occasional tightness in my throat, linked to my outdoor mold allergy. But I had always been able to swallow a normal sized bite. Two months into starting Alvesco, I started having severe throat constriction, so severe that I had my esophagus stretched two months later. My allergist and I chocked it up to the dry winter weather. I was reduced to soft foods only, and considerably smaller sized bites. Three days ago I decided to go off Alvesco, to see whether this was a factor, and to use my albuterol if needed. Despite constant rain, which releases mold spores into the air, already I can eat larger bites and don't get that urgent choking feeling. I've had little constriction. Alvesco made it far worse! And I haven't needed my albuterol once!  Today I have breathed noticably better than I have in months! And again, this is during a very rainy season for my mold allergy.  So I believe Alvesco made my asthma WORSE!	F	51	8  months160 mcg. 2X D	6/22/2011EmailHistory

3	COPD	Recurring chest infections.  More susceptible to illness.  Chronic fungal infection between my toes that was very difficult to treat.	Coming off alvesco was difficult the first couple of weeks - the COPD symptoms were much worse.  After a month my COPD has settled down to a manageable level.I also have ulcerative colitis, for which I don't take any steroid-based treatment.  I believe taking this reduced my colitis symptoms.  When coming off alvesco my colitis became massively worse, though this also settled down after a month, and is actually much better than when I was taking alvesco.
