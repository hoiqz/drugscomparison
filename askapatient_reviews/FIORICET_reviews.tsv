5	Migraine, Cervical OA	Groggy and a little spacey.	My doc thinks my migraines stem from severe cervical OA and prescribed 1 to 2 pills 4 times a day.  I average about 1 migraine a week. If I take the Fioricet right when my migraine starts, it knocks it right out. Sometimes, if my migraine starts at night and is full blown when it wakes me up, I'll have to take 2 pills instead of one, and then an additional pill after 6 hours.  That pretty much takes care of it.  This is a wonderful drug at ending a migraine rather quickly!	F	53	3  years50/325/40 4X D	3/23/2013
3	migraine headaches	Buzzed feeling (like drinking) when active. Sleepiness when laying down.		F	20	3  weeks6x daily	3/9/2013
4	Chronic Pain Syndrome,Stenosis,etc		After over ten years of fighting whole body pain, herniated disks, fibromyalgia, scoliosis, stenosis, OA, ulcerative colitis, brain herniation, etc, etc, etc, and five years of unsuccessful treatment on Percocet and Hydrocodone, I FINALLY got something that has taken away ALL the pain and given me back my life. Well, what's left of it when I'm awake. The sleepiness is a killer. Gotta get in those chores or duties while the euphoria is happening or you will crash. You wake after a few hours, prob due to the caffeine, and it WILL make you addicted to caffeine; you should not drink soda, tea, or coffee while on this med - too much caffeine causes "caffeinism" which isn't fun. Because of the success of pain relief, and naturally high tolerance to any med, addiction is a MAJOR concern.	F	42	 50-325-40 3X D	1/9/2013EmailHistory
5	Migraines	Absolutely none so far. No spacy feelings; just no pain and good energy that's not over the top.	Maxalt, Relpax do not work for me. I have headaches at least 3-4x week. I had just given up on finding something that works. Recently, my neruo rx'd this for me. So far I've taken 2 doses. First time, I had woken up w/ a migraine and decided to give it a try. I layed back down and within an hour: NORMAL.  Second dose taken after feeling one brewing a few days later....within an hour: normal. And with energy that wasn't crazy. As a bonus, I have MG, and this drug also helped the fatigue that for me, comes along w/ it. I recommend giving it a try, and only use it when you can't function.

5	For migraine headache	I had a migraine headache starting late on night then the next morning i woke up feeling like the top of my head was going to explode. I had gotten sick and layed back down for three hours. When i woke up it was still killing me. So I'd forgotten that my Dr had prescribed it to me so i went to the medicine cabinet and took two. After about 30 minutes i started feeling like my normal self. Imetrex and Treximent didn't seem to work and then that's when my Dr prescribed Fioricet. What a God send this was. Thank you Dr.		F	35	6  days3 day	9/27/2012
3	migraines	Thirty minutes after first dose, I felt just weird. Indescribable kind of feeling in my head. Lasted about half an hour. Towards the 3 hour mark I felt a restless leg type sensation in legs and arms. Was prescribed with phenergan during second trimester of pregnancy.		F	29	7  days	9/10/2012
3	tension headaches	Grogginess, slurred speech, dizzy, stumbling around, didn't last real long and the come down is HELL	I was prescribed this for tension headaches.  First evening, it was amazing.  Second evening, when I felt another one creeping up, I took it again.  I ended up passing out on the couch and woke up about 1 AM, then transferred to bed.  The next morning, I woke up much earlier than normal, heart racing and nervous/anxious like I can't remember before.  Third night, again I felt another H/A creeping up, so I took it, but I crashed after it wore off and felt worse than sh*t, so I took some more.  Finally went to bed about midnight.  Following morning, I again woke up nervous and earlier than normal, feeling depressed and morose.  This drug seems to work yet the side-effects, even prolonged, are almost intolerable.  I am seriously considering flushing the rest of the bottle down the toilet.	M	29	4  days325mg 2X D	6/29/2012
5	migraines	I was initially reluctant to try this medicine because of all the fuss, but the tryptan class of migraine medicine nearly killed me with cardiac dysrhythmias, and caused the inability to move or speak for hours. I have never felt high or anything but better on this medicine and honestly I cannot see what the fuss is all about. I think that one must have to take an awful lot and/or have a predilection for addiction in order to have a problem with it. Additionally, I have always taken a generic, and have no problems with it working just fine. I usually take 1-2 at the beginning of a migraine, and that is all that is needed. I have rarely needed a second dose in 24 hours. I find the caffeine too much of a buzz!	This medicine is in the same class as phenobarbital, which has a side effect of interfering with Vitamin D absorption. Though not specifically implicated as interfering with Vitamin D, my level was found to be chronically low for no other reason. If you take this medication, you should have your Vitamin D level checked regularly, and talk with your doctor about taking a supplement. Low Vitamin D can cause migraines, too.

5	Tension Headaches	Little "drunk" sensation.	It does the work. Is the best out there to control headaches, I use it for moderate morning headaches and really works.	M	34	1  years 1X D	3/2/2012Email
4	migraine and tension headaches	short lived euphoria.  if you lay down and want to go to sleep it will knock you out. If you don't want to go to sleep, and stay up, it will make you feel a little spacey (and not in a non-functional way) for 30 minutes and then NO side effects	I've taken this drug since the age of 18 for migraine and also tension headaches. It was a LIFESAVER to me in my 20's and would work pretty fast and pretty completely for the tension/migraine headaches i would get.  The only reason i didn't give this pill a 5 is because in the last 4 years since I had my child (hormonal reasons perhaps? ) my headaches have gotten a thousand times worse and  these pills barely take the edge off of the big monster headaches. They still work great for tension or menstrual migraines.	F	34	16  years 2X D	2/6/2012Email
4	headaches/migraines	Rebound headaches.  Stomach problems.  Dependency.	I've had migraines for 30+ years.  I think fioricet helps temper the pain level of my migraines. I stopped a couple times, once for a over a month and the pain level increased significantly.  I'm probably addicted, have a emotional dependancy on the drug and developed stomach motility problems as a result of my useage.  But, as long as I think it reduces the pain level of my migraines, I have to continue taking it.  It's actually a pretty mild drug with few side effects, especially compaired to what else is out there.	M	60	17  years 3X D	12/7/2011
5	Migraines	sleepiness	I love this! As long as you take it as soon as you feel the headache coming on it takes it right away!!	F	27	2  years50-325-40 2X AN	10/5/2011Email
3	headaches/migraines, neck pain	With 2: mild euphoria, drowsiness (if taken on an empty stomach)With 1: none	I was given this prescription by my doctor for headaches that stem from neck pain, that more often than not led to migraines.  I take it when my neck is starting to get very sore and it usually helps relieve the pain and ward off the coming headache.  I take 2 at a time (only once in a day) because 1 didn't help at all.  I'd suggest eating before you take them or you might feel a little lightheaded.  These have helped a lot with mild headaches I get just before or after my period, and as a bonus they work really well on cramps.  Unfortunately they don't do a thing if I already have a migraine.	F	28	6  months 2X AN	9/6/2011Email
5	Migraine Headaches	No bad side effects noted.	Have been taking it for migraines for over 30 years.  I take an average of 8 pills per month that are 50 Butalbital/325 APAP/500 Caffeine.  It takes about 1/2 hour to start working if I take it early when the headache has just started to ramp up. Sometimes my headaches last three days and those times I take no more than 3 pills in one day, and never for more than 3 days in a row.  I have stuck to these limits for myself, and I have never gotten a tolerance.  I have learned that if I take it within an hour of the headache starting to get bad, then it works better.  Also, I have developed a suspicion that old pills get weak... if the Fioricet pills are more than a few months old, they don't seem to work as well, so I never get more than 2 months worth at a time.  When I was taking codeine for pain from broken bones, I found that I could get relief with just half a Fioricet at a time. Nothing else I ever tried worked this well or this fast. I have tried other things over the years (as urged by various doctors) but nothing else works this well or this fast for me, and it even makes the nausea go away, too.  I'll stick with it for life, fortunately my headaches aren't more frequent... but I think that using Fioricet when I need it has made my headaches less frequent overall.  Bonus is that it's really inexpensive, too.	F	51	32  years50/500/325 1X AN	4/9/2010
2	headaches/neck pain and tingling	none	Fioricet worked for the first few months I took it but over time, it's stopped doing much of anything.  Most of the time it just barely takes the edge off the constant neck tingling/headache/shoulder pain.  I've started going to a chiropractor to see if that helps but so far, that hasn't either.	F	29	3  years	2/2/2010
3	Very frequent headaches	None	I took Fiorinal for 6-7 years.  I felt I had rebound headaches from taking too many and stomach problems from the aspirin.  I switched to Fioricet about a month ago. Instructions say to take one pill.  That does nothing.  Two pills sometime work.	F	61	1  months	1/11/2010
4	Migraines/ Menstrual Cramps	Euphoria, the urge to buy stuff (especially on the internet), drowsiness, irritability after a few hours.	This stuff usually works for my migraines, which can get really bad. The key is to take it early on in the migraine. Sometimes I need 2, but usually 1 does the trick. This stuff also works well for really bad menstrual cramps. I find that I have a decrease in patience several hours after taking it and can be more easily irritated and snappy. Also I stay away from stores because I have a strong urge to buy stuff that is "so useful".	F	30	4  years	1/6/2010
5	migraines/tension headaches	drowsiness, some nausea (though that could be from the migraines themselves)	I hate to see people say that a "side effect" is addiction and give it a bad rating. Fioricet has been a godsend for my agonizing migraines (which things like Maxalt and Imitrex wouldn't touch) and occasional tension headaches. Like most medications, if you take Fioricet AS PRESCRIBED -- not on a daily basis, only when needed, and at only the recommended dosage (no more than 6 in 24 hours for most people) -- you will have absolutely no "addiction" problems or even rebound headaches. Don't blame the drug, take responsibility for your own actions. Fioricet is a wonder drug for many of us who use it responsibily.	F	32	5  years	11/5/2009
3	Headaches	Addiction!! I was prescribed this drug by a Neurologist for tension headaches which led to migraines. Had headaches pretty much everyday. Next thing I know, I was addicted. When Dr wouldn't prescribe enough, I began buying them online. Be Careful!!! You think it can never happen to you, trust me, it can.	Took the drug as directed for 5 or 6 years. Then sometimes 3 at a time insted of one or 2. Ever so slowly took more & more over the next few years until I could sometimes take up to 20/day (you DO develop a tolerance). If you feel like you are slurring your words or your tongue feels thick; beware! Later (in treatment) found out it was highly addictive even though it isn't a narcotic.	F	41	10  years	4/30/2009Email
5	Migraine	None	This is a blessing since I can not afford Maxalt, which works well for me.  This gives me a 90% chance of stopping the migraine in its early stages before it starts up.  Being that its been around for awhile, the generic version = affordable migraine treatment.  I'm so glad my doctor found this for me.  Its so worth a try given the price.	M	28	2  months	2/25/2009
4	low-pressure migraines	relaxed, sleepy, numbness	I was presribed it for a low-pressure migraine caused by a leak in my spinal cord after spinal anesthesia.  I also had to drink lots of Diet Coke for the extra caffeine, so it cancelled out the sleepyness with caffeine jitters.  It didnt fix the migraine so i had to have a surgicl procedure to fix it, HOWEVER i kept the remaining pills and have been using them for my severe tension headaches w/muscle spasms - they work wonderfully on that, i take 1 and then a 2nd about an hour later and the headache is gone and i drift off to sleep.  i do feel a bit drugged the next morning, but it's nothing a coffee wont fix. My dr has approved this usage.  I was taking percosets for the tension headaches but these work better.	F	31	1  years	12/31/2008
3	CSF Leak; low pressure headaches	Tired too an extent but not out; I have to take double the dosage to get any effect. Other than that, none really.	Only rated a 3 I guess b/c these low pressure headaches/CSF leak, if anybody has had them are so intense, they last up to years. I also take with Klonopin and Amitripilyn as a preventative measure. Takes the edge off, but doesn't help it go away...	F	27	7  days	9/29/2008
5	migraines and neck pain	I have taken this for about 4 years on and off. Recently, i started taking Klonopin for my restless leg and now if i take Fioricet i feel like I can't talk normal and my tongue feels thick.		F	41	4  years	2/2/2008
3	headaches	Sleepiness (which is a good thing if you're home and just want to go to sleep because you have a bad headache), but then, about 4 hours after taking it, I'm wide awake (apparently, the caffeine kicks in later than the barbiturate)	Pretty good at knocking out a headache that Advil or Tylenol won't touch, but if you take it at night in the hope of killing 2 birds with one stone---knocking out a headache AND falling asleep---you may eventually be woken up by the caffeine in the drug, if you're sensitive to stimulants, like I am. If you're easily excited by caffeine, you may not want to take this. The barbiturate can make you sleepy, so it may not be something you can take unless you're home, but if you are home and take it, while you may fall asleep, you may find yourself wide awake a few hours later. I've only taken it here and there, for a few days a month, generally (usually during my period, when I notice an increase in headaches most likely due to hormones changes).	F	30	 	1/23/2008
4	Frequent Migraines	I have been taking Firocet for over 15 years for migraines and when taking the medication I thought I had no side effects because it seemed to  help with my headaches, but then I noticed that I was taking it everyday, every four hours because of rebound headaches. I just went to a new neurologist who prescribed me .25mg of Elavil at bedtime and said I should be weaned off of the Fiorcet completely in about two weeks. I went cold turkey off of it about ten years ago and I felt like my head was splitting open for about ten days. I went back on it since I couldn't find anything else that helped with the pain without other side effects. It has only been three days since I have lessened the Fiorcet to about 1 every eight hours and I am pretty much sticking close to home so I can lie down if I feel "not myself". I hope to be off of it completely and am really hoping to be able to stay off of it this time and not get the headaches back.	If you get the generic it is fairly inexpensive. It does work great for headaches, but just be careful in its use since it is very addictive.	F	53	15  years	9/16/2007Email
1	migraine	i broke out in hives under my arms this drug sucks it is no better than speed all it is is tylenol and caffiene  i threw away pills and called the doctor		M	27	2  days	8/8/2007
4	Daily Headaches & Occas. Migraine	If I take 1-2 doses a day I feel normal(able to work, etc). If necessary to redose a 3rd time I feel very groggy by evening. Usually 1-2 doses a day is enough for me.	I began taking Fioricet a couple of years ago when I began having a headache everyday(rather than sporadically) and also migraines twice a month. I went through the routine of preventive meds like beta-blockers, migraine meds (Zomig & Amerge), Verapamil, and Darvocet. Although I am concerned about taking Fioricet every day, it has enabled me to continue working (school librarian) without any serious side-effects. I also take .5mg of Celexa for anxiety and Deconex for sinus congestion daily. I'm not "cured" but this regime works for the most part. I also drink 2-3 caffeinated drinks a day and that seems to make stretch the pain relief a bit. Everybody is different and what helps me has not worked for other people I know. It has been long process of trial and error. I have given up more strenous exercise (Karate) for walking and biking. All the yelling and jumping was too much for my head. I hope to get back to it one day, though.	F	37	2  years	6/9/2007Email
5	severe migraines	no negative side effect.  only 'side effects' would be anything you'd expect with this medication anyways, such as feeling a big groggy or euphoric at times.  one time I took 2 fioricet (4 hours apart) and was more groggy than I wanted to be, but it got rid of the migraine, so I really can't complain	works fast with any migraine.  even after having the migraine for half a day, a fioricet will still help alot.  Heard how addictive it can be, so I only use it for a bad migraine.  have only taken 4 pills in the past month.  it's inexpensive as well.	M	31	1  months	5/25/2007
3	migraines	none that I've noticed	At first this drug worked great. Unfornunately now I have to take 2 each time I feel a migraine coming on and sometimes it doesn't even help. I'm afraid I've gotten tolerant to the medication.	F	25	5  months	5/13/2007
4	migraine;  bad headaches;neck pain	I believe it has contributed to my acid reflux, but I take Tums for that.	I have suffered from migraines since age seven. Sometimes I end up in ER. Fioricet is only med which will block migraine if taken soon enough. If migraine becomes full-blown NOTHING will help short of trip to ER and demerol shot. My car was rear-ended by another car at a stop sign some years back and the whiplash injury has only added to my headache woes. Fioricet is the only thing which helps if my neck hurts to the point of causing a throbbing headache. Addiction isn't anything I worry about because I only use the med when I need it for the "big" stuff, not the everyday type of headache. However, if you take Fioricet and tylenol type meds beware of elevated liver enzymes in blood tests.	F	66	14  years	5/6/2007
5	migraines	relaxed, a bit spacey, sometimes slightly euphoric.	migraines run in both sides of my family. I've been getting them since my teens. After struggling for a decade without meds, a neurologist prescribed Fioricet for me - and they worked. Sometimes they completely stop the headache, other times it knocks the pain way down to a tolerable level. I only take them when I've got a migraine, which is generally 3-5 times a month. I've also tried Zomig, which worked - but the potential side effects of Zomig worried me - so I went back to the "tried but true".	F	57	27  years	3/8/2007
4	migraines & neck-related headaches	GroggyRebound headaches, eventuallyStomach problems, including gastric refluxEuphoric, - the narcotic in this really can elevate your mood!  Unfortunately, it's temporary.	I started on Fiorinal for many years, and switched to Fiorecet due to stomach problems.  For years I relied on it to deal with occasional migraines and headaches due to a neck injury.  I usually take 1 every 4 - 6 hours.  My headaches last 1 - 3 days, and have gotten more frequent in the last few years.  I think that this is partly due to rebound headaches.  I haven't felt addicted, though wouldn't want to be without it, when a headaches coming on.  Recently, I went to (yet) another neurologist, and have had some luck with Elavil.  Also, tried Zomig, which works pretty well, but leaves me feeling horrible.	F	49	20  years	8/25/2006
4	severe migraines (different types)	I took 1-2 pills every 4-6 hours...if I took more than 3 in one day I started to feel really wierd and uncomfortable, almost anxious.  Caused really bad rebound headaches after a month of taking it once or twice a week.  Stopped taking it abruptly after a couple of months and had a bad withdrawal with rapid heartbeat and panic, and passed out.	It really worked great, took the pain away...but I do NOT recommend taking it on a regular basis.  Very addictive.	F	28	4  months	6/3/2006
2	Tension Headaches	Hungover, tired feeling	Doesn't seem to do anything but make me feel groggy, still have a headache. Doc only said take one every four hours, anyone else take more than this and have better results?	F	28	1  weeks	4/19/2006Email

4	migrane/severe headaches	none whatsoever	The greatest drug I've taken for a headache!  Headache is usually gone within 20-30 minutes.  They better not ever take this drug off the market!!!	F	45	1  years	4/7/2004
5	severe headaches	no side effects whatsoever. headache went away w/i 15-20 minutes.  good drug!!	ask your doc for it	F	44	2  years	3/10/2004
5	stress headaches	mellow feeling (nice), increased sexual appetite	If you take it everyday, you get a rebound headache, which makes you get addicted.	F	55	 	12/27/2003
5	Tension and Migraine headaches	Sleepiness	A great medicine for people with combination headaches, use extreme caution so as not to become dependant on the drug.	F	23	10  years	1/8/2003
