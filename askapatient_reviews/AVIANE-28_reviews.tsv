5	To prevent pregnancy	No side effects yet! The other birth controls I tried either made me physco or gain 20+ pounds. So far I love it!		F	18	7  days0.02	3/16/2013
1	not no more-it was for heavy perioi	high blood, pain in legs, then DVT, blood clot in lungs.		F	49	6  months28	3/15/2013
1		I had previously been taking Ortho Novum for years and had never had problems, but I decided I wanted to try something with lower hormones because of the health risks associated with higher hormone birth controls.  I assumed that since there were lower hormones in Aviane that the risk of side effects would be very small but boy was I wrong!!  Since starting the pill four months ago I have gained at least ten pounds, I have no sex drive whatsoever (which is totally opposite of before I started this pill), I have constant mood swings and I've been feeling very depressed. I am switching back to my old pill and can't wait to have my life back! The only good thing I can say for Aviane is that my period was lighter and one day shorter than in the past.			26	4  months	1/15/2013
1	birth control	I gained so much weigh as much as 15 lbs and felt deep feelings and sadness.  I was so sensitive and felt so alone,i didn't want to interact with no one. First i though ,maybe in just going through a rough patch but it just never went away. I soon put two and two together and tried seeing how i felt off the pill, reading some side effects of avaine were depression. After about a month i felt happy again. The pounds started to come off and i didn't feel bloated ever,compared to on the pill being bloated everyday.		F	21	10  months30 mg	1/8/2013
4	Birth control	This pill has helped my acne a ton!! I have just about no more back acne and face has cleared up a lot!!

3	Birth Control	I have experienced much weight gain. I have also had mood swings like crazy, as well as depression and crying for no reasons in particular. My appetite has increased tremendously witch explains the weight gain. I also have felt exhausted all the time after beginning this drug. My acne has gotten slightly worse and I have dark spot scars on my face now.			19	1  years1X Day 1X D	9/3/2012

3	prevent pregnancy	Rage and acne. Breast tenderness.	I've always been kind of upbeat and crazy...in a good way though. But after this second year of being on the pill I feel bat shit crazy. I will be fine and then the smallest thing will set me off. I've never been an angry person. I'm very laid back but the past 4 months I've been terrible and hostile. I don't enjoy it.

2	Prevent pregnancy	The generic form of Alyse was recommended by the pharmacist since it was less expensive but worked the same. For the last 2 years I noticed a huge shift in my happy go lucky personality. My moods would go from tired exhausted to happy for 30 minutes then angry and upset. This would continue for 2 years. A pain in my lower ab right side would take place during sex. While the pill worked for preventing pregnancy it was horrible in every other way. I could barely get out if bed. My sex drive decreased big time. My husband couldn't understand what was going on with me. It effected everything around me. He looked into the symptoms and there they were. I wil be going off of them immediately. I just want me back and put the mood and anger tired swings away forever. I can't believe I went through this for so long and had no clue why!

I feel a lot more emotional since I've been on this BC.	I haven't missed a pill. My period comes on time, I've had light cramps, and sex drive has not increased or decreased.

I have a O.C.D. but it is very mild and I can control it most of the time..But this pill has heightened my OCD symptons quite a bit!!! The other night I could not sleep due to major chest pain and shortness of breath b/c I was so anxious. I am going to keep taking it. But If these symptoms don't go away..i will discontinue use.

I bled the first month which was extremely annoying but other than that, no bad side effects.	F	19	  1X D	6/16/2012
2	heavy cycle, acne	I was on Lutera-28. And loved it. First month I took it, my chronic pelvic pain went away and my period went from 7-8 days w/ the first few days being so heavy and painful I was bedridden & iron deficient to almost no period for 3-4 days. They only had Aviane-28 at the pharmacy as an off brand so I said it was ok. WHAT A NIGHTMARE! I had no sex drive, my breasts were tender and swollen the first week of pills, exhausted and no appetite. I started spotting the end of week 2 and boom, have had my period for now 9 day and just started my REAL period. I have no pain, but my flow is so heavy I have to wear a super plus tampon and a pad!! I hate this BC!		F	27	1  months1xday	3/17/2012Email
1	Prevent Pregnancy	Depression, crying, suppressed appetite.	I'd always been kind of a depressed person, but I was doing better and feeling happier for a few months. I've only been on it for four days but I already feel depressed. I cry all the time, at everything. And my appetite is gone. I usually eat everything in the house!	F	16	4  days.10 mg 1X D	3/16/2012
2	Prevent pregnancy; shorten period	Decreased sex drive; moderate acne on chin & nose, extreme fatigue-- by fourth day could hardly function -- SO TIRED; Supressed appetite.	Unfortunately I had to stop taking this drug on the eighth day. I am newly married and could not afford to have no interest in sex. Also could not be so tired all the time. On the 4th day I was cob fussed, anxious, and overwhelmed by fatigue. But I never got sick or threw up, thank goodness.	F	33	7  days0.10mg 1X D	3/10/2012Email
3	Acne, Irregular periods, Migraine	Spotting (only if I miss a pill), POSSIBLE decrease in sex drive, made periods normal (light and regular), breast growth, decrease in frequency of migraines, DONT TAKE WITH ANTIDEPRESSANTS, cleared my skin from acne, discharge (?), moodiness	When I first got my period it was very heavy and irregular. It would come sometimes twice a month. I also had bad acne. The doc put me on Alesse, but it just made things worse. He then upped the dosage and switched me to Aviane-28. Ive been on it for several years, and I barely breakout with acne. My breasts are growing, and there is a possibility it is causing my libido to decrease. I did some research on it, and its possible. I also found that I would start spotting if I accidently miss a pill. I was also on antidepressants for a month and a half. That made my period VERY light, almost like it wasnt there. It been like that ever since and its been almost a year. I was alos put on it because Alesse and my periods would give me really bad migraines. With Aviane, I rarely get them, unless its due to environmetal factors or emotional, like insomnia and depression and stress. But when I do get them, I get them. I had to deal with a month and half long migraine last term. I havent noticed anything with my weight. I know my depression cause me to lose 20 pounds, and I have been having troubles gaining it back. I dont know if the discharge is from Aviane or from my period. I just know Ive had everyday since menarche. The moodiness is varying. And depends on what kind of day I had.	F	18	5  years 1X D	2/19/2012Email
3	Birth Control	Extreme Breast Tenderness. Nausea. Eating even when not hungry. EXTREME MOOD SWINGS!!!!!!!!! Feel like gained weight but can still fit clothes.	I haven't been on this long but I'm really not enjoying it. My boobs are constantly tender which I can deal w/ but the mood swings are horrible! Either I'm wanting to bawl my eyes out or rip someone's head off or am in a slightly decent mood. I'm paranoid all the time and think everyone around me is acting weird. I'm going to try and stick it out but I'm not sure if I'll stay w/ this one.	F	23	13  days10  MG 1X D	2/18/2012Email

1		I was on Lutera but I heard they stop making it as of last year. I'm on Aviane and I don't like it. I was switched to Aviane twice before and it always made me gain weight. I hate it!!!		F	43	  1X D	2/8/2012Email
2	Prevent Pregnancy; regulate periods	NO sex libido, headaches, and it actually made me break out.  Also, I've experienced more hair loss than usual, as well as frequent spotting -- before AND after my period, and it gave me dark spots on my face!	I've taken this for 2 years now, hoping that the side effects would change or go away, as warned by my doctor, but they simply haven't.	F	28	2  years.10 mg 1X D	2/2/2012Email
5	Regulation of cycle	No side effects at all. This was a great low dose pill that didnt give me any nausea.		F	48	10  years	2/1/2012
5	birth control	None	I don't know about everyone else, but I've had no trouble. Actually cleared up my acne from adolescence, and then regulated my period really well. No spotting, very short and light period. No problems, no weight gain. Decreased my mood swings and no loss of libido. :) Way less hassle than others.	F	19	8  months.1 1X D	1/31/2012
1	prevent pregnancey	Stabbing headaches, cramps, back pain, chest pain, starting having pain on left side and I couldn't breath good, rushed me to hospital to find out that aviane caused me to have blood clots in both my lungs, almost had a stroke, and now I have to give myself shots in the stomach for months and take pills for up to a year that's blood thinners, I would not ever recomend this to anyone, I was so healthy before, no history in my family of blood clots and I almost lost my life.		F	22	3  months10 mg	1/26/2012Email
4	Regulation	Fatigue, Weight Loss	I have been on many different types of BC, but this one has by far been the best. I have lost over 10 lbs and my acne has cleared 100%. I do feel very fatigued often throughout the day, but this is my only drawback.	F	22	  1X D	1/25/2012Email
1	Regulate cycle, menstrual cramps.	I experienced an increase in acne break outs on my face and body, I've gained 20 pounds since I've began taking this pill.  My Doctor was concerned, so I'm off of it now. I had my period 4 times in a 28 day cycle with one day breaks in between, I got head aches all the time and have had trouble sleeping. I started having constant yeast and bacterial infections, on this pill.  I went from a 34B to a 36 D (don't really mind) but I assume they'll go back down since Im off now.	Don't recommend it for anyone, although it really did help my menstrual cramp severity.	F	18	3  months1 pill 1X D	1/24/2012Email
4	birth control	weight-loss, nausea, mild stomach cramps, mild acne	This is the best pill I have been on so far. I loved that it's LOW dose. I gained a little weight after being on another birth control for two years, but once I started Aviane, I lost all of that weight, and I feel great. I can handle the mild acne and stomach cramps (which seemed pretty much go away after around month 3) for the ability to keep my weight in check.	F	24	9  months 1X D	1/23/2012Email
1	For Birth Control & Regulate Cycle	Stroke symptoms, including random severe headache, aura with possible migraine, loss of vision in one eye, dizziness, slurred speech.	Everything was fine until I hit the fourth week of taking this medicine.  I had about six stabbing headaches in one day, but I ignored them since a hurricane was going on, figuring it was just the barometric pressure.  That Monday I went to class and the stroke symptoms struck in the middle of lecture and I had to go to the health center.  Once I got off of it, for fear that I was going to have a full-blown stroke, it took a month of steroids to reduce the headache so I could actually function again.  I would never recommend this.

5	Prevent pregnancy	None		F	20	3  months	11/26/2011
2	Pregnancy prevention, sex drive	Extreme mood swings, acne, increased sex drive.	I began taking Aviane because I had a very low sex drive on Yasmine; however, I experienced mood swings beyond belief! I would burst into tears or a white hot rage in a matter of seconds. Also, I began to get acne all over my face and parts of my body. I am worried to continue into another month because if it does not slow down, I cannot handle it.

3	I switched from taking Junel 21 FE	nausea, acne, fatigue	I was taking Junel Fe for 3 years. I developed a skin rash and was having mood swings. I also had problems with my eyes so I asked my doctor to switch me and she gave me Aviane. So far ive had nausea right after I take the pill and after meals. I have no appetite, but I still eat anyway. I mainly crave sweets now. I had spotting bleeding also. I also have more red bumps on my face than I have ever had in my entire life. My boyfriend says it's not noticeable, but I can tell especially when I feel my face and it had tons of bumps. My mood has been fine and my rash is still here but improving (it happens around my chest and stomach). hopefully the acne and spotting go away after a couple months.

4	Prevent Pregnancy	Mood Swings	I switched from Yaz to Aviane, and I couldn't be happier with the results. About a week before my period, my moods are all out of whack, but it is NOTHING compared to how bad I was on Yaz. My cramps/back pain are now gone, I hardly get headaches, my boobs grew and my period is hardly noticable.	F	17	3  months 1X D	8/3/2011Email
1	cycle regulation and pregnancy pre.	nausea, dizziness, vomiting, exhaustion	I recently switched to Aviane after taking Aranelle for several years. I never had any problems with Aranelle, I just decided to switch to a low estrogen pill and this is what my doctor perscribed me. I took Aviane for 4 days and had no side effects. Then on the evening of teh 5th day, I felt unusually exhausted and got a migraine headache. I had flown on an airplane that day and thought maybe I just got some motion sickness, so I took the pill as usual and went to sleep. The next morning I was dizzy, exhausted, nauseous, and I had no appetite. My symptoms continued all day and by the evening of the 6th day, I was vomiting painfully and could hardly stand up. That night I discontinued taking the medication, and was still sick and vomiting the next morning. It was not for about 48 hours after taking my last dosage that I regained and appetite, my headache went away, and I began to be able to eat and sleep normally again. Aviane was the 4th type of birth control pill I have tried, and the only one that has ever given me such side effects.	F	31	5  days 1X D	8/2/2011Email
4	Pregnancy prevention	Weight loss. Minor moodiness at first, quickly adjusted.	Works great! Have been told of many contraindications, have experienced none! Prevents pregnancy with little or no bad effects.	F	23	5  months 1X D	8/1/2011
2	To Control Acne and balance hormone	My hair went from very wavy to straight.  It is to the point that it won't even hold curl from a curling iron.  I also have been very fatiged and not feeling 100%.  After reading other comments, I realized that it is probably due to the pill.  Also my acne got worse.  Going off of it and trying something different		F	32	2  months 1X D	7/14/2011Email
2	heavy bleeding,acne,bad cramps	Always hungry, weight gain, breast growth, over-sleeping, tiredness, sleeping issues, moodiness	Well for the positive things: it cleared most of my acne (though sometimes I broke out on my chin or a had like one random pimple on my forehead, especially during periods), and it regulated my periods and they lasted only lasted about a 7 days or less. The most important thing to me though was about the bleeding because my was very, very heavy. It did lighten my period, but not enough really. Also I still had cramps, though not as painful, but I still had them. One of the biggest problems I had with this was the increased appetite. Over the months taking it,  I gained 20 pounds. It scared me to death because all my life I've been thin and could eat anything I wanted without gaining weight, and now I was having problem squeening into my shorts. I was always wanting food and craving eating (even when I wasn't really hungry). I went up a cup size, though I didn't really mind that. I also was over-sleeping, but don't know exactly that Aviane effected my sleep or not because I've had sleeping issues all my life, but I was always tired and sometimes sleeping up to 13 hours a night and then still felt like I needed to take a nap. In a month I will probably switch to a new bc because even though it does help, it doesn't help enough and the side effects aren't worth it.	F	16	5  months28 1X D	7/10/2011Email
3	to regulate my menstrual cycle	Stoke like symptoms: facial numbness, vision problems, arm numbness, speech problems. Had to check in to the ER for the symptoms and was told by my PMD to immediately stop taking the medication.	It worked great for my cycle. I was only on it for a month and a half and had one period before the symptoms. I only spotted during my menstrual. I was anemic due to my heavy cycle. So when my cycle was light I was amazed. I thought I was having a stroke when I had the symptoms and it was my doctor who informed me that I was having a side effect of "complex mgraine".	F	25	1.5  months 1X D	6/30/2011Email
3	birth control	worked great until week 6, when I started bleeding and it didn't stop.	I didn't have any side effects at all until I started bleeding in the second cycle. After I quit aviane, it took two weeks for the bleeding to stop. Major bummer.	F	22	7  weeks 1X D	6/21/2011Email
4	pregnancy prevention	Weight gain, breast changes, lighter periods	I took yaz and yazmin for years, both giving me anxiety and awful mood swings. I have no mood swings with Avaine whatsoever, but I did gain about 10-13 pounds since I started, and my breasts went up a cup size at least. If you can tolerate weight gain, it's the best one I've been on.	F	27	5  months 1X D	6/19/2011
3	Birth Control	Horrible back pain, mood swings	I give it a 3 because for a year it was working really well and I had no side effects.  However, for the past 6 months I started getting 2 periods a month and had horrible back pain right before I started my period.  Also, in general I crave more food and carbs when I'm PMSing, which was manageable when I only had to deal with it for like 2-3 days a month.  Now it's all the time and my mood is just always all over the place.  Basically I feel like I am always PMSing and I just can't deal with it anymore, so I am switching to desogen.

1	Birth control, regulate periods	Hair loss, mood swings, crying a lot, weight gain, loss of sex drive, loss of motivation, anger, violence, constant nausea, constant diarrhea	This is my 3rd type of birth control, and it's the worst one I've taken so far.	F	21	2  months 1X D	6/5/2011Email
1	pregnancy prevention	Weight gainAlways hungryExhaustion/fatigueShallow breathingHeart palpitations	I have experienced weight gain from taking Aviane for only 2 weeks. I am a runner, usually doing about 20 miles/week, and I often weight lift, too. I was a steady 112, 5'5" for a long time until I began taking this birth control. I have gone up to about 120 lbs, so I am discontinuing it. I am always hungry, and have been feeling extremely exhausted for the last 5 days or so. Even with my workout regimen of running and lifting, I continued to eat and gain weight. I also became short of breath sometimes, with heavy and shallow breaths. I also experienced slight heart palpitations, and felt like I was almost experiencing the physical aspects of a panic attack without the psychological problems that come with them.I finally decided to go to the doctor, thinking I may be at risk for diabetes, since I was showing some of the classic symptoms, even though I have been diagnosed with the opposite (hypoglycemia):  always hungry, frequent urination (though I think this was due to drinking lots of fluids for my running), etc. There was no glucose in my urine sample (thank God), and my blood glucose readings were not abnormal.So I have decided to stop taking it and will return back to condoms. No more birth control pills for me!	F	22	2  weeks0.10mg 1X D	5/20/2011Email
3	birth control	Major moodswings, breakthrough bleeding, breast growth/shinking problems, decreased sex drive	Aviane wasn't all that bad, it never made me feel sick or bloated and it did it's job. But I choose to switch mainly because of the moodswings (crying for no reason and almost killing my bf) and also my boobs would grow almost a cup size then randomly shink back down causing sagging and lack of confedence. not to mention having to switch bra size.

2	prevent pregnancy	Had to come off this pill as I had 9 days of heavy bleeding (not breakthrough bleeding), in addition to just having finish my normal period 4 days prior. Doctor thinks the estrogen level of this pill does not work well with my own body's estrogen level. And while I didn't experience any other sides effects (mood swings, weight gain, etc) the excessive bleeding was way too much to deal with, not to mention harmful to my own hormone level, risk of anemia...Switching to new pill next week that has a different estrogen and progesterone ratio.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..	F	25	1  months 1X D	11/14/2011Email
3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email
1	depression	i would studder sweat like crazy eye twitching hyperactive cry for no reason heart pounding out my chest really high blood pressure pass out from panic attacks insomia talk really fast umm flame up inside theres more thid pill sucks i thought i was going to die		M	31	 30mg 1X D	8/25/2011Email
5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!	M	37	21  days10 1X D	2/24/2011Email
5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.
