1	Total Cholesterol 301	I have been on lovastatin for 2 months. I have low back issues but when it flares up, only my right leg hurts and this pain is different and in both of my legs equally, not just my right leg. It is a diffuse leg pain/can not pin point the areas but feels deep, almost like the pain is coming from the bones or something. It is worse in the mornings...I would describe it as a deep, achy feeling in my muscles and bones with no definite origin. The pain also occurs in my buttocks, more so on my right side for the gluteal pain but equal in each leg as far as the diffuse pain I experience.  It is more prominent in my lower legs, ie..my calves and shins than in my thighs.		F	52	 20 1X D	5/20/2012EmailHistory
1	high cholesterol	Severe memory loss, very sore and stiff hip bones/muscles and muscle weakness, exhaustion/lethargy	I am so happy I saw this site. I have been so worried about my memory and chalked it down to early dementia. I am 43 and shouldnt feel the way I do. I am stopping immediately. I will exercise and become a vegetarian. I have been thinking my life was over and so upset over it. I am a single dad of two adopted boys and have worried myself sick. I couldnt remember simple words. This isnt worth it. And the tiredness. all I want to do is sleep..like crazy hours of sleep 12-15 hours a day. This stuff is poison. Will report back after stopping	M	43	2  years10mg 1X D	5/8/2012Email
1	very high cholesterol	I took lovastatin 20mg/d for 3 years with no side effects.  Dosage was upped to 40mg and I began to decline.  Joint and muscle pain.  muscle spasms.  Memory loss.  I now feel like I am 80 years old.  Stopped drug 5 days ago.  Doctors reaction is incredible.  No matter what you say they tell you to keep taking this drug.  I will check back in in a couple of months to see if symptoms clear.  Lovastatin reduced my cholesterol, but long term users beware.  Side effects snuck up on me.

1	High cholesterol/triglicerides	I started having shortness of breath about the same time as I started Lovastatin..thought it was just the weather but the problem has persisted to the point where I was having chest wall pain  along with it. Had an EKG and Echocardiogram both of which were normal. Just found on the Mayo Clinic Website that SOB is one of the side effects. Will stop the Lovastatin and see if the SOB goes away.	Very interesting comments. I have tried other Statins too without success.	F	69	3  months10 mgm 1X D	5/15/2011
3	High cholesterol	I've been taking Lovastatin for about 10 years. Had the sore muscle thing, but not severe. I am experiencing tremors (shaky hands, fingers, facial muscles. A "RARE" side effect of Lovastatin is "tremors". I have a friend who has extreme tremors and takes Lovastatin.	I want to know if there are many of you out there who have experienced increasing tremors. Thanks. I might be 74, but I'm as active as most 40 year olds, might account for the sore muscles.

1	high chol. 256, LDL 180	at first no side effects, but after 2 weeks SEVERE muscle pain & burning in left shoulder then both shoulders. Couldnt sleep at all, pain felt like a burning sensation, hurt all the time. I had to stop exercising completely as that only aggravated symptoms.	after stopping for just 2 days almost all of pain went away, can sleep normally again, now it just feels tender or brused but definitely better.

1	Risky Cholesterol - 214	I have been experiencing pain in my Rt Shoulder...like a rotar cuff injury. Thought I strained it exercising. Neck pain...same thoughts. Dizziness. Then i remembered my Dr. warning me about muscle pains. Came to this site...wow...This is a second round with statins in 3 years. Last time mental impairment led to 3 custom shirt jobs done wrong in a wk...lost $3k. I think I will talk to my Dr and get off them again.Then, improve my exercise and foods I eat as well as pick back up the  red yeast rice, Omegas and CoQ10. A month later, I will get back to using Grapefruit Pectin too. They all helped take me from 240 to 200 last year. then I got busy, lazy, older. I think I am now anti-statin...especially after reading this site. Hope you all get better.		M	54	4  days20 MG 1X D	1/18/2011Email

1	high cholesterol	the drug from hell.  I felt like I was 200 years old.  I could not move in the mornings I was so stiff.  All my joints felt like they were swolen, but they weren't.  It was absolutely horrible.  I took myself off the drugs and told my doctor I would NEVER consider take a statin again.  I would rather chance high cholesterol than feeling like that for the rest of my life.		F	50	60  days30 1X D	1/1/2011
3	borderline high cholesterol	Severe muscle atrophy, pain everywhere, migraines frequent & horrible when I NEVER had them before, neck stiffness, unable to exercise effectively any longer.  Have made the decision to go off them.  Cholesterol was 204. Dr said to go on them & it only dropped to 178.  Not worth it.  I am too young.  I have had so many blood tests, MRI & Dr visits with every specialty imaginable, trying to figure out what is wrong with me.  I recently went on vacation & didn't have them & the difference was stunning!  I felt normal.  I have also been supplementing with CoQ10, 50 mg per day, since I came across it 3 months ago.  Migraines are slightly less painful & less frequent only.  No other reduction in symptoms with CoQ10.	Maybe for those in advanced age to help extend or improve life.  However, Drs are prescribing these things to people younger and younger and the 40 year effects of taking these things have NOT been ascertained, nor have the effects on younger people been adequately ascertained.  Same with only borderline high cholesterol cases.	F	32	2.5  years10mg 1X D	7/9/2010Email
1	high cholesterol	left toe pain. At first, I blamed my new shoes. Yesterday, woke up with severe neck pain, stiff neck, soreness. Had a massage today, and some of the stiffness left. Some years ago, I took another statin at higher dose, and had continual muscle and joint pain until I figured out that it was caused by the drug. I was wondering if the stiff neck was caused by Lovostatin.  Thanks to this website, I know that I'm not alone, nor am I imagining this side effect.		M	52	3  months20 MG 1X D	7/1/2010Email
1	Borderline high cholesterol	Sleeplessness, significant muscle aches in lower extremities	I am very dissatisfied with this drug.  I have suffered from significantly disrupted sleep patterns.  When I awoke in the morning, I could hardly walk from the muscle aches in my feet.  The foot pain was so bad at times that I thought I had gout.  I have found no evidence that these drugs reduce heart attacks or strokes, so I am not sure why I was taking it.  Even if this drug does work to reduce heart attacks and strokes, I may still not take it because it has lowered my quality of life significantly.	M	41	30  days20 mg 1X D	5/25/2010

1	high cholesterol	Cramping in calves thighs arms prickling in feet, muscle spasm would wake me in the night. Wrist pain so bad could not open a door since turning door knob caused excruciating pain on inside wrists. Physician told me she never heard of these side effects and to keep taking the medication. Several time phoned and went to see her. She and office staff made me feel like a neurotic and office staff refused my reference of articles to the doctor about my problems.

Causes burning on bottom of feet as if scalded, feels like full thickness blisters on bottom of feet, prickling sensations on bottom, sides and top of feet. Numbness at times that ache, feeling like feet and ankles been frozen. At times feel like I am walking on uneven surface, like floor covered with potatoes. Balance affected, walking for any length of time c	Very dangerous drug. Company only concerned about profits. Statin medications have not been shown to reduce heart attacks. Interferes with the normal effect of cholesterol that helps prevent cancer, helps with protecting cells, etc. Have lots of articles I can refer you to that I have found. Damage can be permanent.

1	High cholesterol	Thought I had the flu. Nausea, stomach ache, diarrhea, right side of my neck very sore, shoulder joints ached constantly, could not sleep. Ached all over. I have never had any major problems with any drugs, but I will never take another statin. There was no warning from the doctor or pharmacist. Wish they could be in my skin tonight.

1	Type 2 diabetic	Watching my husband become a cripple with severe muscle pain and weakness.  Additionally he saw a neurologist 2 times last year for serious memory and cognitive impairment. Was diagnosed with depression.  He's 65 and over past 2 years he's gone down hill so quickly. he can no longer work as a truck driver. No idea Lovastatin could be the cause until 2 weeks ago when symptoms got so bad he could barely walk. I gave up on docs and searched internet.	He stopped taking drug 2 weeks ago.  No major improvement in muscle pain and weakness so far, but he seems mentally sharper.  I am praying he will be back to himself again in a few months.  This has been a nightmare and in all his many recent doctor appts, this was never brought up as a possible cause for these frightening symptoms.  I am angry!	M	65	10  years20 MG 1X D	3/18/2010

1	Elevated Cholesterol	memory loss, fuzzy thinking, mental slowness, clumsiness, inability to form words when speaking, mild joint pain (wrists)	After taking this for about a week, I noticed the above symptoms on a very mild scale.  I initially wrote it off to the long and late hours I was working for part of that first week. (4 days with only about 4-5 hours sleep.)  After that assignment was completed, I went back to my regular work routine of two or three hours per day and 8-9 hours of sleep, however the symptoms did not abate and got progressively worse. After two weeks, I knew something well out of the ordinary was happening to me and the only logical conclusion was that because I was not doing anything else differently, it had to be the drug. I called a friend whom I knew was taking statins and asked him if he had experienced any side effects similar to mine.  He said that except for severe muscle damage that he experienced, I could have been describing his symptoms.  His doctor told him it was undoubtedly the statin and took him off.  I quit the drug today and have called my doctor.  I will report back on what happens.	M	57	28  days20mg 1X D	2/5/2010

Was on lower doses for three years with no problems. Increased to 80 mg for six months and started having problems.  Never imagined it could be the meds.  Tested for other diseases until I ran accross this site.  Quit taking immediately.  Felt somewhat better immediately but still had side effects off and on for about 1 1/2 months.

1	High Cholesterol	1st feeling of rushing of blood in chest, flash warm feeling. I feel like I have been beat up all over my body. Doctor said fibromyalgia, despite Chiropracter/massage therapist denying this. I have a high tolerance to pain, due to 4 discs being gone in my lower back. So why would I develope this now? Extreme right shoulder pain, tightness. Had upper back injury years ago and attributed numberness in fingers and arms to that, appears to be drug related. Cramping in muscles, twitching in hip joints. Cannot sleep or fall asleep, pain all over, took prescribed sleeping pill, Oxycodone, Neurontin and still could not sleep for hours. This is after the 2nd time being on the medicine. Told doctor that Pharmacist vehemently warned against using this. Took it for a month, was off 2 weeks. Apparently it takes longer for the symptoms to go away, but they did get better. On it again and it is worse. Husband read this and said stop taking it now!

Random itchy rashes.  Muscle pain in my legs and I get so stiff I have to stand up carefully and hold the railings to go up and down stairs.  After 15 Dr. visits I read about the side effects and stopped the drug last night.  No one asked about taking new medication and statin side effects.

Also since stopping I noticed I no longer needed to take Prilosec for heartburn and that my loose bowel movements firmed up. I had never thought of side effects such as those. My legs still ache at night but a lot less than at the height. Blood test showed no muscle damage and only one liver enzyme slightly raised.

Have just started 40mg of lovastatin, 3 days. Read the side effects  from the pharmacy and was alarmed. Then the shoulder pain started  and I began researching side effects on line. Found this site. Am very concerned, and will not continue. I will discuss this with my doctor further. Also am concerned that my 87 year old mother's dementia symptoms may be related.

1	blocked stent	Sporadic but frequent joint and muscle pain, especially in right shoulder and arm, but also left side, also hips and knees.  Considerable and constant foot swelling also being experienced but possible lisinopril effect.	Was reluctant to take it because 4 months after double bypass 9 years ago I was put on simvastatin which made me weaker and weaker but without pain.  Told VA docs over and over but had to find out for myself that weakness was a simvastatin side effect; stopping it stopped the progression of the weakness. Just so, if lovastatin is the cause of my current problems - and the muscle pain is certainly not the result of trauma - the docs just haven't managed to come up with that possibility in three consults.

1	high cholesterol	I am only 43 years old but after two weeks on this medication I developed serious memory problems such as forgetting the birth dates of my children. I've always had a sharp mind and was not taking any other medication so I knew it was the mevacor. I've since read that all statins have this side effect and that drug companies hid the side effect data when the FDA approved statins for human use. I was forgetting critical information at work and was scared that I was developing early dementia. The symptoms stopped within a week of stopping the mevacor. But my doctor still wants to try me on another statin. They say memory problems are rare-tell that to the executive who kept taking a statin for 2 years while his memory got so bad that he lost his job. The problem didn't reverse like mine after stopping the drug. The problem is that side effects like mine happen gradually so that it may take a long time (maybe never) before realizing that it is the medicine that is making you sick.

My father, athletic, healthy male who worked out daily at the gym, went to the doctor for first time just for a physical when he turned 64 years of age. Doctor placed him on lovastatin. Within weeks he had weakness in legs, problems with back, would run into walls, lose balance. After 6 months developed dry eye. When he visited doctor, and explained doctor said it was from 'aging'. My father must have aged 30 years in 6 months. He is now (after three years, 2 of those years on lovastatin) unable to leave the house on his own and can not drive. I had to move back with him to watch him. In the last two weeks I witnessed him take two very bad falls, and he couldnt get up without my help. He has been taking coq10 in high doses due to what i've read on the internet. It seems to have seriously improved him but still he has the above symptoms. This drug changed our lives for good.

For clarification, Mevacor, Lovastatin, Monocolins and Red Yeast Rice are [pretty much] the same drug. - Anyways, my numbers now are: Total 194, HDL 53, LDL 129, triglycerides very good, glucose a little elevated but still well within normal. - here is what I did and what I have changed since these numbers were derived. 1/2 pill of Red Yeast Rice (5.2g monocolins), 1500 mg niacin (actually 1200 niacin and 300 inositol in the form of inositol hexanicotinate), 5 1g fish oil pills (molecularly distilled to remove any toxins), b-complex with and also extra folic acid and b12, 200mg CoQ10 (minimum) - Going forward I will increase niacin to 2000mg to increase my HDL. I must be careful and watch my liver function number because niacin as well as the red yeast rice puts a strain on the liver. CoQ10 is absolutely essential for the elimination of many of my earlier symptoms.	M	49	18  months	6/26/2008Email
1	High cholesterol	Memory loss, numbness and tingling in extremities, muscle pain and wasting, atrial fibrillation, bone pain, joint pain, insomnia, poor vision etc...	According to doctor blood tests seem normal to him. Started having heart fibrillations 6 years into this drug therapy. Stopped taking drug and symptoms went away. Start drug symptoms return. Doctor believes drug not responsible. Common senes tells me to stop but don't want to piss doctor off. Hard to find doctors here in Hawaii. Predisposing factor to having negative symptoms may be stress from police job etc. Being on this drug is like a death sentence. Cannot even work out to get back in shape...ironic..been on drug 7 years.	M	47	7  days	6/10/2008
1	high cholesterol	Nausea, insomnia, nervousness, loud ringing in ears, forgetfulness, confusion on low doses	I've taken several statins with similar intolerable side effects. The cure is worse than the disease in this case of many of us.	M	64	2  months	4/5/2008
1	high cholesterol	insomnia, depression, anxiety, muscle weakness and pain, reflux, loss of energy, enthusiasm and drive.  Tendonitis, stomach upset, pain in side. memory loss.	The worst experience I have ever had.  Have been off one month and am improving in ever area.  The change is very dramatic.  Took it 3 years, no symptoms in the beginning, came on gradual and I didn't attribute them to medication until my doctor had me discontinue.  As if by Magic all my complaints cleared up.  I felt so bad I was feeling suicidal.	F	8	 	3/28/2008Email
1	High Cholesterol	Joint and muscle pain. Tingling and numbness in extremities. Fatigue, fatigue fatigue. Weakness. Stopped taking a week ago and am just starting to feel like myself again.		M	60	3  years	3/24/2008
1	High Cholesterol	Pain and swelling in hands, wrists, elbows and shoulders.  Symptoms were diagnosed as arthritis and prescribed 1600 mg of ibuprofin and sulfasalazine for arthritis.	This drug is worse for your health than high cholesterol.	M	58	2  years	2/21/2008
1	cholesterol	I am having severe muscle aches,joint pain, headache's . I can not walk after sitting for awhile because of ankle and leg pain. I also have found after sitting in a car for awhile is even harder on my legs and my hips. I have been to my doc.test show no arthritis.	My Doc has never mentioned any side effects with lovastatin, he says I have some form of arthritis or auto-immune even though all test are negative	M	51	14  months	2/6/2008Email
1	High LDL	Hair loss/breakage and painful joints after taking 10 mg  for 3 months. Doctor had doubled dose for 3 weeks because there was  no improvement in my LDL when labwork was done.	My hairdresser asked about new medications when we noticed my hair was breaking off and looked very "dull" not shiny. When I contacted my cardiologist, I was told this was a side effect, but I could not find it in anything I had read as a side effect.	F	59	3  months	12/29/2007
1	recommended by Dr.	chills, fever, rash, muscle aches, tingling pain in hands and fingers stiff neck, headache, blurred vision, sweating	I would not recommend anyone take this drug.	M	58	2  days	12/25/2007Email
1	to lower LDL Cholesterol	Severe pains in all of my upper body joints and muscles, wrists, hands and ankles and feet. My legs felt like they were so heavy when I walked. After being on my feet to cook Thanksgiving food my feet on the top would hurt for hours afterwards.Then my legs began to swell. I was extremely fatigued and lethargic. The muscle in my right bicep deteriorated to mush. This crept up on me.	Mevacor did lower my LDL from 111 to 76. I thought that was great. I have had bouts of fybromylgia for years and I have osteoarthritis, so I thought when these symptoms got really horrible that I was having a major attack in these two areas. I was on CoQ10 from the time I started taking Mevacor. I felt like I was slowly dying on this drug. I would rather die of a heart attack at 65 that feel like I did.	F	56	7  months	12/9/2007
1	Genetically High LDL levels	Nausea, dizziness, acid reflux, chest pressure, woke up belching, went to bed belching. Numbness and/or pain in arms and hands, sudden tiredness. I would become so nauseous I could eat nothing but crackers and peppermint tea. Very similiar to "morning sickness". Yuck! Seemed to be triggered by anything that could become acidic in my stomach - even coffee.	I did not have immediate side effects, rather started having "episodes" of dizziness and nausea after being on drug for about 14 months. Did not relate as side effects, until I had an "A-HA!" moment and realized that was the only thing it could be. And it was. Within 2 weeks of being off the drug, all the issues I was having were gone. My Dr. is now having me try Zetia. I just read the side effect reports for this - SCAREY!My Dr. said NOT taking anything would be "gambling" on what could happen otherwise. I lead a VERY, VERY healthy lifestyle. My achilles heel though is having high LDL!	F	50	18  months	11/13/2007
3	Elevated Cholesterol	..A GUIDE TO LOWERING CHOLESTEROL FOR THOSE WITH BAD REACTIONS TO STATINS DRUGS SUCH AS MEVACOR AND LIPITOR, etc.. ...Write me if you have questions.. I commented on this page before. I had great success with Red Yeast Rice (also known as Lovastatin brand name Mevacor)lowering my total cholesterol from 244 to 168 with my HDL 40. My orig numers were 244 w/HDL 62. But there were side effects and my HDL had dropped 22.	I stopped and tried beta sterols, oatmeal, loss 10 lbs, kept up the exercise (best I could), fish oil 2 pills total EPA 530mg and 1000mg niacin extended release but my numbers were total 225 w/HDL 53. Thats a little progress but I need more. I have increased my niacin to 1200 mg (600 before bed and 600 in the morning) and started taking Red Yeast Rice again but half a pill therefor 5.2 monacolins but my neck has started to tighten up and crack with headaches. I'm taking one day off RYR and tom I take only 1/4 a pill for 2.6 monacolins. I mean Advicor is niacin extended relase and Lovastatin and it comes in quantities starting at 500mg extended release niacin and 20 mg lovastatin. I'm well within the lowest amount so what gives. I'm upping my fish oil to 5 to 6 pills for an EPA of 1100-1350 mg. I had been taking 6 pills fish oil before my first test (HDL 62) but had stopped before my second test (HDL 40).My goal is Total under 200, HDL minimum 75 and LDL under 125 hopefully close to 100	M	49	7  days	11/6/2007Email
1	To lower chlorestrol	After taking Lovastatin for almost one year, several months ago began experiencing severe pain in almost all joints of body. Had no energy and had a hard time sleeping at night. Went to Doctor this week for physical and after telling him my problems, he said to stop taking this drug. Why was I not advised of the side effects before taking???		F	67	 	10/25/2007
1	To lower cholesterol	I experienced heart attack like symptoms and have been having extreme dizziness, vertigo, and headaches for the past 4 months. I consulted my doctor and she zeroed in on the Mevacor and I stopped it about 2 weeks ago. Am still having dizziness and headaches. Anyone else out there with these problems??
