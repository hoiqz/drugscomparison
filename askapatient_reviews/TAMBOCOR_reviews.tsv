5	Lone Atrial fibrillation	None		M	27	3  weeks100mg x 2	12/6/2012
5	A FIB	Minimal compared to the bad  A FIB I was having lasting all night sometimes.  This drug is a God-send.   I am hoping to back off the heavy dosage of Toprol XL which will help with the tiredness issue.		M	71	60  days50 MG 2X D	10/16/2012Email
5	AFib	A loss of energy, which was taken in conjuntion with other meds (from time to time).  Have worked through that with exercise regime.	Ablation in 2007 helped and two ablations (left and right side) this year as heart tissue grew back causing severe palpatations over a month.  Currently AFib free and without any occurance in the past 4 months, might be taken off Tambocor all together.  My heart goes out to all fellow suferers.	M	50	14  days100mg 2X D	9/25/2012
4	Afib	Cold hands/feet	Controlled my AF quite well till now. No real side effects apart from  cold hands/feet when I sit for a while in an upright posture...(funny, I'm ok when laying like a lizard in front of TV)!But lately, I'm getting short bursts (2 -3 hour stints) of afib back. Not the incredible thumping that used to occur for 24-48 hours, just an elevated rate (120bpm) that is faint and misses a lot. But if I take an extra tablet, this stops within an hour.Going to see what the doc thinks about having 3 tabs a day, or maybe he'll say it's time to visit the electro-cardio specialist.....	M	58	400  days100 2X D	9/16/2012Email
3	AFib	Blurred vision, ED, Rapid pulse rate 100 bpm/130bpm but am in sinus rhythm.	Will see Doc tomorrow to re-evaluate meds. I feel Docs should follow protocols and hospitalize AFib patients three days for observation when new meds are prescibed.	M	50	4  days100 2X D	6/5/2012Email
5	AF	So far none, besides maybe cold feet, hands.	Had AF 4 times now. Two corrected with electrical cardioversion, the third one in hospital with intravenous flecainide and the forth one by just taking an extra cap Tambocor 100mg.Works great for me, low HR of 45bpm, 5 lower than prior to usage of Tambocor. Running long distance whole/ half marathon with max HR <140bpm.Interested hearing other experience of usage in combination with running etc.	M	56	15  months100mg 1X D	3/15/2012Email
5	AF	Absolutely none...but I have put on 5 kgs...not sure if it is related as I have been in a good paddock last few months.	I would get AF the day after drinking alcohol.  Since I have taken tambocor it has not happened. I don't fear it happening any more and I feel great.	M	39	3  months100 1X D	3/13/2012
5	lone atrial fibrillation	nil, except i feel i recover very quickly after excercise	i used to get AF small bouts weekly, and be hospitalised a few times a year, my life was terrible, but since taking tamboccor i feel cured, i dont even get a single palpitation ever, its a wonder drug, i feel great.	M	47	8  years150 2X D	2/25/2012
3	Afib, flutter	Sad to read that others are suffering, but reassuring to see the similar side effects.  Tremors and weakness are severe and getting worse.  Hair loss, memory loss, speech, vision and writing/cognitive abilities are deteriorating rapidly to where it is becoming frightening.  Was just sent to a neurologist; wonderful elecrophysician who performed the ablation but denies/atypical that ablation has caused this rapid deterioration.  Also feel very "lost" mentally.  Thank you for sharing your experiences-not so alone with these terrible side effects. There is a dramatic change in me-difficult to even write this which is highly unusual for me.	Have had afib and flutter approximately 15 years, about every 6 months in clusters.  Was kept in balance with 5MG Zebeta/day effectively until 1 year ago.  Cardizam was added, but frequency increased, plus very slow heartrate.  Decided on an ablation 4 1/2 months ago which seemingly has worked.  Was put in hospital to initiate 50MG/Tambocor 2xDay for a month previous to ablation; which helped greatly.  Am now on Tambocor approximately 5-6 months but with possible severe problems from it. Doctor just removed it and also 10MG/Day of Lipitor after 10 years.  We shall wait and see. I believe it was a good drug for the arrythmias, but not certain if it has caused these severe side effects.	F	59	6  months50MG 2X D	1/8/2012Email
1	A-Fib	Blurred vision, fatigue, overall not feeling normal in any.	This is a VERY scarey medicine to take. For some this works good, but I personally could not stand the side effects. I had two instances where I almost went in to A-Fib, but didn't. My Doctor attributed this to the Flecainide but I don't know. I have now been on Multaq for two months and have been A-Fib free ever since - and zero side-effects.	M	41	30  days100 2X D	5/31/2011
1	A Fib	I've been on 100mg Toporol for 5 years for a fib.  I have a fib once every 12-18 months.  Cardioversion corrects the a fib.  This time the doc put me on 50 mg Toporol and 100mg x2 Tambocor.  I started having very blurred vision and when I layed down my heart would beat twice and skip a beat for hours which caused headaches.  I told my doc no more but he is insisting that I stay on it.  After reading into this med and all the problems there is no way I'm going back to it.		M	53	2  weeks100 MG 2X D	5/26/2011Email
3	Afib	Feel like I am in a fogg all day.  Out of breath.	I will give this a chance as doctors differ with my diagnosis.  Had an ablation in 2001 for SVT and new doctor thinks it's related.  I would have another ablation in a minute to get rid of the side effects.  Also taking 100 mg. of Toprol succinate and may have to reduce that to increase stamina.	F	65	5  days100 MG 2X D	4/27/2011
1	afib	Severe bradycardia, hypotension.  Also extreme nervousness - hard to describe, constantly felt like flinching, maybe it was the tremors others have described.	I couldn't tolerate this at all - my heart rate dropped into the 30's and I still had constant PAC's/PVC's.	F	46	5  days50MG 2X D	4/21/2011
4	A-fib, A-flutter	Feel dazed most of the time, however, it has controlled my heart rhythm. I haven't had any stomach discomfort or hair loss or tremors or visiual problems. Most importantly I haven't had a heart "episode" since I began this medication, so for me it is worth the side-effect.		F	56	6  months100 Mg 2X D	1/3/2011Email
5	a fib	No side effects thus far.	Episodes of arrhythmias are rare now.	M	56	14  days50mg 2X D	11/24/2010
3	PSVT	Fatigue is horrible.  Hair loss.  Hot flashes and mood swings.	I have had a heart ablation and it did not work.  I go again in January 2011 to discuss having another one.  My cardiologist says that sometimes you have to have 2 to 3 before one will work.  I know my pharmacist wants me off this drug.  He said long term use can be dangerous.  I take toprol XL also.  I still have bouts of arythmias.  They can be very painful at times.  I guess I will see what happens in January.	F	52	2  years100 2X D	11/14/2010Email
4	Arrhythmia	None that I'm aware of.	My cardiologist prescribed Tambocor after I developed a cardiac arrhythmia following a heart attack in my right coronary artery. I also had a pacemaker installed, (for pacing only, i.e., not a defibrilator). I'm unaware of any problems caused by the drug. Early this year my cardiologist quit his practice so I located a new heart doc. My new cardiologist does not like Tambocor at all, he considers it to be a very dangerous drug and he does not understand why I'm taking it. He said I should be taking an ACE inhibitor, which he prescribed in August 2010. However, because I've been taking Tambocor since January 1997 he is afraid to discontinue it unless I'm admitted to a hospital as an in-patient for at least five days to monitor my heart while I discontinue taking the drug. It seems that I'm now between a rock and a hard place.	M	67	13  years50 MG 3X D	10/15/2010
3	Premature atrial beats,	After a few weeks, progressive tremors of one hand & forearm,  interfering w/ driving. At 3 months, 2 days w/ leg tremors. Dose reduced to 25 mg 2x/day for 2 weeks w/ decrease of tremor amplitude but increased frequency. Off pills 2 weeks, reducing amplitude but no change in frequency. Another post on this site says it took months for side effects to subside.  Cardiologist says this med doesn't cause tremors, but Primary Dr. says this looks like likely cause, in my case.	Beta blockers had increased excess beats, but Flecainide (Tambocor) controlled them to normal level.	F	60	3  months50mg 2X D	8/1/2010
3	Arrhythmia, Tachycardia	Moderate increase in fatigue, significant increase in sweating with activity. Initial nausea/worsening GERD that decreased with time.	I've only been on this medication for 2 weeks. It's dampened the sensations/awareness of arrhythmia but not taken it away. I am concerned about the additional fatigue.	F	41	2  weeks50 mg 2X D	7/26/2010Email
1	atrial fibrillation	SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST - LOOK IT UP!	I was told that this drug was "bad" if you have blockages so it was started in a hospital July '08 after they did a stress test and determined I was fine. In Jan '10 I experienced SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST and fortunately was revived after 15 minutes in the woods. Nobody expected me to live. At the hospital they did an angiogram and found 4 blocked coronary arteries. After quadruple bypass I'm now on Multaq. I recommend the book "Deadly Medicine" by Thomas Moore, if you can find it. It was written 15 years ago and quickly out of print!!!	M	59	1.5  years 1X D	7/6/2010Email
5	Afib	Flecainide (plus Toprol) has kept me in normal sinus rhythm for over 6 years with only mild side effects (slight visual disturbance).		M	57	6  years100mg 2X D	4/15/2010
1		Extreme trembling in right arm and hand that got worse the longer I took the drug.  Vision problems.  Memory loss.  Worst problems were the tremors as they extended to other arm, knees, and feet.	Took drug for about 1 year.  Stopped it.  Took several months for side effects to go away.  Started me back on it. Tremors started immediately and very strong.  Pay very close attention to yourself if you start this drug and notice changes.  It was a bad drug for me.	F	60	365  days100mg 2X D	4/13/2010
3	Afib, SVTs	This drug stole my energy and my personality.  My edge was gone.  I was chronically fatigued, foggy, with anxiety and depression.  Everything was a chore.  Not  much was fun.	I was treated for Afib with an electrical cardioversion.  When I woke  up, I had a regular beat, then SVTs, regular, then SVTs.  I was put on Tambocor.  It did a pretty good job of controlling the irregular rhythm, although I would have occasional SVT episodes for up to a minute.  In two years, I had three more episodes of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter,and each time I was treated with a cardioversion which restored the "normal" rhythm of regular beat, then SVT.  I resisted the ablation for atrial fibrillation (left side ablation) because of the highly elevated stroke risk.  Eventually, with urging from me, my cardiologists suggested that the real problem might be SVTs, not afib, and that the SVTs might be causing the Afib or flutter.  Three weeks ago, I had an ablation for SVTs(right side, no highly elevated stroke risk).  The SVT ablation worked wonderfully.  No more SVTs, and so far, no afib or flutter.  Stopped taking Tambocor nearly a month ago, and I could not be happier.  My personality is back, for better or worse.  I am not taking any medicine at all.  Only by stopping the Tambocor did I realize what a nasty medicine it is and just how much it cost me as a person.  If my cardiologists had put me in the SVT box, not the Afib box, much earlier, I would have had the SVT ablation much sooner and not lost myself for more than 2 years.	M	62	2.5  years100mg 2X D	2/21/2010
5	Afib	Having a little trouble with close-up reading but not a big problem. Could also just be time to get reading glasses. No other side effects.	I used to have afib events about every 2 months that last for 4-6 hours. I haven't had any problems since taking tambacor (so far). This stuff has really helped me.	M	45	15  months50mg 2X D	2/10/2010
5	atrial fibrillation	none that I know of	It's a life saver. However, I will ONLY take the brand. I had one generic of it that put me in the hospital with a-fib.	F	62	6  years	7/21/2009
4	Tachycardia	Double vision when i look to the side about an hour after i take each dose, lasts about 45 min	works great!	F	25	2  years	4/24/2009
5	svt. a-fib	nothing that i can attribute to the medication	wonderful drug that keeps my heart regular as long as i take it religiously.	F	45	10  years	3/21/2009Email
3	Heart arrhythmias: v-tach and PVCs	Blurred vision, stomach upset, anxiety, disruptive sleep patterns, cold extremities, hot flashes, sweating, a sense of pounding/pressure in head and temples, pain in shoulders, continued hair loss.	I have to say that this medication has controlled my arrhythmias, but I feel really "out of sorts." And my hair loss hasn't slowed down at all.  Although my cardiologist assured me that Tambocor wouldn't cause hair loss, I discovered that indeed it can cause hair loss in a small percentage of patients.  I'm looking to transition off this drug to something else in a couple of weeks because the side-effects are starting to affect my quality of life.	F	57	3  weeks	3/2/2009
4	AVRNT	Fatigue, sudden dizzyness, blurred vision, ringing in the ears.	I've only been on tambocor for a few weeks and I find they are good at controlling my arrythmia. I'm on 50mg twice a day at the moment and due to increase to 100mg twice a day. If I forget to take one (which is often!) I experience the arrythmia again, but they are great when I do remember.	F	38	3  weeks	2/18/2009
4	atrial fibrillation	Flecainide has worked very well to control my atrial fibrillation - have been on it 6 months and no more episodes.  I'm taking it along with Toprol XL.  Side effects include fatigue and some peripheral vision problems, but overall worth the price of not having AF episodes.		F	67	6  months	12/2/2008
1	SVT, PVC's	Weight gain, horrible tremmors, short term memmory loss, anxiety, shortness of breath, insomnia, muscle weakness, edema, and headache.	I was taking 100mg twice daily along with Toprol XL 100mg daily to control my pvc's because the Flecainide alone did not do the job.  Even then, I continued to have the pvc's and 4 episodes of svt, but they were not as strong. I could deal with most of the side effects except the tremmors, which were not constant, but very strong when they did happen.  The tremmors became progressively worse as I continued to take the medication to the point where one day I couldn't even hold a glass of water without spilling most of it.  I have gone for 2 ablations without success because my pvc's usually stop when I'm lying down.  I'm very frustrated, but still looking for answers.	F	35	3  months	10/2/2008
1	a-fib	headache, tired, confusion, dazed, felt was drunk, stomach upset, just couldn't get out of my own way	will never take again, symptoms of a-fib which are very bad are not as bad as drug	M	58	7  days	9/27/2008Email
4	Intermittent A-fib	Vision problems, fatigue	I take 100mg a.m., 150mg p.m., and from the first day noticed that my vision is affected, most noticeably in the first 3 hrs after using. Could not take the extra 50mg in the a.m. because of the vision difficulty. Any attempt to use my peripheral vision causes severe eye strain and blurred vision.  Fatigue is not incapacitating, it just affects my stamina when walking or other cardiovascular activity.  Plus side, though, I have been virtually a-fib free for over a year.	F	67	6  years	9/25/2008
1	A-FIB	Tired, flu like symptoms, no sex drive, no appetite, weight gain. ringing in my ears, erectile disfunction	This drug ought to outlawed.  Once your on it,doctors wont listen to you about the side effects, and those who do, (I've had 5 cardiologists) tell you to get used to it.	M	48	1  years	7/18/2008Email
3	idiopathic vtach	tired,'buzzed' feeling, blurred vision, strained eyesight	my pill comes in 100mg. i was taking 2 pills a day. since the pill is not time released when it kicks in i definately feel it. i had to cut down to half a pill at a time. i couldn't function when the side effects set it. my eyelids got heavy. i would get tired. it was hard to focus on anything unless i was looking dead straight. if i looked up or to the side my eyes felt really strained and vision would be off. i would feel a little unbalanced. lights were brighter and left trails. i felt like i had too many drinks. even taking 4 half pills a day i still have the occasional extra beat and slight side effects but nothing that prevents me from a normal day. flecainide did help control the beats compared to what they were. i still hope to be off this pill some day.	F	28	7  months	7/16/2008Email
4	SVTs	No significant side effects noted until I stopped taking it--maybe some mild hair loss and irritated stomach.  You do have to be careful when having a dental procedure requiring anesthesia.  I seemed to develop tinnitus, pressure in the sinus area, low-grade headache, and mild dizziness more so when I discontinued taking Tambocor.  Of course, more premature heartbeats once I went off of it too.  I'm going to undergo an ablation, which is why I went off of Tambocor (can't take it for a few days leading up to the ablation).  I felt the medication did a great job of controlling the SVTs, but I just don't want to take it the rest of my life.	If your doctor suggests taking Tambocor, give it a try.  I felt a lot of relief from SVTs when taking this medication.	F	47	1.5  years	6/22/2008
5	PVC's, PAC's, palpitations	Insomnia, and mild hair loss (even though the doc says these are not side effects of this med, both of these started when I started taking flecainide)	I have been taking 125 mgs daily for about 6 months now. I tried other medications to stop the palpitations that were controlling my life, but the side effects were so bad I had to stop them. I have not experienced any of the awful side effects from the Flecainide and am only have 2-4 palipitations a week.	F	38	6  months	4/27/2008
4	wpw syndrome (tachycardia)	small decrease in energy (it helped my insomnia though), infrequent mild chest pains	I used to get migraines all the time and was expecting them to start up again when i started this drug but they didn't. I've noticed some decrease in my tachycardia episodes and have noticed no other major side effects that would discourage me from taking the drug. REMEMBER THAT THIS SITE IS BIASED! READING REVIEWS HERE SHOULD NOT DISCOURAGE YOU FROM TAKING A DRUG, JUST PREPARE YOU FOR THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS!	F	18	1  months	4/25/2008Email
4	tachycardia	I've been on tambocor for about six years. Experienced no real side effects for ages but now I am experiencing dizziness, headaches, a tight feeling around my head and feeling of pressure, plus I developed tinnitus in my ears about 3 years ago which I'm sure is a side effect, even though my doctor says not. My alternative is to have ablation on the extra electrical pathway in my heart, but havn't plucked up courage to have this yet, but I really don't want to be on this drug for the rest of my life, even though it has been great in stopping my attacks, I really feel prolonged use does cause side-effects.	I wonder if anyone else has experienced ringing in the ears or any of my other symptoms?	F	52	6  days	2/7/2008Email
3	Afib	I did not notice any side effects when I was on 50mg twice a day, but I am now taking 100mg twice daily and I experience a slight agitation/quiver in my body!	I was taking the 50mg twice daily and I was able to continue with my normal routine i.e. cycling, hiking & gym training. However, after about six months they lost their efficacy. For the past month I have been taking 100mg twice daily and I am beginning to get frequent short bursts of Afib whereby I experience a sensation in the centre of my chest, a rapid pulse rate and a feeling that I am going to pass out, but it only lasts for a few seconds. I can experience as many as 30 - 40 of these events per day.	M	56	8  months	12/28/2007
3	ventricular fibulations	dizzy, fatique, stomache ache.	Concern with long time useage effects.	M	68	3  months	8/21/2007Email
5	Non-sustained Ventricular Tach	none	Great Drug. Keeps my arrythmias in check and keeps me from passing out!	F	26	6  months	6/9/2007
5	PAF, PAC, PVC	Rarely I feel an intense muscular pain in my chest.  Very intense but short lived.	It has worked very well to control my rythymn problems.  However, I have to take 200 mg twice a day to get the full effect.  At a lower dose I have breakthrough PVCs,etc.  I am heavy 350 lbs so that might account for the need for a larger dose.  But it works great and I was on Corgard, Quinnidine, and finally Sotalol in the past.  The Sotalol was the pits.	M	57	3  years	5/22/2007Email
3	A-Fib	I was in A-Fib and started taking Tambocor.  It put me back in rhythm but am experiencing:  hot flashes; sweating, burning to the bottom of my feet; pins and needles sensations to the face and arms; tiredness; and lethargy.  I do not feel alert but foggy and out of sorts.	It does keep me in rhythm but dislike all the side effects.  I am going to ask my doctor to try something else.  I used to be on Amioderone but ceased due to similar side effects.	M	57	3  weeks	3/29/2007Email
2	pvc's and vtach	Intense headaches every time I took a pill, and I never get headaches.  Seems like it reduced the sensation of the palpitations but I still felt lightheaded and faint.		F	44	21  days	3/20/2007
5	Lone AF	Makes me a little tired, but manageable.  Nothing else.	It really works well to control Afib.  I was reluctant to go on this drug, but--bottom line--it really works.	M	50	2  years	3/8/2007
5	Arrythmia	None	I have been taking this for about 10 years now. I have tried several others and the side effects for all the others was very nasty. I have no known side effects and could function without it. Its been a life saver for me.	M	40	10  years	2/15/2007
1	Atrial Fibrillation after RF Ablati	Approximately 2 hours after being given three (3) tablets orally while in a recovery area following an RF Ablation Procedure, and experiencing Atrial Fibrillation (procedure didn't fix it), I experienced a 23 second cardiac arrest.  My heart restarted in sinus rhythm on its own.  Noone told me there was any danger in taking the drug.  I'll never take it again.		M	73	1  days	8/14/2005Email
1	ARRHYTHMIA	Head Tremors, more forceful arrhythmias, and lack of energy.	Just wondered if anyone has noticed any head tremors after taking Flecanide (Tambocor).  I have jerky head movements from the base of my neck.  I never had it before starting the medication for PAT.  I have gone through several brain MRIs and they show nothing that could cause the tremors. My arrhythmia seems worse after changing from Inderal, that I had been on for 25 years, to Flecanide along with Veramapil. The more forceful irregular heart beat interferes with my sleep, and I am tired all the time.	F	59	18  months	6/28/2005Email
