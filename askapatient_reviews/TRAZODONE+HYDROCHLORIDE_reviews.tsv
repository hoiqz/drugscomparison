3	insomnia	Hungover, tired next day. Actually put me to sleep last night. More but I don't know for sure	Got insomnia from Geo Don and other medication withdrawal. Trazodone seems to work after many months of no sleep	M	25	20  days50mg 1X D	7/19/2013Email
4	Depression and agitation	Weight gain - extreme appetite - dryness of mouth. Don't bother telling the psychiatrists about the weight gain - they'll only write down 'patient refuses to accept medication does not affect her weight.' But, once I halved the dosage, I lost 20 pounds.	Good for those who are depressed and agitated, but probably too sedating for those who are depressed and lethargic. It greatly reduced my insomnia, which was a godsend.	F	55	17  years150 1X D	3/9/2013
1	Insomnia/frequent waking	I had a SEVERELY horrible reaction. 30 mins after taking I began to feel dissociative and oddly impulsive. Despite this being a sleep med, I became extremely restless and decided to go for a drive (bad idea). I was so removed that my driving was very erratic. I made it back to my house, and began to feel more and more crazy, like I wasn't in my body. I heard voices telling me to kill myself. I was sweating profusely and shaking. Didn't sleep at ALL. These effects lasted at least five or six hours.	Never taking this again. I know of some people who have loved this med, but for some reason it made me go crazy!	F	22	1  days50 mg 1X D	10/19/2012
2	Inability to sleep	On 50mg but 1/2 dosage nightly. Loss of appetite. Waking up exhausted, sleep paralysis type symptoms- ankles, wrist all numb and like jello. Mentally I'm up but my body felt dead. Anger heightened, irritability, experienced. Got off of bc like two days of taking, hear rate increased (racing fast) and tremors. Was giving ambien (horrible experience). On clonazepam and can barely wake after over 10-12 hours of sleep.		F	28	2  weeks25mg	10/8/2012
3	Sleep-onset insomnia	Ear ringing, fatigue, feel like a zombie.	I've had sleep onset insomnia my entire life. This is the only thing that works to put me to sleep. Otherwise, it literally takes 3+ hrs to fall asleep .BUT I am wondering now if it's the cause of this weird brain fog feeling I have. All the time  all my brain wants to do is zone out and stare. I am only 24 and should not be feeling brain dead! It's uncontrollable and very distressing. Please email me if you are having a similar "zoning out" experience with this drug!!!

1	Insomnia	SINUS CONGESTION	How can you sleep when this medication causes, for some people, complete SINUS CONGESTION? I didnt have this problem when I took it years ago, then it snuck up on me, within 1 hours of traking Trazodone my Sinuses completely SWELLED SHUT like I had a terrible cause of Sinusitis. Is there any way to get around this sinus congestion? If you are predisposed already to nasal allergies and some nighttime nasal stuffiness, Trazodone probably will make it much worse. Any solutions anyone? Hard to sleep when you cant not breathe out of your nose at all!!!	F	32	1  months50 1X D	6/13/2012
1	Insomnia	I felt drunk, the first evening I took one. I felt groggy the next day & absent-minded. Didn't help with the insomnia either, instead of waking up at 4am, woke up at 5am, not much improvement there. Felt nauseous most of the time, had bouts of diahrrea & had strange metallic taste in my mouth.After a few days I  noticed oppression ( like when about to hyperventilate )  when breathing that made me irritable. I tried to though it out but nothing improved. On the 11th day decided to cut down to 25mg, not much changed so eventually I discontinued. Had the worst withdrawal side effects in my life, and in the past I had withdrawn from other AD without horrible side effects. The first two days of withdrawals were hellish - I had vertigo, felt restless, had constant nausea but unable to vomit, my heart was racing & was shaking like a leaf, I had debilitating headaches and backaches, felt like I was on the verge of a full blown panic attack. I tried to lie down but when I did, I f	This old AD should be discontinued as I believe there are surely better alternatives to this drug.	F	49	12  days50 MG 1X D	5/15/2012Email
4	restlessness, and could not sleep	I experienced no side effects, other then tonight. I did not get ir take my meds tonight ( trazadone and cipralex) due to my fm not putting them out for me and in return I cannot sleep. But, every other night when I take my 25mgs of trazadone with my other med i can sleep like a baby, with no interuptions in my sleep and wake up feeling refreshed and ready for the day. A lot of reviews i see on here are by people who have only taken them for 1 day - 2 weeks and id just like to say there are things you have to deal with when you are putting a new drug into your system. You need to allow your body time to adjust to the new chemicals or hormones and sometimes the first couple weeks are rough... but don't put the drug down if you really haven't given it a proper shot.		F	17	2  months25mg	4/5/2012
5	insomnia and nightmares	At first i felt off balance and groggy, had a bad taste in my mouth, but with time they went away. This medicine helps me sleep through the night and stopped my nightmares from PTSD.		F	41	6  years150 mg	3/11/2012
1	Insomnia	Severe sinus congestion and did not help insomnia.		F	44	1  days50mg	1/28/2012Email
1	Sleep	Did not work, plain and simple, believe it was the Pliva generic in particular and not trazodone per say	PLIVA trazodone did not work for sleep. Other generics worked fine for sleep in the past. This one does not or did not. Just wondering if anyone else has had this problem? What generic works for sleep?	F	31	5  days25 1X D	1/13/2012
3	Insomnia	Drying effect on mouth and membranes, sometimes very vivid dreams or nightmares. Can make you nauseous if taken without food.	Does anyone have a recommendation for an effective brand of generic desyrel (Trazodone) that will work for insomnia? I took this drug for years and it did work for sleep, but not without side effects. However, when I last tried it I got a generic made by PLIVA aka TEVA  pharma and it had the opposite effect on me! I see another poster said that Pliva Trazodone did not work for insomnia either, it seems like a totally different drug.  So, does anyone know what generic would work for insomnia? I believe the one I took years ago is off the market now (it had little divider marks in the pill to split it). The Pliva trazodone kept me awake and made me shakey, the one(s) I took before put me to sleep!	F	30	3  years50 1X D	12/27/2011
4	migraines	really the only side effects that I've experienced are the  "nightmares".they are very vivid and haunting when your in that  in-between zone of sleep & awake.	I was put on this med after being on two other anti-depressants for my migraines. they both worked..but, the ED factor came into play on both. then, came the chest pains.  Since being on Trazodone, no ED & no chest pains !	M	41	35  days50 1X D	11/6/2011Email
4	Anxiety/Insomnia	Nocturnal Erections	This stuff made me feel great and in a very short amount of time.Every time I woke, if I did wake, during the night I had an erection.Every morning I had an erection.It would go away using the traditional methods or after getting up in the morning. Doctor told me to stop using it because of priaprism risk.  If I could use it agian, I would.	M	47	5  days50 MG 1X D	10/1/2011
5	Depression / Insomnia	I haven't experienced any side effects. This drug cured  my insomnia. I usually would go to sleep and would wake up every 2 or 3 hrs. Taking trazadone let me sleep the whole night through. My only problem was when I ran out I went right back to the interrupted sleep cycle I experienced before taking it.		M	62	5  years75mg 1X D	7/29/2011Email
5	Sleep disturbances		I've been very happy with Trazodone.  I was prescribed it for sleep issues.. Mostly waking during the night.  I take one at night and my sleep is pretty good.  I've noticed no side effects and have had no reactions.	F	44	3  years50 mg 1X D	7/18/2011
1	Insomnia	Tremor, awkward movement, dizziness, dry mouth, lost words, unable to focus.	The doctor prescribed this for insomnia.  This is one drug that I have had every bad side effect a person could have.  After an MRI to determine what could be the cause of the tremors, I figured out on my own that it was probably this drug.  I feel silly for not connecting the two, but I have a lot of pain with RA, and initially I assumed the side effects were a flare-up.  I know everyone will react differently to meds so I'm not warning anyone away.  I just think there has to be drugs out there that don't have all these side effects.  I have stopped taking this and it's been about a week.  The tremors are better, but not yet fully subsided.	F	40	3  months50 1X D	7/11/2011Email
3	Insomnia	Initially panic/anxiety, severe ringing in the ears; now only have mild ringing in the ears and mild occassional headaches and inability to orgasm	I have not experienced any weight gain or hair loss like others have reported. I did not get any real relief from my insomnia until I gave it a couple weeks and now it works okay (not great, but not scary like ambien).	F	46	2  months100-200 mg 1X AN	5/20/2011Email
3	Anxiety, insomnia	None that I know of	I am able to go to sleep but not stay asleep. Sometimes Desyrel helps but often it does not. I take it around 9:30 for a 10 pm bed time. Of course waking up early doesn't help with anxiety only adds to it for me. From what I have read here I may ask the doctor to increase the dosage to 75 MG to see if that will carry me through the night. I will deal with morning drowsiness if I have too,	M	61	2  weeks50 MG 1X D	5/4/2011Email
1	Insomnia (one night)	Repeated falls, horrible nightmares, grogginess all day long, inability to carry on a conversation.	I was prescribed this after one rough night during a month-long hospitalization. For the first four or five days I had bad, lucid nightmares (and I *never* have nightmares), then I had trouble walking, especially to use the bathroom at night. After two bad falls, I had to have x-rays to evaluate the injury. Also, I felt groggy and "slow" in conversation even late in the day, when medicine should have worn off. Not recommended, especially for a sleeping problem that isn't ongoing.	F	75	10  days50 mg 1X D	4/28/2011
1	insomnia	severe congestion, severe constipation, blurred vision, diminished ability to orgasm , dry mouth.	Trazadone did help me sleep. At first I thought it was wonderful. It took 2 months for me to relaize that the new problems I was experiencing were related to the drug.  I've been off of trazadone for over 1 month now. The congestion  and blurred vision totally cleared up.  I'm still having problems with constipation.  I'm 41 years old and never had a problem having orgasms.  I almost lost the ability all together while on this drug. I know it sounds crazy but I have no doubt it was from the trazadone. Luckily, that is totally back to normal now.

1		Made me a zoombie. awful nightmares. constipation.	will stop taking immediately. ambien was better than this!	F	63	3  days50mg 1X D	4/8/2011
5	Lifelong insomnia	Hair went from fine, to coarse. My legs were extremely uncomfortable, and, my sleep was just as awful as ever, until about the 2 week mark.	After taking this for 2 weeks, my life improved immensely.Sleep was a guaranteed 6hrs, sometimes, 8 or 9. I did have to give med time to work. It also lowered my blood pressure, I was a 200/100 person taking BP meds,now my pressure is perfect, and I take no BP meds!! That in turn, improved my sex life. Wonderful med for me.	F	44	4  months100 mg 1X D	3/23/2011
1	Insomnia	Although trazodone helped me sleep, the negative side effects out-weighed the benefits by far.  I do not recommend this medication	I loved this medication for the longest time --but this was before I made the connection to all of these side effects:1. Weight gain (gained 50 pounds over the year I was taking it. Have lost 30 in the last 6 months of being off of it!)  2. CHRONIC constipation. (I was considering getting a colonoscopy to check for cancer --I'm only 25)  3. Swelling/Water retention (my sister -who is a nurse- used to say I looked as puffy as her edema patients)I cannot believe how long it took me to connect these symptoms with this medication but I feel like a new person since stopping it.	F	25	1  years150mg 1X D	2/7/2011Email
3	Can't fall asleep	Nightmares, vivid realistic dreams.	It makes me fall asleep fast otherwise I would lie awake for hours. However, the horrible vivid dreams are freaking me out and I'm debating going off this. i just hope I'm not addicted!	F	51	3  months15mg 1X D	2/3/2011

4	Insomnia 1978 to 2011	I took this medication in 2006.  I was a miracle at first to go to bed for the first time in my life and sleep the whole night through.   In time it didnt help any longer, so I would take more and more every night to help me sleep.  I decided it wasnt helping me any longer, so I tapered down for about 6 months until I quit taking it.  (long story with doctor and Walgreens insert here).  My hair has become 50% thinner and is slowly coming back and I have sinus problems now on a daily basis.  I thought these two symptoms might be from my job.  (Stress and environment). I would recommend taking the written prescription with you and doing your own research on every medication before filling it or consuming it. Its amazing what you will read on the fine print.

1	insomnia	THIS IS NOT GOOD SLEEP MEDICATION IT IS KILLER MEDICATION USED TO KILL PEOPLE HOW CANNOT SLEEP BECAUSE THEIR BRAIN IS TOO DAMAGED.	Trazodone has nasty side-effects so it is only useful as really **short-term** treatment for sleep. Enough said?If you have mild insomnia NEVER start.If you have used for longer time periods DONT stop.	M	20	564  years100 1X D	1/10/2011
1	bi-polar insomnia	Had a major mental and physical freak out	very soon after taking just 1 50mg pill I had major cardio vascular issues. Felt like I was choking, suffocating, I had to purposely watch my breathing, kept feeling on the verge of fainting. Could not walk straight, was very weak and my body temperature dropped - I was shivering. I took some benadryl to counteract and calm down. Trazodone is a horrible "medication". My wonderful condescending doctor told me this was such a mild and safe option that would definitely help me sleep. Definitely the opposite. I think after trying so many meds I will pick up jogging everyday instead and do it right.	F	40	1  days50mg 1X D	1/9/2011
5	Depression with anxiety.	I did notice hair thining after the 7years of using deyrel. Also,sinus congestion in the mornings.	It does get you to sleep at night,however its very difficult to get up in the mornings. That is why I work nights now.I think the other medications available for depression cause a hipnotic state of sleep. But with desyrel you experience all the stages of sleep through-out the night. I also take klonopin with the desyrel everynight. Desyrel also cause increase heart rate.At the begining of using desyrel I only took 75mg. Had to work-up to 150 due to anxiety.

4	Sleep problems from depression	Hair loss, zombied out	I've always had plenty of hair, and now, after 2 years of constant use, it has begun thinning markedly; At least 3 or 4 times as much hair as normal comes out with each shower. A friend who also takes trazodone said when she doubled her dose (from 50 to 100 mg) she, too, noticed hair loss.  I'm now tapering and will try to stop and use it only when I really, really need to.

1	Insomnia/Depression	Weight gain, An ill feeling, feel worse then when I started 2 weeks ago ... and try to stop taking this garbage, even after 2 weeks your body will crave this SHIT	It helped with the sleep but the side effects are not worth the cure.   Do Not Take This Drug ....	M	60	2  weeks50 mg. 1X D	11/27/2010
3	Insomnia due to severe back pain	I developed pustular psoriasis on both my feet because of this drug. SEVERE pustular psoriasis. I went to the dermatologist and took every drug known to man to aleviate it.  It only subsided when I stopped taking the trazdone.	I was taking 200 mg Soma in addition to the Traz to help me sleep. It was effective but the side effect of the psoriasis was unacceptable.	M	52	6  months30 mg 1X D	11/13/2010Email

Other sleep meds. have same side effect.	Does help falling asleep approximately 30min after taking it. Helps stay asleep for 6-8 hours.	M	56	8  years50 mg 1X D	10/18/2010
2	Insomnia	No side effects	It just didn't work.  I am only getting 3-4 hours of sleep a night, and the trazodone didn't help at all.  Useless drug for me.  Might help other people.	F	50	14  days100mg 1X D	10/16/2010
4	Insomnia	I have taken this for at least 4 years during the last two years I have noticed I have had foot and ankle swelling and some blood vessels showing up there.  I also take Ropinirol and Gabapentin for Restless leg and Prilosec for Reflux (GERD) I am thinking this condition might be related to my Trazodone but am not sure.	I once tried to go off Desyrel but found as soon as I cut back i could not sleep and felt nervous.  So I am now going to discontinue Desyrel by cutting back over 8 weeks I have divided the pills into quarters and every two weeks decrease it by 1/4  and the last two weeks I plan on just taking the 1/4 tab every other day.  So far this seem t0 be working I have just started my 1/4 tab and am still sleeping.  I have discussed this with MD and likes this rate of stopping.	M	56	4  years50 1X D	9/19/2010Email
1	Insomnia	The first time I took it about 15 minutes later I had an overwhelming fear that I was not going to wake up.  I even called my husband at work and told him to come home and check on me on his break.  I went to sleep quickly and had horrible nightmares and kept waking up gasping for air but I couldn't hold my eyes open.  I finally somehow forced myself to get up and go get in a cool shower trying to calm down and I had a full blown panic attack and for some reason kept thinking I was going to suffocate (when I was breathing just fine).  My husband did come home and said I was wild eyed.  I called the doc and he said I had to take it for a week and I would adjust to the medication slowly.  I took his word for it and regretted it.  The symptoms stayed generally the same but the last night I took it I was unable to sleep even though I was so drunk and sleepy I could barely hold my head up.  I was too paranoid and was sure I was going to stop breathing.  I was hallucinating while awake and h	I think there are better options for insomnia and would not recommend this medication to anyone.  I've heard only bad things about it as well and I've made sure to tell anyone that would listen not to take this.  I even made my doctor mad when I refused to take it anymore.  He wouldn't prescribe anything else for me for insomnia!	F	31	3  days? 1X D	9/17/2010
3	Insomnia, Depression	NAUSEA NAUSEA NAUSEA, vomiting, diarreah, groginess.	I am sure Trazodone helps SOME people because I took it as a child and had little to no side effects. (At a much lower dose). When I started taking it again, I went from 50 mg to 100 mg in a few days.  Once I switched to 100 mg everything went downhill. EXTREME NAUSEA and vomiting each and every morning. Groginess throughout the day was frustrating, but the groginess in the A.M. was the worst. Took me nearly 2-3 hours before I even felt slightly awake and functionable. If you have a weak stomach I would advise you to stay away from this drug.  But if you can hanedle the nausea you might be alright. 50 mg didn't help me sleep at all. 100 mg helped better, but for me, the side effects were not worth it.  Everyone responds differently however so I would suggest at least trying it if you need help with sleeping. Good luck!	F	27	2  weeks100 mg 1X D	9/14/2010
1	severe insomnia	While on a course of Amoxicillin, my doctor prescribed the trazodone because I had severe insomnia.  I took only 50 mg at 9:00 pm.  At first, I felt this weird "rush" coming over my body, and it went away.  At midnight, I started to feel really out of it, and mad.  Then, at 1:00 am I was stark raving mad; an absolute lunatic who wanted to commit suicide.I DID sleep, but the next day all day, I was very exhausted, and I was a zombie.	Well, I think that it looks like Tom Cruise is right on this one.   Don't f with head meds.Too high of a price.	F	41	1  times50 1X D	9/5/2010Email
1	Depression, Anxiety	Congestion, drowsiness, hypotension, dizziness, sedation, cognitive impairment, memory loss	A useless anxiolytic and antidepressant, unless you consider sleeping 16 hours a day therapeutic. I can see the merit of a low dose PM for SERIOUS insomnia but anything higher than 75mg will turn you into a zombie based on my experience - and I'm about as easy to sedate as an elephant.

3	Depression, anxiety	Brain-fog, shortness of breath, drowsiness, some muscle pain	Noticed some improvement in symptoms in the first week but therapeutic benefit seems to have levelled off, with only partial remission of symptoms.

2	Sleep difficulties	At first, just a horrible taste in my mouth in the morning.  Now, I'm having trouble falling asleep when my initial problem was staying asleep. Horrible leg cramps woke me three times this week.  I will stop taking this drug.	After taking Ativan for 8 years because I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep, my (new) doctor decided Ativan was no good, refused to give me a prescription for it, and wanted me to switch to Trazodone.  I am not happy - and I've been assigned a new doctor, who I hope will agree with me that Ativan is the drug or choice.	F	63	1.5  months100 1X D	8/6/2010
1	Depression and insomnia	nose a bit stuffy (not bothersome)unwanted erectionsdizziness/off-balance feeling the whole next dayseizure when i missed a dose 1 night	Was added to my daily dose of Prozac (which I have taken for years) after new stressors in my life caused insomnia.  I read it was very commonly prescribed (an older drug), non-addictive, fairly safe to try.  I took 50mg each night for 1 month.  It put me to sleep but the whole next day I would have the hang-over effect which totally interfered with my functioning. So I decided to stop it and not get a refill.  The next day I was a mess with high anxiety/panic/headaches (which I did not have before taking it).  I went to get the 1 refill I had available and I took half a pill (25mg) for 7 days and then stopped.  More than a week after I am still feeling off-balance and having terrible anxiety all day.  To top it all off I am finding it impossible to sleep at night which is MUCH worse than my original insomnia.  I wish I never took this damn drug to begin with...and I only took 30 full pills.  This led me to do more research on the web.  I found that prozac increases the plasma levels of trazodone (it inhibits a liver enzyme that breaks it down) .  Also traz works much differently at low dose (50mg) and higher doses(eg 300mg) and those on lower doses have more trouble getting off it.  And I have read countless withdrawal horrors and how people are tempted to keep taking it to avoid these awful symptoms.  I made a BIG mistake taking it - very nasty drug.	M	40	37  days50mg 1X D	7/18/2010Email

5	Insomnia for 9 years	I had insomnia for years after working night shift. I had finally switched to day shift and my normal cocktail of Benadryl, melatonin, ambien, and Xanax were no longer working. After not sleeping for 5 days straight I finally got put on trazodone. With the first couple of doses I did feel like I was short of breath with a racing pulse. I also had and still do have increased thirst. I am finally able to sleep! I now get 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep every night. I feel amazing and I feel that this medicine has given me my life back!!!		F	30	2  months100mg	5/12/2013
4	Insomina & Anxiety	No side effects.	This drug has been a miracle drug for me. I fall asleep quickly and the am less anxious overall. Nonetheless, I am considering discontinuing trazodone. In Dec 2012 I started to have some GI issues (not related to trazodone) and my doctor asked me to have a CAT scan. Results show that I now have a fatty liver (it was normal a year before). My liver enzymes are NOT elevated, so my doctor is not concerned. He says fatty liver is very common among Hispanics (I am Cuban American) and not to worry.  I have read reports about trazodone and liver toxicity and wonder if anyone else has been diagnosed with fatty liver. My brother has been on trazodone for over 20 years and also has a fatty liver (and is diabetic). Anyone believe trazodone can cause liver toxicity?	F	47	2  years.25 - .50 1X D	4/21/2013Email
3	Insomnia	None	I was prescribed Trazodone after dealing with a bout of insomnia that required some medical attention. The first few months of taking it, it did help me fall asleep faster, but I am not convinced it was just the medication. I think some of it could have been psychological. It never made me feel overly sedated and I could stay up for hours after taking it if I wanted to. A month ago, I decided I would try to stop using it since I debated whether it actually did much of anything, and I quit cold turkey. Do not ever do this. The second night without it, I had what I can only describe as severe panic attacks and sweating, nausea, shakes, etc. I quickly realized it was withdrawal. All the literature I'd read on it said it should not be this severe. Well, it was. I also did not sleep for four days and would sweat profusely throughout the day. I finally gave in on the fifth day and took it at night and slept for 12 hours. I know to wean off it slowly next time (but for now I am just going to keep taking it).

3	Insomnia	I was prescribed to this for insomnia... after taking 50mg at night, I was so dizzy the next mornings and it dragged on to the afternoon. I couldn't maintain my normal work-out routine without giving up in the middle of it because I was mentally and physically drained for no reason.	The biggest difference in me is my loss of appetite. I usually eat everything in sight but now I'm only eating about 1000 cals a day which is causing me to be even more dizzy. I am going to start cutting the pills in half to see if this helps.

5		I requested this because after years on Ambien, then Ambien CR the past 2 years, I wanted something that would not need to be increased due to tolerance, and did not WANT to take Ambien for the addictive reasons which I've had.  I do get a stuffy nose, and dry mouth, red eyes, and have the detailed dreams, but once I wake up and have my first cup of coffee, I do feel better!  I definitely helps me sleep better than the Ambien did-although Ambien helped me "fall asleep" faster.  My eye doctor put me on Restasis eye drops for the redness (he said he HAD heard of the redness from the Traz) and it helps a little.  All in all I can live with these symptoms knowing that the alternative (and I literally have pretty much tried EVERyTHING for insomnia) is not something I want to live with!  I feel "free" for the first time in years not being a slave to Ambien!!!	My Dr told me I could take 1/2 (25 MG) up to 2 (100 MG).  The 100 mg dose cused worse dreams-so I cut it back to 75, then 50 and even cut a tablet so I was taking 3/4 of a 50 mg tablet.  I get sleep with the smaller dose, and my dreams are not as bad.  Best of all, I tell myself in the morning that I DID sleep obviously because I had dreams!   That really helps me mentally to know I got sleep--which I will take over not sleeping at all any day!!!

3	Insomnia	None	My doctor prescribed this for insomnia and while I guess it helped somewhat, it wasn't something I'd rave about, either. I thought it was the dosage, as 50 MG seems like a small amount and my sister used to take 300 MG for her insomnia. The good news is that I had no side effects. Eventually, due to its lack of effectiveness on me, I asked my doctor to switch me to something with a bit more "kick" and he put me on another medication. Maybe it would have worked better at a higher dosage.	M	27	5  months50 MG 1X D	9/13/2012Email
1	insomnia	I guess what i had would be called a paradoxical effect.  Four hours later I  was wide awake an slightly agitated ( though not a panic attack). The only way I got to sleep ( after taking 1 mg melatonin to add to the Trazadone) was to take 0.5 mg Ativan, which I had successfully tapered from and gotten off  7 weeks earlier.	I know many people who swear by Trazadone.  There really are individual differences.  I had tried this drug a few years ago ( for 3 weeks with varying doses  up to 100 mg) with equally horrible results but thought I'd give it another try.	F	72	1  days50 mg 1X D	9/13/2012

2	Insomnia	Increased libido, arrousal, and erections during the morning after. Loss of orgasm. Frequent sleep paralysis, night terrors, death like panic attacks.	Although my libido and such increased, I was unable to orgasm through manual stimulation or sex with my wife. She complained that my penis was harder then usual when engaging in sex, I had noticed this as well and it became uncomfortable for the both of us. The frequency of sleep paralysis and night terrors was negating the effects of falling asleep and soundly. I have had sleep paralysis since I was a kid and this really took it to the edge. Ever have a conversation with the devil, with him asking you to turn around and look at him? It's an awful state to be in, body is dead, but the mind is working wonders with your imagination, and the thought of death coming over you as one of them. Needless to say, I gave it a chance but it was to much to handle. I am now on low dose (5MG) Lunesta and sleeping soundly!	M	29	2  weeks50 MG 1X D	8/7/2012Email

I was in a holding room in a the ER walk-in area & it was COLD. The night nurse gave me Trazodone; it only made my head throb (tho not ache); the nurse said it might help my IBS pain too...well it didn't & I still cldnt sleep until she broke down & gave me Ativan (yay!)I will say this for trazodone: at least it didn't drive me nuts like paxil or zomb me out like remeron; it was merely ineffective.

Only takes a half hour to go to sleep versus well over an hour. Only wake 1-2 times and can fall back asleep more easily. Also, find more clarity of thought in the daytime hours. This is life changing for me...........difficulty getting to sleep and would wake 3-4 times a night with great difficulty in falling back asleep.

3	Insomnia	Dry mouth, congestion and sometimes crazy dreams or nightmares, sometimes nausea, and a few other things. Oh, sometimes made me sleepy very, very quickly!  Different generics though had way different side effects, see my additional comments	Ok, PLIVA generic trazodone acted totally different for me than all the other generic trazodones I took in the past. Pliva trazodone acted more like a stimulating anti-depressant and kept me awake, instead of a sedating anti-depressant used for sleep which is the main use for trazodone. I think Pliva may be the same as Teva, I am not sure......but I am looking for a generic manufacturer that makes a trazodone that is actually sedating. I wish I knew what ones I took years ago that worked for sleep. Anyone have any input?	F	30	3  years50 1X D	12/30/2011
1	Insomnia	Severe Allergic Reaction that started with a stuffy nose and progressed to hives, reddened skin, increased pulse rate, increased blood pressure and a major crisis which required medical intervention. The first time I took the medicine, I noticed my pulse rate increasing. I decided that maybe I took it too long before going to bed. The 2nd time I took it, my nasal passages immediately closed up, and I got up and took a dose of Benadryl so that I could breathe. By that evening, I had raised lesions on my thighs and my entire trunk was becoming red and hot. I contacted a dermatologist online who instructed me to stop the Trazadone, as I had experienced a severe drug reaction. My attending physician did a follow-up and confirmed the same. It has been 2 weeks, and my skin is now peeling, but not fully healed.		F	56	2  days50mg 1X D	10/25/2011Email

Before, it would take me over an hour to fall asleep, and now I'm out like a light in half an hour.  On the down side, I can't take it if I'm going to be getting less than six hours of sleep, otherwise I won't be able to wake up as fast, and often I'll fall right back asleep and not remember conversations.  Otherwise, it's fantastic!	F	20	5  months150 1X D	5/20/2011

1	Insomnia		I loved this medication for the longest time --but this was before I made the connection to all of these side effects:1. Weight gain (gained 50 pounds over the year I was taking it. Have lost 30 in the last 6 months of being off of it!)  2. CHRONIC constipation. (I was considering getting a colonoscopy to check for cancer --I'm only 25)  3. Swelling/Water retention (my sister -who is a nurse- used to say I looked as puffy as her edema patients)I cannot believe how long it took me to connect these symptoms with this medication but I feel like a new person since stopping it.	F	25	1  years150 MG 1X D	2/7/2011Email
4	Depression	This medication certainly isn't without side effects (but it's been said that any medication that does not have side effects, likely will not work)! Here we go: dry mouth, sedation, improved quality of sleep, constipation, increased appetite, feeling out of it all the next day, increased libido, increased frequency and quality of erections and ability to reach orgasm (no complaints about that one), dry eyes and occasional minor visual disturbances.  As with most medications, the side effects are most noticeable at first and when the dose is increased.  The good news is that if you take it easy and go up relatively slowly, most of these side effects will diminish with the passage of time (although I'm still going up to a max of 600 so I will likely have to deal with them for a while longer every time I increase the dose).	I'm writing this primarily for those that might be researching this drug and are just starting or are considering trying it for depression related conditions.  I asked my doctor to consider it since through my reasearch I learned that it was related to Nefazodone (which I did very well on for years before it was pulled from the Canadian market).  This drug is classified as an SARI (serotonin antagonist reuptake inhibitor), which is to say that it is both a serotonin antagonist (a lower doses) and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor at high enough doses.  This makes the way it works different from any other available antidepressant (except for Nefazadone, which is essentially an improved version of Trazodone that is still available generically in the States (wish it was available in Canada).  It's brand name (Serzone) was discontinued after several less than convicing reports of liver failures requiring transplants ( the risk is something like 1 in 250 000 and I would take it again in a heartbeat). Some of the advantages of Trazodone over much more popular drugs such a Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor ect... are that it actuall has no detrimental effect on the quality of sleep (something which the SSRI's and SNRI's definetly mess with).  It has a strong calming feeling so it could be good for certain people who struggle with anxiety and have trouble sleeping (it is not addictive or habit forming).  Most importantly for me anyway, it has considerably less sexual side effects as compared to m	M	42	5  weeks400mgs 1X D	1/21/2011

3	Insomnia, Depression.	Dependent, dizzy, very vivid nightmares.	This drug deffinently does help me fall asleep, but almost every night I have an extremely vivid nightmare that leaves me in a bad mood the next day. I stopped cold turkey for 2 days and didn't have any nightmares...because I didn't sleep. I was rolling around all night trying to get comfortable and it just seemed impossible to fall asleep. I feel very dependent and it's kind of scary, But I am satisfied with how well it puts you to sleep. It really knocks me right out and I usually feel refreshed every morning and not tired during the day.	F	18	11  months50mg 1X D	7/25/2010
2	Insomnia	It left me very, very relaxed which in many people would put them to sleep, but not me.  It causes night sweats, which I never get when I sleep.  Left me extremely sluggish all day the next day.	I was prescribed 50mg for insomnia in attempt to get me off of Ambien 10mg at my request.  I also tried Vistaril for sleep, but it was like taking Benadryl and didn't do anything.  So needless to say, I'm back on good old Ambien again.	F	25	 50mg 1X D	7/13/2010

I agree with whomever wrote that you need to go to bed within one hour of taking it, though.  After that, the effects seem to wear off, and it becomes more difficult to go to sleep.

Been taking Prozac and Trazodone for 12 years and never had this reaction before. Lowered the dose to about 1/4 pill, kept lowering the Prozac, finally had to go off both because I needed them both for either to work. The combination was completely unworkable, I felt like garbage. HOWEVER!!!! The debilitating fibromyalgia I've had disappeared with hardly a trace. I switched to a tricyclic (Watson nortriptyline) and the relief continues.	Pliva Trazodone is apparently a whole new drug, and acts entirely different from each of the other generic Trazodone brands I used in the past.	F	58	12  years	11/9/2009

If I don't get to bed within an hour of taking the 50mg pill I pass out on the couch. I'm still trying to train myself to get to bed by 11pm or midnight but I have a lifetime of anxiety around trying to fall asleep and failing. I also have a CPAP machine for sleep apnea that was added just after I started the Trazodone. I wake up several times during the night still and I don't know why.	M	39	2  months	9/24/2009

As a formerly heavy drinker, this doesn't bother me one bit--tho it would be nice to enjoy a glass of wine once in awhile. Can't do it anymore! Any alcohol causes splitting headache and indigestion.

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
