2		People please read this, My pop who lives with me the last 5 years, was diagnosed with parksion's, he allegedly now has mild dementia, well people pay attention some drugs such as carbidopa can cause dementia like symptoms, pay attention due your homework!  Anyhow, he was on 5 mg of aricept for 30 days which he was fine on 10mg he became angry hositle yelling which never was his temperment..  SO I knocked it back down to 5mg he became worse, more frequent episodes with aggression.  SO I stopped the drug.  We shall see.. It's not a ""ONE SIZE FITS ALL""    Some of his current meds can cause dementia like symptoms..  Please people read read read make sure you know your loved one's med's not just what they treat, but more importantly what Underlying symptoms they may cause....  This is a prime example. No wonder there  is a stagering alarming amount of seniors in nursing homes..

1	short term memory loss	My daddy just past away last week. He went to the hospital for malnutrition and dehydration and ended up w other problems like fluid in his lungs and heart. We didn't know at the time because I swore he would never b on dementia meds. Again. Doctors prescribed it again and he had delirium for 5 days not sleeping 24/7 then we found out they put him on it again. He slept and women up normal. But there is a malpractice case due to numerous mistakes being made. In a nut shell. My dad would have never stopped eating and walking if it weren't for this drug.		M	61	3  weeks5 mg	8/10/2012
2	Dementia or Alzheimer's	My husband was prescribed Aricept probably five years ago.  He has had garbled speech, many times unable to complete a thought or sentence.  He has had extreme stomach pains on occasions.  Told his primary care physician about this, and she didn't seem to know the cause.  After reading comments on here, am wondering if it is caused by the Aricept.  He would sit at times and just stare at the floor (or nothing). If he knew someone was coming to visit (even family members), he would say he would leave because he didn't know them.  His appetite has dwindled, especially at home, although he eats well most of the time when we eat out.  He has become irrational and has told me that some men had told him some things about me, like I was out partying or even worse, and he would ask me if I was.  Always wanting to go "home to Buffalo," even started for the door one night to go, even said he would walk there.  We live in Indiana.

1	poor short term memory,	This drug was prescribed to my 83 year old mother. We did not know that she was suffering from dimentia caused by slight strokes. The medicine caused her to loose control of her bowel and her apathy and ability to comunicate declined. She died of a heart attack 6 months after starting this drug. Very sudden death and we did know she had heart problems. She had begun seeing a geriatric speacilist who prescribed this medicine.	This is a very dangerous drug. I would rather know mama died of natural causes but I know this drug causes heart attacks in people with vascular dimentia. I would rather be safe than sorry. People want to beleive it works but it doesn't from my experience and many other people as well. I think this drug hurt my mother and hastened her death.	F	83	6  months10 1X D	3/3/2012Email

2	Brain atrophy and dementia	Panic attacks, delusions, confusion, anger and being irrational	My 76 year old mother was on 5 mg Aricept for a few years and at first seemed ok but I didn't notice that it helped her memory much. Dr. recommended upping it to 10mg. After 8 months or so my sweet docile mother began to become angry and irrational. She was always mean and hateful to me (her only daughter and caregiver).  Everyone around us noticed the change. Some were very concerned since she would become very hostile. I took her off of it after reading some of these side affects.  She became her sweet self again but I worried about her memory loss so I spoke w/her Dr who said maybe 10 mg was too much and go back to 5 mg again. Well after 3 months on 5 mg she is becoming worse than before.  She threatens to hit me and yells at me constantly. Accuses me of lying to her and scheming but can never explain why - just says you know what you did. There is no talking to her when she is in this state. She has spells where she thinks I am her sister and she is living at the home where she was a young adult. I cannot convince her otherwise and trying to tell her different makes her very upset.  the spells only last a short time then she remembers me again.  Dr. still insists Aricept shouldn't do that but has agreed to try something else if I want.  I took her off the Aricept yesterday and we will see if the behavior improves again.  I hope the Aricept hasn't done any permanent damage.  Afraid to try any of the other memory drugs for fear of more side effects. I will check this site t	F	76	3  years5mg 1X D	1/31/2012Email

2	Memory loss	High blood pressure, Saying nasty comments to faily members, Complaints about cramps / pains in legs, Extremely tired and sleeping alot, Would rather sit in an empty room on his own when family/friends are all gathered together in another room. Anti social - not wanting to leave the house or if he does cannot wait to get home (mainly to go to bed) Anxious and panicky, Depressed	I am writing this on behalf of my dad who is 73 years old. His short term memory started to deteriorate.  4 months ago our GP prescribed 5MG Aricept.  Dad started sleeping alot more, like to be on his own, very withdrawn, personality changed and shuffles around very slowly, happy to sit in a different room to everyone else either sleeping or just staring at the wall. His concentration is very bad and if he is part of a conversation he hears completely different things to what is being said. He's had a sudden drop in weight loss (although good appetite).  He went to a memory clinic 4 weeks ago, Aricept was increased to 10MG.  I really think this caused further disastrous side effects. My dad is now sleeping so much it is unhealthy. He's had arguments with my mum calling her names (totally not like him) and giving her an ultimatum to leave him alone or she can leave the house.  My mum feels scared of him for the first time ever. I searched for side effects from Aricept am so shocked to see the stories from others on the website and I could relate so many of these side effects to my dad. I am going to make sure that my dad goes back to 5MG Aricept and then stop it completely. I feel like we are losing our dad very quickly (more so since the increase). I hope that once he stops the Aricept we will get our dad back.	M	73	4  months10 MG 1X D	11/8/2011Email
1	Parkinson's dementia	My 92-year-old mom had Parkinson's dementia and we started her on 5 mg of Aricept, which helped a bit (she talked a lot more, anyway). After a month we increased her to 10 mg and she immediately began having GRAND MAL SEIZURES (8 in 12 hours) and had to go to the hospital to get them under control (because IV anti-seizure drugs would work much more quickly than oral drugs). Long story short, she died 2 weeks later. 	DO NOT overlook the less common side-effects of this drug. MY MOM DIED because it caused seizures. She had never had a seizure in her life.	F	92	6  weeks5 and 10 m 1X D	10/24/2011Email
1	Dementia/Alzheimer's	My mother-in-law was prescribed this medicine for dementia/alzheimer's disease.  She ended up with out-of-control, chronic diarrhea.  This resulted in dehydration and severe, rapid weightloss.  Because she was also unable to deal with her bathroom issues herself, the diarrhea caused numerous serious infections and also resulted in the breakdown of skin tissue on her bottom which caused an ongoing burning sensation.  All of this resulted in multiple hospital trips.	This medicine in no way improved her memory.  In fact, when we knew that the end was growing nearer, we stopped giving her the medicine and she was then able to recall everyone's name, most of her personal information, etc.  She was not able to do this while taking this medicine.

5	Alzheimer's Disease	No side effects. Also taking 10mg of Namenda twice daily.	My mother who was diagnosed in 2006, has been on Aricept and Namenda and it is not the medication it is the disease which causes the aggressiveness. My mother had no side effects until 2011 and I was told it was the disease progressing. The medication has "bought" my mother and our family several years of valuable time together. We are just now beginning to see this mean disease begin to progress. When we saw the aggressive behavior begin, we placed Mom on Abilify. I know, it has side effects and a black box warning that it can cause death in the elderly. My doctor explained that there are two age groups of studies done on this medication. One is that of young people approximately 25 to 35 and an other one done on older adults, thus causing more side effects due to heart and health issues. My mother has done very well on this med and the aggressive behavior is completely gone. She takes it with nightly medications. I guess I am wondering if the aricapt and namenda will keep her in this "limbo" stage for years or should we expect it to progress soon? It sounds like every individual who has been diagnosed with AD progresses at different rates even if they take these meds which slow down the disease.	F	78	5  years10mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
5	memory loss & concentration	I am 76 years old.  I began the30 day sample of this medicine about two weeks ago.  I didn't think this med could work so fast until I read comments in this site.  Within a week I found my memory retention was inproving and I had no ill side effects. I figured that if the bad side effects could be evident within 1 day that my week of good effects could certainly be possible.  I have always had a gift for remembering numbers.  About a year or two ago I felt angry at the loss of this skill. Hooray!   It's back!  I hope now to regain conversational skills so I don't lose my way or get off track with the slightest sidetrack.	It appears to be better for early memory loss than for fully diagnosed Alz.  I worked with Alzheimers residents for years and have seen the cost to the family. I have known about Aricept for years. I never believed that I would be taking it!	F	76	11  days5 MG 1X D	5/19/2011
1	Frontal Temporal Lobe Dementia	Still trying to figure out what exactly this medication is helping with. My mom is 60 started taking this poison about 3 years ago, immediately noticed an increase in hallucinations and agressive behaviors, anorexia, tremors, etc. Mom has been in a nursing home the last 6 months and her disease has made her decline rapidly. These medications are A HUGE EXPENSE, my family would like her off of them but each time it is brought up we are guilted into continuing them, "you don't know what they are preventing" It has not been my experience that this medication has helped with anything.

3	cognitive decline	I am a counselor and work with elderly adults who take Aricept on a weekly basis.  I work with one gentleman who was having some behavioral difficulties while taking it.  He also had behavioral difficulties before taking it.  His physician held his Aricept for 7 days and behavior improved.  It was therefore discontinued.	It's important to consider that this man also began eating more (adequate amounts) during this time, per his wife's report.  This may have been a confounding factor.  Furthermore, I've talked to family members who are dissatisfied that Aricept does not improve memory/cognitive status.  Current research however, indicates Aricept does NOT normally improve memory performance.  Aricept DOES, however, delay the advancement of cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer's Dementia and some other forms of dementia.  I have been told overwhelmingly that while family members don't notice Aricept IMPROVING cognitive performance, they DO notice that their loved ones decline much quicker once they discontinue use of Aricept.  This makes sense, because it is very consistent with current research findings.  It's also important to know that physicians don't always tell patients about behavioral side effects of Aricept because they are pretty unusual.  In most cases I've seen, benefits outweigh the side effects experienced from Aricept use.  It's also important to note that people who are offering things like Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, and/or Ativan for depressed mood are offering the wrong medicine for the wrong symptom.  Xanax and the others are called benzodiazapines and are primarily intended for treatment of anxiety (nervousness), not depression.  They can also make people groggy and elderly people are more sensitive to medications in general.  If your loved one is taking a benzodiazapine and	M	29	 10 mg 1X D	3/24/2011Email

Her usual is to lay in bed almost all day, seems depressed, give her xanax for that she also take parkinsons meds, namenda, reflux meds, celexa, crestor and trazadone for sleep.  will probably bunk with her tonight to keep an eye on her, she is really frightened and combative.	This is really scary that a medicine could have this bad of side effects in just a few hours, feel very sorry for people who are taking this and are alone, very frightening.

1	mild dementia	My 81 year old mother, who I really love, is always up at 8 a.m. to eat her cereal and watch TV, every morning, and she goes on walks up the street several times per day.  She was prescribed Aricept 10 mg. and took her first dose at 7:45 p.m. on 1/1/2011.  Since Sunday morning she has been having very severe side effects.  Labored breathing, loose bowels--not stool, profuse sweating, and she has been so tired she cannot open her eyes for more than a couple of seconds.  She had the pill at 7:45 pm on Saturday January 1 before bed and now she is still sleeping and sweating profusely and cannot walk.  I can tell she is dreaming as she is talking in her sleep and reaching for something.  Other side effects slurred speech, disoriented as to where she is, and what she should do next.	This drug is VERY VERY strong and I would recommend to never give an 81 year old 10 mg dose initially.  Wish my mom luck to wake up soon please.	F	81	1  days10 mg 1X D	1/4/2011
1	mid to latent alzheimer's	Gradual increase in rate, intensity and frequency of the following: irritability, irrational throughts, violent outbursts, argumentative, chronic EXPLOSIVE diarrhea, insomnia, fatigue, nightmares (he reports never remembering a dream in his life prior to taking medication), loss of appetite, childish mood swings, apathy, no understanding of hygiene (was meticulous about hygiene prior to taking)	I am writing this for my dad who is 75 years old. He was diagnosed with alzheimer's 3.5 years ago. His functional abilities were limited, at best. He suffered from five mini strokes within the same time frame. My dad has always been irrational and explosive, never cared to know the date or time of day, and when asked about who is president, has answered incorrectly his entire life. His physician diagnosed and prescribed based on questions like this. 5mg aricept for two weeks, then to 10mg--he has taken now for 3.5 years.  He was also prescribed Namenda, Zoloft, and plavix.  I thought this combination of meds was miraculous until the past six months. Prior to diagnosis, his behavior was severely explosive, hallucinating, "sundowners", and essentially could not dress himself or get out of his chair. Immediately upon taking the meds, he appeared to regain 70% of his functionality, began to be involved in life again. For the past six months (and more likely, gradually upon taking med), mood swings are more frequent, irrational-bordering violent-extremely irritable/argumentative, complains about everything (frequent complaints were characteristic of him, but this is unbearable),basically hates life and everything about it, AND has chronic,EXPLOSIVE episodes of diarrhea-usually not making it to the bathroom.As his primary caregiver, and after reading these comments, we are DCing the aricept tonight.I will re-post the results of this trial within one week.I deperately hope	M	75	3.5  years5-10mg 1X D	12/4/2010
2	Alzheimers	Hallucinations	My mother is 96 and has late stage. Her behavior is usually terrible. About a month ago her perscription ran out. Since her doctor was moving and I'd heard it really doesn't help late stage patients, I skipped it for a couple months. She's been back on it 4 days now and is having very strong hallucinations again and has been doing this for around 8 hours now. I just realized this wasn't nearly as bad during the period when she was off the drug. I am wondering if the last 4 years of her life have been made even more miserable because of it and also why I was never warned about side effects. Does it somehow counter-act the Namenda she takes to calm her down?	M	60	4  years5 1X D	11/25/2010Email

4	following a TIA	none reported	My father was prescibed Aricept by his GP several years ago when my mother complained to his doctor that he had become too "forgetful". He complained of diarrhea and nausea and refused to take the drug after only a few doses. During a follow-up appointment with a neurologist, he was told that his  forgetfulness was consistent with his age at the time. About nine months ago, he rather suddenly became withdrawn, very forgetful, spoke very quietly and hesitantly, and had trouble walking. When his condition did not improve, he went through a battery of tests and was eventually diagnosed as having suffered another TIA (years earlier, he was told that MRIs and CT scans showed signs that he'd suffered a TIA...most likely during a triple bypass surgery). He was prescribed a generic for Aricept, and it helped him very quickly. He still suffers from some forgetfulness and, after playing in pinochle and bridge groups for most of his life, decided he could no longer play cards very well and quit these groups. He still has some balance problems and walks with a pronounced shuffle. However, he is more engaged, responsive and talkative on the generic for Aricept. He did not remember having tried Araicept several years earlier, and has not complained of any side effects this time.	M	84	6  months 1X D	9/15/2010
1	memory loss/dementia	My 86 yr. old mom was given aricept for memory loss.  Two days after starting the drug, she started having incredible fears, horendous nightmares, extreme paranoia, and total confusion.  She had trouble sleeping at all and had no appetite. She didn't know me (her daughter) most of the time and lost most of her grasp of reality.  We discontinued the drug after 2 weeks of hell and since then she has done so much better.  She still has some of the same problems, but the fears, nightmare, paranoia have totally disappeared since 3 days after discontinuing the drug.

1	Alzheimers	My mum aged 94 was diagnosed with alzheimers in 2007 and was given aricept even though both she and I were not happy about the drug as we had watched a tv programme about its negative effects on patients  she took it for approximately five weeks and her personality changed for the worse she became aggressive and afraid to leave the house and got very upset at the day centre which was completely out of character for her.	Mum stopped taking the aricept after 5 weeks and returned to the way she was before taking it.I am very concerned about the side effects of this drug but some of my relations want Mum to go back to taking it so I am immensely grateful to the contributers of this site for highlighting so many of the negative effects of aricept. Mum is now 97 and seems no worse than when she was first diagnosed back in 2007 and I feel sure is alive and well today thanks to stopping taking aricept before it did lasting damage.

3	Memory loss from mild TBI with PCS	Apathy, depression, and severe post-op anxiety following surgery with general anesthesia while on aricept.	Aricept helped with some head injury symptoms such as light sensitivity.  It helped me stay on task and not 'zone out' as much, and improved my ability to remember conversations.  Aricept was helpful in some ways, but due to how horrible the post-op anxiety was, I decided to discontinue it because if I ever needed emergency surgery again, I would not chance being on aricept at the same time.

She is 81 and just recently diagnosed with advance Alzheimer's. There didn't seem to be any side effects. It was increased to 10mg in April of 2010 and within a few days she started not feeling well. We thought it was the flu and called the neuro and he suggested to wait 2 more weeks to see if this was due to another issue.  She has gotten progressively worse and now after reading a lot of these reponses, I know for sure she needs to get off of this drug or at least go back to 5mg.	F	57	2  months10 mg 1X D	6/1/2010Email

I haven't found any links between aricept and macular degeneration but I am wondering if anyone else has experienced that.

1	Memory loss	I'm writing this for my 90 year old mother.  She has suffered severe anxiety (sense of "doom"), loss of appetite, very weak, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleeping a lot, muscle ache, stomach soreness.	My mother was given Aricept while in a rehab center after a fall and leg fracture. Mom always has these episodes when in hospitals, etc., of not knowing where she is, getting upset, etc. but always recovers when back home. Don't know why dr. felt she needed this.  Was "ok" on 5 mg in rehab ctr but when she got home 3 weeks ago dr. upped it to 10 mg. She started with MAJOR anxiety (woke up during middle of night with fear and shaking).  I took it in my own hands and cut her down to 5 mg. 3 days ago.  Anxiety stopped immediately!  BUT...she is still very weak and short of breath and fills up after eating practically nothing!  After reading here how others are also suffering same things, I think she needs to be OFF it NOW! Starting tomorrow we'll be stopping it and getting Mom back to herself!  I hope it's not too late.

1	Alzheimers	Nausea, dizziness, exhaustion, weakness especially in legs.	My mom is pretty healthy for her age, really a vibrant person. I have never seen her look the way she did after she had been on Aricept for a week. She was sickly, pale, droopy, depressed, tired, and dispirited. She was nauseated and dizzy. Her incontinence worsened. Her legs got so weak after a week that she required assistance walking and we wondered if she'd had a mini-stroke. (Testing the same day showed that she had not.) Aricept is POISON and I feel extremely guilty that I did not research this medication before allowing her to go through this ordeal. Now I'm suspecting that Aricept may be one of the reasons that my dad got so much worse so quickly after he started taking it 10 years ago for Alzheimers. It makes the life just drain out of a person.	F	85	8  days5 mg 1X D	4/1/2010Email
1	Possible Alzheimers	lethargy, confrontational, seeing things that were not there, hiding things, child-like behavior, skyrocketing blood pressure, unstable blood sugar, terrible anxiety	Took my 82 yr old Mom off Aricept. As half-life of drug is 70 hours, true enough, all her values improved steadily.  Skyrocketing blood pressure of 162/104 was considerably better within 3 days!  Tonight, just one day shy of a week, she walked into the kitchen and asked her husband how she could help with dinner! She had previously been zombie-like!	F	82	2  days5mg-10mg 1X D	2/24/2010Email

3	Memory Loss due to Head Injuries	-Very- vivid dreams. No nausea or vomiting.	Greetings. I'm a 33 yr old man, in great shape, but have suffered a number of head injuries in the past due to my occupation, military background and sports. I am suffering from memory loss, which seems to get progressively worse every year. My neurologist gave me some Aricept, and I took my first dose last night. I did not suffer any nausea or vomiting, although I did have -very- vivid dreams. This was not mentioned in the side effects; they were not nightmares, and I was aware that I was dreaming, but they were usually vivid, and seemed to last the entire night. Hope that this helps. Regards,- J	M	33	1  days	12/30/2009
5	Vascular Dementia	nausea,bloating,confusion,heartburns. all of which subsides after 2 weeks on the drug.	Aricept is a wonder drug! a true life saver for my grandmother.My grandmother was a complete wreck and started to deteriorate rapidly after having 5 strokes. her doctor diagnosed her with vascular dementia and prescribe aricept + namenda along with her daily drug regimen (aspirin, plavix, benicar, tekturna, crestor, zetia, lexapro, lamictal, soriatane). now she's absolutely couldn't be better,she's functions well with us and remember every little detail. I would recommend aricept and namenda to anyone who suffers from vascular dementia!	F	75	1  years	12/19/2009
1	Dementia	This medication was prescribed to my 81 year old mother who had, had 2 previous strokes. She has slight dementia and when she went to a follow up appointment with a neurologist/phyc. he prescribed her Aricept after talking to for a few minutes. After 3 weeks of taking this medication, I found her on the floor lying like a snow angel and she did not even seem to care.	I think that this is a dangerous medication. My mother like a lot of others mentioned above has incontenence, dhiarea, cannot walk on her own and is very hypersensative, sleeps alot during the day, tries to get up during the night to use the toilet and does not and soils herself. When we try to get her up to walk everything aches. This drug may help some people but from the responses that I have read here most of them have been negative.This has been a nightmare for my mother and whole family. Our family doctor told us 2 weeks ago to get our mother off of this drug. She has shown a little improvement but still is not the mother I knew before taking this drug. I feel that this drug is very dangerous especially to the elderly and should be taken off the market. We are praying everyday that my mother gets back to the life she once had.

1	My 81 year old father	For early Alzheimers.Only on it for 2 weeks, became extremely depressed and lethargic and then doctor doubled dose and it was even worse. Affected his speech, thinking, sleeping.	I don't think this medicine helped my father at all. If anything, it made him worse. His speech became slurred and he wasn't even able to make words. His blood pressure skyrocketed and he had never had a issue with high blood pressure. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone living alone because he wasn't even able to tell us how he was feeling. Luckily a family member checks on him several times a day and he was treated at the hospital but the side effects have left him feeling ill and severely depressed. I understand that his alzheimers will progress but this medicine turned his life into a nightmare after only taking it for a week. I think the physicians need more education on what to watch for in their patients. The warnings with the prescription don't tell enough.	M	81	3  weeks	12/7/2009Email
4	Alzheimers	Am writing on behalf of my father who was diagnosed with Alzheimers in January 2005.  He had been having memory loss problems for a while before being diagnosed and we suspected he may have it for a while before being diagnosed, but he put it down to stopping work as he had been self-employed and used to being busy.  He started withdrawing from life as he knew it, refusing to go out, not wanting to converse or socialize with anyone, including his own family.  He seemed to be in a depression and had no real interest in life any longer.	He was started on Aricept 5mg increased to 10mg after a year.  We saw an immediate change FOR THE BETTER in him.  He regained all his prior interests in life, was far more chatty and happy in himself than he'd been for a very long while.  It was as if he'd been lifted out of himself and we were extremely pleased with the good result of this drug.  He's just been to the memory clinic for his 6-monthly check up and he didn't score very well, so they now want to withdraw it as they say it isn't doing any good, but we don't want it to be stopped. He went into permanent residential care last month.  We lost my mum last year and I was his carer until then.  We decided to put him into care because he's no longer safe in his own home (for a variety of reasons, all linked to his Alz).  At the care home he helps do simple chores and at my house he still peels vegetables and can make a drink for himself, with step-by-step instructions.  We're really afraid that if he comes off Aricept he'll lose what precious little skills he has left, so we're fighting to keep him on it.  We live in the UK and it's paid for by our National Health Service and is therefore free to him but I know it is an expensive drug. He isn't on any other medication as he has excellent health in every other way. We believe that everything my father can still do is thanks to Aricept and personally I would advise anybody to try it.  I know it isn't for everyone, but it has definitely worked for him.

1	My father is for slight memory loss	My father is having loose stools, he's acting childish, nightmares at night, sleeping during the day, begging to be taken off this drug.	My father was just experiencing some memory loss and repeating a lot of stories. Doctor put him on Aricept about two months ago..5mg, now 10mg. I had not seen him in a month, just had Mom telling me what was going on. I saw him today - not my normal Dad. Something crazy has happened. He's acting like a child, etc. I just read things posted here, and I'm very upset. My mother-in-law was put on this and she went crazy.    I made the doctor take her off, because I couldn't handle her. Now, I see what my dad is like in just this short of a time. I called Mom and told her what I've read.  It fits what he's acting like. We have to take him off it and hope it hasn't done damage. I am very upset tonight. We were trying to find out if this stuff can be quit "cold turkey" or not.	M	80	2  months	11/13/2009Email
2	Memory loss	My mother, who is on a bunch of other thyroid and blood pressure drugs, tends to develop total anxiety breakdowns within 4-5 hours of each daily dosage.   Many of similar symptoms reported for other patients here. Drop in blood pressure, shaky hands, total loss of situational awareness, distortion of reality, loss of rational thinking, repeated past fears, confusion of past and present, self destructive behavior, etc...When a dosage is skipped, a normal thinking and behavioral pattern is restored.  Cant' say if the drug is ineffective or if it interacts with other prescriptions.   I am surprised that doctors were so quick to prescribed to someone who has what appears to be "normal" memory loss for her age (84).  There does not appear to be any improvement in memory recall.  A definite no-no.		F	84	60  days	11/12/2009Email
3	vascular dementia	Writing for my mother.  She was diagnosed with vasccular demential.  Been on 10 mg aricept for about a year.  Saw some improvement in memory in the beginning after we got past the initial "break in period".	In recents months she's had horrible diariah, terrible weight loss.  My sister said Mom looks like she's starving to death.  She eats well when we go out however so maybe it's that she doesn't like to cook any more.  Mom does however confuse my sister with her own Mom who died over 20 years ago, and constantly refers to her mother as though she's had recent conversation with her. That started with the Aricept.  Her disposition has not gotten violent like some comments on here, but in general she's more negative than before and it's hard to get her motivated to do anything.  She sleeps more than she used to, in the middle of the day even.  But all the comments I see the severe side effects started right away. Her's are all coming on slowly. I can't tell if it is just the general aging process continuing to progress or if the drug is just taking longer to do it's bad things.  Her memory, once improved on the drug seems no better and no worse than it was when we started.  But of course, there's always the fear to taking her off the drug and finding out it really was helping...  If anyone has experience with symptoms 'creeping up' rather than so immediate, can you please respond to my email address?	F	84	1  years	11/2/2009Email
1	memory loss (old age)	Delusions,Confusion,Fatigue,Panic Attacks	My mother started to image shadows of a male head w/ eyeglasses watching her and hearing "clicks" as if someone was photographing her. Needless to say what she is seeing are floaters and flashing lights; an effect to the YAG laser eye surgery she had about the same time she starting taking the Aricept. This is an alarming "head trip" drug. This is her 1st day off Aricept. Does anyone have any experience with the delusions stopping after the discontinuation of Aricept?	F	73	18  days	10/26/2009Email

1	Alzheimers	horrible diarhhea, difficulty verbalizing, interupted sleep and loss of appetite, memory seems far worse	my brother is 60 yrs old. He was dx at age 56 and placed  on Namenda. dosage was slowly increased until he reached 10mg bid and has done quite well.  Since starting the Airicept he has shown a rapid decline.  The stomach upsets have been horrible for him. He is not his smiling self and is happiest when isolated in his room.  I have stopped this killer med and will never give him another dose of it. I do not understand why this drug is still on the market.	M	60	10  days	10/15/2009
1	my father did; 88 years old	He was prescribed aricept to manage Alzeimer's. He died by gasping for air (he could not breath; he died in my hands taking a breath every 10 seconds until he stopped breathing).	My father was not in great shape but we had no reason to expect him to die. When he started taking aricept, he also started sleeping more. After one week we rushed him to the hospital because he could not breath. There he recovered soon (now I imagine because Aricept was stopped). We brought him back and he started aricept again following the doctor's orders. He died after a week. My father always had low blood pressure, and I would imagine bradycardia as well. I am afraid that aricept stopped his heart from beating (possibly by increasing the levels of acetylcholine). If only I had checked earlier the side effects of this drug on the internet.

1	BY AGE WITHOUT A REASON	Difficulty breathing, moving and talking, tightness in the chest, confusion, unusual tiredness and sluggishness, irregular heartbeat, muscle weakness, lost of appetite and weight, swelling of the hands.	My mother was recovering from a hip surgery at Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Brooklyn, NY. Her observing doctor at the center had prescribed this drug without any reason or concern. My mother has never suffered from Dementia or any stage of Alzheimer disease. We were completely unaware of the fact she was taking Aricept until all physical and mental changes had appeared and I had researched it on-line. This drug is VERY DANGEROUS and families should be advised on all possible issues. It is 1 week now she is off the medication but we still can't see the improvement in her.

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS.

We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me.

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email

Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify.

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie).

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor.

It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated. Who knows if it "helped my depression" because it made me an absolute basket case!	F	21	14  days2.5 mg 1X D	9/27/2010
2	GAD	RAVENOUS, INSATIABLE HUNGER!!!!	When I see my Doc I have to tell him I MUST come off this med or I will be the size of a house in a month!	M	33	2  weeks 1X D	9/25/2010
2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.	F	36	7  days2 MG 1X D	7/15/2010Email
2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
4	BIPOLAR 2	Severe Hiccups, lasted for 3 days.  Nausea, severe burping, felt like I was going to throw up, lasted for a week.  Slight mania, abbreviated sleep cycles, still having these.  I feel the side effects are worth it because of how well it keeps me from short cycling, which causes way more problems in my life than a little Nausea		M	36	8  weeks15 MG 1X D	6/2/2010
