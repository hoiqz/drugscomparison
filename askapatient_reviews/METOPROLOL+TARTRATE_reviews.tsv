1		I was taking this meddication for 5 months. After about 4 months I started to get some side effects. Insomnia mostly then all at once I was having Anxiety attacks starting at my feet and going as in a circle through my legs and then through my chest and then out my head. I could not walk 10 feet before having trouble breathing. Could not sleep .got about 2 hours a night. Weezing which also kept me from sleeping. My wife said I was walking around in a fog and at times she could not understand what I was talking about. I couldn't take it anymore . It was a Sunday so I left a message for my GP and my Cardiologist. I saw my GP that morning and told her that I stopped taking the medication. 24 hours after I stopped the drug I was fine. I can sleep 8 to 10 hours per night. Most times not getting up at all to go to the bathroom. The shortness of breath STOPPED. I can walk miles and not be out of breath. I have no strange feelings at all. My pressure is 130/75 most of the time. At the doctor		M	70	5  months50 MG 2X D	3/24/2013Email
3	Heart attack	Tiredness, wake up several times a night, some weight gain, dry mouth, pain in lower back and shortness of breath 	The doctor says I need it... so guess I have to put up with the side effects.	M	57	7  months25MG 1X D	2/26/2013EmailHistory
2	Irregular Heartbeat/Panic Attacks	acid reflux, lethargic feeling, mild nausea in the beginning, feeling of being out of breath easily, getting worn out fast with exercise to the point of not being able to exercise, decline in sex drive.	After I got over the "heart attack" feeling and feeling like my heart was fighting against beating the 1st week I started it, that type of side effect went away at 1st. It has slightly came back in about the last 2 months and the drug just in general makes me feel tired and lethargic. I take 25 mg 1x a day and I am going to lessen my dose to half of that pill and try to stop it alltogether soon. I do not want to be on this medication, it has totally zapped my energy and made me feel like im 90 years old.	F	38	1.5  years25 mg 1X D	1/5/2013Email
1	high blood pressure	I have chest pains.....		F	40	2  days25	12/15/2012
2	high blood pressure	A little drowsy and got a skin rash from it		M	24	10  days50MG	7/10/2012
3	High BP			F	47	4  weeks12.5 mg	7/8/2012Email
4	Palpitations/High Blood Pressure	Initially, I was on 50 MG twice a day - no side effects. After 5 months Dr. increased in to 100 MG a day. Had some dizziness that went away after 2 weeks or so. Odd but interesting dreams.	It works like magic in controlling palpatations. Haven't had any since the dosage increase. Overall I have been very impressed the medication.	M	47	 100 MG 2X D	4/19/2012
2	anxiety, high bp, irr heart beat	dizziness, tiredness, night time hallucinations, very dramatic hair loss, loss of sex drive, blurred vision	Ive been taking 25mg twice a day for 4 years, cut my dose in 1/2 and started taking 25 mg right before bed to keep it in my system and bypass all the side effects at night.  Thats when the hallucinations and hair loss started.  Im only 27 and am losing my hair.  Im not on any other meds other than this.  It works for my palpitations but the side effects are the worst.  Tried to quit taking it and didnt think it would be that hard since I'm on the lowest dosage possible but within 2 hours my heart was irregular and fast again.  I can deal with all the other side effects but I'm not going to lose my hair to this drug.  Its listed as a serious side effect along with hallucinations and once I googled it I noticed it happens to alot of people but its so gradual that it almost seems to happen overnight. My doctor is changing my meds on friday and it cant happen soon enough. I will never go back to metoprolol.	F	27	5  years25mg 2X D	12/6/2011
2	palpitations	My life ended when I started this drug.  In 9 years I gained 80 lbs, lost my libido, my humor, I have horrible dreams.	Getting ready for an ablation and doc took me off Metroprolol, flecainide and cartia all at once.  I feel like I'm ready to die with a pounding heart, a-fib and a wicked headache.  I'm hoping for a cure with the ablation.	F	65	9  years50 2X D	10/30/2011Email
3	palpitations	Mellow mood;  reduced exercise capability; weight gain; depression.	Very effective for stopping my palpitations (which were causing dizziness.)  I also enjoyed the mellowing side effect on certain stressful occasions.  It made strenuous exercise more difficult (but not impossible) and invalidated my Polar heart monitor, used for assessing my workouts -- my heart rate was too slow to fit the Polar algorithm.   I noticed a marked tendency toward weight gain (and retention) and over time plus a marked depressing effect particularly during winter.  When I weaned myself off this drug I found my energy and mood improving sharply.  (My wife observed I had "sort of woken up again.") I still take the drug for occasional bouts of palpitations -- it remains effective for this use -- but overall am much happier without it.	M	60	2  years25 mg 1X D	6/17/2011Email
4	a-fib	Brain-fog and loss of memory.	Very pleased that I'm still able to run 4 times a week for an hour and lift weights 2 times a week for an hour; I was worried that this would melt away like my mind has.	M	52	8  months25 mg 2X D	5/31/2011
1	High Blood Pressure	anxiety attacks,heart palpitations,irregular heart beat, hot flashes,nausea, headaches..	the doctor prescribed this to me with my blood pressure being high after having an episode of palpitations went to hospital and doubled my dose. i actually thought i was dying with all the problems i was having with this tablet. i got a second opinion and she reduced my dose i actually feel like myself again. it was terrible my bp is still erratic so thinking i need to change to another tablet	F	27	2  months50mg 1X D	4/20/2011Email
3	atrial fibrillation	Heartbeat is a steady 60 bpm.  Have experienced runny nose; cold hands; dizziness; pain and odd "aches" in my chest near my breastbone; general tiredness all the time.  Am feeling depressed wondering if I can take this for the rest of my life.	Was on dilatiazem for several months, side effects were too much.  Was put on metropolol for a week, then taken off to try Multaq, ended up in the hospital ER and didn't think I would survive the night.  Back on Metoprolol tartrate, I don't like all the side effects but I may not have a choice.	M	58	6  weeks25 mg 2X D	12/15/2010Email
4	blood presure	Blurred vision mostly in my right eye. I have experienced shortness of breath as well.		M	54	30  days24mg 1X D	6/8/2010
5	MVP	Blurred vision from time to time. Nothing major.		F	36	2  years12.5 1X D	3/22/2010
3	PVC's, MVP pain	occasional head rush when standing up.  I take 50mg twice a day.  Initially rx 25mg but that didn't help at all.  They said I could increase the dosage even more but that I would start getting more side effects.  I'm sticking with 50mg for now.	Has helped somewhat by slowing down my heart and relaxing the PVC's a bit and the sharp pains that come with MVP.  Also, I recover from exercise quicker.  I don't get a racing heart as often.  I was hoping it would help with my poker game by slowing my heart rate during exciting hands, but it didn't.  The doc said Inderal helps with that but has more side effects.  Also, this drug is cheap.  $10 for 90 days supply.  Has helped with my migraines a bit, too.  I don't get floored by them anymore.  Just head pain but no "sick" headache or light sensitivity.  I asked my GP if I could take this for 40 more years and he seemed to think it would be fine.  I hate being on a maintenance drug.	F	43	3  months	9/16/2009
5	Hypertension	Dizziness and fatigue for the first several weeks, but once my body became fully adjusted (about a month as I recall, but it might have taken a bit longer), the side effects finally faded away and have not returned. Now as a long-term user, I am very pleased with the results.	I take 100 mg twice per day. My blood pressure has been rock steady at 115 over 70 for over 7 years, despite remaining overweight and not getting as much exercise as I should. Although I have not gained weight, I find it impossible to lose any, even when I exercise frequently and am highly disciplined about calorie counting.  This might be due to the Metoprolol.	M	52	7  years	9/6/2009
2	To control high blood pressure	Upset stomach, extreme mental dullness, lack of energy	Also taking DILT-CD 240mg and Coumadin, which don't seem to produce too many side effects.	M	59	60  days	8/28/2009
2	high blood pressure	shortness of breath, low pulse, no energy	I was started on this for high blood pressure (155/78), my pulse was fine - 25 mg twice a day. After being on this a while I started having shortness of breath when walking only short distances plus having no energy to do much. My doctor and I have been monitering my blood pressure and it was irratic. Sometimes it was in the 120's and 130's and other times it was 140 and above - so the medication was not really working well. Per the doctor, I tried to up the dose to 50 mg twice a day but my pulse went so low and the side affects so bad I couldn't. About a week ago I decided to stop taking this medication. I did research on other blood pressure meds and came up with Atacand. Went to the Dr and told him this is what I want to try. Only been on it for 3 days, so hard to tell but so far no side affects.	F	64	6  months	6/19/2009
5	Atrial fibrillation	At the very first, I experienced shortness of breath when I walked a short distance, such as to the office from the parking lot, but then the doctor added Digoxin and the two work perfectly together, no shortness of breath or any other side effect that I know  of.	I feel pretty lucky about this, even though I don't like the idea of taking powerful prescription medication, as I don't know what else it is doing to me or how it might be hurting me.   But without it, my heart rate would be 128, 135 somewhere thereabouts, whereas with Metoprolol, it is kept down to a reasonable 70 or 80.  This does not control my arrhythmia (it's not expected to), only keeps the heart rate normal.	M	61	4  months	2/21/2009Email
5	hbp & headaches	tired		F	50	30  days	1/1/2009
2	Atrial Fibrillation episodes	Fatique,Heavy chest, pounding heart beat, insommia, heartburn and just general feeling of Blah all day long.	Taken to prevent occassional bouts of Atrial Fibrillation and this drug has done that but at great cost in side effects.	F	76	2  months	12/2/2008Email
5	arythmia	I notice no side effects from this medication	50 mg daily keeps my heart beating regular.	M	54	12  years	9/10/2008Email
1	High blood pressure	Massive weight gain, since my new doctor put me on 100mg, twice a day. Hallucinatory nightmares and hallucinations, especially at night. I would wake up yelling that someone was in the room, when nobody was. I would also see someone standing by my bed during the middle of the night, but if i blinked,they were gone. I would "hear" people talking in the hallway at night..I "saw" a woman walk through the closet without opening a door. Of course it wasn't real, just med-induced. I thought I was losing my mind!I would get extremely tired, had no hope for anything anymore. Couldn't concentrate at all. I also had heart palpitations almost all the time. Really bad edema in my ankles and feet.I developed a weird red itchy scaly rash on my shins, and on my left leg in the back too. This started 3 months after taking the pills. It got progressively worse, and I thought i might lose my legs if it keeps spreading..but it is now finally healing since I stopped the medication.	I had the nightly hallucinations for a year or so before I quit taking the recommended dosage the doctor recommended. I also gained 50+ pounds in a year, and I couldn't figure out why for awhile. Until I started researching the medication. I drove my husband crazy with the nightmares, waking him up each time. I started cutting the pills in half, then fourths, weaning myself off of them. Since the doctor refused to switch me, I found a natural alternative (blood pressurex from theherbsplace.com)and am now totally off metoprolol and will never go back. In fact, i will never again take prescribed medications as long as I live. Since I no longer trust doctors in any way, shape or form. For anyone that has ever been told by a doctor that you will have a stroke and die if you quit taking the medicine they prescribe for you, you won't. As long as you ease up on the medicine slowly and find an alternative to help you. Ask any pharmacist how you can wean yourself off of any medication you	F	50	1.6  years	3/7/2008Email
3	anxiety	Weight gain!!! Tiredness. Calmness.	Well, it sure helped my anxiety but I packed on the pounds too. Now I'm not sure if I should stop taking it and be thinner and more anxious or stay on it and be fatter, but more calm.	F	36	6  months	12/19/2007
3	PVC	gained 15 pounds in three months, hair loss	Insurance switch me from Totorol, does not work for PVC, lowered my blood presure, try half of the pill does not work, feel week, shortnes of breath, I have to switch to natural medicine.	M	49	8  months	12/18/2007
4	Proactive prevention after bypass.	Dry mouth.  Occassional sun sensitivity.	The dry mouth is sometimes annoying.  Otherwise, no particularly noticeable effects, good or bad.	M	65	16  months	9/24/2007
4	high blood pressure	some loss of sex drivedizzness	side effects didn't last long	M	65	5  days	8/23/2007
1	mild hypertension	weight gain / water retention (15 lbs), increased blood pressure, increased glucose levels, shortness of breath, nightmares, fatigue, nausea, cold hands and feet.	Before starting Metroprolol I had undergone a successful thoracic aortic stent and aortic valve replacement operation. My blood pressure was marginally elevated at 135/75 - 145/85.  After starting on 25 mg Metoprolol as recommended by my cardiologist, I gained 15 lbs water retention in 6 weeks, causing blood pressure to rise by up to 30 points, both systolic and diastolic; blood glucose levels shot up between 40 and 70 mg/dl above where they were before. Other symptoms got worse: shortness of breath, fatigue, cold hands + feet, general lethargy, nausea and malaise. Have stopped the drug and am gradually getting the poison and excess fluids out of my system.  Have since learned that a significant percentage of patients lack the enzyme to metabolize this drug, and that it is not recommended for patients who have diabetes or are over 60 years old.  This is a bad drug and I have fired my cardiologist for putting me on it.  Avoid Metoprolol if you can. Avoid cardiologists that try to put yo	M	74	50  days	4/28/2006Email
1	blood pressure	dizziness,extreme fatigue, unable to exercise, extreme edema, depression, inability to focus, memory problems, weight gain, cholesterol elevated for first time in life probably due to inability to work out, constantly cold, extremely painful constant Raynauds, waking hallucinations, hopelessness, restricted ability to work and drive, difficulty doing the most regular and mundane tasks, was not controlling bp, basically couldn't function, loss of interest in everything, feeling isolated, and stuck with it, according to the DR.	I have just come off of this drug in the last week after being weaned off over a month by new Dr. Was in this nightmare for over two years.  Blood pressure was swinging high, and has dropped with each cutback; additionally, have lost 14 pounds of edema over the course of the cutback. Felt better immediately after each cut back, and starting to feel like myself.  So thankful to be off of this drug - it was like poison to my system.  If you're having problems, get a 2nd or 3rd opinion.  It's unbelievable the difference!  Now taking Benicar/HCT	F	51	3  years	4/18/2006
2	irregular heartbeats	more frequent irregular heartbeats especially when sitting watching TV or lying down, palpitations, anxiety/near panic attack, sensation of heart pounding, strong pulse	I know that this drug helps many people with high blood pressure and angina, otherwise I would recommend against taking it.	F	47	7  days	2/22/2005Email
1	long qt syndrome	extreme fatigue, constipation, loss of interest in activities,absolute intolerance to exercise, muscle weakness and burning with activity, hallucinatory nightmares, living in a fog, worsening of depression.  15# weight gain in six months.	Has ruined my life and have no hope of getting off of it because of long qt syndrome.  Used to be very athletic and mountain biking and trail running were my life.  Essentially a cripple on the bike, muscules burn all over, feel heavy and weak, Heart rate tops out at 100. I can't imagine living like this. However,I have had no episodes of cardiac arrhythmia since on it so it is doing it's job	F	42	10  days	4/21/2004
