3	High b/p &irregular Heart beat	I experienced  cold hands and just feel spaced out...and agitated....I am a very active person and when I workout my heart doesn't get over 150.. Thus making it difficult to burn necessary calories...I'm stopping this medication...I would rather deal with the irregular heartbeat...that's easier that dealing with the side effects of this medication	If your doctor suggest this medication make sure you ask what the side effects are.....	F	39	5  days50 2X D	2/26/2013Email
4	A-fib, hypertension	Fatigue, nausea, depression, weakness, lethargic. Multiple cases of atrial fibrillation tried to sort it out using medication. Heart used to race at 160-200 bpm. The medication has stopped that although I still feel it every now and again 'trying' to race away but less often now. I've forced myself to eat healthy and try to exercise but its like having all the wind taken out of your sails and unless you have a strong will then you will simply stop, lay down exhausted and become depressed. Side effect of the drug. But it's a MUCH better side effect than having a-fib and its feeling of sickness and doom.		M	28	1  months25mg x 2	11/20/2012
3	High Blood Pressure	Definitely mellowed me out.  I'm seriously Type A.  But my hands are numb every morning, and a muscle in my right hand has not stopped twitching since I started the medication.  I've never experienced that so I am pretty sure it is the medication.	My b.p. fluctuates a lot, probably due to perimenopause.  Sometimes it is 160/110, sometimes it is 130/90.  I'm taking a very low dose, and last night I felt so weird - my b.p. was 99/68.  Woah.  Even when I was young and very athletic my lowest b.p. was about 110/80.The last thing I need to do is gain more weight - hopefully that doesn't happen.	F	44	5  days12.5 1X D	12/15/2011
2	arrhythmia, high blood pressure..	nausea, headaches, extreme dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, exercise intolerance, weight gain....		F	34	2  years25mg 2X D	8/12/2011
5	Tachy/Afib from Pericarditis w/HBP	Drowsy, spaced-out, vivid (but happy) dreams, lack of energy.	In my case, the side effects are well worth the fact that my heart is not racing or beating irregularly.  I have taken this medication for 4 months, roughly a year ago, for the same issue.	F	45	10  days50 MG 2X D	7/29/2011Email
5	A-Fib	Low resting HR, usually in the upper 40's.	Work's great on my BP, and the lower HR has helped prevent my A-Fib/SVT immensely!!!	M	41	45  days50 2X D	5/31/2011
4	Hypertension, Mitral Valve Prolapse	5-7lb weight gain	I went to a cardiologist about episodes of very high blood pressure and palpitations.  He diagnosed hypertension and mitral valve prolapse.  The metoprolol has not only helped my blood pressure, but has taken away palpitations and heaviness I sometimes felt in my chest, especially in prone position.  For my particular problems, it worked very well, and I think I'm more relaxed...not as prone to anxiety as I used to be.  Not thrilled about the weight gain, but I had gotten down to a normal weight before taking, and the extra lbs aren't really a problem beyond vanity.  I've exercised all my life, and I can exercise as well now, or better, than before.	F	50	15  months25mg 2X D	2/24/2011Email
4	htn,  tachycardia	fatigue, weight gain, dizziness upon standing, blurry vision.  heart rate down as well as bp.		F	56	10  years100 mg 1X D	2/15/2011
1	High Blood Pressure	Severe blurry vision especially in right eye, overall body achiness, fluid build up in legs	My doctor started me out on a lower dosage but raised it when med didn't lower bp.  That's about the time my problems started.  I've had 20/20 vision my entire life but my vision blurred and looking through my right eye was like trying to look through very dark sunglasses, blurry as well.  I also started retaining water in my legs, something that's never happened before.  It also felt as if I had arthritis in every joint in my body.  Call me a hypochondriac but it seems pretty coincidental considering what I've began discovering about this medication.  I'm going to ask my doctor to put me on something else.	M	44	3  months100 mg 1X D	1/26/2011Email
1	hbp	terrible fatique,blurry vision,numb on soles of feet,tingly legs,woobly standing,weak,to many problems to list here,also take other drugs to, so who knows. This is real crap. But afraid to stop.Started Clonidine a month ago and that compounded my problems, along with metoprolol. I am now like warmed over death.		M	80	15  years200 1X D	12/29/2010Email
4	Hypertension	May slightly aggravate my Asthma, but not enough to stop using it.	Side effect profile low, It has worked well for me in conjunction with Hyzaar 100/25.  I have taken beta blockers since I was 27 and this one has fewer side effects and works well at a low dose.	M	53	4  years25 mg 1X D	12/7/2010
1	a-fib	Bloated feeling, excessive gas, suffocating feeling- especially when attempting to lie down. Basically spent entire night sitting up burping and farting- Yea! Oh, almost forgot- all that made me depressed.	The thought occurred that slowing my heart rate down would not really be that important if taking Lopressor caused me to take a gun and blow my brains out.	M	50	1  days50 2X D	10/7/2010Email
2	HEART ATTACK	PALPITATIONS;SINUS CONSTRICTION(HARD TO BREATH);EXTREME ANXIETY;FEELING OF DOOM;DIZZINESS;SLEEPLESS NIGHTS;FREQUENCY OF PALP/ANXIETY WERE FREQUENT;EXTREME FATIGUE;PALE SKIN;DARK CIRCLES UNDER EYES;(I KID YOU NOT!)ALL OF THIS!VISION SEEMED BLURRY AT TIMES;COLD HANDS;CHILLS AT TIMES;LOW DIPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE;DEPRESSION AT TIMES;THIS WAS ALMOST EVERY DAY.	ALTHOUGH IT DID WELL IN CONTROLLING BP, THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE NOT WORTH IT FOR ME. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ON SOMETHIG ELSE. DR IS DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE THIS TO. HE THINKS ITS ME.	M	61	5  months25MG 2X D	10/5/2010
2	inappropriate sinus tachycardia	nausea, dizziness, headaches, heartburn, unusual dreams, depression, low sex drive, weight gain (about 8-10lbs), inability to exercise.	I was put on this drug for an elevated heart rate. I got a lot of unpleasant side effects from it. I had a perpetual dull headache and missed a lot of work from the nausea. I am constantly bloated, even on days when I only eat a small amount due to nausea. I have a high metabolism but gained weight almost immediately. I can not exercise either, because this med prevents me from getting excited. I also now find sex very boring. My significant other is not happy!	F	22	2  months50mg 2X D	9/30/2010
1	Hypertension	Lethargy, physical heaviness, inability to move, severe depression,dry mouth, bad taste in mouth, weak muscles, confusion, not wanting to move, severe anxiety, hopelessness, physically unable towalk properly, felt faint, uncoordinated, loss of memory.	I was advised by more than one MD that after taking Lopressor for 4 weeks allside effects would cease.  The side effects became increasingly worse until I began to stumble and became totally unable to function.  I have never had a worse reaction to any medication.  I will never take Lopressor again.	F	55	4  weeks25 MG 1X D	5/29/2010Email
3	high bp	light headed-cold hands and feet-not able to concentrate-weak erection-not funny-just overall drugged feeling.also this stuff will give you anxiety for sure.	had a stent 10 years ago-and a triple bypass last year,only reason i take it is because i fear a stroke.i know no one gets out alive,but a stroke is way to much to handle after having cancer twice.lopressor does lower my bp to a reasonable level.	M	60	15  years100mg 2X D	4/2/2010
1	Pericarditis	Heart palpitations, mood swings, light headed.	I realize this drug works well for some people, but if I was given the choice to live a year feeling good, or ten years taking Lopressor....I would choose the year.	M	60	3  weeks25mg 2X D	3/30/2010
2	high B/P	TIRED!!!,cry all the time, dizzy,way to relaxed.	I've tried 3 diff. meds and this is the only one that brings it down.	F	22	3  weeks25 1X D	3/28/2010
3	Blood Pressure; after Bypass Surger	Extreme tiredness	It has worked very well to bring my blood pressure down but I feel wiped out most of the time.  It may have been prescribed (as opposed to another blood pressure medication) because of my recent heart surgery; I'll be asking my Dr. about trying something else.	M	49	2  months25MG 2X D	3/11/2010

1	For high blood pressure.	OMG..I've gained 15 lbs and become sooo lethargic..it has caused depression and its hard for me to get going in the morning. I used to work out like a mad woman, now I could care less..haven't worked out since I started taking the medecine. I am getting off this on Monday!! Do not take this medecine, especially if you have ever had depression issues, it makes it so much worse. This medicine sucks!!!!!		F	34	5  months50 mg 1X D	2/7/2010Email
3	A-fib, A-futter, V-tach, SVT, tach,	tired, dizzy, short of breath, vivid scarry dreams.	I been taking lopressor now on and off for nearly a year.  I have had 3 ablations, and I also take Tikosyn.  I think lopressor works well for me, for the most part it keeps my B/P from spiking most of the day, it is held around 140/90 if I miss a dose or we try to wean me off lopressor within 6 hours of the lower or no dose, my B/P is 190/110 or higher.  The vivid dreams are the worse and the main reason my doctor believes I should try and stop taking it.  I was married once to a not so wonderful guy, who still won't leave me alone and I keep having a dream of him killing me.  when I wake up from it, or someone wakes me from my screams, my pulse is over 250 and my B/P is 198/150. My heart monitor is beepig off the wall.  any suggestions on how to calm my dreams down?	F	45	11  months	12/29/2009Email
2	Heart Valve Disease	Sleepy and tired and not wanting to do anything.. Just started taking 2 days ago so I am still in the testing stages. will update as needed.		F	40	2  days	11/13/2009Email
3	Atrial fibriallation	Tired, "needing a nap" feeling is getting old.  Weight gain may be because I have no motivation to exercise anymore.  Pulse seems almost too low, 45-50 @ rest.  And, not sure if this is related to Lopressor, but I love spicy/Hot foods, and now can't seem to eat anymore.  Not because of stomach or heart burn issues, just burns my mouth, bad!	I was hospitalized briefly for Atrial fibrillation, which converted back to normal sinus rhythm on its own.  My cardiologist put me on 25MG, twice daily.	M	34	60  days	10/28/2009Email
4	blood pressure/hypertension	I've been on Lopressor, or Metoprolol Tartrate for two decades+. While it has been effective in controlling pressure, along with other drugs and behavior changes, it has greatly reduced my libido, caused constant fatigue/tiredness and makes me really have to fucus in order to maintain a vigorous exercise program. Really hard to work out at a cardio level. Also have severe short term memory loss, but ascribe that to age-related issues, but then, who knows?	Complained to my physicians about side effect, but am told the drug has been too successful to consider switching to another. I guess the feeling is some things are more important than sex! Like life! I'm not so aggravated that I would take the risk of not using the drug.	M	74	25  years	10/26/2009

1	hypertension	Immediate heartburn within 2 minutes of taking it. Second day took it again and same thing bad heartburn. I even took a prilosec with it and still experiencing heartburn and have to try and sleep 2nd night with this heartburn. I am going to have to find something else. I can't live with constant heartburn.		F	45	2  days	8/20/2009
3	heart problem - ventricular arry.	HEADACHES.  very lightheaded.  taking this 3 times a day at 25mg.	my bp is way down - it was at 165/110 - and it been around 128/86 for the last few days.....	F	32	5  days	8/1/2009
4	BP	Some shortness of breath when standing up or starting exercise, tachycardia	Taking 25 mg twice daily. Considering all of the complaints on this board, MANY OF WHICH I HAVE SUFFERED WITH OTHER DRUGS, I consider myself lucky. I guess it's a matter of finding the right drug and NOT "listening" (obeying is a better term) to your doctor, who doesn't care about the side effects, many of which are worse than his cure.	M	67	3.5  years	7/22/2009
2	Atrial fibriallation	Spacey and unable to concentrate at work; vivid dreams at night; need for daytime naps which I never took before!	My cardiologist told me to take 1/2 tablet (25 grams) of Metoprolol ER once a day.  It worked great for suppressing my AVs.  However, I only lasted a week on it because I couldn't stand the constant sleepiness and space cadet feeling.  Then I tried 1/4 tablet for 2 weeks and that didn't improve the side effects.  My AVs are of short duration and intermittent.  I'd rather deal with them and remain alert and awake.	F	47	21  days	3/15/2009
4	Tachycardia	Low blood pressure, a slowed down feeling. I can't exercise with the same intensity anymore. I tire easily, lessened physical endurance, feeling cold all the time, need more sleep, bp will drop suddenly very low and make me very sleepy	Metoprolol has helped to control my tachycardia, which was causing chest pain, shortness of breath, and other cardiovascular problems. A really nice side effect is that it has helped my PTSD. Since Metoprolol actually works by blocking the release of adrenalin(in layman terms), it therefore is great for reducing anxiety and that "flight or fight" state that I had seemed to live in prior to Metoprolol. I am mellower, and more laid back, not quite so "driven." As one of those Type A sort of folks, that has been a nice side effect. I just wish it didn't make me so tired and I could do the sort of cardiovascular exercises I like to do. It does frustrate me that I cannot do all the things I want to do.	F	33	2  years	1/14/2009

2	fast heart rate	vivid dreams, hallucinations, wanted to sleep all the time	it did keep my heart rate regulated	F	73	1  months	1/5/2009
2	High Blood Pressure	Disconnected feeling - space cadet feeling, weakness in the arms and hands, tingling, sleeplessness, vivid dreams when you do sleep	After six months on the drug, I want off! Helped my blood pressure but haven't felt like myself since the day I went on it.  The side effects are worse than the high blood pressure in my opinion.	M	35	6  months	11/12/2008
1	high blood pressure		further complaints: muscle pain and weakness particularly in the calves, shoulders and arms; joint pain in the knees, jaw and feet; possible tooth pain and tooth breakage.	M	59	7  years	10/23/2008Email
2	Palpitations and Tachycardia	I am on 50 mg 2x's daily. I feel extremely tired to the point where I can not function. Blurred vision. Stomach problems (such as heartburn and loose stools), I feel like a zombie during the day and then I can't sleep at night! Rash and itchiness. Feeling very weak.	I don't like this medicine at all! I couldn't get into my cardiologists office this week so I saw my regular dr and he switched dose to 50 mg 1 time daily. I WANT TO GET OFF THIS MEDICINE IMMEADIATELY AND GET MY LIFE BACK! I'll admit the palpitations are scary but they are do to anxiety and I will find another way to deal with my anxiety! Plus my blood pressure is almost TOO low! I don't like it at all, it might work for some people but not for me!	F	19	3  months	9/23/2008
3	Atrial flutter	Tiredness, some lightheadiness and slow heart rate.  when my HR is below 60, I don't take this med because it lowers my HR to the mid 40's to low 50's.		M	64	2  months	7/26/2008
3	high blood pressure	fatigue, dizziness, sexual side effects		M	56	2  years	5/22/2008
3	htn	night sweats,low sex drive,low energy, numbness,tingling in hands, leg feet ankle swelling, 30lb weight gain, sudden weight gain, fluid retention,indigestion.	I also take altace norvac,catapres III patch, it's been the best combination to keep me controlled.	F	41	5  years	3/19/2008
2	Supraventrical Tachycardia	I was prescribed this medication to prevent future episodes of SVT.  Firstly, it didn't prevent my episodes of SVT, I had nightmares and violent dreams frequently, and I put on 10 pounds as a result.  Lopressor slows your heart rate and makes you sluggish....excerising is almost impossible when on this drug....a definite conflict.	I hear it is good for lowering your blood pressure...that was not why I took it and had to monitor my blood pressure to ensure it wasn't too low.	F	52	7  months	2/13/2008
4	High blood pressure	i like the this med the only thing that it does wrong is make my short term memory really crappy haha		M	27	1  years	1/19/2008
1	High Blood Pressure	I have been unable to work for over a week.  I decided to go on-line to see what if any side effects may be caused by lopressor.  It seems that it may be possible that the tingling sensation in my fingers and toes, nausea to the point that I want to throw up, headaches, chronic fatigue, dizziness so severe that I cannot drive, agitation, mood changes, could all be a result of this medication.  There have been times I felt I was not going to make it through the day. I am going to ask my doctor to take me off of it immediately.		F	52	3  days	10/25/2007
2	angina	40lbs weight gain	Slowed my racing heart down, I feel better, but slowed all my metabolism down... the freaking weight gain... and if I miss a dose, my heart thumps like crazy.	M	37	18  months	9/4/2007
2	235/120	gained 50 pounds in under a year, drug limits my ability to engage in aerobic exercise.	I am on norvasc, lopressor, and avlide.  Lopressor was the first one they put me on.  It controlled the BP well for a while, but the dosage has been increased from 25mg/day to 100mg/day over three years.  In that time, the other drugs were added too.  Metoprolol by itself brings blood pressure down considerably (I can see the effects within 20 to 30 minutes on the BP machine) but now I'm obese.  I wasn't before.  Doesn't seem like a good tradeoff to me.  I wish someone could answer the question:  Why did a healthy non-drug using 24 year old end up in the ER with BP of 235/120?  Why do I have to keep increasing the doses of lopressor and other drugs so rapidly just to stay under 160/60?	M	27	3  years	6/23/2007Email
2	Congestive heart failure	Since beginning beta blockers, I've gained 25 lbs, I'm tired all the time, and after months on metorpolol, I've begun to have chest discomfort.  Then, when lisinopril was added, the chest discomfort became much worse and I felt as though I aged 10 years in 3 months.  I had a bunch of tests done to find the cause of the chest pain and they could find nothing.  I told the Dr. I wanted to stop the lisinopril and see if I felt better, and I did.  I got back 8 of the 10 years I felt I lost!!  So lisinopril is history.	I'm not convinced that metoprolol is doing me anything positive, but it is doing plenty negative.  When I miss a dose, I feel SOOO much better!!!	M	51	300  days	5/10/2007
2	Heart and BP	I developed afternoon Chronic Fatigue, and I gained up to 30 lbs. due to Lopressor.  I got off it after 2 yrs. on it and my caring doc switched me to Atenolol for Tenormin.  Now I'm calmer, have more energy and less appetite.		F	68	2  years	2/17/2007Email
2	BP and Heart disease	It caused nightly heartburn/indigestion.  Since switching to Atenolol (Tenormin), this symptom has decreased 95%.  No bad side effects so far.	I believe Lopressor is a support system, i.e., it keeps you alive, so I went off it so I could live naturally.  Now the Aenolol works even better.	F	62	15  days	2/17/2007
3	Hypertension	Cold and tired when taking 100 MG once a day,  better when I divided the dose but still feel spacey at times, get tingling in extremities	I think I can feel the drug kick in, weird sensations. Not sure my BP is as low as it should be by now.	F	65	2  weeks	1/11/2007Email
4	To control SVT's and HBP	Some tiredness and occasional dizziness in the beginning but the symptoms subsided.	So far, I like Lopressor much better than Lotrel 5/10.	F	47	6  weeks	1/4/2007
4	high blood pressure	none	very satisfied with it	F	43	90  days	10/26/2006
4	heart disease...hypertension	This beta-blocker has a "mellowing" effect on me.  I tend to lose hours daydreaming...............instead of accomplishing any given task. I no longer take naps, probably because I am in a constant state of rest.	For an active person this is not a good medicine.......although it does keep the BP in check (117/64). My doctor claims this is the best of the beta-blockers.......with less amount of side effect.	F	68	3  days	6/3/2006

5	Irregular heartbeat	Stuffy nose, tingling in hands and feet (more at night), cold hands and feet, tired the first 2 weeks.	My ireegular heartbeat is MUCH better now - almost gone or non- noticeable at least.  All the side effects have basically gone now but every now and then my nose is stuffy and I still get cold hands and feet.	M	33	2  months	12/7/2005
1	HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE	TERRIBLE HEADACHES	From the start, I got terrible pains in the back of my head. missed 3 days work, almost bedfast. Dr changed me to Avalide.	M	64	3  days	12/5/2005
4	Heart palpitations (PACs)	Tired the first week or so; mild sexual side effects	Lopressor provided immediate relief (20 minutes after first dose) from palpitations.  Am sleeping again.  Much better than toprol xl.  take 25mg twice a day.  Not a cure, but suppresses symptoms enough to let life go on.	M	53	30  days	11/30/2005
4	Heart Attack	None that I know of		M	42	4  years	11/2/2005
2	High Blood Pressure	Heart fluttering,cough and mood change	Caused heart fluttering and cough, and fatique. The worst side effect was that it caused a personality change. I am usually a very docil person and this medication caused me to be extremely aggitated and made me want to scream and fight with people!	F	47	2  weeks	8/18/2005
3	chd	tired		M	52	1  years	2/2/2005
4	Extreme hypertension	Sometimes tingling/pins and needles sensation in my fingers - especially at night.	When I have heart palpitations this medication immediately stops that which is a great relief!	F	39	1.5  years	12/7/2004
4	heart palpitations	A little spacy feeling at first.  I also take a diuretic for high BP, so I have to make sure I allow at least 6 hours before I take the lopressor	worked very quickly and effectively to control my heart palpitations	F	47	14  days	9/27/2004

				F M	 	 	    
1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.	F	52	8  years20 MG 1X D	1/13/2012Email
2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
