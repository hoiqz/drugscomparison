2	copd	stabbing pain in head,started in just like the sinus's now it's like having   5 knifes being jammed into my skull gets worse each time helped the lungs but have to stop because of the pain		M	60	5  days 1X D	4/25/2013
2	asthma	weight gain around the mid section only. I'm very active fit person. It has slightly decreased how often I have to use my fast acting inhaler.		F	32	3  months	1/16/2013Email
1	bronchiactasis	disabling back muscle spasms. Muscle relaxants and pain killers had no effect. tried acupuncture, massage, chiropractic. Stopped completely after stopping the drug!		F	65	1  years 2X D	11/15/2012
5	Stage 3 COPD	Backpain, thirst.  Occasional leg pain (sharp stabbing pain coming from nowhere...goes away in as little as 10 seconds, sometimes 20-30 minutes.)  Use heating pad for backache, and drink a lot of water for the thirst. Livable side effects, IMO.	Taking Spiriva in conjunction with Daliresp...astounding improvement: went from 88 on resting blood oxygen level to just about normal (reading of 94)  Even on mild exertion, it only fell to 89. I can walk for 10 minutes without getting short of breath.  I can actually talk a little while walking!  I go about normal household tasks without taking a break every 5 minutes.   I don't wake up short of breath in middle of the night. Yes, there's a few side effects, but so far I can deal with those just fine.  I am dieting, and have lost weight without difficulty so not getting the weight gain issues at all.  Have COPD...quit smoking 8 years ago but apparently I inherited bad lungs so got the COPD even though I quit  (and have never worked in a chemical-type industry or town either.)

2		The usual dry eyes, thirst, etc., after being on it for 3years developed neuropathy symptoms, was  Dxed with Small Fiber Neuropathy but painful symptoms turned out to be caused mostly by the medication... still on it but not taking as much and have far less pain.	They call this side effect 'paresthesias' in drug info, it can be a lot more  severe than that implies.	F	63	7  years18mcg 1X D	8/9/2011
1	copd	Dry mouth to the point it was painful. Disturbed sleep,belly weight gain and bloat. Increased heart rate.  Not sure exactly what it did do for my lungs.	I've only stopped this 2-3 days and already feel better	F	61	4  years 1X D	4/17/2010
3	COPD	This medicine worked for many months, however the dry mouth has gotten intolerable.  I won't take the medicine any more.		F	63	2  years	11/15/2009Email
1	Emphysema	I had taken Spiriva for 6 months. My eyes became Severely red and burning . My eyes looked like a birght red sun going down . Severe pain in my eyes. Stopped taking it 6 months ago and my eyes are still very painful.	I would never ever take this drug again....it didn't help my breathing and was not worth the side effects it left me with.	F	66	6  months	9/27/2009
2	mild COPD	Tried it on two separate occasions. Got a chronic-type bronchitis within 5 days of starting this drug, each time.Bronchitis disappeared within 5 days, once I stopped taking it, each time.		M	67	5  days	9/8/2009
1	COPD	Extreme mid-section weight gain and bloat.  In three months I'd gained 22lbs and 4 inches on my mid-section...and no place else!	Although it's been six months since I last used the inhaler the weight gain, and bloating, has not subsided.  I've had an ultrasound done which showed no blockage.  Tomorrow morning I will undergo a colonoscopy to see if anything can be found.  I'm not the only person that this has happened to. There are more on the internet.	M	67	3  months	6/4/2009Email
5	asthma	No side effects.	I was put on spirva for my asthma, so I could sleep through the night without waking up to take a hit off my asthma inhaler. Since I have been on Spiriva I have not had to use my rescue inhaler at all. It works great for me.	F	53	2  years	7/22/2008
