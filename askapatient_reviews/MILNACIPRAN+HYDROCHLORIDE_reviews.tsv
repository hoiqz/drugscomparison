1	Fibromyalgia	I had the worst case of constant sweating & at night soaking my Bed.	The only reason I took Savella was because it is an approved Fibromyalgia Drug.- I am already taking Lyrica, which took a while to find the right dose, so that I no longer wake up in the morning and my hands and feet do not work (As though I have severe Arthritis in my extremities). I started feeling well on the 1st dosage of 50mg 2xday, but kept going higher until I was at 200mg 2xday, which gave me no more relief and caused weird side effects, so I stopped taking it, only to find out that I really needed it. I now take 100 mg 2 x day and it works great with no side effects.-3rd drug is Cymbalta, of which I am in need of to stop Depression and some pain. -Summary; Savella may work for some, but the side effects outweighed the Pro's for me taking this drug (of which I feel more than likely works for many others). I however, take Lyrica & Cymbalta to function & continue working. I have found through my very rare Family Doctor who specializes in Fibromyalgia (Dr Janet Ciarkowski) the exact comination of medication that works for me.	M	46	2  weeks20? 2X D	3/24/2013Email
5	FMS, CFLIDS	Began with clinical trials, so I have been on this medication a bit longer than those who started after FDA  approval. It has changed my.tolerance of FM symptoms Significant&#322;y.	If you are oink this medication and your insurance will not cover it, or no ins. Coverage at all contact Forest Pharmaceuticals in St. Louis, MO and talk with them about you're positive experiences with Savella and request their Patient Assistance Program. Some paperwork, easy, straight forward. Once approved the work I 90 Day increments and mail the meds to you prescribing doc where you will pick it up.  A short tel call after that all required to continue, ard a new written Rx from the doctor.  Please use the PAPS the pharmacy companies have just  for this purpose.   Please do not just stop taking something that is doing wonders for you.	F	46	5  years50 2X D	12/21/2012Email

2		My doctor had me work up to a full dose of this medication, but I couldn't last that long. While the first few days were fine, as I increased the dosage it became so painful that even the pressure of my hands on my thighs would be too much. All I could do was lay in bed and cry.  I felt weaker and more tired than usual when I took this medication.	I haven't found side effects like this anywhere else, so it is possible that this is just a strange side effect isolated to me.

1	Fibromyalgia	Panic, personality change, forgetfulness, burst of anger, literally craziness, racing heart	I was put on this to help with my numbness and tingling. It was a horrible mistake. I have been on medicines throughout my life and never felt the way I did. I forgot where I was driving (with kids in the car), blew up on my son who did nothing wrong, cried and was sick. It was horrible. My heart was racing, I was clammy and just couldn't function. I almost went to the er. It is most likely my inability to handle too much serotonin, or whichever it is, but yikes!

1	Chronic migraines	Sweat like a stuck pig, head felt like it was on fire. Dreams were awesome though.	Had to quit after 7 days.	M	50	7  days5 2X D	8/23/2012
5	fibromalgia	None		F	49	2  years100 MG	7/18/2012Email
5	Fibromyalgia and + ANA	Insomnia and felt like I couldn't lie still but that went away after about 3 weeks. I've been having problems since 14 so the insomnia was nothing new since I haven't slept thru a night in years because of my nawing joint pain and discomfort. I feel great after being in this for almost 3 months. I still have my days but that's a lot better than everyday being miserable.		F	24	3  months50mg 2xD	7/13/2012
5	Fibromyalgia	some dizziness and slight weight loss in the first month, but have maintained a constant weight since.	I've been extremely happy with Savella. I was first on cymbalta, which was ok, so I thought, then my Dr switched me to Savella, huge pain relief! I had a brief experience after about a year of taking it where my Dr switched me back to cymbalta, and the pain was unbearable! Within weeks of switching again to savella I was again pain free (minus the occasional flare-up). I've been on it a little over 3 years and am now able to again play tennis, volleyball, etc. and live my life without the pain and exhaustion :)	F	29	3  years50mg 2X D	7/13/2012
1	Back Pain	Heart Pounding,High Blood Pressure,Extreme Nausea,Vomiting,Stomache Pain, Irritable, Hot Flashes, Sweating	Worst Medicine Ive Ever Taken!!!!!	F	18	1  days50MG 2X D	7/12/2012Email
5	Fibro	Fortunately NONE	Having my first flare up since starting Savella.  I'm scared to increase the dose because it may not work.  Going back to the doctor tomorrow for help, none of the opioids worked this was the only drug that gave me any relief.	F	48	4  months50 mg 2X D	6/12/2012
5	Chronic joint and muscle pain	I started with 15 mg a day for a week and they 15 2X a day for a week 25 and 15 a day for a week. 25 and 25...25 50...50 and 50 a day. My dr had me start very slow because of the side effects and it helped. I would get nausea about 90 minutes to 2 hours after I took the pill and my heart raced and I could not sleep at all. I also noticed I was short of breath and if I did anything that took effort (mowing the yard) I could not catch my breath. It would take about 4 to 5 days for my body to get use to it and then it was time to does up again.  I also lost about 5 pounds and my body felt flushed. After two months of the pill the my side effects are gone except the shortness of breath and I dont require as much sleep as I did before. I do notice if I dont eat at regular intervals I get nausea but if I eat it goes away.	It took my pain away!!!!! I have been dealing with pain since I was a teenager and the last few years it has taken away my life. This medicine has been amazing even with the crapy side effects. It was scary as hell that first month with my heart racing and being short of breath ( I even went to the hospital one night because of chest pains) but it was worth it. What is one month of hell compared to a life that is pain free. I have more energy, I am happy, I am motivated to live again. I fixed my garage door after I replaced a leaky faucet all on the same day!!! I feel amazing. I am hoping with time the short of breath goes away. But even still, I am very satisfied	F	32	2  months50 2X D	5/29/2012Email
3	Fibromyalgia	Savella made me sick, as if I were pregnant. I didn't correctly wean off of cymbalta, so I was overdosing to begin with. However, once on savella alone I did notice that my limbs werent as numb and also that I didn't seem as fatigued. The pain was worse though, and my vision became messed up again		F	28	3  weeks50	5/21/2012Email
1	Bipolar/chronic pain	Wow so taking this medicine was one of the weirdest experiences I've ever had. At first I was incredibly nauseous and felt like I had to burp or I'd throw up. Then I got incredibly irritated. I just wanted to bitch to everyone about how I felt cause honest I felt sick at first. Not to mention my body was so hot. Then I felt so wide awake and couldn't stop laughing uncontrollably. Literally, I couldn't stop laughing and nothing was funny. I had to actually try not to laugh. During this time I had so much energy I was debating doing a workout video. lol Finally the laughing wore off but was still wide awake. I dont know what the hell my doctor was thinking putting me on this medicine. Its stupid.	I was supposed to take this medicine twice a day. Basically if I did I'd be a nutcase that couldn't function. This was terrible for me and did not react will to my mental disease. Made me incredibly manic so I couldn't sleep. Finally I surrendered and had to take my saphris. Seriously what a weird night.

5	CFS	I'm the 62 year old male who recently posted about Savella.  It did wonders for my cfs but adversely affected my heart.  To update: The cfs problems returned within 2 days of ending Savella.  Now I'm on Norco 5mg, twice a day, one in morning and one in the afternoon.  It does a good job of knocking out the pain and fatigue.  I know people go nuts when you mention using an opiate because of the addiction potential.  They need to back down.  I intend to stay on the Norco as long as my m.d. allows.		M	62	6  weeks50mg 2X D	5/11/2012Email
5	CFS	Savella did wonders for my CFS.  It knocked out 90% of my fatigue problems.  But I had to get off it.  It substantially increased my heart rate.  The blood pressure went up, too.My cardiologist wanted me off it.  I'm on a pacemaker so I have a danger of other heart problems so there's no need to aggravate my heart.	I'm hoping against hope that the CFS doesn't return. Savella is a good drug for CFS.  I, unfortunately, had a side effect that wasn't tolerable.	M	62	6  weeks50mg 2X D	5/9/2012Email
2	fibromyalgia	When I started Savella, I had hot sweats, nausea, vomitting, a great deal of anxiety and worst of all an increase in blood pressure.  I went up to 100mg because I was not seeing any benefits, but the side effects were much too severe.  I had to be started on a second blood pressure medication to even be able to tolerate a 50mg dose.  Due to the bad side effects, I decreased again to 25mg.  That had much less side effects except for my blood pressure.  It seemed OK for a while but my blood pressure became very unstable and my doctor took me off of Savella due to the high risk of stroke or death from high blood pressure.	I think savella wants to blame peoples blood pressure reactions on SSRI antidepresants being taken with it, but I think the Savella itself is a high risk drug for high blood pressure without them.  It did help, but is not worth the risk of death.  I wonder how many people it has killed or caused a stroke in.  I predict it will eventually be taken off the market.	F	48	8  months25mg 2X D	5/1/2012
3	Tension Type Headaches	Extremely lethargic, irritation on small things, major side effect was my inability to pass urine properly. Severe lower abdomen pain, with back pressure.	I've had TTH for 5 years now, I switched from clonazepam (Klonopin) to Savella as a trial drug. The medication definitely was working on the receptors and I was feeling much better. I had less frequent headaches, no unilateral dispersion of pain on the right side of the head. Although the side effects of the pain in the groin and lower abdomen compelled me to stop taking this medication. If women are not having the same problem, this might be a better drug for them. After 1 week of taking the medication, I returned to my normal routine, and I experienced severe pain in my legs, pain in my chest, shortness of breath, dry nostrils, I wanted to go to the rest room, but then I could not pass any urine, which made my body go cold.

2	fibromyalgia	Increased anxiety, high blood pressure, severe flushing, nausea.		F	33	4  months100 mg	4/21/2012
5	Chronic severe pain	None. It relieved the constant unrelenting pain in my hands I had been experiencing for 6 years during the 1st wk of titration.  Now pain in shoulders is bearable.		F	52	3  months100mg 2x/d	3/17/2012Email
3	Fibromyalgia	I experience the hot flashes and sweating.  I sweat anyway but it's increased a good bit.  I felt completely stoned with my first dose.  I just increased this morning to the 25mg twice per day so still waiting to see what happens.  My head itches/tingles after every dose.  I still sleep ok.  No nausea yet.  So far, so good. Nothing to report yet on how it helps pain.		F	32	5  days25 mg 2X D	3/16/2012Email
3	Fibromyalgia - Severe Aches	Extreme nausea, vomitting	Switched to Savella from Lyrica due to over 50# weight gain in just 6 mos. & other adverse side effects. Nausea was mild w/ titration pack, but once regular dosage started, it got worse each day, ultimately resulting in vomitting about an hr. after each dose. Before the vomitting, I started to feel some relief from the deep, unrelenting aching & pain from the Fibro. Was so disappointed to have to discontinue it.		38	1.5  months50 MG 2X D	3/12/2012Email
1	Fibromyalgia	I became extremely agitated, irritable,and suffered with a severe headache with my blood pressure up on the second day of taking to 170/130 with my heart rate at 120's.  I felt like my head was going to explode.  I went to the ER immediately and was diagnosed with Seritonin Syndrome, which is life threatening.  I was told by the ER doctor to never take this drug again and that she has seen this syndrome with serval other patients recently.	This drug is new and not widely researched.  When combined with other types of SSRIs it can cause serious, sometime irreversable effects.  There needs to be more studies on this drug.  MD's need to have more information regarding interactions of this drug with other drugs one may be taking.  IF ANYONE is on this drug, please monitor your blood pressure and heart rate especially with any dose changes.	F	40	2  days12.5mg 1X D	2/4/2012Email
4	fibromyalgia	increased BP and heart rateloss of appetitetingly scalp	Starting on titration pack helped me to adjust to Savella.  Taking 50 mg twice a day works well; anymore than this causes hypertension, and less just doesn't maintain the pain and fatigue well.	F	50	18  months50 mg 2X D	1/1/2012
5	fibromyalgia	The first several weeks were tough with nausea and strange craving. For weeks I could only eat goldfish crackers. But after about 8 weeks that disappeared. Now the only real side effect is weight loss,but I'm not complaining about that.		F	35	4  months50 mg x 2	12/27/2011
2	Depression	Initial startup was pretty hard.  Lots of anxiety, muscle tension, etc.  and at every dose increase.	Now I'm at 100mg. and for depression I would say it hasn't really done anything either way.  I'm going to give it a full 5-6 weeks though and report back.	F	47	24  days50mg. 2X D	11/21/2011Email
5	Fibro/Chronic Fatigue	Side effects were mild nausea in first few weeks which has now gone.  Worst was the strong heart beats or palpitations at night time.  I have reduced dosage to 25mg 2 times daily and they have almost completely gone away.	I love this medicine!!!  I feel better now that I have in past 8 years.  More energy, less brain fog, more endurance, less pain and stiffness.  I am waking up at 7am and actually staying awake without having to take provigil.  I actually did yard work and painting yesterday and the day before went on a long walk with my son and the dogs!  Wow - never thought I would be able to do that again!  This has been a miracle for me and I feel like I will be able to go back to work now and take care of my kids instead of being a lump just surviving!!	F	52	4  weeks50 2X D	11/17/2011Email
4	FM, herniated disk pain, arthritis	After 3 months -- 50 mg Savella helped reduce the overall pain threshold dramatically (though it did not get rid of it entirely). I titrated to full dose slower than recommended to avoid side effects.  I believe that helped. It has helped considerably -- and allowed me to get back to my life.  The side effects (headaches, heart, BP, urination, etc) were significant but most minus heart issues went away in 3-6 weeks (because of the heart issues I was going to stop taking it  -- bad and pretty scary -  but because of pain relief I didn't want to stop). The heart issue side effects stopped at 2 1/2 months. Most people won't see it through long enough to see the side effects disappear.  So glad I did.		F	54	3  months50mg 2X D	10/23/2011
1	Fibromyalgia	Difficulty urinating (very slow), tiredness, out of breath with exertion, increased heart rate, worsening of constipation, hot flashes and severe sweating at times, worsening of pain.	I take methadone for pain, which also causes most of the side effects I have listed, but Savella has now worsened them.  I have only taken for 8 days, but have seen no lessening of FM pain. In fact, there has been a huge increase in pain to the highest pain level I experience (it constantly feels like it used to feel only after a day of substantial over-exertion).  I don't think I'm going to stick out the remainder of the trial period due to the side effects and in reading the notes from other male users, it doesn't seem to help men at all, only some women.

3	fibromyalgia	I took Savella titration pack for the full 2 weeks. Insomnia with very little sleep not helped by sleep aides was my worst side effect. .I wouldn't have been able to take this without an anti-nausea pill.  Sweating only lasted the first week	Some relief from the Fibromyalgia pain and it helped with anxiety.I tried to stick it out because I had hope for it after reading other reviews. Imagine my surprise when the pain management doctor seemed very upset when I didn't stop this drug after the side effects did not subside after "3 or 4 days"...so he stopped it on my 2 week follow up visit.

1	Fibromyalgia	Doc switched me from Cymbalta and Lyrica to Savella.  It is awful.  I have been on this med just 5 days. I have brain zaps, dizziness, jerky, twitchy movements, nightmares, awful insomnia despite taking 2 Ambien, intense sweating, night sweats/chills, cold feet and hands.  My ears are ringing, head thumping, headaches and I am having cognitive issues including forgetting words, slurring and repeating myself.  I feel like a zombie!	Caution!!!!	F	50	5  days 2X D	9/17/2011
3	fibromyalgia	major weightloss, nausea, vomitting, supresses appetite, wears off quickly.	anyone know something similiar that will decrease pain and not cause so much weight loss?  In six months i have lost 12 pounds.  Is this normal?  I'm thinking maybe the dosage is too high, but can't see cutting dose, lots of pain still exists on high dose.I have regular tests every six months, no other significant reason of weight loss.  Heavier sweating than usual.	F	31	6  months50mg 2X D	8/20/2011Email
5	Fibromyalgia	None that I am aware of except possibly sweating a bit more.	Savella is my miracle drug. Before Savella I had tried EVERYTHING from gabapentin (very minimal relief,) to Lyrica (make me feel like I was on illegal drugs,) and Cymbalta (1 pill, made me feel so crazy I called a friend to "babysit" me and my kids until my husband got home) and everything in between. Savella enables me to live a much more active and "normal" life, I am no longer a slave to FMS or to painkllers. Sadly at 130.00 a month I cannot afford it without insurance and after 9 months of taking half a dose to stretch it out (since insurance went away) I am weaning off it. The weaning is bad and my FMS symptoms are through the roof...I even took a full pill tonight just so I can be mobile to bake my sons birthday cake and not be so foggy headed tomorrow. I am hoping a low-cost clinic will help me...soon, because I cannot live like this.  Honestly Savella gave me my life back and now finances preventing me from getting Savella are taking my life away again :(  One warning is to check drug interactions CAREFULLY, I can't even take cold medicine and I was taking tramadol (Ultram) at first and ended up with seratonin syndrome and nearly passed out at my kids' birthday party in 2009. Luckily I made the connection, went to drugs dot com for the interaction checker and realized what was wrong and called my doctor right away. My poor doctor felt horrible, but the drug was so new (on the marker a few months) when I began taking it that there was very little in	F	32	27  months50 mg 2X D	8/18/2011Email
5	Fibromyalgia	Sweating but it is subsiding.	After just one day, I slept like I never slept before! My side hip pain stopped & more energy. I could turn in bed without waking up but I slept through the night. I just sweat but that is OK. 50% less pain and pain is a 3 and not an 8! Was on Cymbolta but didn't work and side effects. Was on Doxepin and 10 lbs. heavier. At 50 mg. I have some nausea but I just started the dosing pack and doctor said to continue till I get used to medication.  Worth a try.  Have had fibromyalgia for 23 years and this is the only thing that helps the pain!	F	54	11  days50 2X D	7/11/2011Email
3		none yet, but are still just on the 12.5 twice a day	not so sure about it, also take methadone so am really concerned about combining the two medicines	F	58	8  days 2X D	7/2/2011
4	Fibromyalgia	Slight nausea the first week of taking the titration pack with the increase in dosage from 12.5 to 25 to 50. The morning pill makes me tired after taking it.	Savella decreases all of my fibromyalgia symptoms. It does not make it completely go away, but I have tremendous relive from it. My "bad days" or "flare ups" still occur, but I am still able to work and function during the day while taking savella. It has really decreased my pain, headaches, body fatigue, and sleep disturbances.	F	19	4  weeks50 2X D	6/13/2011Email
4	fibromyalgia	I started med as precribed up to 50mg twice a day,(tried to go up further but could not). I had nausea for the first 3 months. Cut back to 25mg twice a day. Had relief for constant aching and pain from scale of 15(yes my pain was bad) to maybe a 2. Side effects included insomia, constipation, skipped beats to the point of having it evaluated, and high blood pressure which didn't response to medication much, occasional zings in my head. Decreased dose to 12.5 twice a day and had some improvement in side effects and still had relief of pain. I always called it a wicked drug due to the side effects. After a year and 3 months I slowly weaned myself off of it and have kept my pain at a tolerable level which I can take excedrin or ASA. B/P has gone to 117/69, heart rate to 80 and no longer have irregular heartbeats.Would never go back on due to side effects.		F	63	548  days12.5 2X D	6/12/2011Email
5	Fibro,MFPS,Raynauds,RPS,CI,& more	Some vivid dreams, but many side effects people think they have from Savella can many times be traced to other things. I could say I had hot flashes, but I was 52-53 at that time. That's called menopause. Many sides effects I could have attributed to the Savella were in reality caused by other things.	I went off all my meds(oxycontin, etc.) in 2008 to go on the study for Savella. Unfortunately I got the placebo. I literally almost died. My BP shot up to 210/120 for 8 months. I was totally bedridden the whole time. I went on Lyrica and gained 50 lbs. in 5 weeks, plus it did nothing for the pain. Then my kidneys shut down. Finally by June of 2009 Savella went on the market. I could feel a difference in 1-2 weeks. I went on the highest dose fairly quick because my pain is so severe and causing other health problems. Just remember it is not a pain pill. It will not get rid of ALL the pain. It will not work for everyone. Nothing man does will get rid of this illness. You will have to listen to your body to help manage your pain and other symptoms. And most of all, if you have fibro, as I have for 25 yrs., realize that everything you do will have a consequence to your health. Fight the urge to be overly focused on the pain. I have been on just about every drug and holistic pill there is. Savella hasn't gotten rid of all my pain, but it has worked the best for me. You HAVE to give it more that 1 day or week to see a difference.	F	55	2  years100 mg 2X D	5/31/2011Email
5	fibro	sever sweating, constipation, HBP	The first week taking this medication was not easy.  The second was better.  When I started taking the full dosage of 50mg 2xday, it was the worst.  I stuck it out because I hoped this med would benefit me.  I am so glad I did.  I sweat terrible for 4 hours  after my morning dose but am not bothered by it after taking my evening dose.  I am on BP meds and had to have them increased.  Constipation is tolerable, it has to come out eventually!  I have noticed that I have nausea if I miss my stomach meds.  But the one thing that I am happy to tell you is that I cannot remember when i felt this good, probably at least 15 years.  I still have pain in the morning but it is nothing like before.  I can put up with the side effects because it helps me to live a normal life.   Before Savella, I didn't want to live if I had to be in constant pain.  It works for me.  If you are dealing with the side effects and don't know if it is worth it, stick it out longer if you are not in life-threatening danger, you may be glad you did.	F	43	3  days50 2X D	5/16/2011Email

1	Fibromyalgia - PAIN	My heart rate started going up.  Then pressure in my chest and neck with palpitations.  Also, it made me nauseous every time.  This was on low dose and got worse as the dosage went up.  Also sweating at night, mostly just before awakening.  Light headed & out of breath at times.	First of all, I've had Fibromyalgia for 20 years.  I'm in horrid pain.  I also have Complex Regional Pain Syndrome from falling (Fibro imbalance) down the last stair and spraining my ankle badly, damaging the nerve.  Then there's my Chronic Fatigue, Migraines, Cluster Headaches.  They took Darvocet off the market.  I used Gabapentin for my Fibro and it works pretty darned good and no side effect.  But I get a lot of severe pain.  I use Soma mostly for my muscle spasms.  I try to keep my meds down to as low as I can tollerate without being too on edge of pain.  I have gastritis so taking pills is no fun.  Yes, I know how to take these pills properly.  I went from getting obese from Fibro to now being skinny.  I'm having difficulty keeping weight on at times.  Like right now.  I'm off the Savella because my heart pumping madly drove me nuts and felt awful not to mention light headedness and out of breath, as mentioned.  Since it did nothing positive and did do somethings negative, I went off of it slowly.  I can take none of the other pain medications out there and am really ticked off that I can not have my Darvocet.  I am now on the Gerson Diet.  It is extremely difficult.  The positive thing here is, no Migraines and no Cluster headaches.  Yea!  God helps us all!	F	55	30  days 1X D	4/2/2011Email
2	Fibromyalgia	anxiety, depression, insomnia, excessive sweating	Had no effect on my joint/muscle pain caused by Fibromyalgia, so I stopped after 8 weeks.  Just another SNRI that supposedly cure all ailments (depresion! anxiety! panic attacks! pain! fibromyalgia! OCD!.....doctors have no idea what the f&*$ they're prescribing, or how these drugs work.  It's reprehensible.	F	27	8  weeks100 mg 2X D	3/24/2011Email
3	Nerve pain in my leg	itchy scalp, insommnia, enlarged prostate, weight loss, frequent night time urination with interrupted flow.	I took Lyrica for over a year and my physician recommended I try Savella because I wasn't getting much relief for the pain. I haven't seen any change in pain with Savella either but I'm getting side effects that I never had with Lyrica.	M	59	2  months50mg. 2X D	3/23/2011
5	Fibromyalgia	no side effects	I have diabetes and conditions related to Diabetes, Sjogrens, acid reflux, year round seasonal allergies and Fibromyalgia. I take meds for all conditions. I started at 12.5 mg 2 times a day 7/14/10, increased to 25 mg 2 times a day on 8/25/10 and increased to full dose 50mg 2 times a day Nov 1, 2010. I wnated to introduce the drug slowly to make sure there would not be any extreme med interactions. The fibro pain has been reduced 65%. I feel better than I can remember in a very long time.

4	Fibromyalgia	dry scalp, sometimes itchy didn't have this as a chronic problem until started taking medicine (switching shampoos helps); initially face flushed easily, not so much now.  Heartbeat weird at times; vivid dreams sometimes.  Nausea, but taking it after food helps; probiotics help too.	I found this medicine to help.  The fatigue lifted fairly quickly after I started and the numbness/pain went away.  I was less angry/irritable after taking the medicine.  Now if I overdo it or get sick, some symptoms come back.  I have a lower than normal white blood cell count, but that is not due to the medicine.  I struggled with being sick during the fall and winter and found my fibro symptoms coming back.  I received acupuncture treatments weekly for a month while on Savella and my fibro symptoms went away without having to up my dose. I think Savella works but it can not work alone.  Need to eat healthier - Acupuncturist said Omega-3 foods help for fibro, and have a more regular bedtime and excercise.  If I do not do this, Savella doesn't work so well.  But Savella did greatly reduce my numbness/pain and my fatigue and my irritability/moodiness.  But in order for me not to up my dose, I had to start taking care of myself - limiting activities, doing low-impact excercise, eating healthier, and doing acupuncture.

2	Fibromyalgia	ringing in ears, constipation, depression-uncontrolled (depression was moderately controlled prior to taking Savella)	Savella has not worked for me.  It did at first, but after my body got "used" to it, the dosage had to be raised for effect (x2)and the same thing happened...worked for about 2 weeks, then stopped working.

3	chronic daily headache	Hot flashes, flushing, heart palpitations, difficulty sleeping, weepy feeling, brain zaps	seemed to help my head pain at first, side effects not as bad as other meds I've tried for headache (tricyclics, AEDs).  worth a try IMO for those who have "tried everything".

5	FM	1 per day (12.5 mg)NO SIDE EFFECTS and really controlling my pain and depression.  Savella is a GREAT medication AT A LOW DOSAGE.	I am newly diagnose with FM (I have been treating arthritis pain for years) but progress to very painful "Hit by a Bus" type of pain about 4 months ago.  Lyrica 75 mg stopped pain but left me feeling high and started retaining water weight.  I tried Lyrica 25 or 30 mg but it did nothing for my pain.  Then the doctor tried me Savella trial pack 12.5 mg  no problems, but Savellas next white pill, I think its 25 mg, I started getting heart palpitations and chest pain, hot flashes and increased my blood pressure.  My doctor suggested I I use only the 12.5 mg (the lowest dosage) 1 per day.  It took a few days for me to start feeling better but Ive been on 1 per day (12.5 mg) for over 3 weeks now with NO SIDE EFFECTS and it is really controlling my pain and depression.  Savella is a GREAT medication AT A LOW DOSAGE.  The prescription is very expensive even with insurance so my dr. wrote my prescription for 2 pills per day, but I only need it once per day.   So a prescription (60 pills) last me for 2 months which is a great help.  Savella works great for me at a lower dosage.  Dont give up, I know I almost did, keep trying meds at low dosages to control pain and avoid side effects.  Im feeling much better now, so I will try to start walking/exercising again.  God bless everyone.	F	45	3  weeks12.5 1X D	1/10/2011
1	Fibromyalgia	drowsiness, severe hot flashes.  I feel like I'm on fire inside.  My muscles hurt so bad it wakes me up in the middle of the night.  I can't get comfortable.  Joint pain has worsened.

4	Fibromyalgia; nerve pain	Had tried Lyrical with unhappy results( constipation, head spinning, sudden hair loss, bloating). Rheumy suggested I try Savella. No constipation this time ( ialso had IBS which errs toward constripation)...in fact I think I am going more often. Sometimes I get a tingly feeling in scalp. Blood pressure only pre-hypertensive when I check it at work once a day. Get occassional lightning type headache...but also have that from nerve injury due to a fall I had 2 years ago.	I am not feeling as achy or least less aware that I am hurting all over particularly in my spine. I promised my rheumy I would try it for 5 or 6 weeks this time. So far...not too bad.	F	57	14  days50 mg 2X D	12/11/2010
5	possible Fibromyalgia diagnosis	My head crawls sometimes which isn't bad, just annoying. My sinus's have cleared up great. I have bad allergies and have a sinus infection 4 times or more a year but now I breathe better. I had a few nights of no sleep but started taking the meds at 7 pm and sleep is much better. I have always had a headache everyday so I'm not sure if the 2 bad headaches I had were from Savella or just my normal sinus headaches.	I was in having all over body pain and aching. After starting Savella I was extremely nervous reading the side effects, especially the suicidal stuff. I am on an anti depressant and was afraid it would make things worse, but it hasn't I feel so much better. I still hurt some but the major pain and aching has gone away. I actually clean the house now and do things outside. Before starting the meds, all I did when I got home from work was lay down and nap or lay on the couch and watch tv. Had no motivation or energy for anything. So far, I have been blessed with Savella. I go to the doctor in a week to have more tests to see if I have Fibro and if I continue on this med. What ever is wrong with me...Savella has helped with minimal side effects.	F	47	4  weeks50 mg 2X D	11/26/2010

4	Phantom limb pain	Side effects are quite unpleasant.  I have to take Atenolol to lower my heart rate now because the Savella increased my resting heart rate to 115!  I have also had low to normal blood pressure.  Without the Atenolol, My heart races with the slightest exertion.  Also, I have testicular pain.  My doctor confirmed that this is a side effect of Savella.  I also have trouble draining my bladder while taking this drug also unpleasant sexual side effects..

Itchy painful rashes wherever I perspired; terrible dry mouth; constipation; dizziness to the point of falling over even while sitting down.	It worked to eliminate the pain and "fibro fog"; but the side effects were so ghastly as to impair my ability to do my job.  Diagnosed with FM 12 yrs. ago, I am now trying to taper off of this and my dr. will try something else.  I still feel terrible and am so saddened that it didn't work for me.

I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects.

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS.

We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
