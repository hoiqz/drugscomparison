5	afib	Heart rate in 50s alot of the time. I also take a beta blocker so maybe that is why.  Doc says not to worry unless pulse under 50.	2nd try at cardioversion with Multaq worked.  Have been back in sinus rhythm for 6 weeks.  3 breakthroughs. One episode afib 3 hours. 2 episodes about 22 hours each.  Spontaneous cardioversion back to sinus.   Very happy with this drug. Great to be in normal rhythm.	F	62	 400 mg 2X D	5/15/2012Email
5	A-Fib	Stomach cramps on occasion.	It took me several weeks to get used to this drug but it has been a very positive outcome for me.	M	43	4  months400 2X D	2/24/2012
5	afib	None	The French health authority have stopped paying for it so I'll have to stop. They claim ineffective and side effects. For me after several other drugs, two ablations and electro shock, this is the first time I've been trouble free for ten years	M	77	1  years400 mg 2X D	2/22/2012
5	a-fib	Lost sense of smell after a few weeks.  Known side effect, but I incidence is less than 1%.	Had three episodes over two years -  first followed by cardioversion, second by ablation and third by cardioversion.  Started taking Multaq after third episode and haven't had a problem since.

5	afib	Afib stopped after fourth pill. I do seem to be having bloating and gas, but it's better than afib!		F	39	5  days400 mg 2X D	1/15/2011
3	Afib	bad stomach aches and extreme bloating and gas.very hard to sleep because of discomfort	it stopped the afib ,which is great i also take digitech and metoprolol .I have severe asthma and take alot of meds that raise the heart rate which is what caused the afib in the first place..

4	AFib, Following Tikosyn & others	No apparent side effects.	Directions to take with food likely due to solubility (oil vs water)because drug uptake considerably greater (15% with food vs. 5% without. #'s are my recall from med insert small print details)I get breakthrough af episodes about monthly, lasting about a day. In the interim, I experience short lived arrhythmia every few days, lasting a couple minutes to an hour.	M	69	5  months400 2X D	8/24/2010Email
5	atrial fibrillation	slight stomach discomfort if not taken with a meal	I was previously on Rythmol for 2 1/2 yrs, was changed to Multaq because of breakthrough a-fib, fatigue and a general "drugged" feeling. Cardiologist told me Multaq has less side effects. The Multaq makes me much less tired. I still have occasional VERY brief runs of the a-fib, and can sometimes get dizzy if I get up too fast. I like Multaq better than Rythmol.I'm giving it a 5 because I feel that less side effects are a good thing, and even though I still get the rare brief breakthrough, this med has helped me quite a bit.

5	Atrial fibrillation	slight nausea if not taken with enough food	this medicine has stopped the a-fibs I was having almost daily which were causing  much distress.........it was prescribed in addition to the diltiazem I was already taking........so far no side effects	F	80	2  weeks	12/2/2009
1	arrhythmia	Feell terrible shortly after taking the pill.  I get spasms, especiallly in my legs, upset stomach, lightheadedness.		F	74	21  days	11/30/2009
