1	infection in toe	Diarrhea, extreme fatigue while taking. Severe cramps that woke me up every night for I finished taking it. Still having diarrhea, absolutely no energy during the day and sleeping a lot and achy legs. Been off it for two weeks and my toe infection returned.		F		10  days500mg	2/18/2013
2	Tooth abscess	I just feel lousy, like I have the flu. Lethargic, nauseous and irritable!! Not a great appetite and thirsty all the time. I called the pharmacy and pharmacist says this is typical for this drug. I will continue to take it because abscess is pretty bad!!!		F	43	6  days500 mg	12/22/2012
1	turf burn	diarrhea, chest pain/acid reflux, stomach cramping, severe vomiting, felt like I had the flu, etc.	Took this drug for about about 5 days, was supposed to take it every six hours but only ended up taking it two times a day and stopped before I was supposed to because it was so painful, got diarrhea immediately, had chest pain leading to what I thought was the stomach flu but now I believe was from this drug. Continue to have chest pain, wouldn't give this drug to my worst enemy. DO NOT TAKE!	M	23	4  days500 3X D	11/25/2012Email
1	infected bug bite on my leg	I started having severe stomach cramps and diarrhea the night I started using this drug. I also felt like I had the flu fora day and shortness of breath. But the worst is the stomach pain. I stopped using it after 4 days (prescribed for 7) and it has been 2 days and the side effects persist. I can only eat a simple diet (toast, potatoes, rice etc.) which is not good because I am 29 weeks pregnant!	I would never ever use this drug again! This is the first time I am reacting to a medicine like this. Usually have a string digestive system.	F	37	4  days 2X D	9/28/2012
4	Breast duct infection	I'm on my third day taking it for a bestBreast infection. It makes me so sleepy, not hungry and it have me a nasty taste in my mouth. I hope I don't develop any other symptoms. Oh and gas.At least it took away the swelling, pain and bloody discharge I had.		F	30	3  days500 mg	9/23/2012
2	Evidence of a UTI	Anxiety, racing heart, difficulty sleeping.	The first 3 doses didn't seem to make me feel badly, but shortly after the 4th pill I started getting anxious. I had only recently been getting over a period of anxiety in my life which I had never experienced before, so I'm not positive that the Cephalexin kicked it back in gear. However, nothing else has been going on to make me anxious, so I'm blaming it on the drug.	F	58	3  days500 mg 2X D	5/5/2012
1	Suspected Bladder Infection	Rapid heart rate and chest pain, vision impairment, pain in teeth, dizziness, headache, rash, nausea	I has take  Bactrim which made me hurt a lot so I got prescription changed to this.  I took 1 pill and had never had these types of side effects from antibiotics!  I am slightly allergic to penicillin but was told by my doctor and pharmacist this should be ok, and several hours later my eyes felt like they plastic over them things were so foggy!  My teeth hurt a lot as did my abdominal area (which is what I was taking it for), and the chest pains and heart palpitations were bad (and this is NOT listed as a side effect even though it is apparently common).  The nausea and headache didn't really occur until about 8 hours later.  This was too much for me, I couldn't even make it to the 2nd dose, very bad reaction.	F	35	1  days500 2X D	4/18/2012Email
1	sinus infection	became very ill, flu like, diarreah, blacked out, then began bleeding from rectum without any stool. After a day of this, admitted to hospital for the next 2 days and had colonoscopy along with other tests for bacteria and such.	All results aren't back yet, but was told not to take the drug, but that it probably didn't cause this reaction.I'm convinced it did, since this had never happened before, and stopped the next day after I quit taking the drug. Unfortunately, the docs wouldnt let me go until other things were ruled out, due to the blood loss.	F	53	3  days500mg 2X D	4/4/2012
3	UTI	Diarrhea,Body aches,Upset stomache,Gas.One day it even made me feel like i had the flu.	This drug makes you feel awful!! And it smells really bad!!!	F	19	7  days500 4X D	2/6/2012Email
1	UTI	Extreme Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Difficulty Breathing, Loss of Appetite. Fast Heart Rate and Pulse.	Only took for 2 days. Could not handle the anxiety.	F	61	2  days500 2X D	1/26/2012
1	Finger surgery after saw accident	No side effect other than minor gas.	Have some infection on index finger after surgery. Cephalexin did nothing for it after taking 108 pills.	M	66	27  days500 4X D	11/10/2011
1	Problems Swallowing(pharyngitis)	Really bad bout of ThrushReally bad indigestion which is still ongoingStomach crampsReally bad acne when normally very clear skin	Took the drug for 6 of the 7 days I should have taken the tablets due to the Thrush. Given this because I am allergic to Penicillin. The symptoms abated but never went away and are now back.	F	44	7  days250 4X D	10/12/2011Email
1	bladder infection	I believe I developed acid reflux disease!!!	Had to quit taking it on the 6th day due to gas. I am now experiencing awful pain between the shoulder blades and pain in legs. Would not take this again!	F	62	6  days500 MG 2X D	7/28/2011Email
5	Acne (facial, back, etc)	Maybe a little tiredness but aside from that none!	LIFE SAVER. Doctor prescribed this with clindamycin topical gel to help my acne and within DAYS I had seen a huge improvement. No reportable side effects and my face is as clear as ever!	M	20	1  years500 mg 2X D	6/18/2011
3	cyst	Terrible joint pain, especially in back and neck; pretty bad acid reflux; headache. Tylenol does not help these problems.  No diarrhea or gas like others mentioned.	Terrible joint pain, especially in  neck/shoulder area, and back; pretty bad acid reflux;  chronic headache. Tylenol does not help these problems.  No diarrhea or gas like others mentioned. I was given this for mile cystic acne. It does seem to help that, temporarily, but these side effects are horrible.	F	45	6  days500 mg 3X D	3/27/2011
3	respiratory infection swollen gland	I was sick 10 weeks.  I had sore throat, persistent chills, and some dizziness with illness, but after taking this drug, dizziness worsened and I had hiccups too once a day for five minutes.  Inflammation in chest worsened.  Swollen glands under arms reduced by 50%, but still hurt after completing drug. Sore throat resolved after six weeks.  Was it due to drug??? I eat yogurt every day any how and did not experience yeast infection.	Noticed new symptom after completing drug, added to my chills, were intense icy cold sensations in the skin of my thighs and butt.  Skin felt cold as well.  Never experienced this before and don't know the cause. Had to take Ibuprofen for some relief.	F	55	5  days500 mg. 2X D	3/23/2011
1	Cyst removal	Contracted C. Diff -- sick, sick sick sick sick 3 weeks later.  Make sure you REALLY need to take this before ingesting any.	STOP this drug the very SECOND you get diarrhea.  Ugh.	F	35	  1X D	2/27/2011
1	cellulitis in finger	I was prescribed Cephalexin for cellulitis in my right ring finger after adverse side affects from Clindamycin and sulfur meds. I have had NON-STOP diarrhea after taking it for two days. I am also on the BRAT diet and Gatorade. I am losing sleep from chronic diarrhea and rush to the bathroom at work. My mom and I are praying this will end. I told my doctor I stopped taking it. I never experienced diarrhea like this. I'm angry this drug is on the market. I'm worried this will be part of my life now.	Didn't help my infection and is causing me misery..	F	44	10  days500 4X D	2/19/2011
2	preventive care	I had to take a one pill in the morning and one at night for 7 days. By the 6th day, I developed a yeast infection. I know this is a downfall in antibiotics but the first time it has happened to me. Also made me gasey and have to frequent the bathroom. And similar to other antibiotics the pills stink!	I do not know how well this medication works because I was never sick, I took this med as preventive care after a surgery. I just know the itching from the yeast infection was horrible, I just started medication for that today.	F	23	7  days	10/24/2008
1	sore throat (not strep)	painful bloating, constant gas, inability to digest food normally, unintended weight loss (went 10 percent below my normal weight), constant thirst, shakiness caused by low blood sugar	Took this med 15 years ago at age 27 and my digestive system has never fully recovered. Almost immediately lost ability to digest milk, followed by impaired ability to digest any food. Food passed thru my system in as little as 30 min. I ate all meals alone for one year due to unbelievable amount of gas. Extensive probiotics helped. I used digestive enzymes for months, also helped.	F	27	10  days	4/5/2008
5	Cystitis	Thrush, but this was easily cleared by using an over the counter pharmacy product. Sore throat (possibly not related)	This cured my cystitis very quickly, much more so than other antibiotics I have been given previously. It did give me a bout of thrush on days 2-5, but completely cleared the cystitis symptoms within 24 hours. Really pleased with result as I had resigned myself to at least 48hrs of pain.Also, someone else mentioned an allergy to penicillin may make this drug unsuitable for you. I'm allergy to penicillin and was fine.	F	26	5  days	8/30/2007
1	Sinus infection	I got major stomach aches,lots of abdominal cramping,diarrhea,and nausea that would not go away. I have been off Cephalexin for several days, and my bad symtoms,and side effects will not go away! I feel the sickest I have ever been! This antibiotic has destroyed the lining of my stomach, and done damage to my intestines.I would stay 100% away from it entirely. After all that, it did not cure my sinus infection.	Do not recommend it at all. It is really toxic, and bad.	M	66	9  days	7/6/2007
5	Strep throat	none	My 9yo boy went from severe pain and fever to running and playing within 12 hours.  By 24 hours he was back at school.  He responded very well to this med.	M	9	10  days	3/30/2007
1	Respiratory Infection	I got a stomachache that was constant. Then I got severe diarrhea. I couldn't leave my apartment for 1 1/2 weeks and could only eat the BRAT diet (I also added yogurt), even a few days after I returned to work. I started burping and other funky noises stemming from gas in my stomach (150+ times per day!), and had too much acid, too.  Many doctors said I was just swallowing air.  I told them I was swallowing the same way I did for the first 28 years of my life.  My present doctor told me I have acid reflux and will for the rest of my life.	I won't go near this drug with a 20-foot pole. I do realize many take it with no problems. I'm just one of those that can't. I count it as an allergy even if no doctor has specifically said that. Having it down as an allergy on my records will keep them from giving it to me. (Age listed here is the age at which I took this medicine.)	F	29	7  days	12/15/2006
4	Spider Bite	Tired!  I was in bed by 8 pm everyday when taking this med.  Really lythargic as well....	I was on it for 10 days - after the 2nd day my spider bite (which was really severe) had stopped throbbing and swelling.  it was hard to remember the 3 x a day for 10 days though :)	F	26	10  days	9/10/2006
2	Acute bronchitis w/ sinus infection	I do not believe that this medication did anything for my bronchitis that time and rest could not have done alone.  On top of everything else, this antibiotic gave me a serious yeast infection.	Beware of taking this drug if you are female.  Most of my female friends end up with yeast infections after taking cephalexin.	F	26	1  weeks	2/26/2005
2	Crohn's Abcess	First 2 days, symptoms were much worse before better.  Improvements after about 5 days, but after day 6, the infection returned - plus the smell and taste is from hell...		F	30	7  days	2/4/2005
1	After eye lid surgery.	Cephalexin attacked my colon and was near death until they discovered the cause.  Operation had to be done to repair colon.  Doctor said that he was not responsible.  I was in hospital for two weeks and only after a year and a half have I recovered completly.  The doctor said only 1% have this reaction but who wants to be the 1%?	Would not advise anyone to take this med.	F	74	3  days	1/2/2005Email
4	Sinus Infection	Some stomach side effects, no bad, mainly cramps	This is the second time I take it for sinus infections... It's ok.	F	28	14  days	10/5/2004
3	Strep Throat	Could not tell if I was having problems due to strep throat, or the med (night sweats, racing heart, panic attacks).  Unsure...	It cured my 6 week old case of strep throat after Levaquin, Zithromax and Erithromycin failed.  Read somewhere that Strep is not resistant to Penicilin (which I am allergic to), but can do something with enzymes to make it less effective.  This drug combines the effectivness of Penicilin and is not impacted by the enzyme thing (so it said...).  Be careful, there is a 20-30 percent chance that you will react to this if allergic to penicilin.  For me, it was worth the risk.	M	39	10  days	8/5/2004
