3	NERVE DAMAGE/CHRONIC PAIN	SEVERE constipation, 'high feeling, irritability	This med helps for my pain but the constipation has gotten so bad I was at the ER the other day because my bowels were literally stuck. I was given a rectal suppository and some oral laxatives which temporarily relieve the situation. It's not just Lorcet that does this I have also taken Norco or just plain Hydrocodone. These meds slow your bowels and it's imperative if you are on them long term to drink plenty of fluids, increase fiber and use stool softeners!!!	F	29	2  months	1/25/2010Email
4	Chronic pain from lupus, RA, fibro	Occasional constipation	I started out on regular Vicodin 5/500's and as time wore on & my pain got worse, my doctor switched me from those to Lorcet 10/650. Now I get LESS acetaminophen daily but more pain relief. This drug has been a LIFESAVER. If not for it, I would not be able to have any semblance of a normal life. I take 1 pill 3x per day with Flexeril 5mgs. Oh, and to combat the constipation... just make sure to drink lots of water, eat a high fiber diet and take Colace or Senokot-S when necessary.

2	Chronic Pain	Stomach discomfort - just a feeling of blah. Normal constipation w/narcotic pain relievers.	This was the biggest waste of a copay and a doctors prescription. This medication was made by WATSON - 10mg/650mg - and was awful. No pain relief - a feeling of constant stomach blah - and just an overall feeling of still discomfort.	M	23	2  weeks	6/12/2006
