1	Jock Itch	HORRIBLE MEDICATION! A doctor prescribed this to me for a jock itch infection. I followed up with him a few times and he kept prescribing it telling me it was working. It caused skin atrophy, i have stretch marks, and worst of all I have a constant burning sensation and my skin gets very red. It has been 4 months since I stopped and have not had any improvement. DO NOT PUT STEROIDS ON YOUR GENITALS, YOU WILL REGRET IT.	Any doctor who is going to prescribe lotrisone to a guy to put on his genitals should stop and think about what you are really doing to that person.	M	30	2  months30mg 2X D	9/4/2012Email

5	Yeast infection	none.	My husband has also been prescribed this medication and we cannot find it loacally. The doctor does not want to use the generic, feeling that this product is more effective.I found it cured my problem very well. My husband has been to 2 other doctors who prescribed medications that did not work. He is using the remains of my tube and has already gotten relief. None of the pharmacies in Keene, NH have this medication. It takes a month to get it ordered.	F	68	3  days	7/19/2004Email
