				F M	 	 	    
3	High blood pressure	None	Started on 1mg, increased to 2mg three months later, have been on 2mg/day for over a year now.Began taking it the same month as I took my first cholesterol-lowering pills and hypothyroid medication: mildly increased libido and increased general activity level three months later were likely due to thyroid meds, not Mavik.Average daily BP lowered from 170/115 to 145/90. I self-medicated and increased doseage to 4mg for two weeks but it didn't bring the numbers down any further. Yesterday, doctor prescribed a water pill in hopes of increasing Mavik's effectiveness.

3	high blood pressure	Constant running nose, sinus drainage, fatigue and dizziness.	It has lowered my blood pressure, am presently on 8mg per day	M	57	3  months	12/29/2006
3	hypertension	drowsiness, dizziness and some fatigue	I started on ,5 mg per day then after two months, increased to 1,0mg per day. Initial BP was 170/110. Mavik was relatively effective, but pressure remains high (150/95).	M	46	3  months	9/4/2006
4	high blood pressure	an annoying dry cough; ticklish throat	it did lower my blood pressure	F	59	10  months	8/3/2006
1	High Blood Pressure	Severe fever, flu-like symptoms, blackouts, extreme vertigo so I couldn't stand up.	Not for me.  It must work for some people or I presume they wouldn't sell it.	M	45	3  days	5/8/2006
3	Hypertension	Started Mavik at 1 mg for 2 weeks, developed a dry cough, heart pounding and drowsiness. However it did bring down my bp and stopped protein spill in urine. Am going to discontinue to try Atacand.  Altace gave me the same problems.		F	52	2  weeks	11/25/2005
3	High Blood Pressure	Causes constant constipation which is somewhat alieviated by fiber suppliments.  My Blood pressure has been reduced.		F	60	3  months	7/30/2005
2	High blood pressure	The cough drives me nuts. Absolutely no sex drive and I'm tired all the time	It seems to be keeping my blood pressure at 140/85, which still isn't good enough. I'm going to talk to my doctor about switching drugs. I've been on mavik 2 mg for 10 months since I had a cecerian section and lost a lot of blood.	F	26	10  months	6/23/2005Email
2	HBP & kidney protection (diabetes)	1 and 1/2 months after starting Mavik (2 mg./day), I developed a dry (nonproductive) cough that is particularly irksome at night. This is coupled with an always runny that doesnt respond to any allergy medication.  Now at 5 months on Mavik and these symptoms are worse.	Mavik is completely effective at controlling my HPB at 2 mg./day.  None of the terrible side effects I experienced on the Beta-blocker Metoprolol (fatigue, lethargy, depression, weight gain).  I have sleep apnea however, and it's tough enough already to get a good night's sleep without coughing all night.  If you don't have the runny nose and cough, or it's tolerable, Mavik works well.  I'm on to an ARB next to see if that works for me - Benicar (olmesartan).	M	44	5  months	9/20/2004

3	hypertension	Persistent cough worse at night, upper respiratory mucous and tickling, increased loss of libido, increased fatigue. Not sure how much is attributable to Mavik, but doctor switched me to Avapro after seven months because of complaints about upper chest and persistent coughing and fatigue.	Mavik appeared to control my BP by end of day, but morning BP readings were still higher. Probably because I was started on minimum dosage, but after seven months did not want to increase on this drug because of cough that would not go away, plus occasional acute fatigue & drowsiness.	M	56	7  months	9/7/2004
2	high blood pressure	lowered sperm count	didn't seem to lower blood pressure as well as other meds. Doctor suspected it lowered my sperm count	M		5  months	6/4/2004
2	Hypertension	At 2mg no side effects, but when I needed to increase the dose to 4mg, my libido dropped to zero. My doctor didn't tell me this could happen. I don't think doctors think this is important to women.	I also take Maxzide to control my blood pressure. The combination of an ACE inhibitor and diuretic work, but I don't consider Mavik a good choice for me.	F	57	2  years	4/18/2004
4	Blook pressure	none		F	79	3.5  years	1/15/2003
2	Hypertension	Moderate joint pain,runny nose, watery eyes, painful nipples, lowered sex drive.	After dosage increased to 8mg/day the BP remains high 177/96	M	51	7  months	12/8/2002
1	blood pressure	Although it did lower my blood pressure, it eliminated my libido and 3 years later I am still having problems from it.  My doctor forgot to inform me about this side effect		M	27	5  months	7/18/2002
2	high blood pressure	It lowered my blood preasure but the sinus drainage was more than I could stand.		M	49	5  weeks	6/20/2002
