4	asthma	shakiness, increased heart rate, anxiety	it's saved my life, so i'm willing to put up with the side effects	F	17	12  years	3/11/2009
5	Asthma	I have been taking albuterol for 20 years and have had very few side effects unless my asthma is not doing well and I take too much of it.  This can make me nervous, and my heart race.  It can also make you a little nervous and shaky when you first start taking it until your body gets used to it.  It can cause insomnia if you take it too close to bedtime so I take it about 30 minutes before I go to sleep to avoid that.	Would recommend.  It has been a life-saver for me.	F	40	20  years	6/12/2008
5	asthma	shakiness but not extreme	very effective, has saved my life on numerous occasions	M	17	12  years	2/21/2008
1	Perceived Asthma	breathing worsened.  anxiety, panic attacks, shakiness, resting heart rate went from 55 to 130.  Went from running long-distance to not being able to walk in a week at 25.  Ended up on disability with a permanent disruption to my body's ability to respond to adrenalne properly.  Ended up with a permanent breathing condition.		F	27	4  months	9/19/2007
5	moderate to severe asthma	shakiness if I am having a particularly bad asthma episode, and have taken more than the prescribed amount, but I would rather be shaky than unable to breathe and dead!	This inhaler gives nearly immediate, and complete relief!  I am positive that I would have died (several times) if not for this inhaler!  Even during a very bad episode, when I need to take 3 or 4 puffs, it clears me up completely within just a few minutes!	F	32	6  years	5/3/2007
4	unable to clear respiratory colds	nervousnees, shakiness, hyperactivity in both kids (6 & 3)		F	37	5  days	11/14/2006

5	asthma	If you take too much (more than 2 puffs) this stuff will give you the shakes.	I've been on albuterol since childhood and have learned not to go anywhere without it.  This standard medicine is called a 'rescue inhaler' for a reason!	F	22	17  years	4/29/2005
1	Pneumonia - wheezing	The worst!!  I was up ALL NIGHT wired the first night.  Finally fell asleep at 6am!  Extreme agitation, on edge, tearful.  I almost felt manic.  Stopped after 24 hours use.  Felt like its effects stayed in my system another 24 hours plus!	I would rather have a some difficulty breathing over feeling like this again!!!	F	45	1  days	8/25/2004
