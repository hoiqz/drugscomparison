2	blood pressure	Hair loss, calf pain, trouble sleeping, unable to lose weight(had been successfully in 6 months prior to use)	I was on this once before, I had extreme hair loss. My new doctor said it couldn't be from this drug. WRONG. had to buy a wig last month. stopped the drug. Have horrible headaches now. Blood pressure is within normal range. I have controlled type 2 diabetes, take low dose of Metformin for 3 yrs.	F	60	10  months80/20 1X D	10/18/2012Email
5	Hypertension	Because of switching jobs and the new insurance rules I have been off of Micardis 2 times in the last 4 years.  Each time I have been taken off and substituted a different BP medicine I have major problems.  The last drug Losartan kept me awake at night and caused constipation and worst of all I was tired all the time.  Second day on Micardis and I feel great again!!	I would guess there are some side effects but this is the best medication I have ever used.	M	64	4  years80/25 1X D	12/5/2011
1	High BP	Severe dizziness to the point where I was nauseous and could not focus on daily activities.  I felt like I was in a fog all day.  Headache all the time. I could not sleep at night.  Very restless.  I only recently found out this was due to the Micardis when I missed a couple of days due to not getting it refilled before running out.  I felt so much better when NOT taking the Micardis that I knew all of my problems over the last few months were due to this drug.  I stopped taking the drug and all my problems are gone.	Terrible medication.  Will never take again.	F	52	10  months80mg 1X D	2/19/2010
2	slightly high blood pressure	sore throat, violent coughing, slight headache, hot flushes, feels like flu or bad cold. maybe it is ??????????	not sure whether blood pressure has improved yet. If it is causing the way I feel I wont be able to continue	F	63	15  days	10/7/2009
2	high blood pressure	Headaches, lightheaded, tired all the time. Stuffy nose especially at night and toothache pain that I believe is due to sinus pressure. After about 2 months on it, my sodium levels are real low and I feel sick to my stomach all the time. Worse for several hours after taking it.	My doctor is taking me off it due to the low sodium levels	F	47	2  months	11/22/2008
2	slight hbp	None for days 1 2 and 3.Woke up day 4, took tablet of 40 mg at proper time. 1.5 hours later took a nurofen plus, just 1. within an hour I felt I could faint on and off. My heart was wanting to beat out of my chest. I was irritable and couldnt work out what I was doing. My partner returned home and asked if I was anxcious. I wasnt aware I was till he asked. Things got worse with the irradic heart beat. Scared me senceless	Arranged to go straight back to Doctors. Mine wasnt available so spoke to another. He did a BP test and it was down from the 4 days before. He ordered an ECG. This was fine also. I admitted that I had drank a few beers over 6 hours the night before but he didnt seem worried. He has taken me off the medication, and asked I up my fitness a bit more and concentrate on my diet. I am in a healthy weight range and am fairly active. BP and cholesterol are in my family unfortunatly. I know I will get my BP under control thru exercise and diet. (I will even cut back on the beer !) as it really wasnt so high anyway. I will never take that medication again after suffering an anxiety attack like that. I felt I was going to have a heart attack. I think the first Doctor should have given me a chance to lower my BP by myself before jumping in to medicate.	F	41	4  days	10/10/2008
1	High Blood Pressure	DO  NOT TAKE THIS DRUG IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY TO SULFA!!!  Vision changes, Shortness of breath,Blood pressure bottomed out, Cardiogenic shock,	I did not know I had an allergy to Sulfa, never having a problem before I was told to take this medication for high blood pressure, and return to physician's office in one month...after taking 1st pill on my way home, I was lucky enough to pull up behind a policeman and asked if he would call an ambulance. Arriving at the hospital, I was complaining I was unable to breathe, and was going down fast,intubated and transported to Georgetown ICU, lucky to be here...	F	57	1  days	6/30/2008
2	High Blood Pressure/CHF	Chronic sinus infections, nausea, weight gain	If my GP had listened and educated himself concerning the side effects, I think I would have been more open to sticking with the Micardis HCT.  Hyzaar was dreadful-bp was never under control with it like it is with Micardis but I have had 3 sinus infections over the last 16 months and gained 40 pounds since starting it.  I don't eat more (kept a food journal) but my metabolism is at a crawl now and I have hot flashes even though I am not menopausal. Since I found this website I am now sure it is due to this drug.

4	Hypertension	Too frequent urination, occasional dizziness upon standing.	40 mg. Annoying to get up at 2:30 almost every night to pee. Dizziness not often, passes in seconds. Blood pressure totally controlled.	M	54	2  years	2/17/2008
1	hypertension	after taking 1 mg for four days I developed terrible joint pain and muscle pain. My wrists were so painful I couldn't hold a coffee cup. My heels were very sore and also terrible muscle spasms in my upper back .	Will never take this drug again.	F	46	6  days	2/3/2008
4		dizziness	The blister pack is very strong and requires a knife to open it;I used 40mg for a year, then switched to 80mg and cut the pill in half. The second year, I took the full 80 mg. Lately, I switched to regular Micardid (without the HCT). With Metropolol at night, my BP is about 140/90 in the morning and down to 120/80 in the afternoon.	M	74	2  years	3/31/2007
4	High Blood Pressure	After trying four different blood pressure medicines, my Dr. put me on this one.  It has kept my blood pressure under control the best, but I do experience some dizziness and light headedness at times.  I am on the 80 mg dose, and wonder if a lower dose would be better.  Dr. does not seem to think so.  I will try for a while longer and see if the dizziness goes away.  I have headaches each day too, but not sure if it is from the Micardis Hct.
