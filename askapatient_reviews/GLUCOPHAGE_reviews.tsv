3	Type 2 Diabetes	Initially all was good. I have however developed a rash on both legs. I have also lost 20kg's since been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months ago and started taking Glucophage !		F	38	3  months500mg	4/7/2013
5			I am 28 years old and and was recently diagnosed with PCOS, although I think I've had it for years and years. I started menstrating at 11! I had such severe cramps that I'd stay home from school and in my mid 20's pretty much stopped having a period and started the most devastating acne:(  I am not pre-diabetic or really overweight (I always have 10 pounds to lose) but I am taking it to regulate my cycle, possibly clear up my hormonal and cystic acne:( and start to ovulate so one day I can have babies! My fiance is a family physician and was weary about me trying this med because of the side effects but we did some research and found almost definite ways to prevent the gastric and bathroom problems:-Always eat before and a little after taking the med.-Stay away from dairy, carbs (sugar and flour)-Limit your fruits to only a few a dayIf you stick to this plan you really shouldnt have any drastic side effects:) I have noticed an IMMEDIATE change in appetite and seems it is MUCH easier to eat a healthy diet because the carb cravings are pretty much non-existent!!! Feels like a miracle! I was always always a sugar and carb feen! Felt like it was controlling my life and it was so so difficult to resist junk.  I've only been on it 4 days but really feel like its a life changer! Hopefully it sticks around! I will update again giving it more time:)	F	28	4  days500mg 1X D	3/5/2013Email
5	Pcos/insulin resistance	First week it was rough. I adjusted my eating to be more low carb and lost 40 pounds in 3 months. My blood sugar is perfect now. Love it.		F	38	2  days500mg	1/2/2013
4	To lose 40 lbs gained from Seroquel	First I got extremely nauseous, my stomach was cramping, I went to the bathroom a lot, and I was extremely tired. Now those are pretty much over.	I am not hungry anymore! This is a miracle weight loss drug. I was skeptical but I literally eat maybe 1/3 of what I had before starting this drug. I hope to lose the 40 lbs I gained from Seroquel. I'll post another update after a few months of taking this drug but I think I'm going to be posting that I've lost a lot of weight.	F	27	5  days300mg 2X D	12/31/2012Email
1	Type 2 diabetes	It turned me into a ticking poop bomb.  I could have sudden and explosive diarea at any time, as well as constant upset stomach.  I stopped taking it and became regular again, and I felt a lot better.	And it did nothing for my blood glocose level.	M	55	3  weeks500 mg 2X D	6/29/2012
3	Type 2 Diabetes	No nausea. However, 1 week after initial dose,   I noticed some itching on my arm then some spots on my legs.   Now I have some sort of eruptive rash on both legs, front and back torso.  There is at least one other documented case.	I am afraid I will have to stop taking it.  I feel good. Blood sugar dropped dramatically and I lost 8 lbs the first week.  I hope there is something else that works as well without the itchy, bumpy rash.  It looks like some sort of pox.

3	Hyperinsulinemia and wt loss	Mild nausea and stomach upset for first 2 days and when I take it I feel very very hungry after 3 hours and I tend to eat not more but only  to fulfill my hunger		F	38	7  days500 mg od	6/12/2012

5	Insulin Resistance/Pre-Menopause	I have not experience any major side affects except some brief nausea which passes as quickly as it comes.	I am thrilled and I am only 3 days into it. I have already lost 2.3 lbs(and this is my PMS week where I usually gain 4-5 lbs) and have energy like I haven't had in a while. My appetite has decreased and my cravings for real sugary foods have pretty much disappeared. I will repost weekly to update this information.	F	40	3  days500MG 1X D	3/12/2012Email
4	PCOS	I've only been on metformin for almost a week now. Im on 500mg a day and gradually working my way to 1500mg a day(3 tabs). The first day I had major diarrhea all day. The next couple days it was only once a day. The past 3 days I havent had one bowel movement, but have felt major nausea. My appetite has decreased and Ive only been eating because I have to, not because I'm hungry. Sometimes i'll feel hunger come on but it either quickly subsides when I think about food or I will eat and feel nauseous half way through. Smells also make me nauseous. I'm going to start 1000mg tomorrow, and we'll see how that goes. It's really too soon to decide whether the drug is beneficial to me but my hopes are high.		F	27	6  days1500mg	2/21/2012Email
3	TYPE II DIABETES	i started to experience nausea stomach upset and my stool is brown and very watery. Apart from that i do not have an appetite which is good because i want to lose weight at least 20 to 50 pounds so i can get off of this medication.	Overall very satisfied	M	47	4  days1000mg 2X D	2/4/2012Email
4	pcos and ttc!	Well at first I was very nauses and somewhat and that went away in No time!! Metformin is a great drug because at first I couldn't get my period on my own and now I look forward to 1 every month! As for me concieving I have yet to accomplish that! Hopefully one day bt I'm just taking it one day at a time! As for women out there having problems like me! Don't Give Up There's Always Hope! #BabyDust..		F	21	8  months500	12/28/2011Email
1	PCOS	horrible, constant diarrhea at any dosage. could not live a normal life on this drug.		F	31	4  months2000	12/28/2011
5	Pcos & weight loss & insulin resist	Mild nausea, horrible migraines NSAIDs didn't help, complete loss of appetite, no sugar or carb cravings. I love this medication! My migrains have subsided and the nausea is bearable but the real kicker is the fact that i have absolutely no appetite whatsoever... Everytime i even think about food i feel sick. Thats extremely strange for me considering i used to love food. i guess you could say that i had a sweets/carb and grease addiction. i also used to drink nothing but diet coke and now i can't stand the thought of it... and i quit smoking too! this medication has been a life saver :-)		F	25	1  months2000mg	12/15/2011Email
2	weight loss	Extra fatigue.		F	57	3  months500 daily	11/28/2011Email
5	PCOS and weight loss	Horrible diarrhea and vomiting the first few weeks until I realized that I needed to space 6 hours between doses. Now I just have loose stools and the occasional diarrhea.	I love this medicine.  After 4 years of constant weight gain no matter what I did (100 ibs in 4 years) and a doctor that wouldn't help me, I switched doctors and within 4 days of my first visit she put me on Glucophage.  I have already noticed a big difference.  I'm no longer hungery all the time.  I have much more energy.  My acne has cleared up somewhat and my facial hair is starting to disappear. I find out next week just how much weight I've lost, but I can already tell that I've lost some.	F	22	4  weeks500mg 3X D	11/2/2011Email
3	Type 2 Diabetes	Mild stomach upset for brief period. Tiredness.	The first day was the only day that I experienced any mild stomach upset and after that I really don't have it anymore. I do however feel very tired. I started on a dosage of 500mg of the extended release form once a day. My fasting number came down, but not enough so my doc upped it to twice a day. Just started on the 2 pills a day this past weekend so not sure if its working just yet. But just so afraid of feeling this tired every day of my life. I am only 36 and my husband is a young 40. We have no kids, so I dont think i should be feeling this way at 36. I just want to come home  from work and lay on the couch...but I force myself to cook dinner, clean up, and watch some TV. Hubby is great and helps me alot. Thankfully I have someone in my life who cares about me as much as I do. I just want to feel good again. Also, has anyone ever experienced any hair loss on this medicine? I have very thick and lots of hair on my head, as do all the women in my family. I just want to make sure it stays that way!! I just read some stuff and am getting myself worried.	F	36	3  weeks500mg 2X D	11/1/2011Email
3	Diabetes	Constant watery stools and stomach cramps. Strange, as no problem on 500 x 3 times a day.		F	57	30  days850 3X D	9/21/2011

5	Insulin Resistant/Possible PCOS	Lack of appetite/no sugar or carb cravings (HUGE achievement)/frequent urination	In the past 3 years, I've gained 50-60lbs for no apparent reason.  My mom has lived with this weight around her waist for years with no explanation.  Finally, my OB-GYN diagnosed me with Insulin Resistance 3 days ago, and it seems like I have ALL the symptoms!  I never would have guessed that my acne and severe fatigue could be associated with this.  Anyway, I am taking 500mg once daily, and I will continue to add 500mg weekly until 1500mg daily.  So far, I have not had a BM (which is normal for me because of my severe constipation).  No stomach upset so far.  I have increased urination from 3 times daily to 6 times daily, and this is hopefully solving my water retention!  I have no desire for sugary or fatty foods, and my carb cravings are finally something that I can manage!!!  So far I'm quite optimistic, but I will update in a few days.  Lets hope for some weight loss/regularity/and a menses this month!!!	F	25	3  days500mg 3X D	9/10/2011Email
4	PCOS	In the begining I had the dreaded diahorea, but the frequency of it has diminished considerably. Nausea from time to time. Reduced appetite.	I like this medication. It has helped me. I was diagnosed with PCOS and am taking the Metformin with Ocella. The first month I had a menses when I hadn't been having it regularly since, well, EVER. I have changed my diet to a reduced carbohydrate diet so that is why I believe I don't have the tummy symptoms as most people do. If I drink more than 2 glasses of OJ I get nauseous, don't know why yet, but it never happened before I started on the medication, so I place the reason there. It is very important to reduce junk food and fast carbs and high fat foods when on metformin, that is the exact reason why you get the tummy issues. The junk food wants to raise your blood sugar and the metformin is trying to lower it. It's a battle in your insides where the drug wins. Messily, LOL. I have lost weight as well, about 11 pounds with minimal exercise but I feel I've plataued so I'm going to be going to the gym now. All in all, metformin is a good drug as long as you are serious with it and change your diet for the better and healthier.	F	25	7  weeks500MG 3X D	9/6/2011Email
4	Insulin Resistance	Tiredness, headaches, gas, loose stools.  Thirsty all the time. And yay it took my sweet tooth away!	500mg Glucophage XR - Glad it has cured my unhealthy sweet and fizzy drink addiction, when willpower alone could not do it. Still waiting to see the scales move though. Watch this space.	F	36	18  days500mg 1X D	9/2/2011
4	To treat PCOS	Horrible nausea, excessive gas, stomach pain, frequent restroom breaks	I was prescribed Metformin after I was diagnosed with PCOS. Over the course of 4 weeks I will go from one pill a day to four a day (500 mg each). I'm currently at day 9. The side effects aren't anything unbearable. I've definitely been through worse. The 2nd day of taking this medication, I was in the restroom 4 times, so if you're about to start taking it, be prepared! I was started at a lower dosage because the side effects would be more harsh if I started out at the 2000 mg. I was told by my Dr. that many people can't tolerate the full 2000 mg a day and they have to decrease it to 1500 mg due to the person constantly being sick. Within the first 5 days of using Metformin I lost 6 pounds.	F	26	9  days500-2000MG 1X D	8/9/2011Email
3	PCOS	Flu-like aches and fatigue for first 3 days	I had relatively few side effects - only mild aching for the first couple days, which could have possibly just been some kind of cold. I'm taking it for insulin resistance caused by PCOS. My periods are still absent and I still have a small amount of facial hair. It hasn't helped those things, but hopefully it's keeping my pancreas from having to work so hard at producing insulin. No real side effects so I can't complain, and it's dirt cheap - $4 at walmart	F	22	4  months500 2X D	6/10/2011Email
5	PCOS	Diarrhea & stomach cramps over the 4 weeks buiding up to the full dose (+500mg per week util I reached 2000mg)...but symptoms were eased with a low carb diet	It has worked wonders for me, after a few weeks my periods were every 33-35 days (rather than every 3-9 months)...I have lost weight (12 kg to date) but through a low carb diet & gentle exercise rather than the Metformin alone (I think if I upped the cardio & cut back further on the food the results would be more drastic)...I am more energetic and am sure the facial hair is less noticeable....It has transformed my life (and will hopefully enable us to create one in the near future) xxx	F	37	7  months1000mg 2X D	6/9/2011
3	help with PCOS	Doctor  increased my dosage from 1000 to 2000 mg of metformin daily... no real side effects except unbelievable diarrhea... thinking of asking the doctor to reduce the dosage		F	44	6  months1000 2X D	6/9/2011Email
2	PCOS	The brain fog was terribe. It made me feel like I had the flu.		F	30	7  days500 3X D	4/22/2011Email
3	PCOS	Severe, emergency diarrhea, nausea, gas, heartburn, acid ingestion.	I'm taking it for PCOS.  Have been trying to get pregnant for over a year now.  I've been on 2 times before and suffered terrible diarrhea both times.  This time I'm willing to give it more time.  I'll keep you posted.	F	33	2  days500mg 2X D	4/21/2011Email
4	PCOS	Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, bloating, sleepiness, headaches.	I experienced terrible diarrhea, nausea, vomiting from this drug, however, if you give it the chance, stick with it for a few weeks, and get through the side effects, they subside, and the results are- for me- ovulation and weight loss.  This is very important because not only are my chances of pregnancy increased greatly, but my chances for diabetes and gestational diabetes are decreased because of the weight loss.  I suggest it- but you must be patient with the drug.  These are KNOWN side effects.  If you must, increase more slowly.  For me- it was worth it just to increase more quickly because every increase gave me more side effects, so better to feel terrible for 2-3 weeks and be done with it.  Than to feel terrible for a week and a half three times for each increase.  I suppose it depends on what you are willing to deal with....	F	25	6  months500mg 2X D	4/7/2011Email
1	PCOS	Nausea, loose stools, headaches	I took metformin for my PCOS and never lost any weight. I never had elevated blood sugar levels. I am now unable to eat any meat products due to the nausea, and am suffering from a severe vitamin b12 deficiency. Since I quit taking to metformin, I can at least eat what little I can without running to the bathroom. Not sure if this drug caused all my problems, but beware ob/gyns who think this is the answer to PCOS. Now I can't even touch my hair without if falling out or breaking.	F	36	7  years850 2X D	3/21/2011
4	PCOS/insulin resistance	Diarrhea alternating with slight constipation, cramps, stomach gurgling, headaches, bursts of energy	I was on this med about 5 years ago.  Had similar side effects, except for these weird bursts of energy!  It definitely helps with weight loss (the first time I was on it, I lost about 45 lbs along with diet and moderate exercise), which in turn will help lower my chances of diabetes.  And that's pretty awesome because I HATE needles.  It's worth some of the discomfort to me.	F	25	1.5  yearsup to 1500 1X D	3/20/2011
4	early stage of diabetes	Slight headache and nausea, frequest bowl movements, slight stomach cramp.	Thankful I found this forum, because I was concerned about the symptoms I was experiencing and comforted by the fact they seem to be very common.	F	66	2  days500 1X D	3/12/2011
4	Insulin resistant/PCOS	Loose stool, felt out of breath a bit - this has subsided, sleepiness - subsided, belly bloat - subsided.	I take with meals morning and night.  I have had no nausea or vomiting.  I have had some loose stools, more like regularity.  My face has cleared up some.  I have noticed that sex is not as intense :(  I am not sure about weight loss since it has only been a month.  My period has not appeared as of yet.  My moods have improved and I don't have that terrible shakiness if I don't eat anymore.  My blood sugar (not fasting) was 140 before and now it runs 120 (not fasting).  I am going to stick with this for another month or so to see what happens.	M	37	1  months500 mg 2X D	3/6/2011
5	type 2 diabetes	A bit of nausia and loss of appetite until I lost about 30 pounds.  I'm sure the weight loss helped me a lot.  I am off medication now, but I stuggle to keep my blood sugar normal.Type 2 diabetes is reversable.		M	57	9  years500Mg 3X D	3/5/2011Email
5	Insulin resistance	Nausea the first few days, "buzzed" feeling but focused and energized, appetite decrease, less obsession with food, totally turned off by carbs	Didn't experience too much of the gastro side effects (I think) because I have been eating minimally processed / paleo / whole foods for several years before starting Metformin.  I'm sleeping better and stopped snoring 3 days after starting.  I know I've lost a few pounds but haven't stepped on a scale in a while so don't have exact numbers.   I do get pretty hungry when it's time to eat but it is a physical hunger.  I'm not suffering fogginess or confusion from highs and lows of blood sugar.  I am very hopeful.  Nothing else has helped me lose this abdominal fat.  Will keep you posted.	M	47	1  weeks500mg 3X D	2/25/2011Email
3	Pre-diabetic	Almost daily diarrhea and indigestion	I have been wondering why I have been having so much diarrhea.  I have had problems with it since I have gotten a little older anyway, but it is getting worse.  For the last few months I have not been exercising or dieting and eating whatever I want.  I think I have finally realized reading these posts that I must cut my carb consumption.  I am going to try that and see if I lose some weight and the side effects diminish.  I'll let you know!

3	PCOS/Insulin Resistance/TTC	severe diarrhea, occasional constipation, changes in appetite, I can be starving one minute and then completely turned off by food the next, gas, bloating, stomach gurgling, stomach cramps	Taking the extended release version of Metformin has really helped with my side effects.  Also, taking the medication at night between dinner and bedtime helped me. Originally my side effects were so bad I considered going off the drug.  All I can say is stick with it, it will get better. I still experience the side effects, but no where near as severe.  I have lost about 8-10 pounds in the last 6 months while taking Metformin (without exercise and without changing my diet).  This medication has reduced my cycle length from 45-70 days to 33-36 days.  However, I have not ovulated on my own.	F	30	6  months1500 mg 1X D	1/29/2011
4	PCOS	The 1st week I was taking 1 tablet in the evening before bed. I felt dreadful. Tired, dazed, bloated. I didn't have too many stomach issues though. Just felt like I had flu symptoms. Then I upped the dose by 1 more pill in the afternoon and had no side effects. After 1.5 weeks of taking the medication, I felt back to normal.	I am taking this medication for infertility. I'm very slim so had no idea I might be insulin intolerant, anyhow, after 2 months all my cysts have disappeared and I'm therefore hoping I'll fall pregnant soon.	F	31	2  months500 2X D	1/26/2011
3	Insullin resistance	Gas, bloating, flatulence, diarrea, occassional naussea and recently intermittent anxiety or feelings of dread.	Started taking 500mg a day for two weeks then 1000mg for one month then went up to 2000mg in the morning after breakfast. I noticed that the symptoms of upset stomach decreased quit a bit when I cut out or limit my carb intake to one serving of carb per/ meal.  Recently I noticed that the anxiety comes on when the meds peak (around mid-day).  It has helped to lower sugar levels but I have to watch my carb intake for it to work.

3	PCOS/IR	diarrhea, but also constipation...mostly have subdued but every few days it still happens	so i know this is for a review but please please if anyone could answer a question, so i've been excerising at least an hour every single day without fault some days over 2hrs and trying to stay under 1200cal/aday but im not loosing weight? when i get to 2000mg/a day is that when everyone noticed weight loss i feel crazy excerising so much and not eating everything i want when im not loosing weight. Please email me with advice or when u noticed weight loss what your dosage was?	F	18	2  weeks500mg 2X D	12/26/2010Email
4	PCOS	Occasional cramping and diarrhea, mostly after eating fatty foods. Decrease in appetite. A few episodes of mild heartburn.	I was very nervous to start this drug because of all the side effects I had read about. I'm terrified of vomiting (emetophobic) so the fear of side effects was quite strong. Overall, though, it's not too bad, and I'm relieved. The cramping and diarrhea can be inconvenient, and there have been a couple of times that I've stayed home or come home early to be in my own bathroom. One great thing is that I find that I'm not craving chocolate anymore, and don't really feel like snacking. My advice? Don't be scared by others' side effects, and give it a try.	F	32	16  days250mg 2X D	12/22/2010
5	PCOS	stomache cramps and diarrhea after that, loose stools, tiredness so I take it at night	As soon as I started taking it, my period that had gone on for 60 days just stopped. My energy level has improved significantly in the past 2 weeks, and my mood has been elevated a lot. I feel like this drug is going to change my life for the better. No weight loss, but I have the energy to get to the gym and really feel I can do things of my own volition now!	F	22	14  days500mg 1X D	12/14/2010Email
4	pre-diabetic	Constipation. Condition did not change with XR. Interestingly, when it was taken in the night (before sleeping) instead of morning with breakfast - no side effects, no constipation! Go figure.		M	52	4  years500 Mg 1X D	12/6/2010
5	PCOS and insulin resistance	I have occasional headaches and stomaches. Most days I have explosive diarrhea but other days it is regular. The smell is awful. I have very painful cramps before the explosive kind. I have to stop what I am doing because of the pain.	I have lost more than 50 pounds while on this medication. I have less body hair and I have a lot more energy. I had a loss of appetite. It also regulated my periods. The pain was worth it, I feel great!	F	21	2.5  years750 2X D	12/1/2010

4	PCOS	I literally had no side effect;just that I got extreme hunger pangs for the first two days and a bit of nausea. The side effects lasted for just 2-3 days after I started the medicine.	I lost 2 kilos in one month without working out at all. My ovary size (which were bulky otherwise)went down drastically in this one month too.	M	29	1.5  months500mg 3X D	11/13/2010
4	PCOS	slight nausea at times and some diarrhea (once a week at most), 5-10 lbs weight loss	I have been taking metformin for 6 months now to try to treat PCOS as my first attempt at treating infertility. Although this medication did not help regulate my cycle, I don't mind being on it. I feel as though it has regulated my blood sugar, I have lost a few pounds without trying (always good, right?) and the side effects have been fairly sporadic and minimal. If only it had worked to treat my PCOS!	F	33	6  months500 MG 3X D	10/22/2010

I started out with the 500xr and got up to 1500xr a day.I had no side effects at theat time. I did some research and found Met good for weightloss too! I asked my doc to take me off the XR as I read it's less effective for  the weightloss part and put me on the regular. She did, now I am taking 1000 in the morning and 1000 at night but I have had no decrease in appitite at all. I only have stomach problems on the day I up the dose then I am fine. Right now I am trying to play with the dosages and take them at different times to see if that helps. Anyone have any insight on the appitite decrease?	F	38	2  months1000 2X D	10/10/2010Email
4	Insulin Resistant/Weight Loss	Constipation, gas, bloating, upset stomach, loose stools	I started this medication slowly with 500mg for 1 month then moved to 1000mg for 2 months. During this time I have experience slight appetite decrease and actually had some constipation. With my follow up Dr appt she has increased my dosage from 1000mg to 2000mg. I have only been taking this for 2 days now but have experienced looser stools but only in the morning so it doesn't affect my daily routines.	F	34	3  months2000 mg 1X D	9/29/2010Email
4	PCOS	Gurgling stomach, loose digestion, fatigue, and decreased appetite.	It is a relief to have a medicine that helps fertility that does not make you gain weight! I have been on metformin leading into assisted conception and first trimester of a successful pregnancy. I am back on now for pcos hoping for another successful pregnancy. I am happy to take the bad with the good that comes from this medicine.	F	40	7  months850mg 2X D	9/28/2010

With diet you can control diarrhea/constipation. I have really bad headaches on the top of my head :-( Any ideas what to avoid or help with that?

5	insulin resistance/to help wt loss	none lasting. started slowly at MD suggestion, 500 mg then up to 1000 in one week	My NP offered this to me to aid weight loss. I had excellent results - 296 to 215 in about 10 months and have kept it off. I was aware going in that I would only lose about 60% of what I needed to lose to be of normal weight, but was willing to give anything a try. I watched my portion size and carbs, but essentially the weight fell off.	F	55	2  years1000mg 1X D	9/4/2010

3	Insulin Resistance/Weight Gain	Loss of Appetite (initially), nausea, tiredness, acne worsened, bloating	2 hour insulin test was high, although blood glucose was normal. I'm in that peri-menopausal phase and had weight gain around the middle that I could not lose, despite strict diet & exercise. Diagnosed as insulin resistant.  Started on 500mg and went to 1,000mg after two weeks. Then tried 1,500mg but could not tolerate. Initially lost eight pounds, but plateaued after that. It made my irregular periods very regular, but unfortunately, made my acne alot worse. Med makes me feel very bloated with alot of water weight gain. Tired all the time, even though I take Vitamin B Complex/B12. I take generic and pills smell disgustingly fishy...yuck! I am slowly discovering this med may not be for me in the long run.

3	metformin	nausea, mild headaches, loose/soft stools, dry mouth and loss of appitite	I was diagnosed with PCOS and have gained weight in my belly. My periods come when they feel like it and my husband and I have been unable to concieve since our last child 6yrs ago. I started out taking this drug once a week for a week and just started twice a day. I had nausea and loose stools and still do but not as bad. I can't speak on the area of helping regulate my cycles yet but I have lost 5lbs since taking and hoping to loose more as well as concieve more children.	F	24	2  weeks500 2X D	7/27/2010
