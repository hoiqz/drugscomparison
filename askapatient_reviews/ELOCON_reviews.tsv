1	Eczema	Difficult to identify whether the problems I encountered were associated with the Elocon or the underlying condition.	The systemic addiction problems associated with this drug are not publicised. The withdrawal process is HORRIFIC. Read itsan.org if you are using it or thinking of doing so for more detail.

1	eczema	I developed an itchy stinging rash that would keep me awake a night, and experieced upsetting mood changes. The lack of sleep had a unfortunate effect on my ability to do my job.	I would never use this again	F	43	1  weeks 1X D	7/12/2011Email
5	Psoriasis	none	Used sparingly and correctly Elocon is wonderful for reducing redness and swelling associated with psoriasis. It isn't a 'cure', more a management tool to be used with other medications such as Daivonex.	M	30	5  years	9/12/2008
1	tick eczema	pustules, hives, rash spread all over my body, increased and  debilitating itching leading to bleeding, small haemorrhages under skin due to skin thinning .....	Neither my dermatologist or pharmacist warned me about the side effects - I had to research myself after the rash got worse and hadn't cleared up after 6 months & 4 visits to the dermatologist. I could have stopped it 6 mths ago had the doctor realised the pustules were a side-effect - instead he sent me for pathology of the pus filled lesions. Then he was going to do a biopsy of a lesion on my back. All these have cleared up since I stopped using elocon. The side-effects can be debilitating. Just be warned & informed!

5	eczema	not seen yet, other than knowing it is a steriod which might have bad side effect if use for long time.	Elocon is very effective in clearing away my two-year-old son's eczema around his lips and knee/wrist creases. Normally the flare-up will go away in a day or two. The skin will be smooth for a few days before next round coming back. So i would classify it as temporary relief for eczema. We are still looking for permanent cure.	M	40	12  months	4/30/2008
1	Rash on fingers	I developed Perioral Dermatitis as a direct result from using Elocon.	I would NEVER recommend using Elocon for anything!  Elocon has many nasty side effects, one of which is Perioral Dermatitis.	F	49	1  months	3/19/2008Email
5	Allergic Rashes	None.	It is a life saver. I have unexplained itchy rashes that break out and this takes care of them right away!	F	42	10  years	12/27/2007
4	contact dermatitis	skin changes, thinning of the skin, darkened areas	I have used Elocon for over 9 years (since i was a child). I regret that I didn't use it with much caution as would be expected with steroids as i didn't understand the implications but overall i have had good control with it. It hasn't cured my dermatitis though. I dont know how much longer i will need to use it but i am concerned about the long term side effects i.e. the amount of steroids entering my bloodstream causing complications such as diabetes mellitus.

5	eczema		This is the best steroid medication I've used and I have had eczema  since I was born. It stops the break outs so they don't spread and it's not a heavy duty steroid so you can use it on your face. I have not had one negative side effect with it, not even burning on open cuts.

4	Eczema	Burning sensation at site of application.	I use it for my son when his eczema flares up.  It gets rid of any flare-up within a day or two.  My son complains that it burns, but I notice that it only burns in areas that he's scratched, not in areas that he hasn't.  I only use it when necessary, and only in affected areas.  Elocon keeps his eczema under control for weeks in certain areas and months in others, and it works almost right away.  It has never taken more than twice a day for two days for the Elocon to make the rash go away.  My son has had eczema since he was a couple of weeks old, so we've tried everything... Elocon is the best!!!  I even use it around his mouth, he used to break out there the worst... but he hasn't had a flare up there since last summer!	M	3	1.5  years	4/25/2006
5	Excema all over	Got acne like pimples all over which contained pus.  However, it cleared up the excema in 3 days, and then had to take anti-biotics to clear up spots!	It's great for a quick fix, and I have tried everything!	F	32	4  days	2/28/2006
5	Eczema	None.	This is the best cream to stop eczema break outs. I've had eczema since I was born and this is the only thing that really works.	F	26	8  years	2/18/2006
5	Dry skin problems	None	Took away soreness, itching and cleared up affected areas	M	47	4  weeks	12/10/2005
1	Eczema	I had a lot of burning and stinging when applied to my hand where the Eczema was at.		F	26	5  times	3/11/2005Email
