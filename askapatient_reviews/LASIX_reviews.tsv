2	Reduce fluids	Inadequate erections..	Poor erections - full but soft and rubbery even with Viagra and a cockring. Penetration has become a real challenge because I've been accident prone (premature ejaculation) all my life.I've read that this (impotence) is not an uncommon side effect with this particular medication.

1	Water retention, swollen ankles	I was getting horrible chest and lower jaw pain.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  I called my cardiologist and he checked me out and said it was panic attacks (I am going through alot of stress).  I stopped lasik for a week and the chest and jaw tightness went away.  So, I am going to assume it was Lasik.  Will stop again and see what happens.		F	54	30  days20mg 1X D	8/24/2012Email

5	CHF and High Blood Pressure	None	This drug literally saved my life!! I have 2 leaky heart valves (one severely,one mod.) with some regurgitation. However, I have functioned great until now and now require both valves replaced. It is one reason the need for surgery was not required until now!	F	56	10  years40 1X D	4/29/2012Email
5	Congestive Heart Failure and HBP	Frequent Unrination	I was diganosed with CHF 2 months ago and I am only 37 years old. I was at 250 lbs and am now at 170 lbs. I see my regular doctor, cardiologist and nurse on a weekly basis and they have confirmed the rapid weight loss is actually good for me since I was so overweight. Lasox along with my HBP (lysinopryl) and CHF meds (Coreg) plus a high fiber and low sodium diet has lowered my Blood Pressure and the weight loss has me feeling like a new man.  It looks like I've hit the plateau at 170 but docs want me to get to 130 to get the fat from my belly and liver. Just hoping I can keep up with the lifestyle to maintain my new eight.

5	Edema in my legs and ankles	I have been taking Lasix for a very longtime, and now it is not working, I am taking 160 mgs per day, I do not know if I need to increase the dosage, it is a great medication, keeps my weight down, no more edema, but for soem reason, not working anymore, any thoughts?

1	labile Blood Pressure			F	65	1  days20 mg 1X D	5/21/2011EmailHistory
5	Post Surgery Leg edema	I didn't notice any side effects.	I used it "as needed" and it did the trick.  Do remember to take it in the morning as it will make you urinate quite often.	M	52	2  weeks 1X D	5/12/2011Email
3	High Blood Potassium	Hate having to be in the bathroom so much, etc. Very dry mouth. In the night my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.	I do also have leg swelling, which Lasix helps. I think it also causes me to have less energy. High potassium is a serious problem, so unless there is another way to reduce it, I guess I'll just continue to know where the bathrooms are at every store I go to.	F	64	9  months20mg 1X D	3/10/2011
1	Heart		This killed my father	M	74	  1X D	12/24/2010
5	CHF, valve replaced	Excellent to keep BP and CHF under control.  Sweet potatoes, bananas, and oranges increase Potassium enough & easier on stomach.	After the hospital was on 40 mg a day, gradually tapered to 10 mg a day and doing great at 93.  Also take CoQ10 100 mg a day and MDR.com CardioTone twice a day, plus Captopril 6.25 mg AM and PM.	M	93	3  years10 mg. 1X D	11/30/2010
5	Congestive Heart Failure(CHF)	Cramps..from dehydration	If you are taking this drug before bed time...Stop...you will not be able to sleep...you should only take it when you have little or nothing to do...If going shopping...do not take it until you get home..you will spend more time going to the bathroom than shopping..Also, your Doctor should be telling you to take potassium for the cramps...because laxis will dehydrate you...causes Cramps. I buy over the counter potassium...it is cheap and I take one or two when I get the cramp's or while taking the Furosemide. This is a great drug if you have CHF...when I feel a heavyness on my chest and have a hard time breathing, I take one of two of these pill's..along with using my Nebulizer..in 2-4 hour's, the swelling in my leg's goes down and my breathing become's easier.

1	swollen ankles -h.b.p	at first this drug was ok worked good and got rid of swollen ankles! however within aprox 3 weeks of taking it at 20mg per day with verapamil at 240mg  I began to have sudden wake ups at night with very high blood pressure readings! and rapid heart beats ! my breathing was messed up from this drug hard to explain but had drop outs and deep breaths off and on happen when sleeping or trying to sleep! got very bad internal shakeing  jittery feelings threwout my body that traveled head to toe ! however when sitting up right and awake it stopped ?	after reading online and talking to RN and Pharm at the local cvs store,I found I had allergic reactions to the medication- I also broke out in Hives on my back and stomach and arms itching bad and burning hot feeling. the excessive peeing at first had stopped and was back to a normal deal again as before taking this drug ! the ER doctor told me to stop it -dont take it again.  im now on spirolactone it seems to work better with less reactions to it. but we will see ?  im not a fan of taking drugs !! and this one lasix  is a one Nasty medication to take ! to strong !	M	57	2  months20 1X D	7/17/2010
3	high blood pressure	muscle cramps and spasms of inner thigh area.  often at night it will wake me from sleep.  also high creatnine level reading that was reduced by stopping my night dosage 80mg and I also take coenzyme 10 now.  But lasix helped me extremely when I was admitted to hospital weighing 400 lbs. and fluid almost went into my lungs.  Lasix works fast but overtime, you can develop leg/muscle cramps.		F	59	4  years 2X D	7/8/2010
2	blood pressure high	dehydration rapid -dry mouth -tightness in chest off and on! headaches bad ones ! vision blurring while on it, not lowering b.p at all - no sleep at night and when sleep comes nightmares and vivid dreams going on ! stress feeling ! internal jitters when wakeing up or trying to sleep threwout body from it	this stuff works for swelling ankles and legs but does not help with b.p lowering at all -its distroyed my sleep at night and also dehydrates rapid the side effects from this med are bad !!  not worth taking at all   I have stopped it totaly !  and wont take it again ever !! bad stuff !!	M	56	2  weeks20mg 1X D	6/27/2010Email
4	Edema from other prescription drugs	If I don't eat foods rich in potassium, I can start to feel very ill.  Lethargic, extreme sleepyness, almost flu like symptoms.	It's helping keep the swelling and bloating away thatI always get from taking another prescription med. In the past I would stop talking the medication because I could not deal withthe bloating and swelling.	F	43	3  weeks20 mg 1X D	6/26/2010
5	Peripheral Edema in Feet and Ankles	Feeling a little tired but managed it with High Potassium foods.You need a bathroom available at all times.	I had Elephant feet, literally and Lasix 80mg twice a day solved the problem within a week.I still have the swelling but way less than without Lasix.I recommend this medication.Before taking Lasix make sure it won't intract with other meds you may be taking.Always ask your doctor or pharmacist.	M	40	2  weeks	9/17/2009Email
5	idiopathic edema	muscle spasms in calves and feet, postural hypotension	make sure to take potassium.  it usually takes about 1.5 hours to start working for me.  i take 80-160 mg as needed for fluid retention in my face and hands.  if i have to go somewhere or on a long drive, i'll take it at about 2 am so it's out of my system before i have to do anything.  you have to be close to a bathroom!	F	52	10  years	7/16/2009
4	Lower extremity edema, SLE kidney	Charlie-horse sort of sensation in lower extremities. My legs would cramp up and it would be the most excrutiating feeling! After supplying myself with more potassium, the sensations slowly went away. It was probably due to the hypokalemia you can get with the lasix.	Works within 5-10mins of use! So, be prepared!	F	21	6  months	6/21/2009
2	Hypertension	Reduced my kidney function dramatically!		F	59	17  days	4/20/2009
5	fluid after aortic dissection	light - headedness, ringing in the ears	I took three rounds of lasix while in the hospital. Lasix successfully pulled the excess fluid out of my body, including the fluid around my lungs. I literally lost 10 pounds in one weekend during one round of lasix. I have been off of my last round now for a week, and again I am having trouble breathing. I highly recommend this drug for patients with serious edema, however do not take it if you feel inconvenienced by running back and forth to the bathroom.	F	28	3  months	1/22/2009
4	water retention	Just some shakiness if I didn't supplement my potassium level.	This is a great diuretic, however it works very quickly so you need to be prepared to go to the washroom within an hour of taking it.   I tend to retain water a lot, so when I take it, it works quickly.  Unlike other diuretics that can keep you in the bathroom throughout the day at fairly regular intervals, I have found that Lasix works quickly (done in about 3 hours).  However, keep bananas around to help supplement your potassium levels so that you don't get shaky.	F	41	2  years	1/10/2009
4	fluid build-up around lungs/heart	cramps in legs BUT with potassium added the cramps are gone	If you are getting leg cramps talk to your Dr re: potassium deficienc e due to urinating so much -and loss of this potassium	M		2  weeks	3/22/2008
3	mitral valve regurgitation	Worked well with only dry mouth side effect for one year.  Then started to develop muscle cramps in both hamstring muscles.  These became so severe that I could hardly walk or sleep.  So have stopped Lasix.  Gained 6 lbs of water right away; hope muscle cramps will go away.	Good diuretic, as long as you don't get any major side effects as I did.	M	76	1.5  years	1/25/2008
4	Fluid build-up	dry mouth	removed some of the fluid but not all of it, also it makes you have to hang out by the bathroom door also causes dizziness	F	47	12  months	11/26/2007
1	Congestive Heart Failure	After about 3 yrs of Lasix (20mg) I developed an unknown allergic reaction that caused blistering on my hands and feet.  My feet would get 20-30 at a time and my hands would get hundreds at a time.  I had to take medication to keep the breakouts minimized.  This slow torture lasted 2 years or so.  Due to a situation on my part that engaged my stubborn streak I was without lasix for a month.  I realized that since I wasn't taking the lasix I also wasn't needing the pill for the blisters.  Started lasix again... blisters.  Stopped taking lasix... no blisters.  After 2 yrs lasix wasn't really working anymore for me so it didn't really matter that I stopped.  I could drink a liter of water have a lasix and still not urinate to excess.  I am still sensitive to processed foods and drinks however that are flavored with the wrong "fruity flavoring" (somehow related to a chemical in lasix).  No more blisters or claritin though.  Yeah!	Lasix is definitely not for me.	M	41	5  years	9/19/2007Email
5	heart failure - leaky mitral valve	dehydrated and thirsty but what do you expect from a chemical dehydration pill that tells your kidneys to flush all fluids now.	Great drug.  Pulminary edima it's my first choice.  Ate them like candy.  But while dying of fluid in lungs you learn how to survive.  I highly recomend SALT reduction as far better solution.  Food tastes like crap but it's better than chemical dehydrate you pills.  <700mg/day sodium was the #1 thing after lasix that kept me alive while waiting for new valve.  Less sodium means less lasix is needed and your life is better.	M	43	2  years	9/1/2007
5	insulin edema	helps with the edema from my frequent insulin dosage (ie keeps weight down) freq urination, thirsty, dry skin.  I couldn't live without lasix, works like a charm.	Be careful about overexposure of sun.  Lasix can intensify sunburn. esp on backs of hands.	F	36	1  years	6/17/2007
4	Edema for now !	none that i can actually say. I feel that a little tiredness is from peeing a lot.I'd rather pee a lot then put my heart all through that extra water fluid to carry. And, i am not a small lady. i am 5'7" 3/4.So, weighing what i do now which is close or on 200 is an awful feeling of unwanted retention.	I would tell you all to just give it a try. Of course, it may be a life saver for Me. I have had no relief from swelling (edema) for over 3 years or more now,gained over 50 + pounds more then i wanted to.I don't eat a lot of garbage and, food really has nothing to do with it. Its the fact that HBP,Heart Disease and, Edema are my biggest targets. Give it a few days to atleast Work. No, one likes going pee a lot but, I'd rather pee a lot, feel somewhat tired and, know that i can sleep and, not feel so bloated all the time. I have lost close to 5 pounds already. Now, thats unwanted water (fluid) as far as i am concerned .I don't need to carry that around everyday.My heart doesn't need to work that hard because my Body can't get rid of the bad toxins naturally. Now, i could end up not liking all the peeing and,unusual little tiredness but, people believe me when i do say, PLEASE---> give it sometime. I will keep you posted as to how i feel and, what happens. It has only been 1 Day ! =]	F	41	1  days	4/14/2007Email
2	hypertension	Not many side effects yet, other than not sleeping well and dry mouth.  Only on it one week so far	The potassium supplement seems to be more of a problem than the lasix but I am afraid to stop it without doctor approval.  I have had bleeding stomach ulcer this past year and reading the side effects does not make me feel comfortable!	F	59	7  days	2/21/2007
1	Congestive heart failure	Headache, generally feeling unwell, constipation, gas, lethargy.	Began to feel unwell about one-half hour after taking Lasix, felt unwell and not normal until about 5-6 hours later.  Very debilitating.	F	79	6  weeks	1/10/2007
5	hypertension	weakness in the legs, sweat, hot flashes the first 6 hours then feel much better.  Really helps to lower BP over a period of time, maybe a  month		F	53	4  years	7/28/2006
3	congestive heart failure in 2004	dry mouth, dizziness, bloated stomach, sleepy, feeling tired, and walking too slow.  I take one pill daily in the early am 20 mg tablet.  And, need to visit the bathroom every l 1/2 hour about 5-6 times a day.	I am better.  I took what the doctor prescribed...lasix, potassium, diovan for my bloodpressure, and correg for my heart since 2004 so that is 3 years but always felt tired with no energy and hardtime breathing.  In late 2005, I was desperate condition...I found a natural alternative product called stem enhance that after 1/2 hour taking my first two pills.. made me breath better again, able to talk on the telephone, climb upstairs, and walk in the mall. So there is hope...stem enhance gave me back my life.	F	63	3  days	7/17/2006Email
3	EXTREME swelling in both feet	20 lb weight gain since taking lasix, even though I urinate 30-40 times per day - I also have intercistal cystitis.  During the night my hands draw up like I have severe arthritis.  Bloated stomach, short term memory loss, extremely dry mouth, very lethargic.	While the lasix did relieve the swelling in my feet, which the doctor's never determined what caused it, and I lost 6 lbs. overnight, the weight was back up the very next day.  I have gone from 126 lbs to 145 lbs since september, and I am not eating more than I use to.  The pain in my hands and drawing up in them at night is very painful.  I also have dizziness and am very sleepy in the a.m., even after a good nights sleep.  Well, I wouldn't call it so good, due to the fact that I am up every hour on the hour urinating, and I take my pill early in the a.m.	F	47	2.5  days	7/17/2006Email
5	Hypertension, slight edema	Perhaps slightly tired at times but that might be my imagination and the dark days of December-January!	Diuresis is remarkable and 3 pounds in several hours is welcome. It's doing a nice job on my blood pressure. I had hoped that 40 mg. in the morning would be enough but I need to take an additional 40 mg. in the evening for more consistent BP control.It replaced thiazides which I had been taking for decades which gave me consistently low serum sodium. Blood tests in the works to see the effects of Lasix on sodium and potassium. Fingers are crossed.Extremely low price is a nice plus.	M	62	40  days	1/17/2006
3	congestive heart failure	its supposed to work for six hours. it worked for maybe two with me. i'm going to try demadex( torsemide ) instead. i take 40mg three times a day and still have to take an extra here and there.	from what i have read and experienced, although both are loop diuretics, people do not respond to them the same and often do better with one than the other, but its trial and error to see which is better for YOU.	F	36	6  months	9/13/2005Email
4	CHF & Cardiomyopathy	Frequent urination, Hearing problems.	I take a very high dose(280 MG)daily. Works like a charm.	M	41	4  years	9/7/2005
5	water retention	Slightly tired after taking	Could loose up to 3 pounds after one use!! Happy Day!	F	59	5  years	5/3/2005
2	high blood pressure	Lasix has raised my cholesterol and glucose levels and caused me to have a low white blood cell count		F	62	1  years	5/3/2005
4	Swelling of legs, blood pressure	Tiredness, frequent urination, dizzy feeling	I had congestive heart faliure last year and seems this medicine does help with pains in chest (along with other BP medicine and insulin for diabetes). My feet would swell so big I have stretch marks on them, and this medicine after a day or two takes it away completely. It does make me feel tired and a little dizzy after taking it.
