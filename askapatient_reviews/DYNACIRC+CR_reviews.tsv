2	lower blood pressure	extreme fatigue, acid reflux, blurred vision	I have become a sort of vegetable on this drug.  A once active, life-loving 60 year old who now hopes she can cook dinner or walk to the mailbox.  And BP is only out of the danger zone,not anywhere near good.	F	60	2  months5 1X D	5/3/2010Email
1	high blood pressure	horrible joint pain, fatique, muscle pain, headaches,complete loss of quality of life. It took 10 months and 3 doctors to finally figure it out. I thought I was dying, horrible drug.	horrible, awful, should not be on the market. I google dynacirc and the side effects I was having were not listed. I had to google dynacirc SEVERE side effects in order to see what they were. I wish I could sue them for the year of my life that I lost.	F	50	2  years	7/22/2009
2	high BP	NONE	NONR	F	41	12  days	3/19/2008
5	Hypertension and Parkinson's	Occasional minor flushing of the face	Very consistent regulation of blood pressure though it doesn't quite last 24 hours and it needs to be taken twice a day. No interaction with PD meds. Much better than the ACE inhibitor lisinopril with regards to consistency and edema. Hopefully, it will slow the PD progression as well..	F	63	6  months	3/15/2008
4	High Blood Pressure	Seems to do the job with no side effects.		M	59	10  years	7/14/2007
4	Isolated Systolic Hypertension	None so far and I've been taking this medication for 2 months now.  It isn't quite as good as an ACE inhibitor, but lacks all the nasty side effects that the ACE has (for me anyway)		F	66	2  months	4/24/2005
