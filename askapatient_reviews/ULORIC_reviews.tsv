5	tophaceous gout	none	I changed my rheumatologist because I felt my gout was not adequately controlled, especially when I started developing tophi on my hands.  My new Dr. put me on Uloric.  After 3 days of taking Uloric my uric acid was 3.2.  18 days after that, it was down to 2.9.  My uric acid tends to run above 10.  Even probenecid was not having an effect.  I couldn't take allopurinol because it raised my liver enzymes.  I also notice that it appears the size of some my tophi are diminishing.  Overall I'm content with the fast improvement.

1	gout	During the two and a half months I took this drug, I had more gout attacks (5) than ever before. Before using this drug, I might have had a gout attack every two months at the most. I used my colchicine to combat the attacks, but then, thats what I did before so I stopped taking it. I'm going to try something else.		M	65	80  days40 1X D	7/20/2010
5	gout	none	Lowered my UA from 9.1 to 4.4 in 2 weeks. 40 mg/day.  Allopurinol is cheaper and been around longer- works great for most people; I happened to be allergic to it.  If you need help with gout, go to gout-pal.com. they are not selling anything just a forum of fellow gout sufferers with outstanding advice.	M	44	4  weeks	1/30/2010
