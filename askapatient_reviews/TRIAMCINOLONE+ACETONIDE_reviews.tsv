1	back pain - 2 facet injections	Where to start . . . unbelievable fatigue, shooting pain in arms and legs, insomnia, hair loss, weight loss, blurry vision, headaches, mood swings, itching all over.  Almost 9 months since injections and still have side effects.  Other than back pain, healthy before shots.	How is it so many people suffer from this med and doctors deny any serious side effects??!! I asked before injections and was told they are safe.  Maybe some flushing of my face, that's all I was told.  And when I went back to docs about immediate, horrendous adverse reaction, they denied Kenalog causing anything.  Greedy #$%^&$%^!	M	42	1  days80 MG 1X D	6/2/2013
1	Allergies	I was given this shot by my doctor to treat allergies and wasn't told of the side effects, or that it was a steriod. I would not recommend this drug. I would advise anyone thinking of getting this shot to research before doing so. There are plenty of side effects and I don't think they are worth it. Every since having this shot, I've had difficulty sleeping, fatigue, muscle weakness, mood swings, confusion, depression, irritability, dizziness on and off, light headed, itchiness, flushing, tingling in arms and legs. Now I can't sleep without taking medication to help me sleep. I was relatively healthy prior to taking this. 		F	82	21  days 1X O	3/13/2013
1	injections for spinal nerve pain	After an epidural to my lumbar spine: severe pain, burning pain, jolts of shooting pain, constant aching pain, weakness, rapid heartbeat, dizziness.  The next day, I had a an extremely severe jolt of shooting nerve pain that was like a lightning bolt inside my body  I saw a flash of white light and almost fell down. I was terribly disoriented, could hardly walk. Any activity immediately triggered nerve pain that traveled throughout my entire body, especially the lower body.  Tingling, spasm, weakness.	EVERY TIME I have had a steroid shot for my spine, no matter what typeepidural, block, trigger point injectionsI have had NO relief and the horrible, severe symptoms I described here. Extremely severe pain and spasm continued for MONTHS, along with severe side effects, including weight gain, insomnia, weakness and horrible spasm, rash, flushing, and anxietyalthough with all that going on, how else could one feel?  Every doctor has denied that Kenalog would do this.  I think they know very well what steroids do. How could they not? By the way, if you HAVE to have a steroid injection, take an antihistamine. That will stop some of the side effects.	F	67	5  times 1X D	12/15/2012
1		A couple of days after I was given a  1 cc Kenalog 5mg injection on my scalp due to hair loss, my life was turned upside down.  Here are my symptoms:  Nigth-time panic attacks, anxiety attacks, adrenaline rushes up and down my spine, stiff neck, lower back pain, abdominal cramps, chronic diarrhea, digestive system disturbance,couldn't eat, bloating, stomach pain, itichy scalp, burning eyes and face, tinglyness and numbness on both arms, and upper torso, debilitating muscle and leg weakness, pain in my joints and feet, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, dizziness, vertigo, nausea, blurry vision, headaches, loss of hair, dry mouth, extreme thirst, deppresive state, general malaise, inability to focus, loss interest in anything I enjoyed, unable to work out, insomnia, increased urination.  I had this injection on April 2012, and today, Dec. 14, 2012, I am still suffering from most of this symptoms.  The thought that this will never go away scares me.	Does any body knows how long these side effects could last?  How long does it take for this medication to get out of your system?	F	50	1  times5 mg 1X O	12/14/2012Email
1	Allergies	Had a Kenalog injection in my upper arm in August to relieve seasonal allergies, as prescribed by my doctor.  A little over 2 months later I notice an indentation just underneath my shoulder.  After researching symptoms, I have finally put the two together. I am extremely upset that I was never told of this side effect!  I have read that the indent may get larger....and I am afraid of future side effects from this drug.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!

1	misdiagnosis of spine impingement	Pain in all extremities 6 months since injections. Pain began immediately following injections and was never experienced before injections. Consulted with many doctors who either flatly denied any connection to Kenalog (according to them, there are no lasting side effects) or are clueless about side effects (it appears they are unfamiliar with the drug's package insert material).	Look up article Understanding Potential Complications Of Epidural Steroid Injections: Practitioners need to understand and educate their patients regarding the full scope of potential side effects that can occur when receiving epidural steroids by two highly respected pain specialists at the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California. The article states in part: Despite the indisputable rise in the number of pain interventions, little has been written about the potential side effects of administering steroids into the epidural space. In fact, many premier textbooks allocate only a couple of pages to exploring glucocorticoid mechanism of action and then only briefly mention potential side effects. This lack of understanding has led many practitioners to navely view steroids as benign drugs without fully comprehending the broad scope of potential side effects that can occur when steroids are injected into the epidural space. Undoubtedly, adverse effects from epidural steroid injections are not usually lethal, but they can carry significant morbidity and may be very disconcerting to patients. To understand the full scope of complications that can arise from epidural administration of glucocorticoids, it is necessary not only to understand the technical/mechanical complications that occur with needle placement, but also to grasp the role of pharmacokinetics, steroid particulate size, and, most importantly, how glucocorticoids affect near	F	44	6  weeks200 4X O	7/31/2012Email

5	keiloids	I get an injection every six weeks and I am very happy with the results. I have very sensitive skin so my bra strap caused keiloids on my shoulders. They became big lumps and darkened my skin. Most people mentioned about a dent in the area of injection. Well, this is what you want to happen with keiloids. You want them to shrink and it also brings back the natural color. Once those big, dark lumps are flattened I will quit with the injections. I have noticed some irregular bleeding that mimics my cycle. Most of the time it's just spotting but it basically goes on throughout the month! However, I expect to have only 1 more injection and I will be happy with my shoulders and my cycle should return to normal.		F	28	4  months 1X M	5/24/2010
1	Shoulder pain	Drug nearly killed me. Doctor did not do any tests for underlying infections and this drug weakens immunity, causing an undiagnosed infection (Lyme Disease) to spread throughout my body causing pain most people will never know.  That was nearly 4 years ago and I am fighting for my life ever since.	Stay away from these kind of drugs at ALL costs they destroy your immune system	F	46	1  days	1/31/2010
5	Poison Ivy	none	This was a generic form of what kenalog is that i was taking. I have severe poison ivy allergy.  This was on my hand. My fingers were swollen to twice their normal circumference and very blistered. The cream worked within 24 hours after applying. The swelling went down and the itching was gone.  Did not have to use a lot of it either. Used less than what was directed on the bottle.  Remember you own your body.  Research and understand all that you can about anything that ails you. Know and understand anything given to you to relieve that ailment.	M	39	2  weeks	8/2/2008

1	for hip pain	I didn't feel like kenalog helped with my hip pain.  The worst thing, though, was that after a couple of months I noticed a large dent in my hip.  So, the only thing that drug did was kill my muscle tissue.  I'm 5 ft. 3 in. and weigh 110 pounds--I need all the muscle and fat tissue I have, especially around the hip area.	I never would have agreed to a shot of Kenalog if I had known what it would do to my hip.  No doctor can tell me how to get the muscle tissue built up again.	F	58	1  days	2/17/2007

I was getting up at night to urinate too because I was the one applying it. My daughter wet the bed at night for years until hit his medication was stopped.  It also contributed to major mood swings and depression in my daughter. Resolved when medication was stopped. It did NOT clear the rash.

Then it quit for five days only to start up again and now I'm on my 14th day again!  Bleeding will act like it is going to stop only to start up full force again.  Flow also has a lot of clots.

My dentist put some of this paste on it and then I applied it again in a few hours. I left it on for abt 3 hours each time and it was gone when I removed the paste the second time. All that gooey yellow tissue that would NOT go away, was gone and the ulcer looked calm. No redness. Still a little tender b/c it needs to re-grow the skin in that spot.

It does not sting like other canker sore medicines and it usually clears up the canker within three applications with relief by the second day. It is has worked miracles for me.	You will need an rx to get the medicine. My dentist had never heard of it, it was recommended to me by a regular doctor, but if you ask for it that can find it for you.	F	32	3  years	6/29/2009

It did nothing- except give me hot flashes, sweating, worsening daily migraines- and horrible atrophy. Here's the thing: my RIGHT hip has a peach sized crater and bruise, a crater forming under right buttock, and one forming on the front of my right leg!

1	Severe allergies	Heavy menstrual flow, large clots, cramps. Ended my last period on 5/16 (for seven days), started again yesterday, 5/23. Started having cramps in my foot after shot, they usually last about 10 minutes, not something I had before.	My doctor told me the one side effect would be that it might bring my period down a day or two, that I could deal with. To go from a normal four day period with a normal flow to a seven day, heavy flow is not normal, to have it happen again a week later is not acceptable. For women, I'd think twice about taking this shot and ask your doctor is there is an alternative.	F	41	  1X D	5/24/2013Email
1	allergies	Too many side effects to list including blurred vision, extreme cramping all over, insomnia, weight gain, hair loss, rashes, menstrual issues - all lasted over a year.

5	eczema	No side effects, no indentation at injection site.	I get an injection once a year for eczema and it is amazing.  I am usually itch free for about 7 months.  An added bonus is that two years ago when I had the shot for my eczema I had severe pain from plantar fasciitis.  A few days after the shot all the pain from the plantar fasciitis was gone.  I have an appointment tomorrow.  I will get my fourth annual shot for eczema because it is back.  The plantar fasciitis has not returned.   The kenalog injection has given me back my life.

I have noticed increased focus problems and depression/anxiety but I just thought it was from stress from work and home.  Now that the dent appeared along with pain at the injection site and after doing a lot of research, it is ALL related to the Kenalog.

1	spine injection for back pain	Pain all over, insomnia, menstrual irregularities, hair loss, weight gain, dizziness - all persist 6 months after injection.	This is a very potent drug w/many potentially serious (even life threatening) side effects. A doctor recently told me that corticosteroids cause more side effects than any other medication. The 11.13.12 reviewer who seems to consider this a miracle drug and says "most of the comments I read are nonsense," is incredibly uninformed and sounds like a rep. for Bristol-Myers, Squibb, the manufacturer. Corticosteroids can successful reduce pain for many people, but many others suffer long-term, debilitating side effects.	F	35	1  days80 1X D	11/14/2012

1	lower back pain	flushing, suicidal thoughts, despair, nausea, collapsed	It's only been a week and I'm horrified after reading other experiences of what may still come, but here's how it's been so far.  First night I felt flushing (normal).  Woke up next morning suicidal and hopeless and unable to control my crying.  Felt fine later as day went on.  Woke up 2 days later - everything fine.  Then midday, within an hour I felt flush, nausea, burning like hot water feeling in chest (which I thought may be anxiety and I thought nausea was because I needed to eat. )  I went into a restaurant and felt strange but couldn't describe it and wrote it off then next thing I now I collapsed onto the floor.  I wasn't dizzy, it was like my brain and body stopped communicating and I couldn't sit up I was completely limp.  I also had a hard time articulating words.  Spent 4.5 hours in ER with tests all around heart issues.  My heart was FINE.  It was the Kenalog and when I told the doctor that he wrote me off.  I called my own doctor who had given me the shot and spoke with his assistant who also wrote me off and said to see my PCP because collapsing was not caused by Kenalog.  I beg to differ.  I was fine BEFORE the shot!  I still feel like gumby (weak) legs at times.  Seems to be getting better but I have been a wreck.  I will NEVER get this shot again.

Sleep difficulties include difficulty staying asleep, often impossible to get back to sleep and frequent mild nausea, which comes and goes. Second dose in April 2012 (was unaware of Kenalog conerns until now) and  5 months later (Sept) have dent in left buttocks, increasing in size and sesitivity. Sleep and nausea difficulties continue, as does some blurriness of sight that appears to have emerged out of nowhere, also lack of focus is area of extreme concern, a sharp contrast to my background and profession. Now have bruise like pain on dent as well as weakness/pain in depths under dent - likely hip/leg bone when bearing weight walking up stairs. Unsure how long effects will continue, or whether they will worse. Delayed reaction makes me wonder if/when things could deteriorate further....

Several other specialist visits and blood works didn't show any abnormalities but symptoms persists for 5 month now.My doctor didn't informed me about the possible horrible side-effects neither even disclosed what type of drug did he inject into my shoulder. Please be careful using this drug, the side-effects could be way more extreme that the original cause. Check out my blog if possible and allowable to post it here. http://kenalogneveragain.wordpress.com	M	42	1  days10 1X D	9/11/2012Email

Also, extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of muscle and weight loss.	Have been doing a lot of research since MDs are apparently clueless about the side effects of the drugs they most frequently prescribe and have no interest in problem solving. For those with an indentation from soft tissue injections, find medical article "Treatment of Local, Persistent Cutaneous Atrophy Following Corticosteroid Injection with Normal Saline Infiltration" by PETER R. SHUMAKER, MD, JAGGI RAO, MD, AND MITCHEL P. GOLDMAN, MD. Apparently, saline infiltration which is easy to do, works to fix the indentation (but good luck finding a doctor who has heard of this); you should be able to find the abstract for the article online and the paper at a medical school library. A good dermatologist should know about this technique or be willing to investigate it for you. For other issues such as muscle weakness, extreme fatigue, nerve issues, get your adrenal glands checked by a GOOD endocrinologist. Corticosteroids are known to interfere with adrenal gland function which can result in a host of uncomfortable to debilitating symptoms.	F	44	6  weeks200 mg 4X O	7/17/2012

Tingling and deep itching sensation in arms/hands/legs/feet continues, 3 months after last injection January 2012. According to 2 doctors who seem somewhat informed (not the docs who administered the injections), it's nerve irritation which is a possible side effect of Kenalog (it seems that the workings of Kenalog are not fully understood by anyone). Like so many others here, I was told that these injections are safe and carry very low risk. I was not informed of any side effects other than the possibility of the face turning red. The docs who administered the injections had apparently never heard of or seen the side effects I have although it's detailed in the Kenalog package insert material; I provided them w/a detailed account of the reaction I had and they suggested more injections.

4	asthma related breathing problems	Heavy vaginal bleeding; severe muscle cramps in my calves in both legs; itchy, red rash that doctor says is eczema (yeah right); fatigue; burning, itching in body; dizziness; blood sugar levels affected	I received a shot of kenalog for asthma related breathing problems and was told that I had a wet sound in my lungs.  I was having extreme amounts of wheezing, breathing problems, and counghing fits.  The Kenalog injection my doctor gave did help with these problems.  Normally, this would have been greatly appreciated.  Of course, I began to experience light bleeding and spotted with my monthly period then stopped.  Several days later I began to have heavy vaginal bleeding.  This has continued.  My calves have both began having severe muscle cramps.  I have an itchy, red rash on my elbows, around my ankles, and on one knee cap.  The doctor that gave the shot said that I have eczema (yeah, right) and prescribed a cream for me. He gave me a sample of this cream to use for two days so the cost would not be so great.  I was to use the steroid cream for two weeks only.  I found out this is also the trima.... whatever the spelling is that is a steroid so this continues the bleeding and things because even once the kenalog leaves my body, there will still be some steroid from the rash in my system.  I was told by the ob/gyn office not to be greatly worried that kenalog does this, but they are seeing me in their office to err on the side of caution.  I have had bouts of dizziness and fatigue.

Symptoms that lasted about 2 weeks: insomnia; red, puffy face, red chest; felt kind of manic and extremely irritable; throat closed a few times felt dizzy on and off.	I had 4 shots (2 epidurals and two facets) over a 6 week period (200 mg. total of Kenalog). The last injection was Jan. 20. Most extreme and lasting side effects: extreme tingling and a deep itching sensation in arms/hands/legs/feet; numbness down one arm; intermittent cramping, stabbing, and pricking sensations all over. Any movement aggravates these symptoms. These symptoms have not subsided at all. Like many others here, I was not warned of any of these side effects. Also, the docs. who administered the injections have apparently never seen an adverse reaction other than "mild facial flushing." Please read this recent Bloomberg news article about the dangers of steroids, including Kenalog:http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-25/bristol-myers-warning-ignored-on-steroid-shots-tied-to-deaths.

You will need to leave basic info. such as name, age, what/when/where/how much of the medication and side effect symptoms.

Wish I had read this before taking these drugs!Irregular Heartbeat Does your health plan include high doses of corticosteroids? Heart problems, including stroke and heart failure, could result, depending on the dosage. Heart irregularity and steroids are the focus of a significant new study.High doses of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, often are used to bring down inflammation quickly in people with arthritis, asthma or allergies. A 2006 study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine indicates they also may bring on changes in heartbeat. The study showed taking corticosteroids, such as prednisone, increased the likelihood of developing new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF)  the most common type of irregular heartbeat.Irregular beating means blood is not being pumped efficiently, causing heart palpitations or flutters, fatigue, shortness of breath or difficulty exercising, as well as possibly causing blood to pool, clot and lead to a stroke or heart failure. AF increases the risk of stroke fivefold  a concern for those with inflammatory forms of arthritis, who already have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including stroke, heart attack and heart failure.In the study, researchers followed 7,983 adults who were part of the Rotterdam study in the Netherlands for 10 years. Those who used corticosteroids were nearly four times more likely to have AF c	F	62	30  days 1X D	2/12/2012EmailHistory

The shots left enormous bruises that lasted for months. Worst of all,  I am so incredibly upset to report that a year later, the area where I received the injections still hurts and I have indentions in my gluteal muscles on both sides. I was a petite, fit person and I don't even recognize my body anymore. I have been diagnosed with POTS syndrome because of issues with tachycardia and fatigue that I have developed. I've also developed fibroids in my breasts, moon face (what my family loving calls my turkey neck), a strange rash that still won't go away after a year, my hair started falling out, I've struggled with depression...

My DR states it can lower immune system and make healing/recovering hard for viral, bruising and/or cuts/scrapes. About 3 weeks in the pain from arthritis and swelling went away but a massive headache appeared and has been with me for 3 weeks. the headache overlapped the viral thing so i associated it with the viral infection...but once that started to cleared (about 4 weeks) the headache didn't leave. I also noticed a SEVERE change in my irritability level, very dark depression, anxiety/panic attacks and having emotional outbursts. approx 3 weeks in as well. again we just thought it was from lack of sleep from being so sick with the viral but when the viral cleared up	I WOULD never recommend this medication to ANYONE without first advising them of the possible side effects.When I ask how long this will be going on for the reply has been until the drug has left your system which could be 6 to 24 weeks.

Car accident 5/08.  Unbearable pain in knee  first shot two years ago gave great pain relief for about three months. Spinal blocks and steroid flushing twice (not sure if two or three areas) with some relief for damaged disks.  Another knee injection two months ago.  For a week I felt like I had the flu.  Some scary heart issues but figured I was being paranoid.  Pain in knee was MUCH worse.  Early and heavy period followed by another heavy period a week after  both extended.  Headaches, strange rash, hard strange pimples on my thighs, breast discharge, nasty leg cramps. Had vaginal ultrasound (fun), blood tests, exams, etc.  thinking the big C (endometrial or ovarian).  All negative.  Friend mentioned possible medication complication but I wasnt taking anything.  Light came on and thought of the shot I just had.

5	Cervical Sponylosis with Myelopathy	Immediately after treatment - high energy, insomnia, insatiable appetite (30 lb weight gain).  One month post treatment - severe depression, anxiety, nausea	IThis medication helped my pain immensely although I have reinjured my neck from physio and pretty much bedridden again.  Now I am experiencing terrible side effects.  Called the pain management doctor and he denied it is the drug.  I had 3 shots two weeks apart with the last shot on July 22.  I had fantastic energy but could not sleep and gained 30 lbs in six week.  Now one month laterI am now severely depressed.  My mentsrual cycle is completely messed up.  I have terrible nausea.  When I suggested this was caused by the medication the pain doctor said I had the flu and it was not from the Kenalog.  I am going to see my G.P. on Tuesday and request blood work to see if I have adrenal insufficiency because the nausea is overwhelming.  I've never felt so terrible in my life.  But I do have to admit that until I reinjured my neck it was the best thing for me in terms of pain management.  I don't know if I will take it again if offered because I absolutely feel horrible right now. The pain doc never told me about the side effects and my G.P. who referred me said that is why she doesn't like this clinic but referred me because they have a short waiting list and I was in a pain crisis.

I wrote an initial review on 8/20/11 the day after I got the shot, and even then I expressed my worry about developing the symptoms that many here have mentioned. My fears have manifested. 2 days ago I woke up looking like the Pillsbury dough girl. What stinks is that I already battle puffy eyes (and carb face after sometimes indulging in a late night snack) so this added problem is devastating. I tried my usual remedies for puffiness (ice pack for 5 mins, caffeine face cream) and nothing works. This is awful for someone who has a history of eating disorders-I'm worried that this will trigger another episode after 1 year of eating like a normal healthy person. I also noticed my period was severe, I'm bruising easily, and just all around feel like I'm easy to anger. My doc did not disclose these side effects to me, and I even asked what I was in for!

I am so afraid of having all of these major side effects (more specifically the ones that women have been describing). I can't really say for sure if the medication will help my pain, given that it's only the second day. Please don't knock me for writing a review so soon, but I feel that my initial side effects may help someone who is even considering this injection-insomnia and anxiety alone, hours afterward, were bad enough. Thankfully, I have a hormone spcecialist doctor who may be able to help me if I do run into any of the symptoms that seem to strike women. It seems as if our systems are more sensitive to this drug. I agree with some of the others who said that doctors seem to be inept at informing the patient beforehand about these symptoms. I was only told that I may have "some flushing". Now, from what I've been reading here, it sounds like I could be in for a long road of misery.

2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out!

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie).

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email

2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011

3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.

1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010

I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works.

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.

3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR.

5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it.

5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine.

4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
4	BIPOLAR 2	Severe Hiccups, lasted for 3 days.  Nausea, severe burping, felt like I was going to throw up, lasted for a week.  Slight mania, abbreviated sleep cycles, still having these.  I feel the side effects are worth it because of how well it keeps me from short cycling, which causes way more problems in my life than a little Nausea		M	36	8  weeks15 MG 1X D	6/2/2010
2	Bi-Polar	Lethargic, Weight Gain and Depression has gotten worse.  I want to be taken off this medication.  Having indecisiveness (more than usual) and my OCD has increased.

1	bipolar depression	Agitation, Heart Pounding Anxiety, Insomnia, Sweating, Headache, Shakiness	I took this drug one time, and it was a HORRIBLE experience. Abilify is not the right drug for me. I do NOT recommend Abilify.	M	41	1  days5 1X D	5/21/2010
5	As a complement for Major Depressio	Stiff Muscles and ridigity, upset stomach but those symptoms went away in aprox. 1.5 weeks.	A life saver for me. Eased my stubborn treatment resistant depression. I am starting to feel like my old self.	M	41	40  days15 1X D	5/17/2010Email
3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped. Abilify worked immediately and I haven't been depressed since.	F	24	3  weeks5mg 1X D	5/9/2010Email
4	psychotic symptoms	i was taking Geodon for some psychotic symptoms. have sleep problems (insomnia), switched to Abilify and i felt like i gained some of my energy back (still have sleep problems, though). i haven't had very many side effects with abilify and taking it seems to prevent the onset of my psychotic symptoms.	geodon seemed to help me lose all the weight i gained from zyprexa and helped me keep it off. my weight on abilify has fluctuated and i have not been able to return to my ideal baseline.

1	Bi Polar 2, Panic Disorder	horrible headache, voracious appetite (gained 10 lbs.), dizziness, anxiety, hot flashes, chills	At first this med seemed to be wonderful but after the first two weeks, these side effects became unbearable and I am three weeks off now and still having problems with my increased appetite. Normally b/c of other GI issues, my appetite is very suppressed but now I can't stop eating. However, the other side effects have decreased to almost nothing.	F	33	4  weeks5 mg 1X D	4/30/2010

4	GAD with Nausea	Appetite coming back.  Sex drive increased.  Anxieties seem to have diminished.  Feel a bit tired and flu like at times but not too bad.	Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal. I belive my GAD is finally diminishing - regular therpay is helping me too.  I have had my condition for 6 yrs and 6 months now.	M	45	2.5  weeks2 mg 1X D	4/19/2010
1	paranoid schizophrenia	hallucinations, night terrors, thought people were coming to kill me, locked myself in my studio, saw demons everywhere, racing thoughts, hearing things, couldn't sit still or sleep, the hour or two i was able to sleep was awful, i was going to kill myself but some how made it to the hospital and got some seroquel.  I was no where near this bad before i started taking it.		M	28	3  weeks5-15 1X D	4/19/2010Email
1	Bipolar spectrum disorder	Restlessness, anxiety, drowsiness, face rash	I went on Abilify at the start of an up period, so I don't know how effective it would have been in treating depressive spells. However, it did counteract some of the effectiveness of my lithium, and I was falling asleep during the day more frequently than usual. Had to go off it because of a rash on my chin/cheeks/ears.

5	for depression-w/ my antidepressant	lowering my libido. Craving more sugary, fatty foods and carbs.     I took this several yrs. ago and although the medication initially worked-I packed on more than 10 pounds. I got depressed due to weight gain, but after several months I feel medication ceased to be effective. This time  was very reluctant (2 yrs later & different Dr. & different anti-depressant medication-Prozack-2 yrs ago) but I am trying it w/ a different antidepressant than previously-Taking now w/ Wellbutrin.

THIS DRUG SHOULD COME WITH A WARNING LABEL.  I WOULD AKIN THIS TO RAT POISON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	F	54	4  months4 mg 1X D	4/17/2010
4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue. Negative - I find myself much more emotional - memories, key phrases, smells, songs, pictures, etc.can bring me to tears.	M	50	9  months50 MG 1X D	4/11/2010
2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now. I have woken up from a 12 year-long medication-induced nightmare.	M	57	 15 MG 1X D	4/7/2010Email

When it comes to causing the "munchies" it is like pot gone nuclear (haven't had a toke in more than 35 years)	NO APPETITE CONTROL - OBSESSED WITH EATING - ANYTHING - ALL THE TIME.

2	depression	Nausea the first few days, some constipation, cloudy thinking, increased appetite	Combined with Wellbutrin XL which suddenly stopped working for me after 3 years. After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

Insomnia (but the Seroquel has completely cured that.)	Abilify has helped me like no other drug.  I am on it along with cymbalta, deplin, seroquel and ativan.  Within just a few days I was feeling better and am now able to exercise, clean my house and just moved across the country-something I could never have done during my depression.

Then still have little to no energy for the rest of the day.  I was previously, taking 60 mg. of Cymbalta for almost 2 years, but my dr. switched me to this when I started to feel like dying again.

Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!

2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010

No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010

Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight.

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.

5	anxiety and depression	increased hunger and increased energy	This is a wonder drug for me. I thought I was going do die due to severe depression and anxiety. I am taking cymalta but after about a year, it didn't work. My MD RX'd 5mg of abilify along with my cymbalta every day. In my opinion, it saved my life. I feel like I have a reason to live and starting to enjoy the things I used to, just after one week of starting the med.	F	42	7  days	1/13/2010
4	Bipolar and anxiety	restlessness increased appetite inability to concentrate. Not sure if there are periods of anxiety or nervousness. No Mania	Works for mania. My pdoc says there is activation at low doses. My son started on 10 mg and takes 15 mgs. He also takes 900 mg of lithium and 10 mgs of Lexapro.	M	10	6  months	12/29/2009Email
3	Depression	Weight gain and constant appetite, anxiety, inability to concentrate	Worked well for the depression, but the constant appetite and associated weight gain, along with anxiety at higher doses, was not worth it overall	F	39	2.5  months	12/22/2009

1	anxiety and mood swings	increased heart rate that made my daughter pass out only after the 2nd day.	after first night of taking my daughter missed school the next day feeling nauseated and stomach cramps. That night she experienced indigestion/heartburn. She vomited. Sleepy but couldn't sleep. Feeling scared for no reason. Next day she passed out after being awake for 15 min. I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug. I got home and looked up the side effects and all of these were listed.  I can only say that we are glad we found out so quickly about this drug.	F	12	2  days	12/19/2009
2	OCD, racing thoughts.	drowsiness, leg pains, akathisia...	it is a great drug to calm down mind... seems to be on a "holy peace"... but side effects are too strong, just for me.	M	23	14  days	12/18/2009
3	bipolar	stopped after 14 months due to heart pulpitations, memory loss, trouble sleeping, slur speach due to excess syliva, after 12 months these things started. At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying. I am very uncomfortable giving a child this age any drug that is diagnosised by trial and error.	M	8	14  months	12/17/2009
2	unipolar depression	nasal stuffiness, dyslexia, word finding problems, increased appetitite, change (worsening) of vision, weight gain and wanting to graze constantly, watering eyes, feel like gravity is heavier (I have to sit down to brush my teeth), very restless around people, visual hallucinations (things disappear then reappear right where I saw them last), trouble focusisng while driving  --- weird.	I am taking 50 mg of lamictal concurrently with 7.5 mg abilify.  Affect is flatter, less mood swings, but more non-reactive than anything.  I'm not sure this is where I want to be. I have been able to get projects done that I had difficulty starting.  Some days I have energy, some days I don't.  I a fasting blood draw yesterday and haven't heard the results yet.  Continuing to take abilify is a quandary -- do I feel worse or better if I factor in all the weird side effects?  I will probably cut down on the dose since I really will be suicidal if I gain any more weight.	F	51	30  days	12/17/2009
3	Bipolar	Some weight gain, some restlessness	My 14 yr old son has been on 2.5 mg of Abilify for 3 months now.  He has gained 8lbs. so we are going to be watching this closely.  It has helped him be able to concentrate, and definitely better in school, and social groups.  Smoothed out the ups and downs.  Previously was on trileptal and zoloft.	M	14	90  days	12/14/2009Email
1	Post-opiate addiction depression	Cannot sit still, terrible anxiety after about 2 weeks, weight gain	This drug should be taken off the market.  After about the 3rd day you will not be able to sit still, ever.  It feels like there is something inside of you trying to get out.  After about 2 weeks I started having severe anxiety attacks almost constantly and came very close to having to be committed/hospitalized.  Smack your doctor if he recommends this.	M	26	 	12/13/2009
5	Depression, bi polar, etc.	NONE, ...perhaps a little sleepy. I only take 5 mg per day.	I know I am lucky for this but I really haven't noticed any side effects. Abilify has been great in that for me it creates a kind of peace of mind by eliminating the aberrant thoughts and whatnot.  I stop talking to myself so much, it helps me get out of my head so to speak...   Based on my positive experience I would tell others to start with no more than 5 mg for the first month...  	M	42	3  years	12/3/2009

3	bipolar	insatiable appetite. Gained 7 pounds in 4 weeks.	Worked well on stabilizing my mood. But already being overweight, my Doc said the rapid weight gain was unacceptable and switched me to lamictal. Geodon had been working well for me, but the side effect of clenching my left side...mainly leg and toes, leaving my toes red and swollen, led me to stop taking it. Depakote made me a zombie.

5	major depression	Vivid dreams otherwise a good addition to lexapro	greatly improved my mood and made me more active and interested in life.	M	55	6  months	11/26/2009
4	autism spectrum disorder/ bipolar	Weight gain - up to 30lb	My daughter has had tremendous improvement in energy, concentration, and mood. Before taking Abilify she was on Geodon and had terrible akathisia. It also interfered with her ability to learn, and she had to withdraw from college courses to avoid failing. (She wound up finishing college with a B average, so you can see she's normally able to learn. ) Once she got off the Geodon, the irritability and stupidness went away but she became suicidal and self-injured. Since starting the Abilify she hasn't tried suicide even once. (Before that it was 14 times in six years.) I am grateful to the Abilify, but I wish she wasn't so hungry all the time.

4	recurrent major depression	Within the first 4 days I had experienced a great sense of relief of the depression. I had a burst of energy that is still there, my old self. I did experience about 3 days of severe headaches , migraines , but I weathered the storm and  the headaches went away. I take Cymbalta 60.mg and now 2 mg  abilify.I would stick with it since it works within 2 weeks.I sleep better, and  am more focused. I do eat more but I think it's the winter and I needed to feel better from the headaches. Diet tomorrow!		F	49	6  days	11/23/2009
5	Autism/ADHD/Bipolar	Muscle pain and sleepiness	My son started taking 10 MG about a year ago.  He has made drastic improvements in his schoolwork and social skills.

1	bi polar	Weight gain within weeks. I felt bad enough w/o the extra pound a week.Went From 110 114 IN 3 Weeks. Very restless as well. I stopped taking my 10 abilify and continue with ambien and clonazepam	made me feel worse. I would rather deal on my own	F	39	1  months	11/15/2009
1	depression & anxiety	I took this and right away I had more energy. Even joined a Gym for the first time in my life. But than within a week my blood sugar sky rocket, I mean I was in the hospital with sugar over 600, my meter couldn't even read it, and the hospital had trouble bringing it down with fast acting insulin. Then my legs started shaking couldn't keep still. I had to go off it cold turkey because of my dangerously high sugar. It might work for some people but be careful of the side affects.

4	major depression and anxiety	the first night i felt like i was coming down from meth. i adjusted the times i took my meds, because i take asprin, reglan, nexium, and effexor 75's.  i took the asprin, nexium, and reglan with dinner, and the effexor and abilify, plus a half of a klonopin at bedtime, and i sleep through the stomach upset.	the second day i felt much better.  i was able to clean a room, take care of bills, and just never thought of negative things more than twice.  this is my third day, and i was able to joke around with my husband at the store, and though i still haven't showered, i may do that tonight, after i clean the bathroom.  i have great hopes for this med, and hopefully, i won't have to take it very long.	F	47	3  days	11/8/2009Email
5	Bipolar depression	Some weight gain and insomnia.	This drug saved me from the darkest, deepest depression I have ever had to endure.  For over two years, I lost my will to see people, clean house, get dressed, etc.  After just three days on Abilify, I was able to get up, shower, go visit friends in New England (I live in South Florida), clean up my messy house and talk on the phone again.  I have gained a great deal of weight over the years from all different types of medication.  I accept the fact that medication makes me heavy and I am grateful to be heavier and sane than thin and crazy.	F	54	30  days	11/2/2009
5	Depression/Anxiety	Occasional headache.  Woke up in the middle of the night a few times but that got better.  Still sleeping well.	Doctor added 2 mg Abilify to my 10 mg Lexapro because I was still having suicidal thoughts despite the Lexapro.  Its worked great so far and has been a real boost in energy and mood.	M	17	5  weeks	11/2/2009
4	anxiety, paranoia and major depress	restlessness at 20 mg, eye tic at l5 mg, now down to 2 mg daily.  No weight gain at all on any of the doses.	Because of side effects including diabetes risk tried to go cold turkey at l0 mg.  Okay for about 2 weeks then experienced major nervousness, disorientation, jaw clenching, etc.  Now taking 2 mg. daily and feeling much better.  Still worried about side effects.  Not taking any other drug along with it.  Still experiencing anxiety but it is manageable.  You must wean yourself off this drug and not try to quit at once.	F	62	3  months	11/2/2009
3	ADHD	uncontrollable muscle movements, especially when in the car.	My son has been on Abilify (1 mg) for over a year.  We started on .5 mg because of his weight.  I did not want to medicate my child but I had no choice.  He was diagnosed at 2 with ADHD, but I didn't believe the psychologists because it's hard to diagnose something like that at age 2.  He is also ODD.  Last summer he was almost kicked out of daycare because of impulsivity, aggression, and inablility to sit still.  The Abilify worked for him then and continues to work.  I would love, however, if he didn't need it but now he's in kindergarten and has to take it to get through the day.  I was also able to get him a 504 plan with the school since I got another diagnosis at age 4 which was ADHD.	M	5	1.5  years	11/2/2009Email
2	add on for depression	none except rapid and major weight gain	I was very hopeful at first. I felt improvement after the 3rd day when this was added to my Wellbutrin. But in 5 months time, I gained 40 lbs on a petite, 100 lb frame!! I'm really struggling to lose it, and am currently discontinuing because of it. People that I bump into at stores and such ask when I'm due!!Really too bad, I had no other side effects. but now I'm left with this big mess with my weight to clean up.	F	34	5  months	10/29/2009
1	GAD/Depression	weight gain, extreme fatigue, depression worse	I was taking 2 mg of Abilify last Spring after Paxil didn't seem to be working as much any more. I felt ok then I felt bad again. Dr put me on 5 mg of Abilify. I feel terrible!  Extremely tired- so much so that I can barely move. I am going to ween my self off immediately.	F	47	6  months	10/28/2009
3	Mood stabilizer along with Zoloft	I took 1 mg daily and it helped but caused too many side effects. I'm very med-sensitive. I've stopped Zoloft at this point.	I was on Zoloft and Abilify but stopped both due to weight gain. After a lot of research I'm adding Abilify back at 1 mg every three days. I'm very med-sensitive and tend to respond at lower doses than other people do. Will be back to post how this goes. Something has to help. I'm a wack-job right now. Can't control my thoughts and I dwell on bad stuff too much. Can't get sad events out of my mind etc. I have to give Abilify another chance at a reduced dose.	F	62	 	10/27/2009
4	Oneiric states	jittery at low doses, sleepy at high	It has helped me stop feeling like I'm in a dream all the time                                   but my mood is only a little better so far	F	59	3  weeks	10/25/2009
2	Depression	Insomnia, chest pain, blurry vision	Only on 0.5 mg. for three days.  Horrible insomnia no matter what time of day I take med.  Makes me drowsy during the day, hard to tell if my mood is improving due to the side effects.	F	35	3  days	10/24/2009
5	major depressive episode	Energy and hope restored.  Insomnia, head ache, speedy, shaky,visual disturbance,constipation.	Hopefully the side effects subside as my body gets used to the med.  I'm not willing to stop taking the med as I feel so much better with just 2mg of Abilify as an adjunct to Lexapro.  I have hope again.  I got my butt out of bed by day 3 (went shopping) then cleaned the house on day 5.  What a change from the depths of deep epression to my old self in less than a week...WOW!	F	46	10  days	10/23/2009
3	bipolar II	agitation, shakiness, acne, loss of libido, weight gain, inability to urinate	This med helped stabilize my mood a bit, but I could not get the full benefit because I could not increase the dose.  Every time I would go up on the dose, I would be hit by an avalanche of side-effects.  Had to get off eventually.	F	26	5  months	10/23/2009
3	To help my mood	Strange itching in my nose. I made myself bleed by trying to scratch it but couldn't help myself. It tasted good so I'm okay with it.	I've had depression of one kind or another most of my life.  I wanted to feel normal.  But, I ran out of samples after a week.  It wasn't long enough to find out if it would help.	M	56	7  days	10/22/2009
3	Mood Disorder	My son is 9 years old. He started in June on a mood stabilizer.  Abilify 5 mg, worked on mood, however he has gained 25 pounds. He can not stop eating.  He even sneaks food!! I don't know what the doctor is thinking.  We are taking him off.		M	9	4  months	10/19/2009
5	Bipolar Disorder	Very hungry, but able to manage it. Some difficulty sleeping, usually for an hour in the middle of the night. Spending money a little more than usual. Initially had a few days of headaches, not major.	This drug immediately snapped me out of low-grade depression that was steadily worsening. I started taking 2 mg of Abilify each morning and all of my depression symptoms lifted. I only realized how bad my concentration had been because it was so improved on this drug. Like others have said, I lost my hyper-sensitivity to people and situations and replaced that with a high tolerance for life's challenges -- big & small. The side-effects are very minimal at this point, but I'll be paying attention to see if this continues. Lastly, the fact that it works so quickly is a powerful asset if it works for you.	F	39	2  weeks	10/17/2009
1	depression/schizoaffective	can't stop pacing, feel like someone is inside me trying to get out of my skin, insomniac, no sex drive, having to put car into park at stoplights to keep from ramming into someone in front of me; insane.	i stopped taking this today and hope to G-d it doesn't last long in my bloodstream.	F	29	2  weeks	10/16/2009
2	possible bipolar	feel like a crack addict, hard to even sit here and type, hitting wrong keys, clenching jaw, restless beyond belief	on 10 mg...gained about 5-7 pounds, doc swears I need it, am bipolar but w out mania, just very low lows.......need to get off this but afraid of geodon...feel like a speed freak.  sleep is my only relief.............	F	38	6  weeks	10/7/2009
1	Mood stabalizer	makes me gain weight, tired, not sure if it is what causes memory loss, fatigue, moodiness, irratability.		F	35	2  years	10/7/2009
5	Anxiety, depression, mild mania.	Jitters, sleepiness, stomach distress.	This drug is very strong and very good.  I am taking 2 mg in conjunction with 7.5 mg of Lexapro.  It has reduced my severe PMS and helped me with my previous need to sleep 11 hours a day.  Note that I am on one tenth of the recomended starting dosage for someone who is bi-polar; I can only imagine the side effects, however for my purpose it has been a god send.	F	29	1  months	10/3/2009
1	Bi-polar	pacing, high blood sugar, foamy urine, severe thirst, fatigue, pancreatitis, kidney damage	Please stop taking the Abilify immediately.  My husband was prescribed Abilify and it almost killed him. He was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis for 10 days and then on home care hooked up to ivs for another 2 weeks. He is now diabetic and needs to take insulin shots 4 times a day. He is on a very strict low-fat no-sugar diet and may never have even a sip of alcohol ever again. His pancreas is permanently damaged. We are very lucky he is alive. Abilify is evil. Please do not take it. It will kill you.	M	30	 	9/30/2009Email
5	depression, OCD	more alert, motivated, racing thoughts greatly diminished, some nausea, no weight gain!	I was leery about taking this, others make it sound like a nightmare drug. I have no doubt that it affects some people badly, but for me, it made a huge difference. I do wonder if this will wear off after a few months, but so far 5 mg have allowed me to think clearly, get off the couch and accomplish things. No weight gain but dr has me on Metformin to regulate blood sugar and cravings, so that might be the trick there. Important for everyone to monitor their own reactions carefully, or ask family members to help, because every drug works differently for every person. YOU know best what helps YOU.	F	45	2  months	9/19/2009
3	depression/ bipolar	flattening/apathy, word-finding problems, short-term memory loss, trouble concentrating, not able to articulate thoughts and feelings, muscle weakness. To be fair, it made me manic for the first month I took it, which was wonderful, and I say I'm not depressed now, but is apathy really that different from depression?	When trying to stop taking 5mg, severe akathasia that literally kept me from sleeping at all. I'm tapering, now on 2.5mg, but still fearful that I will have the same symptoms when I discontinue again. Feeling a little trapped.	M	35	7  months	9/17/2009
3	Childhood Bipolar, ODD	WEIGHT GAIN, MUSCLE PAIN/STIFFNESS	My son has shown improvement in mood, decreased mood swings, more even temperament, however, he constantly complains about pain in his feet and legs. He describes as burning, stinging pain, mostly in his feet. We have observed more nasal stuffiness. He appears short of breath, at times, however, we are linking this to his weight gain (approx 12 lbs) and history of asthma. We are still observing and waiting to gauge any affect in cognitive abilities (school grades). Time will tell if the side effects are actually worth taking the medication.	M	11	3  months	9/16/2009
1	Bipolar 2-PTSD	Eating abnormal amounts - lethargy - no libido - no personality - sweating	This shit, and yes I say this profanely because that's what it is. It made me more depressed than ever. Yes the headaches and voices went away. But it made me socially anxious , paranoid , ripped me of my self esteem and made me gain weight because all I did and wanted to do was eat. I am an athlete, model, and full time mom. I kissed my life goodbye when taking this shit. Desparate, I stopped taking it. Which made life even more worse. I wanted to kill myself so badly because I wanted the pain to go away. It's all in my head. Mind over matter. I'll be the moodswingin crazy gal I am than risk my life. Also causes muscle weakness. Lucky to be able to carry anything up a damn flight of stairs. All in all, just stay away!!! Spent the whole summer in bed sleeeeping getting fat and suicidal. Whack!!!	F	25	2  months	9/14/2009
1	GAD/BPII/PTSD/OCD	Severe depression/out of touch	I was on Abilify for three weeks.  I started with the 10 mg for two weeks and up to 25 the third week.  On the 10 mg I started feeling "funny" and experiencing some side effects.  By the third week I was self mutlilating (something I have not done in 15 yrs.  I was so depressed I could not function at any level, very irritable and people just were too much to deal with.  All I wanted to do was sleep and just disappear.  My Therapist said it was like I did a 180 in two weeks and was so concerned she called my Psych.  After seeing my Psych, she immediately took me off it and put me on Geodon...not sure if that is a possitive change or not.	F	37	3  weeks	9/14/2009
3	Bi Polar 2	Akathesia, insomnia, anxiety, weight gain, head aches	The Akathesia was awful.  I would lie in bed thinking I was weak or flu-ish, but once in bed I could not get comfortable.  My workouts decreased as I felt weak, dizzy, short of breath, lost balance while stretching. My face would sweat way more than normal.  I could tell I was starting to gain weight and would pack on the pounds rapidly if I did not stop taking this. Since exercise is therpeutic for me, the abilify took that away from me.  BUT it did help control my mood swings (by making me feel like an emotionless zombie) and the need to act out my irritability. However, inside I felt increasing anxiety and irritability.  The side effects just aren't worth it.	F	30	2  months	9/8/2009
3	Depression/Anxiety	I have gained 20 pounds and am not eating any more than normal.  The medicine definitely lifted my depression, but the weight gain now has me looking like a pig.  And, it seemed to increase my libido.	Started off with 5 mg; now am down to 2.5... but, because of the weight gain, I am asking to get off of this medication.	F	40	4  months	9/5/2009
1	anxiety	Akithesia	Do not take this med. I had severe akithesia whereby I had a constant feeling of having to 'move' It was exhausting and I thought it would never leave which made me feel even more panicked. It was the most scared I'd ever felt on a medicine. Before this I truly never paid attention to side effects on labels, now I do.	F	38	 	8/29/2009
4	Bi-Polar	Akathisia, increased libido, insomnia	Loved it the first week until the Akathisia kicked in.  Then I wanted to jump out the car while it was moving... Halfed my dosage, no help.  Halfed the dosage again, no help.  Now I am on 1/8 of the pill.  Akathisia is gone, but increased libido went away.  Still have insomnia taken care of by Ambien.	F	46	1  years	8/28/2009Email
5	for incentive, to mk decisions	none except lots of hope, energy, lack of fear,loss of procrastination, able to make decisions, ability to focus just an all around zest for life with unlimited happiness	If your anti depressant or anti anxiety meds work but you still have no energy, ask your Dr to add Abilify. I had never heard of it but now instead of thinking of everything I need and want to do I am optimistic and bubbling with enthusiasm and energy. Now instead of reading all day long I am cleaning and doing hobbies, kyaking, running, dancing and marching with my grandchildren Whats next a sea plane ride and travel. Was just weeks ago I was close to Agoraphobia. If your meds only get you to the bottom of the mountain looking up and wishing you would, try Abilify, you will climb that mountain, maybe even run up it and then dance on the top!!!	F	62	3  weeks	8/23/2009
2	bi polar 2	weight gain, sugar cravings, excessive sleepiness, inability to exercise (no stamina, gasping for breath)	It helped with irritability (because nothing seemed to matter) but left me unable to live normally and my friends all asked if something was wrong because I was so quiet and getting more quiet with each passing day.  Because the side effects were so crippling, I have stopped taking Abilify and switched to Geodon.	F	60	4  months	8/18/2009
1	Bipolar I	Akathisia, loss of interest in life, Always sleepy, high anxiety, catatonia	Got really bad Akathisia after only 3 days on 10mg. Was taken during a bad manic/pschotic state so was forced to stay on it. Initially was bumped to 20mg which made me catatonic. Back to 10mg kept hallucinating. Added Cogentin, made Akathisia go away but severe anxiety came in it's palce along with lack of motivation and no interest in anything. Severe confusion followed. This sucked my will to live. The Akathisia was so severe I was suicidal.	M	32	7  months	8/17/2009
3	depression; withdrawal aid	VERY rapid weight gain (10 lbs in a month!), constipation, swollen legs and feet, back pain	GOOD NEWS: This drug helped me in the horrible phase of discontinuing Cymbalta.  I was no longer moody and nasty-tempered.  BAD NEWS: the fact that my face is so puffy I now look like a fatter, older version of myself and I now have GOBS of fat in places I never gained weight before (back of arms, waist) proves this stuff is POISON.  It may inhibit thyroid function, because I am not eating more than I usually do (in fact my appetite is less than normal--wierd!) yet I am piling on weight. The constipation, nausea and fatigue aren't fun either.  And I look like CRAP: bloated, haggard, pale, and unhealthy. Phasing off this med asap!	F	31	2  months	8/14/2009Email
5	depression	I have experience swelling of the calves. This may not be related to the Abilify, as I have had a kidney transplant.	My family has a history of serious depression to the point of being institutionalize. For many years now my brother and I have tried one drug after another. Nothing helped us 'open the curtains'. Two mg of Abilify each morning, after just a couple of days, has given us our lives back. This is a miracle drug for both my brother and my self. I must include, we have only been on this medicine for two or three weeks.	M	60	18  days	8/8/2009Email
5	wellbutrin	somewhat more tired, some difficulty urinating..	A Great help.. relieved pain in my shoulders and elbows.. and has rid me of most of my suicidal or weird thoughts and voices.	M	57	25  days	8/5/2009
4	bi-polar 1 disorder	nausea, vomiting, insomnia	I am 5mg, for just about a week, first 2 days I was very hostile, last 4 days restless with insomnia and cant eat much.However I have energy, I get things done, I am back to being social which I was not for over a year and half. No fears of public and can focus to read, play games etc.  My patience level is much better.  Just would like to know when the insomnia and nausea will pass.	M	41	1  weeks	8/5/2009Email
2	Possbile Bipolar 2	Extreme sweating, extreme nausea, weird chest movement, insomnia	Been on Celexa for 10 years now, up and down in dose as lifes stresses went up and down... 40mg now for past 2 years. Doctor added abilify for possible Bipolar 2. I took at 7pm and within 2 hours I was sweating profusely and kept doing so for the next 24 hours, then it started to go away. I wasn't hot, I even cranked up the air conditioner, didn't help at all. I soaked my clothes and sheets. This caused some dehydration which didn't help the nausea. That was also extreme. I never actually vomited but still laid on the bathroom floor just in case. The first few bouts of it I could barely move. I was flushed and weak and trembling it was so bad.I also couldn't sleep, which I'd already been fighting insomnia the past few months. But this made it worse as I couldn't sleep more then 10-30 mins at a time. The constant sweating didn't help when trying to sleep.I'm not saying don't take this med. I dealt with bad nausea for weeks when I first started it, and also when I went without for over a week. Just wanted to share what happened to me	F	32	1  days	8/2/2009
5	major depression/Bipolar	None really..Some initial insomnia but got better with time. Sexual sides are minimal and never a problem	A great medicine.It worked the 1st day I took it (5 mg)..I felt so much better..NOTHING has worked for me except Abilify and Parnate. People love to rant and rave when something is not working for them. Fine. But please don't tell other people to stay away from the drug because it doesn't work for you. If your having a hard time finding something that works, try this med. It works quickly so you'll know if it's for you without having to wait 2-4 weeks.	M	49	60  days	7/31/2009
1	Bipolar Disorder	Weight Gain	I was taking this medicine for about half a year and was recommended to not go off of it. In this six month period I gained 67 pounds. It also made it very hard to lose the weight afterward. Here I am almost two years later, and I am five pounds away from getting rid of the 67 I initially gained. Although the weight is gone, the stretch marks remain and still will. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE.	F	22	6  months	7/27/2009
5	schizo personality disorder	I LOVE ABILIFY!!  It is my favorite antipsychotic.  Side effects range from mild tiredness and hunger spells to insomnia at bed time.  But that helps with Ambien CR which my doc loves to prescribe like candy to me!  Abilify helps tremendously with voices and does not give me the akathisia movement disorder like the "dones" risperidone and ziprasidone antipsychotic do 100% of the time.	This medicine is a mild antipsychotic when it comes to side effects when compared to other antipsychotics.  I would recommend ABILIFY (aripiprazole) over the other atypical antipsychotics any day.	M	29	6  years	7/23/2009

1		Severe headaches, Nausea and Coughing. It was so severe that i had to go to the emergency. I underwent blood test, CT Scan and lumbar Puncture (Removing Fluid from the Spinal Cord). They said it was viral infection and it will go out.	I believe that the damage it has caused in me was not worth the temporary relief i felt for the first two days.	F	27	6  days 1X D	2/13/2013Email
1	Sinusitis	I was put on a very large dose by my Dr. due to a sinus infection.  He told me that it would not be absorbed into my system so there were no risks of side effects.  I started getting really random sore muscles in my rib cage, back and abdomen.  I also had very high anxiety and emotions.  Because of these side effects, and because the sinus issues were better, I dropped my dosage down to 2 puffs a day from 8 puffs a day.  What resulted has been a very scary steroid withdrawal process.  I suddenly lost all muscle strength, painful joints, pins and needles, dizziness, and nausea.  The prescribing Dr. and my GP did not believe it could be from coming off of the Nasonex, and ordered me all kinds of tests to rule out a bunch of frightening diseases.  WIth no answers, I found myself an endocrinologist who told me that I have classic steroid withdrawal symptoms that can very much happen from intranasal steroids.  The withdrawal has taken over my life for a month and I'm still not totally off o	This drug is probably fine at the recommended dose, or one puff per nostril per day.  If you find yourself having random steroid withdrawal symptoms after you discontinue Nasacort (my first was pins and needles in the feet), your doctor will likely not believe that Nasacort could be the cause.  Persevere, and find yourself a smart endocrinologist who knows about these things!!	F	36	30  days4 puffs 2X D	10/18/2012Email

I am so relieved I found this website because after reading other peoples comments I now know I'm not turning into a mental case.  The symptoms of taking this spray nearly cost me my marriage, I'm not joking!  My personality changed from a happy laid back person into a lunatic!  I'd rather have blocked ears...which I still have as it didn't actually work anyway!  I followed my doctors advice to the letter and took this medication religiously.  After two days I had  really bad stiff neck but had no idea it could be due to this spray, I just thought I'd slept in an odd position.  This is day one of not taking this medication after weeks of hell... I'm not looking forward to any withdrawal symptoms but they can't be any worse than the horrible side affects that I have experienced!  The brain fog was so bad I seem to have lost half of my vocabulary! If you enjoy being a sane and happy person then this is not the medication for you!  By the way...

2	Allergies and sinus congestion	I have seasonal allergies.I cleaned my apartment and my allergies flared up. I took the generic version of this drug. I had a bad headache before taking it and the drug prolonged it I was laid out for a month thinking I had a virus. With such a bad headache I forgot to take it for a couple of days. My headache nearly disappeared. Took it on the third day and the headache and it's intensity returned within 5 minutes. Additionally, this stuff has really messed up my stomach. Awful diarrhea and burning stomach and intestines. I missed quite a number of days of work while on it. Stomach is still upset. Never used more than directed: one to two sprays in each nostril per day.	Two years ago I used the brand name for an entire summer and part of the fall and at that time it was a miracle drug without any side effects. Cleared up all my allergies. I have a feeling I have an issue with the generic or have developed an intolerance to an ingredient both in the brand and the generic.	M	34	3  weeks220/110 1X D	7/26/2011

5	Allergic rhinitis, asthma, allergie	Nose bleeds and burning in nostrils.	Don't let it go down the throat because it is a steroid and can cause stomach irritation.  Just keep sniffing until all of it goes up the nasal cavity.  I'm very sensitive to oral steroids, but the other nose sprays just didn't work.  OTC sprays have a bad rebound effect.  The menthol gels work well to keep things loose if I'm dried out inside my nose.  Nasacort does cause recurring nose bleeds.  I only take it 1X instead of 2X per day.  I also alternate days whenever possible, instead of daily dosing.  I go off it completely when the weather is moist and warm.   Nasacort AG helps the mucus to soften and drain like normal people who do not have rhinitis.  I use Nasacort, guaifenesin pills and cough syrup, nasal gels when it's truly necessary, and vaporizers in the winter when the weather is cold and dry.  Calcium lactate from health food stores is also great because it causes involuntary muscles to relax that often cause constriction and asthma attacks.  It has a very sedating effect, so I take it at night.  No one drug can do it all with me. Except for mild nose bleeds, I have no other side effects with Nasacort AG.

1	allergies/cough at night	This drug, after not even using it as much as doctor's recommendations, gave me a perforated septum. I have two holes in my septum which will eventually have to be repaired by major surgery. And this happened in two months.

2	Allergies	Worked like a charm - relieved all congestion from my many diagnosed allergies (dust, dander, pollen, etc). But, only after I stopped using due to insurance coverage changes raised the monthly cost to me over 10 times higher, did I discover that it HAD to be the cause of nearly incapacitating anxiety.(Only medication I was taking that I stopped - and my anxiety went away)	I noticed in particular that I developed, over the last couple years of Nasacort use, an irrational fear of travel for business trips. I would wake up sweating in the middle of the night, heart racing, stomach in a knot, for weeks before any business trip. Completely irrational, unwarranted and unlike me. Would have never thought that nasal steriods could cause this, and shocked to see it listed by others in this forum. Probably affects a very small fraction of the users, but can be crippling for those.	M	58	10  years 1X D	10/31/2010

2	nasal allergies and inflammation	This medication worked well for my inflamed sinus passages but  made me an emotional mess. I was either irritable or crying about little things that don't normally bother me and I know it was not due to PMS. Emotional side effects were not listed in the patient info. that came in the box.	If you are sensitive to other forms of steroids DO NOT use this nasal spray. I would rather have sinus problems than to not have friends and family.	F	39	2  days 1X D	7/30/2010

1	Nasal congestion	The first week it actually helped with my congestion. Although I don't take it daily, just when needed, I noticed on the fourth week I took this med I experienced an intense headache for several days in my forehead. Throughout the course of the month I also felt very emotional, (crying for no reason).  Come to find out many people like me are sensitive to the steroid in this med and the emotional side effects.	I would rather  suffer with a stuffy nose than take this med again.	F	22	30  days 2X D	2/8/2010

I had an immediate headache after taking, several days later I started feeling nervous all the time and having terrible anxiety attacks while driving, scared the daylights out of me.

5	Nasal congestion	None!	I used Nasacort AQ for nasal congestion and felt relief within the first few hours. I used to use Afrin, and hated the irritation, dry throat, nasty taste, and rebound effect. Nasacort felt clean, fresh, and didn't drip down my throat. I tried other sprays but the alcohol dried out my nose, and I didn't like the way some smelled and tasted.	F	32	8  days	6/24/2009
2	Swollen sinuses	First two days, I felt O.K. and noticed very little watering of my eyes and drainage into my throat; however, after those two days, I felt cloudiness in my thinking and low in spirit. When I stopped using Nasacort, I felt like my normal self again.	I believe Nasacort helps with the allergies, but for some people, there are side effects.	F	74	1  weeks	6/10/2009
1	chronic sinus infection	frontal headache, excitability, anxiety, confusion, "brain fog"; upon discontuing- withdrawal symptoms: moderate to serious depression for days, muscular tension in legs and arms, muscle spasms in back, increased headache	If you are sensitive to cortisteroids as I am, avoid Nasacort and Rhinocort. Manufacturer's info sheet says Nasacort is 8 times more potent than prednisone!  I had terrible withdrawal symptoms for several days after using Nasacort for just 3 days.  The doctors will say none of this is possible with nasal sprays.  The med. actually drips down the throat and into the stomach where it is apparently absorbed. 'Very bad stuff.	M	57	3  days	4/29/2009

2	stuffy, runny nose & coughing	It affected the nerves mostly on the left side of my face where I had some cheek twitching and numbness; severe eye twitching, jaw and gum discomfort, funny taste in my mouth; left side of my lips had tingling sensation like when novacaine wears off.	I used Nasacort years ago with no side effects.  Used it again some last year and had headaches, but didn't link it to this.  Then I used it this year for 2 weeks and had the full blown problems listed. Thought it was a sinus or dental problem.  Have had x-rays, CT, doctor & dentist visits and stopped using it during that time. The problems subsided and the day after I started using it again they came back. Stopped using it and the side effects have subsided again.  It's too bad since it worked great on my runny nose and coughing, but I can't live with feeling like I've had a stroke or am doing permanent damage to myself.	F	48	2  weeks	4/4/2009

I have outdoor, indoor and food allergies, especially to milk, cheese etc. Lately I have been experiencing some bad attacks of allergic rhinitus with sinus pain being the predominant symptom which is felt in all 4 of my sinuses. I feel the product helped somewhat but only helped in the nasal area and not deeper in my sinuses. Usually when I have an attack I have to let it go it's course which is 2 to 3 days. From reading these reviews I will definitely be careful not to over use this product.	F	44	2  days	1/2/2009

1	allergies/plugged sinuses	Headaches everyday, extremely sore neck, anxiety and uncontrollable twitching eye lid(probably from the anxiety)and getting worse each day	The first day I used this med. it helped me breath much better but as the week has gone on the side effects are overwhelming.  I feel like I aged 5 years in the last week and I'm sore all over.  The eyelid twitching has gotten out of control.  The first few days it would only happen once and hour or so but now it is almost non-stop.  I researched this and it says it is most likely caused by stress.  HUMMMM... I feel like I have to be doing something at every minute of the day, this must be while I feel like I have uncontrolled anxiety built up.  I also have had a non-stop headache since I started taking this medicine to the point that I have to take some extra strenght motrin each day to cope with it.  I will stop using this med. and see if I start to feel like myself again.	F	36	8  days	11/24/2008
5	Nasal allergies/severe congestion	I still irrigate my nose with a saline product and sometimes there will be some blood during irrigation, but nothing serious.	I found this product to be extremely helpful in clearing my congestion.  I try to get off it from time to time to give my sinuses a "break." The longest I have used it at one time was about four months.	F	38	4  months	11/14/2008

2	sinus infection symptoms	helped clear congestion, but that is largely outweighed by multiple nosebleeds in the last two days.	have given up product after a week taking only one to two sprays per day, in the same nostril that is affected.	M	25	6  days	7/30/2008
1	allergy/sinus problems	Amazing HEADACHE....it feels like my forehead is going to explode.  My whole head and neck hurt so bad, I can't stand it without Ibuprofen.  I am stopping this med asap.		F	33	5  days	4/1/2008
3	allergies	Anxiety	Not certain it was Nasacort because taking Allegra also; but after reading comments, I feel more certain it is the Nasacort. Anxiety usually starts early in the morning, about an hour after inhalation and seems to wear off during the evening. I take another inhalation at night and go to bed shortly afterwards. I feel a little anxious in the morning, but more so about an hour after inhaling.	M	48	2  months	8/28/2007Email
1	Seasonal Allergies	Anxiety, panic attacks (at night), slight depresssion, just not myself, Former aches in joints returned, agitated.	I never would have connected the medication to these symptoms.  I use allergy medicine in spring and fall and thought it was just the change of seasons. I have used nasacort for a number of allergy seasons and never made the connection, but all went away when I stopped using it.	M	48	14  days	4/25/2007
5	Nasal allergies	None	I only stopped because of the various side effects and warnings on leaflet, but I myself did not experience any side effects and thought it worked well from the very first dose.	F	46	30  days	3/18/2007
1	Chronic Rhinitis & Indoor Allergies	It is making my nose more stuffy/runny than before, along with a sore throat, headaches, dry mouth, and some numbness along the left side of my face. Did I mention the joint pain? It seems as though every ache I've ever had has come back all at once. Then there is the depression. Not too bad, but I definitely do not feel like myself since I began this treatment.	If this is what I am to expect from other allergy medicines then I think I would rather suffer the bad effects of the allergies themselves.	M	50	90  days	1/15/2007

2	Nasal Polyps	Nasacort seemed to reduce the swelling of my nasal polyps, but I began having panic attacks.  I never suffered from anxiety before, and when I stopped using Nasacort the attacks stopped too.		F	48	2  years	10/12/2006Email
1	allergies	after about 2 weeks of using nasacort i expierienced very bad panic attacks,my doctors office tells me that that shouldn't be possible,however i have never previously had any type of panic disorder.i'd rather have a stuffy nose than ever go through the severe anxiety or panic attacks i suffered while using this.		M	39	3  weeks	6/23/2006
4	Seasonal allergies	More prone to VERY slight nosebleeds; mild stimulant effects in the first week of treatment which made it more difficult to sleep.	Compared to the horrible side effects of Flonase, Nasacort really seems like a good choice.  It works wonders on allergy symptoms with very minimal side effects.  After the first week, I cut my dose in half and still had no allergies.	M	34	3  weeks	3/23/2006
3	allergies	I really liked Nasacort but after seven years it seemed to be losing its effectiveness, and I had increasingly severe and frequent panic attacks and occasional dizziness. When I stopped using the spray, the panic attacks subsided.	I don't know why panic attacks are not listed as a side effect of this drug.	F	34	7  years	5/23/2005
1	Seasonal allergies	I have bronchaiectasis, along with seasonal allergies.  Nasacort was prescribed; it did more damage to my lungs, caused severe nosebleed and I ended up with infection which would not clear up and after two months, I was diagnosed with leukemia, with white cell count of 224,000.  Nasacort may or may not have caused my problem but I strongly reccomend that anyone with bronchaiectasis not use it.		F	70	2  weeks	7/17/2004

5	sneezing / stuffy and runny nose /	nose bleeds easily. If you discontinue abrubtly, symptoms seems worse.	nasacort works fast and gently to stop all my allergies. It seeemed to work better and didn't feel the side effects of flonase. Like they suggest, if you will stop it after at least 2 weeks, you should do so gradually.	M		4  days	4/25/2004

1	copd/emphysema	difficult swallowing, hoarseness, but the worse was the nighttime muscle cramps which were very severe enough to be afraid to go to sleep. Weaned myself of of it.		F	71	1  months	7/10/2009
3	asthma treatment	lots of mouth irritation and gum irritation even though rinsing well after use.  Also notice weight gain and my face swells and I have to stop taking it for a few days.  It does improve coughing and symptoms quite well but I hate the side effects.		F	60	3  months	2/16/2009

2	asthma	I've been on Azmacort for about a month and it is not working.  I'm still coughing and wheezing.  I'm switching back to Pulmicort.  The only thing I've had that might be a side effect is I had sore gums for a week after being on Azmacort for a couple of weeks.  That has gone away.  Otherwise, I don't know why my gums would have been sore.  So, no other side effects, it just isn't working for me.		F	38	1  months	1/1/2008Email
5	Asthma	No side effects.	Have not been hospitalized for stat attack for over 10 years after being put on azmacort.  Prior to being on Azmacort, was frequently on oral steroids.  Able to lead full life:  walks, play golf, do yard work.  Rarely need to use albuterol inhaler. For me, it has been a cure, although I know better as asthma is a dangerous disease if not managed.

1	Allergies	My 3 yr olds became hyper, irritable, aggressive, and very difficult to discipline/redirect.I have been using it as well, no side effects, but no improvement either.		F	32	2  weeks 1X D	8/18/2010
5	Nasal Congestion & Polyps	Nasacort effectively controls my nasal inflammation without adverse side effects. To save $$, I try to use the least possible, but not less than one spray (per nostril) per day. Nasacort is not fast-acting and must be used regularly to be effective.	Before Nasacort, I had two surgeries (10 yrs apart) for nasal polyps. It was so bad that I had no sense of smell for several years. Nasacort (for the last 10+ years) has kept me out of the OR and smelling the roses. And bread! I worked next to a bakery for a few years and never smelled a thing.

2	allergies	Worked great the first night, but I caught a cold on second day of use - sneezing, mucus, sore throat - my first cold in years.  Mild headaches for the first week, but then went away.  Bloody noses started after one week, but subsided after a little more than a month.  Feelings of lethargy, lack of concentration and slightly blurry vision continue.	I wouldn't recommend against trying the product - it seems to work for some people, and some of the side effects seem to be temporary.  That said, keep in mind that the side effects may negate the benefits, as I have decided.	M	29	1.5  months	1/27/2010

1	Allergies	Weight loss, lightheaded, cloudy vision, lack of concentration, sweating, mild chest pains, and mild shortness of breath followed by anxiety and panic attacks.	Research this drug before you use it. Check with you doctor at the first signs of any side effects. After an ER visit thinking I was having a heart attack my doctor told me to immediatly stop using Nasacort AQ. This brought on a whole different set of even more severe  symptoms causing another visit to the ER followed by an overnight stay in the cardio unit in which my heart was found to be in good shape. My doctor does not believe nasacort AQ could cause such symptoms since it is an inhaled steroid. I did not have any of these symptoms prior to using nasacort AQ.	M	43	1  months	6/21/2009Email

1	allergies/acute sinusitis	At first no side effects, then my ENT doc increased dosage because of sinusitis and I began experiencing horrible pain behind my eyes, headaches and dizziness.  This went on for 6 months.  I decided to quit taking it and for a few days felt dazed and had the sweats but now feel normal.  I went to 3 different doctors for these symptoms and none of them said it could be from Nasacort AQ!!!!  I put 2 and 2 together and quit on my own.		F	50	5  years	1/6/2009

1	allergies	I have taken this product (or similar) for several years.  I have recently had orbital eye pain and puffy eyes, especially the left one.  Further, I have been dizzy as well.  Could this be the cause?  My docs don't know what is wrong.  The pressure is so great around my eye, it feels like a sinus infection, but a CAT scan revealed nothing.  I read other's side effects from steriod nose sprays, so I am stopping it.		F	57	5  years	3/21/2008

2	severe seasonal allergies	Spaced out, lethargic, and short of breath.  Definitely can't drive or operate machinery while on this. Good thing I tried this on a Saturday.	Took for first time today.  Will not take again.  Side effects aren't worth marginal benefits.  Also on Clarinex (desloratadine) and Advair 250/50. Think that the combination of Nasacort and Advair is too high a dose of steroids for my body.	F	44	1  days	6/9/2007
1	Seasonal allergy, nasel congestion	I experienced nosebleed after using just once or twice.  I didn't fully appreciate the connection and continued to use this product several more times and the nosebleeds rapidly progressed to the point I couldn't stop the bleeding.  I wound up in the emergency room and then spent 5 nights in the hospital with a nasal tampon inserted into one side of my nose.  This was the only way to stop the bleeding and I ultimately had to have surgery to correct the damage this product did to my sinuses.  This product was a nighmare for me and I would warn others to STOP USING AT THE FIRST SIGN OF BLEEDING!	Apparently it works for some, but the nosebleed issue is very real and you must take this warning seriously!	M	52	3  days	3/10/2007

5	Allergies/congestion	None	I was on others sprays for a long time and I just found out about Nasacort AQ last year. This stuff has been great! It cleared my congestion almost immediately and it doesn't stink or burn like the other ones did. It also doesn't seem to run down the back of my throat as much.
