5	High Blood Pressure/Prostate	Small rash on wrist which went away after about 1 week.	Cardio recommended low dose (1/2 of a 2 mg.tablet./day) because I get rashes easily from Rx drugs. This stuff took 10-15 points off my top number BP. And it really helped my enlarged prostate....I'm peeing much better now. Been on it for 3 months... great stuff so far. Cheap too.

5	enlarged prostate		With an enlarged prostate the need to urinate often came suddenly and urgently, and then it was difficult to 'hold' for very long. On the road or in public I would sometimes get desparate to find a bathroom, quick. Very quick. Wetting my pants was not an option. This generic form of Cardura helps me with that. The signal 'you need to go' comes on a little slower, and usually, I can 'hold it' longer. Oftentimes the urgency fades again, if I cann't get to the bathroom right away. Doxazosin doesn't make everything work the way it did before my enlarged prostate came along, but it certainly helps. Enough to where I'm comfortable putting off some kind of expensive surgical procedure.  Indeed, my symptoms haven't worsened in the last 3 & 1/2 years I've been taking it.

3	Better urinary flow.	Reduced blood pressure which was tolerable but excessive. Went back to Flomax as it had less blood pressure side effect.	Took 1 mg for 30 days. It worked well for improved flow but blood pressure dropped.	M	58	30  days	8/5/2004
