4	Back muscle spasms	Makes me feel loopy  out of it. Falling a sleep while sitting up		F	51	10  days12mg	6/2/2013Email
5	migraines/TMJ	inability to see straight, trouble walking, and slurred speech.	In higher doses, be close to a couch or bed. Sleep is almost immediate. Complete relaxation of all muscles is quickly attained. Relieves tension of muscles which tense during migraine pain.	F	31	8  months10mg 1X D	5/3/2013Email
2	Tension headaches	Sluggishness and tired	Doc called this in today, 4mg, told me to take one in the evening.  Took the first one and noticed a little grogginess, but felt headache actually coming back and getting worse.  About an hour and a half later, took a second one.  So far useless, might call my doctor tomorrow.  And worse off, I can't take the Fioricet he gave me b/c I really don't wanna mix the two and risk oversleeping tomorrow and missing work.

3	Muscle spasms	Dizziness slowed speech hard to walk but no pain at all take about 4 and you will be really high lmao that's what I use for		M	44	2  months4MG	5/8/2012
4	Muscle Spasms and Headaches	Vivid dreams that would turn into sleep walking.	Worked very well for muscle spasms and headaches.	F	24	3  weeks4mg 1X D	11/19/2011Email
4	muscle tension/migraines/insomnia	dry mouth, sleepiness, kinda hazy feeling	works great for my insomnia when i take three at once. i have been on every medication possible for my migraines and nothing works this is the first medication to actually make me sleep but it is short acting.most of the pain medications they had me on would keep me awake so its nice to just be able to fall asleep. it does wear off after four hours so a repeat dose is sometimes nessesary to sleep thru the night.	F	26	4  months4mg 3X D	11/18/2011Email
4	migraines	slight drowsiness	I take 1mg upon waking, 1mg in the afternoon & 3mg before bed.  My Dr wanted me to only take this med @ bedtime (1mg for 1 week & increase to current dosage) but after researching it & finding its effectiveness lasts only a few hours, I decided to split the dosage up & take it while awake!  Dr gave her Ok (I would have done it anyway) but I did do it on her weekly schedule.  I'm @ 5mg  now (will continue to increase probably).  It helps (though has not been a cure) & I don't have any side effects.  Drowsiness is not major.  In fact, I wake up sooner than I did before taking this medication.  I sleep deeper, possibly, but seem to wake up earlier.	F	38	2  months5mg 1X D	10/4/2011
2	Muscle spasms/ tension headaches	I took one pill before bed. The next day, I experienced depression, fatigue and anxiety. I felt like my insides were vibrating!! It does seem to help with the muscle spasms, but not worth feeling like this!		F	43	 4 mg 3X D	8/18/2011
1	IC Bladder disease	I started out with breaking the medication into 1/4 tried it and it made me very shaky nervous, and caused me to urinate alot..I was so dried up in my mouth and with the stomach sick feeling like i need to throw up...I then was itchy all over... I would not recommend taking this medication..		F	44	2  days4mg 2X D	7/15/2011
5	Fibro. Auto Accidents chronic pain	Slows heartrate, bp and respirations but is not a problem for me.	If you are taking it to help you sleep there is a catch... If you take one or two pills, they will wear off within 2 to 3 hours and you wake up. My doc prescribed me Ambien and it helps keep me asleep. I take a very high dose of zanaflex before bed, 2 1/2 pills or (10mg). I am a true insomniac and rarely get my deep sleep(rem's) This will do the trick. I also suffer from migraines and sometimes I sub one zanaflex and take one 50mg phenegan. This lets me get a full night of restful sleep and most of the time the migraine is gone. 	F	46	2  years4mg 3X D	1/7/2011Email
3	Multiple Trigger Points in Back	I have never tripped from a medicine until last night.  I took only 1/2 of the pill, and was so dizzy I could barely stand.  I started hallucinating while looking at a picture of myself, it was moving, which freaked me out.  It definitely helped, but it wasn't worth my side effects.  I don't like to be out of it like that.  I am no longer going to take it.		F	28	1  days4mg 1X D	11/3/2010
2	Multiple Sclerosis	Very detailed dreams which I enjoy, I take two 4MG pills before bed. Twice perhaps taking them to close to the middle pill, I became groggy and my wife checked my blood pressure and it was 60 over 40	I dont think it helps the spasticity as I have been on baclofen for 2 years and nothing changed, but maybe it would be worse now, who knows	M	74	6  months4 MG 4X D	8/31/2010Email

3	Fibromyalgia, multiple spinal discs	Nightmares! I hate the nightmares! It works OK, but I have to fight sleep for hours, or I'll be staring in my own Sci-Fi/horror movie. Dry mouth - big time, but I can deal with that.	I take it in emergencies, for really bad back pain, in addition to my regular pain meds. It helps, but I can't take it too close to bedtime, due to the side effect.	M	40	10  months4mg 2X D	6/6/2010
2	Back pain	None really	It just didnt do much, it made me a little tired but no relief	M	35	1  months30 3X D	5/18/2010
1	Migraines	Jittery feeling, sleeplessness (insomnia), dizziness.	My FNP ordered Zanaflex along with Cymbalta to treat my frequent migraines and the Zanaflex was to help me sleep at night. Well, that did not happen. I fell asleep then awakened feeling jittery, dizzy & unable to fall back asleep about 2 hours after. I tried the it a second night thinking it was due to taking the Cymbalta too late in the day only to have the same thing happen again. I am certain it is just my system and this drug will work for other individuals.	F	52	2  days4-6 MG 1X D	3/17/2010
4	fibromyalgia; herniated discs; musc	slurred speech but helped the most. my whole support group drove me off of it and now i have to take flexeril which i hate...	THE BEST!!!!	M	21	3  months4 1X D	2/25/2010Email
2	Muscle spasms	Hallucinations	It took an hour for the 4 mg capsule to kick in, however as soon as it did and I began to fall asleep, I started to hallucinate badly.  I saw black and grey squares, and my environment was closing in on me.  I slept for 4 hours with it.  Never again.	F	34	1  days4 mg 1X D	2/3/2010
3	myofascial & neuropathic pain	Depression, feeling unmotivated, sleepiness the next day, anxiety, crying a LOT & easily, dry mouth, difficulty swallowing	I started taking this after a car accident.  It seemed to be the only med that would touch my neuropathic pain. I was taking 6 mg at bedtime and sometimes another 4mg during the night if I woke up.  It didn't always help me sleep.   My current boyfriend thought it was having a bad effect on my personality, so I stopped taking it.  I was still anxious for about a week, but then I quit crying all the time, & was no longer feeling overwhelmed and depressed.If you take this, pay attention to your mood and ask family and friends for feedback on your mood as well.	F	45	4.5  years	10/3/2009
3	TMJ, Migraines	Constant, aching, arthritis pain in both knees. This little known side effect was listed in the package insert.	Helped tremendously with TMJ and migraines, but I had to stop taking it because my knees got so bad.	F	58	4  weeks	8/12/2009
4	muscle spasms/migrains	sleepiness for the first few nights	takes away the migraines and the spasms... but like some similar pills I built a tolerance and can not take them everyday (which I am told to) for these to be effective.IF you get a sinus infection or some kind of infection be sure to mention you take this pill... I was told mixing it with some antibiotics is very dangerous and could possibly lead to death. also, be smart and do not drink alcohol while on this medication.	F	22	6  months	6/19/2009
2	Fibromyalgia , Neurofibromatosis	Told to take 1 to 3 tablets at bedtime and it would help my Insomnia from Fibromyalgia and Neurofibromatosis spinal tumor pain.Took 2 tablets.    Didn't phase me.  1 hours later I took 1 more.   Still No relief.Doesn't even make me tired.Felt abit doped though.   faster heart rate then normal.This drug is short acting.	I think it was a watste of money.No relief at all.Only on it ONE NIGHT.Might be too soon to expect relief.		52	1  days	5/16/2009
1	spinal stenosis	Severe anaphylactic reaction within an hour of taking this drug at bedtime (10:30 p.m.). Woke up unable to breathe -- mouth and throat very dry and throat was swollen -- drank water and used my rescue inhalator (I have asthma).  I was very drowsy and went back to sleep after a few minutes, but woke up again after about an hour with the same symptoms. Drank more water, used my rescue inhalator again and sat up in bed so I could breathe.  During the next few hours I drank a lot of water and Gatorade to rehydrate my body.  The onset of these symptoms was rapid and frightening -- the effects lasted until about 3 p.m. the following day.	I definitely would not recommend this drug to anyone -- the prescribing doctor gave no indication of any such possible effects -- after having read other patients' comments, I would say that this drug is dangerous and needs more research and testing.	F	56	1  days	3/9/2009
4	MS	Sleepiness about 40minutes after taking a dose.  I'll nap for 45minutes if there's nothing to occupy me.  I won't notice drowsiness if I am occupied.	Does a great job of moderating MS related spasticity without sapping muscle strength like baclofen does.	M	55	5  years	12/26/2008
3	Fibromyalgia	None at first then black stool, while rare, 1 in 100 can get this side effect, and although it wasn't explained to me why (and I didn't ask), I was instructed to stop taking it and another muscle relaxant was prescribed.	It did help reduce muscle and joint stiffness and pain,and helped me sleep.	F	37	6  months	9/12/2008
3	Migraines caused by neck tension	Dry mouth	It has mitigated the intensity of my night headaches. Since taking this medication prior to going to sleep, I only get a smaller and shorter version of the migraines. I still sometimes need to sleep sitting up to keep the headaches from growing to full blown. Still if I weren't on Xanaflex I would be passing out and throwing up and all that has stopped thanks to this medication.	M	61	6  years	7/16/2008
5	MS related issues	none	Lots of folks here say it makes them sleepy but I experience the opposite effect.  I take half a pill 3X daily and have yet to feel sleepy because of it.  On realy bad days, I take a whole pill.  Either way this medication works better than any other muscle relaxer I have tried.	F	31	9  months	4/15/2008
5	Stenios in the neck ,  and migraine	Not a great feeling at first. But 1 year of taking it it helps allot with the migraines. Doctors really need to check in with this for severe migraines. helps some with neck but not alot.	Got the medicine for neck But really helped with migrains headaches. Neck pain I has eased up some .	F	40	1  weeks	2/16/2008
5	recreation	sleepyness, nosebleeds, blurry vision	When I can't get to sleep I usually crush up a few pills and snort them. Helps me relax before going to bed.	F	25	7  years	2/8/2008
5	RSD	Non	This drug is a lifesave for the muscle spasms caused by RSD. No noticeable side effects other than mild drowsiness.	F	34	1  years	1/31/2008
5	muscle spasms,sleep trouble	dry mouth	I have taken Zanaflex for nearly 8 years. This enables me to get to sleep. A sleep study showed that I kicked and jerked violently during the night and never rested. I used to have chronic insomnia and migraines. Zanaflex is helping me so much, live is better with it. I am not groggy the next day and the ability to get to sleep is a big plus. There is no way I would ever want to stop taking Zanaflex. I take 12mg each night(I have titrated up over the years from 4mg)Zanaflex does make you sleepy,it is supposed to, this is why I was prescribed it after a sleep study.	F	35	8  years	12/20/2007Email
5	migrains	Tired and a weird feeling at first .	Now no side effects take 4 two mg a day doing great with the migrains. It has been the only medicine that helps prevent them. I eally do have my life back. Is great. I used to get injections from my doctor to make the pain go away and sometimes it would talk several a week to knock out the headache. I have not been back for a n injection In at least 8 months. I hope it helps others.	F	41	8  weeks	12/10/2007Email
4	pain in buttocks from collapsed L4	slight dry mouth and sleepiness which is pleasant at bedtime which is when I usually take it.  No other symptoms.  I can take 2 mg daytime and function.  My liver enzymes have been normal.	not as strong as I would like it so be	F	54	2  times	12/8/2007
5	migrains	a little sleepy at times. Gets alot better once in your body. But not getting as miny migrains.	Has been working very good> got my life back.	F	41	1  days	12/4/2007
3	severe shoulder/neck pain	Brief drowsiness when I began taking them, but only lasted a week or so now I take max dosage staggered through out the day with very little if any effects.	When I began taking I noticed they would extend the length of time I would benefit from trigger-point injections. Now I am not sure if the length of time has built a tollerence but I feel as though there is less benefit.	M	36	9  months	11/26/2007
5	muscle spasms mid back	tiredness	have had spasms in my back for years. percocet (for a knee injury) did not help my back. my dr prescribed zanaflex and the spasms actually stopped. huge relief. it may only last 4 hours and makes me tired but it is worth it. i was in a car accident and had whiplash recently, i had intense headaches for weeks.  this was the only med that took care of the pain.	F	40	1  years	11/24/2007
1	lower back pain	horrible hallucinations		F	52	4  days	11/11/2007Email
2	Fibromyalgia, Lumbar Disc Disease	The medicine works great for spasms and spasticity. The problem was I could not achieve the theraputic dosage without feeling like I was going to faint every time I tried to stand.	I still use it on very bad days when I know I'm not going to have to get out of bed. I break the pills in half and take 2mg every 4 hours. However, I have better luck with Valium and pain medication. I encourage anyone with Fibromyalgia to ask their doctor about Lyrica.	M	34	3  months	10/31/2007Email
5	FIBROMYALGIA	NO side effects	Zanaflex has been a life saver for me! I was not able to sleep for more than 2 hours at a time for years. Then I found Zanaflex.  I sleep 4 hours, take another one and sleep 4 more.  It's WONDERFUL.  It relaxes all of my muscles which try to atrophy because of my fibromyalgia.  It's a non-addictive fantastic drug!	F	53	7  years	10/23/2007
5	migraines, neck spasams	goofey feeling. very sleepy. Do not drive while taking this. Last about 4 hours. will mess with you stomach.	does a wonderful job on migraines. not much for the neck not for long.	F	40	5  months	9/5/2007
5	Back pain, Insomnia	Sleepiness (which is what it was prescribed for)	Was having bad back pain and difficulty falling asleep. Zanaflex helps me fall asleep although I do not stay asleep for very long. I wake up rested with no grogginess.	F	23	3  months	8/29/2007
3	spinal stennios , occipital neuralg	dizzy, sleepy, makes me feel strang most of he time.	Its works for a short time. and sometimes makes me feel strang. I do'nt like that. But the docter does not want to cahnge it not sure why. really would like to try something else less side effects.	F	40	7  weeks	8/15/2007
2	Neck Pain, CFS, Muscle Pain	Involuntary bladder leakage, yeah wetting the bed, nightmeres, major sedation.	Not a great medicine. I use it for sleep when I can't fall asleep. Otherwise, if you have neck pain that is not muscle related, this isn't your drug. I definately can see it being used as a sleep inducer, not sustainer. Trazodone'll do that.	M	22	3  months	5/27/2007
4	cervicogenic muscle spasm	A benign drug, just drowsiness. No bad taste afterward.	Doesn't knock out spasms as well as Valium or even Soma, but it's not addictive either, a big advantage. Can't take during day because of sleepiness. But at bedtime 2 to 6 mg can make the difference between wakefulness due to spasm, and sleep. Won't get me through the night though. Unlike Flexeril and Skelaxin, doesn't give me restless leg. Seems to be a light drug compared to some of the heavyweights out there, and can't cope with the worst spasms, but then nothing else could either. A good, safe drug for pain from muscle spasm.	F	53	2  years	5/26/2007
5	Fibromyalgia	Drowziness	Zanaflex is the only muscle relaxer on the market that actually works!  And believe me I know, Ive been prescribed them all.  I am currently on 8 mgs at bedtime and it has made a huge difference in my sleeping.  I now sleep atleast 5 hours until it starts to wear off and the pain starts to come back.  I take 4 mgs occasionaly during the day but I dont all the time because it makes me so drowzy.  But if im having painful spasms...ill take the drowziness over the pain.  My father even takes Zanaflex.  He broke his neck 7 years ago and nothing works for him.  He is on pain medication that is unheard of.  The only muscle relaxer that even comes close to helping him is Zanaflex so that must tell you something.	F	26	1  years	3/4/2007
5	ms/spasams	i take my last dose an hour before i take lunesta great sleep, during the day im a bit laid back but not sleepy.	does great with the muscle relaxation, and tremors and spasams.	F	31	6  months	1/11/2007
5						 	12/25/2006
5	Generalized Dystonia	Slightly tired when I take my daytime dose, but I also have epilepsy and take 3 anticonvulsants so I think they contribute to that. I take 4 mg of tizanidine 3 times a day for my dystonia and it works great along with regular botox injections	I used to take baclofen but it made my seizures worse, this did not affect them and it works really well. I now only have slightly inward bent feet and a shoulder that is curved from a spazm. The botox/tizanidine mix have worked when nothing else did.	F	28	2  years	11/10/2006
3	Fibromyalgia	I had to stop taking this medicine because of an allergic reaction to it.  For about 2 weeks, I was taking it and I gave it a rating a "3" in terms of helping to reduce my fibro symptoms.  However, I broke out with a horrid rash and hives on the 3rd week.  We had to rule out a Stevens-Johnson situation at first.  That was the intial concern of my physician.  However, after stopping the medicine, the rashes completely resolved themselves about one month after discontinuation.	This was a RARE situation for me.  I have no known allergies to everyday things (pollen, plants, foods, etc.) and I have no other medicine allergies.  So this was just an unusual case.  It was unfortunate also, because the med seemed to be helping me quite a bit and if I were not allergic to it, I would probably still be taking it.	M	42	2  weeks	10/10/2006
3	CBP/Fibro/RSD/Severe Spasms....	The only problem I have is trouble sleeping. I take 4mg. 4x a day and all my meds. cause sleepiness and I am awake 22 hours or more at a time. When I finally fall sleep it is only for 2 to 4 hours.	The medication works pretty well. On my bad days it doesn't help the bad spasms, even if I take 6 mg.  But, Zanaflex is better than any other drug of this type.	F	42	6  years	8/23/2006Email
4	spinal damage causing muscle spazem	Very dry mouth, strange taste in mouth after sleeping. Drowsiness.	Works very well for me, I only take 4mg at a time. Very few leg cramps now. Sleeping much better.	F	34	4  months	7/3/2006
4	Multiple Sclerosis	None, other than slight drowsiness.  I take it a bedtime to help with severe foot cramping.	Works fairly well for relaxing muscles at bedtime.  Other than short-term drowsiness, I've had no adverse side effects from Zanaflex or Tizanidine generics.	M	50	5  years	3/27/2006Email
3	TMJ	loose bowel movement approx. 12 hours after taking medication, nothing that is worrysome.	One dose usually helped with pain and spasms in jaw, neck and shoulder. I take it only when I cannot stand the pain or my concentration level is affected, which usually means the spasms are next. I do take it during the day and have not experienced sleepiness or impaired my working routines. Sometimes the one dose does not affect the pain and spasms and I have had to take a second dose after a hour or two when I absolutely need relief. That is when I got VERY sleepy and had to lie down. I take it as needed, approx. 2 to 8 doses per month, depends on the stress levels.	F	46	3  years	11/15/2005Email
5	FIBROMYALGIA	Dry Mounth, only seems to work for about 4 hours at a time, but I take again after 4 hours.	Thank GOD for Zanaflex!  It's been the only thing that has been able to help me sleep in years!	F	51	4  years	11/8/2005
5	Fibromyalgia	Drowsiness, hallucinations	This med works GREAT for muscle spasms and pain.  I've had a few hallucinations, but am aware of reality.  Pretty weird experience the first time though.	F	49	3  years	10/28/2005Email
4	back pain/spasms after car accident	serious sleepiness, dizziness, unpleasant taste in mouth next morning	I have chronic back pain following an accident. I take zanaflex very occasionally, only as needed (once, twice a month). I was having some very bothersome back pain for about a week that just kept getting worse. I took a zanaflex one night - it made me fall asleep within about 10 minutes. I woke up in the middle of the night and was so dizzy I nearly walked into a wall. But the next morning, the pain and discomfort was GONE! It was amazing. Just one dose, too. Now, after a few days, a little bit has returned (not surprising, since this is a chronic condition), but if it gets bad again, I plan to repeat the dose. I think it's best only to take it when you really, really need it, for maximum effectiveness.	F	24	5  months	8/24/2005
3	severe neck pain	extreme fatigue, dizziness	It helped my pain because it made me fall asleep, so therefore I didn't feel any pain. It also relaxed my muscles. It cannot be taken throughout the day however, because of the soporific effects.	F	24	2  weeks	7/11/2005Email
4	Severe TMJ	Sleepiness; difficulty breathing	Had to take half a pill until i got used to it. Now take one at night before sleep.	F	54	2  years	11/16/2004
5	Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy	TirednessDry mouth	Zanaflex has been a lifesaver for my muscle spasms. It is the only reason I am able to get a good night s sleep	F	36	3  years	10/24/2004
5	Fibromyalgia	Drowsiness. I cannot stay awake on this drug if my life depended on it.	Zanaflex definatley helps with my insomnia. It only helps with my muscle pain by making me sleep. I take it every night because if I didnt I would never get to sleep!	F	22	2  years	7/18/2004Email

3	Bipolar 2	I was hypomanic after the death of my father in November. Began taking Depakote in early December for anger/rage/mood problems.  Psych suggested Abilify might help Depakote work better.  While my mood is better and my anger issues are nearly non-existent now, I'm finding I'm still a bit hypomanic and the Abilify creates extreme restlessness in me.  While my house has never looked better and I'm getting lots of project done, I find I can't sit still for longer than 10 minutes and by the end of the day my feet ache for being on them so long running around in the house and doing all my projects.	Together with Depakote.  Doc now prescribing propranolol for agitation/restlessness/irritability - would rather prescribe additional med for side effect than change primary meds...and I agree with his decision.  Doc now bumping me up to 10mg 1xday and propranolol 10mg 1xday.	F	36	7  weeks5mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email
1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.	F	52	8  years20 MG 1X D	1/13/2012Email
2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
