2	Surgical Menopause	Headaches, extreme weight gain, hair loss, nausea, carb cravings, moodiness, depression, dizziness, fainting, water retention, acid reflux, vision changes, extreme fatigue, greatly increased sex drive, breast pain, back pain, elevated blood pressure	It controls my menopause symptoms flawlessly. That said, I think the side effects may kill me. Back to the drawing board.	F	32	3  months20 MG 1X M	12/21/2011Email
5	Surgical Menopause	Slight weight gain, cravings for carbs. Slight hair loss.	This is the only HRT that has worked for me since my hysterectomy. I have no appreciable side effects, and am having no menopausal symptoms! It's been my miracle drug!	F	32	2  months20 MG 1X M	11/11/2011Email
4	perimenopause	makes me a little spacey; some headaches at first; overall a miracle drug not only for bad perimenopause symptoms but also for mood ~ has taken away most of my depression.  ladies, try this in combo w/ an ssri, or try this first.  it may be your hormones that are out of whack, not your brain chemistry.
