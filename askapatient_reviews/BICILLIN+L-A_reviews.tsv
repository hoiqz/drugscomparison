1	recurrent staph infections	rash, neuropathy, psychological, vision	I haven't been able to find ANYTHING about other people's adverse effects from this drug.  And, my own doctor didn't report any of my side-effects because he claimed they were all already listed in the Physician's Desk Reference.  My experience with this medicine was HORRIBLE!!!  The worst part was that I didn't associate my problems with this medicine because they wouldn't kick in until a day or two after my monthly injection.  It's not the penicillin because I'm not allergic.  Dr. thought it could have been the benthazine suspension.	F	42	8  months	8/9/2009
