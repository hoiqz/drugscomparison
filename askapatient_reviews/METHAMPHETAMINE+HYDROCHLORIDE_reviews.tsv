5	ADHD	This is absolutely the best medication for ADhD . It literally does not produce any side effect or atLeast does not forMe. It works very smooth. does not cause me to have headaches or effect anything, but helps me  organize my life great . Without , I amALiteral mess and I amTried to take  all of them . focal in is the only other than somewhat does the job in short  lengths . The price of this med will cause one tonfall over Andy insurance does not cover . 60 tabs of 5mg is an bag of $384 and the generic is roughly $315. This wouldMakeMost scattered brained  just to add this bill every month . I can barely afford this and crazy they have elevated the price this much, especially when not too many take the med andMost doctors are scared to prescribe . It's a literally conspiracy . Lol . But really ! Wish would lower or find a match for the med .		F	44	10  years5mg	5/16/2013Email
5	ADHD	Slight annoyance when dose wears off as ADHD symptoms return	This is by far the best ADHD medication out there.  Little to no side effects, and no "push" like with other amphetamines or ritalin.  Desoxyn simply allows me to manage my thoughts in an orderly fashion like a normal person, which in turn allows me to get things accomplished which were previously almost impossible.  I fear that due to the social stigma of meth, this medication may one day be phased out which would not be good for my mental health.  Also the cost of this medication has risen by about 1000% in the past two decades.	M	27	5  years7.5 mg 1X D	7/23/2012
3	ADHD	Mild Bruxism & short temper for 1-2hrs at end of day after last dose wears off. Adhd symptoms come back quickly and a little worse too. They don't make an extended release version (at least in US) so if I'm late on my 2nd or 3rd dose of the day my adhd comes back worse than normal and that makes it harder to remember to take the missed dose (like a vicious cycle) which is why I only rate it a 3. Would be a 4 if it was extended release.	Works for me with concentration and motivation but doesn't help me transition between tasks very well. Dr. added welbutrin and together I can muster up motivation and keep up the concentration to stick with tasks and transition between tasks. Wish I would have had it in college. Tried provigil, ritalin (immediate release & concerta), adderall (immediate release and extented), Straterra and dexedrine with little to no noticable benefits. I was so desparate that I tried to convince my Dr to give an Rx for catapres since the stimulants helped only a little and the other meds not at all, but he suggested desoxyn, and I'm glad he did. Note: If you have narcolepsy & adhd - Doesn't work as good for narcolepsy as the provigil did for me, but it still does work.	M	45	4.5  years10mg 3X D	5/4/2011
5	Concentration issues	None, except decreased appetite (which is good when you've taken zyprexa and risperdal).	I think it is great for concentration. I take it for concentration issues due to psychosis/schizophrenia. I also take Seroquel 700mg, Cymbalta 120mg, Anafranil 100mg, and Klonopin. It's expensive, but I believe they have started making a generic again. Highly recommended.	F	17	2  months10 MG 1X D	6/3/2010Email
5	ADHD	Always thirsty, sometimes I feel a little tired or "zoned out"	In comparison to all of the other ADHD meds (I have tried most of them) this one has significantly fewer side-effects and is far better in serving its purpose.  It doesn't make you "hyperfocus" on whatever it is you're doing, like Adderall and Ritalin tend to do; rather, it allows you to prioritize and successfully fulfill your obligations.

3	Severe primary hypersomnia	Feel like my emotions are out of control, easily tearful, easily frustrated/agitated; very dry mouth and bad taste like I've been sucking on chalk; nausea; headache; loss of appetite. Big stima attached to taking this drug. I had a bad experience at one pharmacy where they treated me like I was a criminal or an addict or something.	I really want this medication to work since Dexedrine and Ritalin no longer do but I am not sure I can handle the side effects. It takes a bit longer than Dexedrine to kick in but keeps me much more alert and awake than Dexedrine. Also, it did not cause heart palpitations like Dexedrine did. I could never figure out the equivalent dose. I was taking 17.5 mg of Dexedrine twice a day. It seemed like 10 mg of Desoxyn seemed about right but I wasn't sure.	F	40	2  weeks	4/5/2009
5	narcolepcy	tolerance building	too quickly builds tolerance requiring larger dosages	M	61	3  years	1/23/2009Email
5	sleeping to much	Desoxyn works well, there are times that it takes days before it really works.	Desoxyn is high priced. Would like to know of a cheaper place to get them.	F	44	3  days	3/3/2008Email
5	Narcolepsy	None this drug has much better life duration. Two years on the same dose. Off for one month. Once more works like a charm. Much better than any other stimulant medicine. Never thought about upping the dose. For me a wonder drug.	Yes I did test positive for meth. After showing the script she had to say sorry.	M	45	4  years	5/21/2007

4	Idiopathic Hypersomnia	It has caused my hands to shake a lot and dry mouth.  Muscles in my body twitch and jerk when I lie down but I'm not sure what that's from.	Desoxyn has helped me stay awake in the daytime when nothing else would.  Insurance won't cover it (or Ritalin, Adderall, Provigil) and it's $450 for a month so I think I am going to stop it and see how I do.	M	48	3  months	6/3/2005Email
5	ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER	PERSONALLY I DIDNT HAVE ANY NEGATIVE SIDE AFFECTS FROM THE MEDICATION	IN 1999 I COMITTED A CRIME, AS A RESULT I WAS PLACED ON PROBATION. IVE TAKEN A VARIETY OF MEDICATION THROUGH OUT THE YEARS BEGINING AT THE AGE OF 8,IVE EXPIERMENTED WITH SUCH MEDICATIONS AS CYLERT,RITALIN,ADDERAL,DEXIDREN, THEN LAST I WAS PRESCRIBED, DESOXYN I FINALLY FOUND THE MISSING LINK, SO TO SPEAK, MY LIFE WAS FINALLY MAKING SENCE. TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, WHILE I WAS ON PROBATION,I WAS GIVEN A DRUG SCREEN, THE RESULTS WERE POSITIVE FOR METHAMPHETAMINE, I HAD A LETTER FROM MY PSYCHATRIST,STATING DESOXYN WOULD CAUSE A METH POSITIVE,MY PROBATION OFFICER READ THE LETTER,PUT ME IN HANDCUFFS AND SAID TELL IT TO THE JUDGE. I STAYED IN THE COUNTY JAIL FOR 3 MONTHS WITH OUT BOND, WAITING FOR MY HEARING, AND THE OUT COME OF MY HEARING WAS MY PROBATION WAS REVOKED AND I WAS SENT TO ALABAMA STATE PRISON (JULIA TUTWEILER PRISON FOR WOMEN) I WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY ON AUGUST 5 2003, I WAS FINALLY RELEASED AND BACK WITH MY FAMILY JANUARY 7 2005. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE ALL THINGS HAPPEN FOR A REASON, AND MABY ONE DAY THAT WILL BE REVEALED. THE LORD IS THE HEAD OF MY LIFE, AND I THANK HIM FOR BRINGING ME BACK TO MY FAMILY. IM CURRENTLY PRESCRIBED RITALIN AND TAKE IT AS I SHOULD, AS FOR THE DESOXYN ....... WELL NOTHING ELSE COMPARES,IN MY OPINION ITS BY FAR THE BEST MEDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADHD. AND MABY AS MORE PEOPLE BECOME AWARE OF ITS BENIFITS, THEY WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO BE SO CRITICAL . THANK YOU & GOD BLESS	F	35	3  months	1/11/2005Email
3	depression-refractory.	Repetitive actions (pursuing the same activity beyond what was usual for me).Did not produce ANY real, good energy-only a way to keep going.  But...at least it did that!		F	44	2  years	7/5/2004
