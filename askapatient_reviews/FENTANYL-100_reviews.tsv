4	adhesive arachnoiditis, FBS	constipation, lack of concentration, mild irritation at the patch site, possible short term memory lapses	I've been on the patch for about 6 months, and have tolerated it pretty well.  I've been on morphine ER, methadone, and oxycontin, and the fentanyl patch has helped more than the others.  For me, as with others, it doesn't last the intended 3 days, so my doctor has me replacing the patches every 2 days instead, which works out well.  The best thing about these patches is that they have limited the severity of my most intense pain ("attacks" as I call them), and I can at least move around the house while on the patch, as I am bedridden without it.

1	back pain	griting teeth, immediate withdrawal symptoms, itching, loose stools, depression, loss of appetite, emotions all over the place, and it goes on and on.	My doctor and I strongly feel that I had allergic reaction to this medication because I am allergic to vicodin too. This medication was suppose to last 72 hrs instead I started having withdrawal symptoms as soon as I placed the patch on my arm! Be careful! I felt like I was better off dead and thought i was going to be.	F	45	7  weeks75 1X D	12/9/2011
4	failed lower back surgery, fibromya	sleepiness, loss of concentration, very bad side effects if you don't change patches every three days	have been through withdrawal because a doctor told me to just stop using them so I could change to opana.  Do not just stop at once!  You must decrease your patches very slowly to avoid nasty withdrawel symptoms.	F	54	6  years125mg 10X M	2/22/2011
