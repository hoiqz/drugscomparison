5	End stage of fever blister	No side effects	I had a lingering ulcer left over from a fever blister, just inside my bottom lip. My dentist put some of this paste on it and then I applied it again in a few hours. I left it on for abt 3 hours each time and it was gone when I removed the paste the second time. All that gooey yellow tissue that would NOT go away, was gone and the ulcer looked calm. No redness. Still a little tender b/c it needs to re-grow the skin in that spot. This paste was a miracle for me!	F	50	1  days0.1% 3X D	12/14/2011
5	sores in mouth	I did not experience any side effects. This is the BEST medicine I have taken for my mouth. It does not sting like other canker sore medicines and it usually clears up the canker within three applications with relief by the second day. It is has worked miracles for me.	You will need an rx to get the medicine. My dentist had never heard of it, it was recommended to me by a regular doctor, but if you ask for it that can find it for you.	F	32	3  years	6/29/2009
5	Canker Sores	I have never had any side effects from using Kenalog in Orabase	I have used Kenalog in Orabase since I as a kid.  My dad was Military and I would get it from the Miltary doctors.  It has taken my 15 years to find a doctor that would prescribe it to me.  I told me husband that he has to try it once and he will understand.	F	35	15  years	5/28/2009Email
