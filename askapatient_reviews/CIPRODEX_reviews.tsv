1	ear infection	body-wide twitching, burning muscles, freezing/burning thighs and shins, numbness and tingling in legs, burning right shoulder, dry eyes, panic attacks, burning joints, popping joints. FOR TWO YEARS NOW	I still can't believe that all of these can be caused by such low dose of Cipro. I was told to use it for 7 days but used it for two months. Maybe everything is a coincidence and I have Sjogren's or Lyme Disease (I have been tested negative for both)	M	29	30  days 1X D	10/5/2011Email
