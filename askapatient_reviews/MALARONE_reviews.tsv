5	Travelling to Africa	I took Malarone for a little over 2 months during my stay in Ghana. I had a strange rash that lasted for a few days that I could only contribute to the Malarone but other than that I had no problem with it.		F	23	2  months	12/15/2009Email
4	Travelled to Venezuela for 2 weeks	Severe and constant nightmares when taken before bed.	I know nightmares isn't one of the advertised side effects of Malarone but both my boyfriend and I had really awful nightmares every single night. He is a grown man and wouldn't even tell me about some of them because he was so upset. We rarely had nightmares before. It got to the point we didn't even want to go to bed like in Freddy Krueger movies. We were taking the tablets at night so after a few days we started to take them in the mornings and the nightmares stopped. Other than that we had no side effects and didn't get malaria!
