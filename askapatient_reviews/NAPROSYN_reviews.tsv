2	achilles tendon	stomach pain, really bad tirednes,couldnt function normally	It took the pain away,but didnt heal my achilles. I had to stop taking it as I couldnt function normally and when I asked in chemist how long shall I take it,she said just stop taking it and u will see if the pain comes back. Of course it came back after few days. And the doctor who prescribed it told me it definetely helps,and yes it helps but only for the time when I take the pills. And just found out that she should send me for physiotherapy,but instead they just feeding me with this painkillers. very angry...	F	26	10  days500g 2X D	1/27/2012Email
1	post-op pain	( I took naprosyn with food both times that I took it but still have SEVERE upper abdominal pain, gastritis, & reflux that so far has lasted 48 hrs.& is unrelieved by Zantac or antacids.		F	40	1  days300 2X D	7/28/2011
1	Anti-inflammatory for joints	Severe stomach cramping, diarrhea, muscle and joint aches, dull ache and occasional sharp pain in upper abdomen.	The doctor, aka Pharmaceutical drug whore, pushed this drug on me to help resolve some mild inflammation issues. I almost immediately experienced all of the problems listed. I stopped taking it after 2 weeks and never returned to the doctor again. I went to a new doc because this did soo much damage to my stomach in 2 weeks that it gave me an ulcer. The new doc said it was an "allergic reaction". lol. This was a wake up call for me. I am now only using Eastern, natural medicines for my body. Since going all natural, I fixed my stomach and lost 16 lbs in 1 month. Be aware most Family Doctors are nothing more than the Pharmaceutical companies's drug whores. Pushing this stuff on their patients just because a pharm sales rep wears a short skirt and brings them bagels.	M	30	14  daysNot sure 1X D	6/16/2011

3	RA	none (if taken with milk or food) but it wears off and is not sufficient alone; also elevates blood pressure.	It is well known that these non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ('NSAIDs'] like naproxen (with the generic familty of names) are not sufficient to deal with RA and must be used with disease modifying anti-arthritis drugs (DMARD's) like methotrexate, if drugs are to be used. However I have recently discovered natural remedies are superier even if you doctors do not want you to know; such as honey and vinegar and vitamen B complexes. I now consider myself effectively cured at the cost of about $10 per month with nature's solutions and no side effects instead of hundreds for drugs that are promised to eventually wear off.I was also disappointed to discover that this drug is available much cheaper over-the-counter with the name Aleve. If you have complete confidence in the medical profession try reading about Michael Douglas, Bill Clinton (both whom were misdiagnosed until it was nearly too late) or Dennis Quaid and the service waiting for you at the hospital in high priced America) etc. Aberrations? I think not! Check out Michael Moore's documentaries. Why the skyrocketing autism? Try government 'acceptable' air and water pollution; and cancers, ADD etc. We are not being told the truth; it's sorta like being told 'everything is fine and go back to the 2nd tower on 9-11; somebody misdirected a plane at tower 1' I make these comments so that hopefully it might save a life like mine!

2	Back pain	Gastrointestinal problems. Left a weird, burning feeling in my throat every time I took a pill.	Naprosyn is crap for pain. Doctors say it works for moderate to severe pain - that is a BUNCH of horse pucky. Doctors are just too scared to prescribe pain medication that actually works.	F	32	3  years500mg 2X D	8/31/2010

5	for getting rid of menstrual pain.		I used to feel such a severe pain since my periods started.I tried many pain killers but all in vein.Then my doc suggested me to have naprosyn and you won't believe it was like a boon for me because my life was almost like hell in periods.Now after having 1 tablet i can spend the whole day.Thanks to naprosyn.	F	25	 500mg 1X D	3/22/2010
5	Cramps	None	Naproxen helped improve the quality of life during my daughters cycle.  She can now stay at school all day without having to come home for extreme nausea and pain.	F	13	4  months	10/7/2009
5	Knee pain		I began taking it for occasional knee pain due to a surgery years ago. I love it! It works so well with no side effects at all! I can't take narcotics as they are just too much for me to handle so this was a great fix! Would recomend to anyone!	F	25	3  months	9/13/2009
2	Prostatitis	Agitation, insomnia, skin discomfort	I was prescribed twice daily 500 MG tablets along with CIPRO for Prostatitis.  After a day or so, I started feeling extremely agitated and could not sleep for three nights.  I also experienced periodic involuntary movements/muscle spasms in my shoulder while trying to sleep.  My doctor suggested eliminating the naproxen and giving it about three days to clear my system.  Sure enough, the symptoms subsided.  I have since read that some NSAIDs are contraindicated with CIPRO and other Fluoroquinolones due to risk of central nervous system reactions.  I'm not sure if this is what I experienced, but am just passing along.	M	45	4  days	6/12/2009
1	arthritis foot & ankle	nausea, diarrhoea, lethargy, loss of appetite, indigestion, stomach pain.some of these lasted 12 days.	it did help the pain a lot, but i would rather not have taken it. side effects worse than pain.	F	71	3  days	3/24/2009
3	JRA	stomach pain, reflux	It didn't get rid of my pain. It just turned it to a dull ache. The stomach pain is worth being able to function instead of being in constant joint pain.	F	17	 	2/6/2009
3	Muscle pain in shoulder and neck	Diarhea	I was at work and I leaned over to have a little toot I thought was gas from the pill and o my gosh it was diarhea! It was a good thing I was only 5 min to get home, I had to get another pair of shoes.  If you take this and feel a toot coming you are going to be in big trouble!! Don't forget to take a newspaper for the car seat!	F	45	2  times	2/5/2009
3	Shoulder tendonitis	Woke up most mornings with hangover like symptoms.  Groggy, dry mouth, dullness - it eventually improved	Takes a few weeks to start working, but then started to feel benefits.	M		6  weeks	1/16/2009
1	low back pain	unbearable stomache pain, felt like I had been stabed under ribs. Extream sweating. Do I throw up or have a bm? finally pain passed 45 mins later then was chilled to the bone.	Very scared, thought I'd need hospital, 6 hrs. later still feel drained	F	49	1  days	11/30/2008
3	unexplained midback pain	Terrible stomach pains, diarrhea	This did help reduce frequency of pain flare ups in my mid back.  However, the excruciating stomach pains (even when taken with a meal!) were so terrible I stopped taking this medication.  i was taking 500mg twice daily.	F	27	4  months	9/12/2008
1	Elbow to hand  Nerve Inflamation	After taking two Naproxen 500, one Thursday night and one Friday night, I still feel like I've been kicked by a horse in the stomach ~ and it is now Tuesday.  Totally incapacitating.	The pharmacist recommended Mylanta as a cure for the "cure" ~ finally getting some stomach relief.	F	60	2  days	7/22/2008
4	Shoulder tendonitus	Extreme drowsiness.	This drug was not "supposed" to make me drowsy, but it did so I had to take it only at night.  It did not have to necessarily be at bedtime; I could watch TV.  But I couldn't do anything else.  It might not have been just the Naprosyn, since I was taking Flexeril and Tylenol w/codeine too.  But I had severe pain and partial loss of my range of motion.  These medications were needed so I could do the painful exercises to regain my mobility.  I think I took it about 2 weeks.	F	46	2  weeks	5/24/2008
3	elbow bursitis from injury	Extreme sleepiness!! This stuff knocked me out!		F	40	14  days	3/12/2008
2	Endometriosis and cramps	Burns the throat when not swallowed really quick.	Doesn't work for period pains unless you have "mild" cramps. If you have cramps on a pain scale of 3-10 it won't do anything.	F	22	2  years	2/25/2008
2	arthritis in the hips	no side effects	I think this drug is worthless. Doesn't help me at all	F	35	10  months	2/14/2008
1	Shoulder Joint Pain	Red, itchy red blothes over 70% of my body -- and I only took 2 pills	It did take care of the shoulder pain, but the shoulder pain was a blessing compared to the constant itching that lasted for 5 days after I stopped taking it.	M	57	1  days	1/22/2008Email
1	menstrual cramps/breast pain	None	This was like taking nothing at all.  It didn't touch my cramps or the breast pain that occurs before menstruation.  Taking ibuprofen (which still doesn't eliminate the cramping pain)does more for the cramps than this stuff.  I've taken darvocet in the past for cramps and those actually worked, I think my doctor is afraid to prescribe them for me though because he is worried I might be a druggie or something.  Maybe naprosyn works for some people, but this has done NOTHING for me.	F	32	30  days	1/21/2008
3	bone spurs	sore arms and legs		M	56	2  months	1/8/2008
2	Pain after removal of bursar in hip	Weight gain, bloating, dry and itchy skin, unpleasant feelings in stomach	I managed to lose 6 kilos in the 3 months prior to my surgery which was removing the bursar from the hip area which was being performed due to 5 years of pain, ceasing long walks and giving up tennis.  6 weeks after surgery I was put on Naprosyn 500, twice a day and immediately started putting on weight, experiencing dry itchy skin and stomach bloating although I was definitely taking the medication with food as instructed.  I now weigh in at the heaviest I have ever been in my entire life.  All in all I do not feel that this medication is worth taking.	M	57	2  months	12/12/2007Email
1	cramps	I developed a stomach ulcer because of this drug.	I used this drug several times a month for over twenty years. It relieved my cramps really well. I now have a ulcer due to this drug. My doctor told me I was safe from the side effects because I didn't use it everyday. WRONG!!! BEWARE of this drug!	F	49	 	12/7/2007
2	sore muscles, to help sleep	similar to a hangover: woke up early AM with dry mouth, next morning was groggy with mild headache and a foggy head that day.	It did releive the muscle pain. Did not help my sleep.	M	51	1  days	10/9/2007
5	Shoulder aches and pains	None to date..	I can move my shoulders (pain free) and I can finally sleep thru the night and feel refreshed in the morning.	M	60	14  days	9/10/2007
5	to get high	I got high	it gets you high	M	14	5  years	8/30/2007
1	rotator cuff / possible SLAP tear	Dizziness/loss of balance so bad I could not walk and vomited. Milder dizzy episodes followed.  Mild stomach pain.  A positive heme during my gynecological exam.  Photosensitivity.  Increase in blood pressure (low BP prior, 110/70).  Muscle cramping, mostly at night, but also during the day in calves extending down to my toes (not a potassium deficiency).	Took the conservative route for my shoulder - Naprosyn and physical therapy.  Amazed that my doctors did not discuss side effects.  Thank God for the internet! Did reduce pain somewhat.  Too many side effects to continue with this med - stopped taking it.	F	52	4  months	8/27/2007Email
5		arthuritis		M	74	 	6/10/2007
3	Hip pain	Dry mouth. Extreme facial burning & flushing.	As a pain treatment Naprosyn has been great. However the facial burning & flushing is completely unacceptable. On to something new & hopefully less problematic!	F	42	4  months	4/13/2007
1	Knee pain	Extreme stomach pain! I feel that I may even have developed an ulcer because of it...	I am pissed off that a doctor would prescribe this drug to me without describing the side effects AND without first asking me if I am prone to stomach distress.	M	34	1  days	2/1/2007
1	broken foot	severe stomach pain		M	56	 	1/13/2007
1	Headaches and migraines	-stomach issues: more uncomfortable than painfull	-I was prescribed Naprosyn for numerous headaches, it did almost nothing -I don't recomend it for people who suffer from headaches, the ironic thing is that in the side effects listed for naprosyn, they say it may cause headaches, go figure.	F	17	 	12/31/2006
1	for arthritis	After taking 1 220mg.tablet daily for about 8 weeks I became dizzy offbalance and I felt so sick that I could not go anywhere. Yes it helped my joint pain some but the side effects felt like they were killing me.!!! Please beware!		F	54	2  months	11/9/2006
4	Muscle pain in upper arm	I get chills which is strange considering it's 101 degree's outside and I've been getting nose bleeds often.  But...the pain is gone and that's a plus!		F	39	5  days	7/28/2006
1		Naprosyn Linked to Stevens Johnson Syndrome 				 	6/30/2006
5	menstrual cramps	myt period shortened from 6 to 3 days, itchy all over stomach ache	I was taking A LOT of Advil for relief until it gave me ulcers, Naproxen seems to only give me mild stomache aches when I take it. I take it a week before my period starts, I feel zero pain.	F	25	9  days	6/5/2006
1	menstual cramps	got dizzy	Try to take 6 pills of Black cohosh a day for menstrual pain.  I took it for 4 months, and now have no pain. This drug doesn't cure, just hides the problem.	F	20	1  years	5/10/2006
4	cramps	i had SEVERE cramps secondardy to endometriosis and fibroids.  Used just about all holistic remedies.  then went to vocodin.  by the way HATED the vicodin.  Made me feel like SH--. plus did nothing for my pain.  The naposyn in conjuction with midol per dr. suggestion has eased the pain by at least 95%.  I do get really tired for a day or so though.  Don't know if it has to do with the meds.		F	40	3  months	4/28/2006
1	Foot pain or neuritis	I developed a laundry list of side effects including nightmares, chills, insomnia, and dry mouth.  Also I happened to develop a lot of tendinitis in my shoulders, my ankles, in my left knee?!	Beware this drug, I took it because of foot pain, and ended up with about 40 percent of my body with tendinitis.  Go figure.  If you have tendinitis stay away from this drug!  Also check out the findings that elderly patients have a 50 percent higher risk of heart attack when using this drug.  My goodness this drug should be pulled from the over-the-counter status! Also there is a warning not to take the drug for more than 10 days beware!	M	54	120  days	4/2/2006Email
1	For bone spurs in my heels	Dizzyness,Drowsyness	I was taking 1000mg a day and had zero relief.	M	29	16  days	12/22/2005
1	knee pain	horrible gastointestinal distress, palpitaions, overall sense of doom	This drug is a killer!  I didn't read the warnings before I took it.  Vioxx killed my Dad - DON'T TAKE THIS DRUG!	F	49	5  days	11/28/2005
4	inflammation around ribs/rib fx	none	seems to work in combination with vicodin	F	34	4  days	9/15/2005
3	Hip Joint Pain	Decrease in Libido.	It worked for the pain and discomfort whilst taking it. The dosage was 1000mg daily! But as soon as the medication stopped I was horney again but with pain!!	M	39	3  months	2/21/2005
2		muscle pain	I am taking naprosyn 500 twice a day for about a month and three days now i have a muscle pain especially in my hands. I think it must be a side effect. i am wondering if there is anyone who has the same problem with me....	F	29	30  days	1/31/2005Email

5	Severe menstrual cramps	none	I swear it saved my life, well at least the quality of life during the cycle. It literally removed all the effects apart from the flow. I have since entered menopause and no longer need it, but don't know how I would have managed for many years without it. The proof was when I'd run out and do a cycle without it, horrid.		54	10  years	1/25/2005
5	Aching joints (back, neck)	None that I noticed	It was a wonder drug. I didn't think a medication could help with my lower back pain. Muscle realaxants and pain killers only worked marginally, but I didn't want to take them for prolonged periods. Naprosyn solved my back pain and aching neck and shoulder pain!

1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.	F	52	8  years20 MG 1X D	1/13/2012Email
2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email
1	depression/anxiety	severe muscle weakness, tremors that have yet to stop 2 months in, not sleeping, pacing		M	44	5  days5mg 1X D	9/19/2011
1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email
1	depression	i would studder sweat like crazy eye twitching hyperactive cry for no reason heart pounding out my chest really high blood pressure pass out from panic attacks insomia talk really fast umm flame up inside theres more thid pill sucks i thought i was going to die		M	31	 30mg 1X D	8/25/2011Email
5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
