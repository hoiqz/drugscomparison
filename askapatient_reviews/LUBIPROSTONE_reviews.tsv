4	Chronic Constipation	A little fatigue and bloating	I started with the 24mcg 2xs per day and had nausea, headaches, abdominal pain, fatigue and mental fogginess. I read that there is an "adjustment period" so I stayed with the program and started to have BMs daily. I very gradually decreased the dosage over time and still get the same benefits with much reduced side effects. I only take one of the small pills per day now, but I still have a little bloating and fatigue, but significantly less than I had with larger dosages and without any medication at all. This medication works for me. I can't give it a 5 rating because I still deal with side effects, although they are minor.	F	49	7  months8mcg 1X D	3/12/2013
2	Celiac complications/constipation	Painful, cramping stomach. Nausea. Body aches. Sudden onset of bloating/gas that does not improve with BM.	This medication was helpful for the first week or two, but for the past 5 days I've felt like I had a stomach bug. No vomiting, but very nauseous and my stomach is very sore. Also extreme bloating has returned. Not sure if I should keep taking or not.	F	27	3  weeks8 MG 2X D	2/21/2013Email
1	chronic constipation	Severe nausea, racing heart beats. Anxiety. I have attempted this med several times and the nausea and reflux was terrible. And felt like my heart was going to explode. Stopped it. Will have to try something else.		F	53	4  weeks8mcg	1/7/2013
2	IBS-C	I have dealt with constipation all my life but only recently witht the severe bloating, abdominal pain and distinction. The first two weeks, this was a miracle drug. I felt normal for the first time in my life. Having BM daily and eating without bloating. For the past week, effectiveness is gone and I'm back where I started. Doctor wants me to continue. Absolutely devastated.		F	26	3  weeks2x D 24 mg	12/21/2012
3	IBS-C	Initially worked for 5 days, then constipated again.	I will take it intermittently because when taking it regularly it doesn't work anymore after the first week and I'm constipated again, why continue to take the poison.	F	32	3  weeks8 mcg 1X D	6/12/2012Email
3	IBS C	None	I haven't noticed any improvement in symptoms yet (that's why I only gave this a 3), but I wanted to report that I do not have any side effects either.  I was advised by my Dr to take this for 4-6 weeks before "giving up" (she said it could take that long before seeing full effectiveness) & if there was no improvement, we'd go from there/explore other options.

4	Constipation	I have gotten very sick taking this medicine. It's more than just nausea, it actually causes me to have to throw up about an hour after taking it.	I used to go once every 2 weeks or so. Within the first two days of taking it, I have already had a bowel movement. Now I just have to decide if being sick every day is worth taking the medicine.

2	chronic  constipation	No change.  The drug simply doesn't work for me.	Obviously, lots of people really get enormous relief from this drug.  We're all different -- I'm one of the unlucky few the drug doesn't help.  What a disappointment.	F	65	3  weeks24 mcg 2X D	10/4/2010EmailHistory
5	IBS-Constipated		Most awesome med ever!!!  I was constipated for most my life with bouts of zero bm and then a day of several bm including diarrhea and horrible stomach cramps!!  I take 1 pill every night before bed and have a bm now almost every day in the morning.  I can thank the makers enough for this!!	F	31	2  years24mcg 1X D	7/22/2010
1	IBS-C	stomach muscles spasms (left side), sudden onset of painful gas, joint pain (knee)	When I first started taking Amitiza, it worked really well. I was taking the 8 mg pills once a day even though the directions said to take it twice daily. This was for about a 2 week period. I was having bowel movements about twice a day and felt great. After prolonged use, I found that it did not work for me. I started to experience muscle spasms on the left side of my stomach, which I have not experienced before taking the pill. Although they are not too painful, it is an odd sensation. Going into the 2nd month, the pill seemed to have lost its effectiveness as I wasn't having regular daily bowel movements like I used to when I first started. Bowel movements were starting to get irregular and I would have movements every other day. I was off the pill for a while and started up again and increased my dosage to two times a day. This had a negative effect as I would have sudden onsets of painful gas which was  embarassing while at work. I have been off Amitiza for 2 months and have decided to go the natural route: reduce stress, improve diet, regular exercise, LOTS of water, and fiber supplements. I have found the exercise has improved my IBS-C as well as reducing stress. The fiber supplements don't really help but I am unsure if I am using them properly (not drinking enough water). Although I still experience bloating, constipation, and gas, it is not as bad as it used to be and is probably due to not following a healthy diet. And the painful gas has lessened.

1	Chronic constiipation	Didn't work and was too expensive besides. I not take Lithium Carbonate 300 mgs at night and have 3-4 movements a day at $2.00 a month. If I take just a third of that it would still work.		F	45	5  days30 mg 2X D	2/23/2010
5	IBS-C ( spastic colon	When i started taking this medication on August 24th 2009, i was a bit hesitant because nothing else had worked.  Anyway i started taking 2 pills a day 8mcg. The NAUSEA was almost debilitating! And, no bowel movements. So i had to wear the Nausea Patch behind my ear which cause MAJOR BLURRINESS and i couldnt focus to read. But, after about a week i actually started having bowel movements which was a blessing! i started having stomach/abdominal issues after i had my gallbladdere removed in 2000. anyway.. so after about a month into the medication which i contemplated stopping several times because i could hardly stand the nausea. im so pleased with it! A MIRACLE!. Now my insurance is starting up saying that i need to try this or that first and im like ive tried everything under the sun and this is the only thing that helps.. what a croc of crap! I would highly recommend AMITIZA.		F	35	6  weeks	10/2/2009Email
3			Worked sooooo well for my constipation! So effective I only have to take it everyother day! The only side effect I have is nausea but I have a zofran Rx for that!	F	25	 	9/13/2009
5	IBS with Chronic Constipation	Some slight nausea.	This medication is a life saver.  After suffering from chronic constipation, I would never go back to living without it.  I went from having a movement once every two weeks [if I was lucky] to once a day.  I'm at 24 mcg twice daily.	F	21	1  years	8/27/2009
3	chronic idiopathic constipation	extreme watery diarrhea	It works great, you definently will not be constipated however you may end up in the bathroom 11 times a day with solid water diarrhea	F	22	3  months	2/28/2008
5	IBS	Bloating, slight nausea	Really helped a lot! I would recommend this medicine. The first week of taking it I was very bloated, however this could be from another medicine I'm taking. Helped me a lot and I feel so much better!!	F	24	10  days	2/26/2008
5	Chronic Idiopathic Constipation	Headache and Nausea, but if taken at night before going to sleep I don't notice the side effects.	Has helped with constipation, bloating, and excessive gas without causing diarrhea or abdominal cramps like a laxative would. I only take 1 a day instead of prescribed two. It's been a life saver for me. I go every two days now, instead of once every two weeks.	F	34	1  years	1/25/2008
5	Constipation	None	I take 24 mcg.  Amitiza is great!  No side effects whatsoever.  Once it takes affect, though,(between 30 min - 1 hr) preplan that you will be near a restroom.	F	41	6  months	1/11/2008
