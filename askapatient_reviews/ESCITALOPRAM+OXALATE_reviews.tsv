2	Anxiety, Panic, Mild Depression	Changed From Brand Name Lexapro 1 Month Ago - relapse of anxiety, horrible mood swings, return of panic attacks, no energy, diarrhea, nausea.....	The efficacy of Escitalopram (generic) is far less than the Lexapro (Brand Name).  I have been on Lexapro for 2 1/2 years with fantastic results.  I have severe anxiety with panic attacks and Lexapro has done wonders far more than any other AD I had tried previously.  A month ago was the first time I had the prescription refilled with the generic form and within a week my friends and family started noticing I was getting very moody and just wasn't myself.  2 weeks into the change to generic I started feeling very anxious and noticed slight zaps of panic attacks setting in.  Around this time I also started having diarrhea and was getting nauseas.  1 Month into the change to generic I was back to being anxious with panic attacks, horrible mood and feeling dull and depressed.  I called my Doctor to swith me back to the brand name but had to wait for my insurance to approve it.  In the meantime, my Pharmacist gave me a few Brand Name Lexapro to get me through until my insurance approved it.  From the first dose I started noticing subtle improvement and three or four days later I was totally feeling better.Now I know everyone reacts differently to these kinds of meds so this is pretty much my opinion, but this generic is NOT the same as it's brand name and I won't be surprised if it doesn't start to receive more poor reviews as it is new to the market this year.

5	DEPRESSION	HAVE BEEN WEANING OFF, FROM 30 TO 20 GRADUALLY AND NOW I AM ON 10. FEELING OK. CAN I GO FROM 10 TO 0 AND HOW LONG	THEY HAVE WORKED FOR ME..	M	74	6  months30 1X D	6/7/2012Email
2	depression	Sinus congestion with plugged ears in the morning, lowered energy, occasional numbness and tingling in hands, arms, legs. Felt down and pessimistic. Appetite increased. Digestion was affected.	I have a gluten intolerance and while I never had a problem with the brand name drug Lexapro, this generic really did not work for me. I suspect it contains gluten. I have switched back to the brand name because it is really not worth it to experience these side effects; it's worth it to pay more fro the brand name.	F	37	3  weeks10 1X D	5/22/2012
4	Depression/anxiety	Tiredness in the afternoons, weight gain	This drug has been very good for calming my mind and stopping anxious and fearful thoughts...however, I have recently cut down to 5mg with a goal to wean myself off completely, as I'm fed up with being so tired and with the weight gain.
