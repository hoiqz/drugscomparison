2	High Blood Pressure	I had muscle weakness taking this drug. I could BARELY lift items and move items that's how weak I was! Also, diuretics in general can cause erectile dysfuntion so if you're a guy, stay away from them if you have high blood pressure! I'm on Enalapril now.		M	32	2  months10 1X D	11/13/2010

3	moderate high blood pressure	My blood pressure has been a little high so my doc put me on this medication. I lost 30 pounds within 3 months. Loved that! However, my hair started falling out. It took about six months to notice how thin my hair had become. I now only take this medication 3x a week and taking large doses of prenatal vitamins. My hair is starting to grow back after 2 months. My blood pressure was borderline at my last check up.		F	44	8  months	7/12/2009
