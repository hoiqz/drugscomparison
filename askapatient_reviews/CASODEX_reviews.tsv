1	prostate cancer	aching,tender nipples, enlarged breasts, hot flashes.	Stopped taking after one month.	M	59	30  days	8/2/2007
4	Advanced prostate cancer	I have had no side effects that I can contribute to Casodex since I am taking other medicines that might be causing the weakness and lack of energy.  The other medicine, imipraine, seems to be the major cause of my weakness.  I also had an orchiectomy (castration) and that didn't help either. All in all I praise the Lord that I am alive and can still get about.	When I started taking casodex my PSA was 0.6.  Now it is less than 0.2.  I watch my liver "numbers" since I have also had hepititis B and have a core antibody resulting from that.  So far so good.	M	76	2  years	10/14/2006Email
