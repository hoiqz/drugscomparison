1		Omg...I can't take this at all as I my breathing gets worse after taking it. Loss of appitiete as well and strange twitching feeling under my right rib also have no energy at all. Going back to Advair!!		F	51	2  days 2X D	3/4/2013
4	Asthma	Possible thresh starting (yeast infection in the roof of my mouth) if I don't rinse my mouth.  As long as I gargle with water with a slight bit of vinegar in it I'm fine.  When I first started taking it I'd get slightly shaky or dizzy for a few moments after taking it.	My asthma was out of control because my apartment was exposed to cat dander.  My other asthma medications (Flovent) were not helping at all, Dulera is a lot more effective for me.  Now I'm taking a combination of it plus Zyrtec -D and that really helps.

3	asthma	First time taking it I felt much relief of my chest tightening symptoms. Once it wore off my chest felt weaker, sore and it hurt to cough. Scared of the warnings and debating on taking it again or not.		F	28	1  days200/5	11/13/2012Email
