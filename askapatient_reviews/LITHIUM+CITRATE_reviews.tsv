4	Depression	Slurred speech (which cleared up after a few days). Auditory  and Visual Hallucinations (primarily Auditory) which did not clear up. Difficulty concentrating.	I took an anti-psychotic with this medication because of the side-affects I experienced... which I started on approximately a week after starting. The reason why I put 4 was because, regardless of the side-affects, this is the only medication that has successfully helped my depression. I loved it while I was on it, but I dropped all my medication for some time. I'm actually considering getting back on it because nothing else has helped. I have been on Prozac (which I had to continually up because I gained a tolerance to it extremely quickly), Paxil (made me hella happy but put me out... I was constantly sleeping), Abilify (I barely remember taking this one... but I know it made me feel flat/emotionless), Depakote (this one made my depression WORSE! I had horrible mood-swings and was angry or depressed for the 5 hours each day that I was actually awake).I will note that Lithium probably isn't the drug for everyone. I was placed on it because I was against artificial drugs and my psych made a plea-bargain with me. I've dealt with a psychotic disorder for years now, so the hallucinations didn't bother me that much, but they do make it hellishly hard to concentrate.But still, what it did for my mood without completely knocking me on my butt or taking me so freaking far out reality... was amazing.I loved it.

5	Bi-Polar, anxiety disorder	Lithium is a very clean drug. I experienced alot of sleepiness for the first month so I took naps.	It saved my life. After a month on Lithium Citrate I enrolled myself in college and earned a 4 year degree. Don't be afraid to take this drug! I find it very relaxing too.	F	41	10  times	7/25/2008
1	bi-polar	got lithium poisoning, no concept of time or reality, the people around me and I didnt feel anything was wrong. Pass out mid sentence mid motion	This has got to be the worst drug I've ever been put on. It took 4 weeks of trying to convince the NP that it wasn't the methadone. I stopped taking the methadone to prove it 3 days later they couldnt even wake me up. i was days away from coma. They stopped te lithium after having my levels checked FINALLY! and I was one point away from the highest possible rate. I'm 5'2 110, I could have died. The scary part wasnt the toxisity, it was coming off it. Being toxic you havent a clue. As I was coming down I noticed how much hair I was loosing, How I couldnt read or write, I also had a hard time walking and putting sentences togethr. I would get lost in my thoughts. It took about 2 mo to finally be able to function halfway normal. I still have cognitive problems and post tramatic stress from this. Lithium is a chemical labotomy and there are much more safe drugs availible now that dont reqire you to be tested every week. There is a 0.1 difference between theraputic and toxic and toxic in so	F	33	3  months	12/7/2007Email
2	Extreme Bipolar I disorder	Weight GAIN, lethargy, fatigue, stomach pain, living in a haze. Didn't help my moods.	Works for some, but it didn't work for me. I wouldn't ever go on it again.	F	21	2  years	7/12/2007
1	bi-polar	weight loss, extreme paranoia, metallic taste in mouth, cold within my body that never went away, zombie like,	Turns out I was MISTAKENLY diagnosed as bi-polar.  Which I tried to explain to the Dr. but of course, she knew better!  Horrible, horrible experience.  Had to move back home, couldn't do simple things like balance my checkbook, do my job, or be left alone even for a moment.  It truly was a kind of hell. Wouldn't reccomend to my worst enemy.		36	5  months	5/1/2007
