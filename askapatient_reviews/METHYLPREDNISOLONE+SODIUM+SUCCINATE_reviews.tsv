4	MS	I've had to take Solu medrol a few times over several years due to different exacerbations.  The first thing I noticed was a metallic taste when I ate food or drank liquids.  I had trouble sleeping which has never been a problem for me. I seemed to have increased energy too. One problem I'm concerned about is from time to time, I've been experiencing right hip pain. I've been reading about necrosis and bone problems so my doctor ordered a bone density. The results came back and everything was fine but I increased my Vit D and started taking Calcium as well. From time to time I still having hip pain.		M	53	3  days	6/10/2013Email
3	MS	Metalic taste in mouth, nausea, headache, sleepless.	The first day I was not aware what drug the Neurologist put me on. So I did not eat breakfast and that was a mistake.  I recommend eating before taking. I also would have brought gum for the taste. I did on day 2 and 3 and it helped.  Day 1 was a 60 min drip and I got a horrible headache that night. After researching this page I found if I slow it down it would help. So on day 2 and 3 I requested to move it to 90 min - that helped.  The nausea whet away on these days too, but the slight headache never did. On day 2 and 3 I could not sleep. I did take Nyquil which seemed to help.  I am on day 4 and feeling a bit better. The tingling and burning in my left leg has subsided for the most part. I feel like my entire spine has loosened up a bit too. I still have Lheremettes sign when I look down.  I hope that goes away soon have had it for almost 2 months now. All and all, the drug is not too bad. If it helps in the week to come it will be worth it.	F	40	3  days 1X D	6/7/2013Email
3	Multiple Sclerosis	weight gain of about 35-40 pounds, full round fac	pins and needles in both feet, but did help me walk	F	47	3  months 1X M	3/1/2013Email
5	Juvenile rehumatoid arthritis	Weight gain (but not too bad only 5lbs) and a moon shaped face. But I was on the highest dose possible. But it reduced my pain in my joints by a lot.		F		6  weeks	12/28/2012
3	South Afria	Creamy metallic sulphur taste, mood swings, depression, suicidal feelings, bloating,farting, burping, diarhoea	Solumedrol is much better than taking oral prednisone. The oral meds gave me a moon face, weight gain, most of the sulphur taste and other bodily secretions. However, the psychological side effects are mostly from the Solymedrol.  I have Scleroderma and axonal neuropathy or guillaine barre. It has definitely improved the sclero. I still have needles and pins, but the severe pain in my feet is gone. Still early days though, only had my first drip today.	F	37	1  months200mg 1X M	7/13/2012Email
3	MS exacerbation and Polymyositis	Insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, headaches, severe sweating, jittery feeling and dry mouth	Although my symptoms of weakness in my legs and arms clear up temporarily after day two, upon leaving hospital I developed diabetes type 2 from my last 3 day dosage. Be very careful and make sure you get a decent dose of insulin to bring your blood sugar down.	F	46	3  days1000mg 1X D	5/2/2012
4	Multiple Sclerosis Relapse	Dizziness, fatigue, severe weakness of muscles, unable to balance, nausea, surface pain.	Taking this drug is not so bad, but for a few days afterwards you are likely to feel "off" from your normal self. You will have a bad taste in your mouth, so chew gum minty gum. You need to have a lot of rest, and avoid anything stressful. Some things will be hard, like driving, so avoid that. Even if you "feel" ok, allow your friends and family to help you out some. As for the nausea, try Tums or Prilosec, both over the counter.	F	17	5  days1000 mg 1X D	4/14/2012Email

4	MS Exacerbation	Metallic taste, can't sleep, mood swings.	This drug definetly has serious side effects so it should not be taken lightly.  In regards to MS, it is not a cure it is a treatment to help lessen the severity and to shorten the time an Exacerbation, relapse or flare last.  I have taken this drug multiple times since 1996, each time there have been side effects but have had great success as well.I do not use this treatment option until the symptoms become almost too hard to tolerate. So, although this medicine is miserable in some ways, I for one am very happy to have it in my back pocket should I need it.	F	42	3  days1G 1X D	1/12/2012Email
5	lambert eatons myasthenic syndrom	Slurred speech, off balance , trouble walking , cordination bad, was tested for stroke several times that's how bad symptoms where	When I first started infusions the side effects were very bad , insomnia, muscle soreness, metallic taste. But this drug helped me tremendously , my symptoms are all but gone , there may be some permanent damage ,and the side effects are weel worth it now they only last for a few hours to a couple of days and the insomnia is all but gone , would highly recommend for anyone with same diagnoses.

4	MS Relapse	Metallic taste is horrible starts about 15 minutes in and takes days to go away.  Sour helps... Cranberry Juice or Lemonade works teh best.  Noticed some reliefe of symptoms about 5 hour after treatment. Less numbness. Mood Swings are increased as well as hot flashes around Neck and face.  Insomnia is horrible.  Can't sleep at all.  Appetite is increased. starting the Taper down of Oral Prednisone tomorrow. But feeling Better so I guess the side effects are worth it		F	36	3  days800mg 1X D	8/10/2011
4	MS activity	Sore throat, irritable, headache, metallic taste in mouth, nausea, neck and shoulder pain	So far feeling weak but just finished i.v. yesterday. Nurse said it can sometimes take a couple weeks. hoping for improvement. Time will tell. Flare up causing right arm numbness and weakness, right leg issues, balance issues	F	27	3  days1000 1X D	5/7/2011
4	ms flare up	increased brightness after about 20 min. no insomnia but did get a little increased confusion. shaky legs. increased appetite (only had one day of severe hunger pains lol) did have the banding feeling around my stomach for a few days afterward but it wears off. bad metallic taste lasts for a while. i could taste it about a half hour into the drip. taste stays affected for a while (few days so far)	the iv is a hassel and i have had to have the line reinserted several times because it sometimes slips out of the vein. but it is worth it. and the positive effects, while not always immediate, are really worth it. the nurses who put it in are always available so do not hesitate to go to them with a concern	F	34	5  days 1X D	4/20/2011Email
4	Multiple Sclerosis - Exacerbation	Metallic taste in my mouth, tingling sensation in arms and legs - first day, insomnia, mood swings, Leg pain and often felt heavy, hard to walk at times, rapid heart rate, felt like heart was pounding out of my chest, headache.	It brought back my vision the first day I was on it but the pain lasted until the second day in my eyes. Following I had all of the above side effects.	F	26	5  days1 gram 1X D	4/8/2011Email
4	MS Flare	Metal taste, sleeplessness, accelerated heart rate, severe increase in blood pressure, hot flashes in face and neck, sweating, joint pain, head aches... pretty much all the standard ones.	Have had MS for 8 years now have nave spent a lot of time doing 5 grams over 5 day runs.  I rated the drug a 5 for the fact that it is effective, but it is not the silver bullet for MS... it simply relieves some swelling in a hope that will help your symptoms.  	M	37	5  days1 gram 1X D	3/19/2011
2	Peripheral Neuropathy	All the standards - weight gain, anger, mood swings, dizziness, spike in blood sugar, insomnia, feeling plain lousy	I'm halfway throgh a 12-week regimen in hopes of slowing down a very agressive form of neuropathy.  I'm virtually insensate below my knees - so I'm hoping the side effects are worth the possible positive results. So far, no improvement at all, however.	F	53	12  weeks1 gram 1X W	1/7/2011Email
5	psoriasis	Body aches and fatigue the next day	I HAVE HAD PSORASIS SINCE I WAS 16. I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING TO CLEAR UP MY BREAKOUTS. I WENT TO A RHEUMATOLOGIST AS A LAST RESORT. HE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN GIVING ME SHOTS OF SOLUMEDROL ONCE A MONTH- WITHIN 2 WEEKS, THE PSORIASIS WAS COMPLETELY CLEARED UP. 15 YEARS OF CREAMS AND OINTMENTS DID NOT HELP. IF YOU ARE TRULEY SICK WITH A DEVASTING DISEASE - IT'S WORTH THE RISK OF FEELING BAD FOR A FEW DAYS.	F	33	4  months120 1X M	11/25/2010
2	optic neuritis, diagnosed MS	Horrible awful yucky taste-smell.Ew ew ew! I tried gum the second day it helped, byt for the rest of the week everything tasted off. "Hot flashes" to my face and neck. The nurse had to slow the drip down because it was hurting my vein near my shoulder, slower helped. I had these done in the evening(5pm) and then couldn't sleep. During the day I was confused, emotional, kinda' whacky. Extreme mood swings!! My husband and children were very supportive throughout, and believe me, they had to try hard.  Words wouldn't come when I needed them.	The solumedrol didn't work. It has been three weeks and my vision in my right eye is no better. It did nothing for me but waste my vacation time and put my Crazy Hat on.	F	31	5  days100 1X D	10/1/2010Email
3	Dermatomyositis, overlap syndrome	70 pound weight gain; hyperactivity/insomnia night of treatment; veins difficult to find for infusion; metallic taste during and rest of the day of infusion; increased agitation, mood swings.	This drug, like ANY OTHER DRUG, comes with risks.  There is a risk of kidney failure if you take too much Tylenol, so with something like this, you have to take the good with the bad.  The drug company does make this information available; it's the responsisbility of the health practioner prescribing and/or administering the drug to discuss the risks with you. If your doctor recommends a corticosteroid, ask for this instead of prednisone - prednisone may be a "wonder drug", but the side-effects are horrendous. Because I've been on Solu-Medrol for so long, my veins have become increasingly unusable (collapsing, blow out, disappearing, etc...).  I'm unable to lose any weight.  This drug is just keeping my symptoms at bay.  I've tried it in conjuction with a few DMARDS and IVIg, without much success.  The next step is Rituxan - if I pass all the screening tests.  I'm simultaneously scared and eager to try it.	F	39	4.5  years1g 1X W	9/9/2010
3	MS related Optic Neuritus	Weight Gain and Bloating, Metallic Taste, Taste "off" for about 1 week after completion, Confusion, Leg Cramps, Unsatisfied hunger (which didn't help the weight gain and bloating), Tearfulness, easily angered/upset, high blood sugars (I am not a diabetic but had to take insulin), terrible acne, jittery feeling/ felt like muscles in my hands and arms were buzzing, and pshycosis,	I have taken solu-medrol twice and each time have hated it.  Yes, it has helped with the optic neuritus both times but the side effects made me feel like I'd lost my mind.  The first time was the worst (I took for 5 days then), but that could be chalked up to the steroids plus the emotional whirlwind of just being diagnosed w/ MS.  Second time wasnt as bad, but I am still feeling the side effects. Both times I haven't felt quite "normal" or like myself for about a month after and then I have to work hard to lose the weight they put on me (both times about 13 lbs).  I have heard of people loosing weight while on them, and I envy them!  The side effects suck, but I think they are worth it in the long run to have my sight back (I saw improvement in my vision by day 2 of solu-medrol and by the end of my 11 day prednisone taper my sight was almost completely restored)	F	25	3  days 2X D	8/30/2010
3	1st Documented MS Attack-RR	Flushed purple swollen face, aggitation, impatience, extremeties felt hot, metal taste (nothing could fix it);	Day 1: Felt ok, but much better day 2. Felt like my old self again, but I over did it and felt exhausted and achey day 3. Day 3 didn't care I was a bit achey, energy was back and wanted to get things finished; which I did, but over did and felt like I got hit by a bus. Day 4 couldn't recover from being hit by the bus. Definitely slower today, right thigh and knee swollen, face swolle, blisters/acne around mouth and jaw. Legs look like they lost muscle mass.	F	36	8  days1 g 1X D	8/24/2010

3	New MS diagnosis	Slight metallic taste. Burning in the injections site. Uncomfortable feeling in my legs and lower back. Restlessness and slight agitation.	I just finished my last day of treatment. Im scared to see what happens. I kinda hurt and i have been told that the worst is to come. Although, my vision is slightly better and i do have high hopes that this will help after the side effects wear off. All and all it hasnt been too bad, yet. we will see how the next few days go.	F	24	3  days1000mg 1X D	3/5/2010Email
2	MS exacerbation	Almost immediate metallic taste in mouth, was worse during the first treatment, abated somewhat during following treatements. Side effects didn't kick in until several days after treatment ended.	after 3 infusions, I was feeling okay and thought I was not going to have any side effects...until 24 hours after the last treatment. I was slammed by insomnia, I was wired and couldn't sleep despite being prescribed Xanax for that purpose. Sheer exhaustion, but couldn't sleep if my life depended on it. Then came the tears, I was weepy for 3 days, and miserable. I could not catch my breath. I have asthma and thought I was having an asthma attack. It turned out I was having anxiety attacks, which I've never had before. My heart was pounding, I was sweating like a lumberjack and I could not relax. I had a huge spike in neck and shoulder pain, with burning sensations in my shoulders and neck. I didn't notice much improvment in my leg weakness, which is why I opted for the infusion. Seven days out from the last infusion, and I'm not convinced it did much good.	F	47	3  days1 gram 1X D	2/12/2010
4	CIDP	metallic taste in mouth, insomnia, hot flashes, redness of skin, severe muscle cramps in calves, intense agression and irritability, weight gain, made me really hungry	I have lives with intense chronic pain for 3 years, and being recently diagnosed w CIDP I was curious what they could do. I have bveen living with severe joint pain that cause difficulty walking even and after 3 days iv solumedrol i squatted to grab something from a bottom shelf in store. With much less pain! amazing! it wasnt cure but it helped enough to make me hope the effects last. Also suffer from a discoid rash like presents in lupus and it is completely gone. Thats a blessing.

4	mixed connective tissue disease	metallic taste in mouth, flushed face and hot flashes, hyperactivity day of treatment, restlessness night of treatment, body aches day of treatment,weight gain and inability to lose weight, abdominal bloating and gas	Compared to Prednisone, Solu-Medrol is a gift.  I didn't end up with 'moon face' or the sharp mood swings / aggressiveness that I experienced on Prednisone.  And as weird as this sounds, when I was taking Prednisone (a pill), I felt like there was poison running through my veins; I don't have that feeling with Solu-Medrol (which is truly running through my veins). I was on Solu-Medrol for three years, tried to go off of it, and now, three months later, I have to go back on it.  It is inconvenient to have to go to a clinic and have a nurse set everything up, poke a vein once a week, miss time from work etc...., but the relief it provides me is worth it.  Like any medication out there, there are always risks associated with taking it.  Before starting it, patients should ask lots of questions, research articles online etc....  As with any corticosteroid, be sure your doctor also gives you a prescription for calcium with vitamin D - like Fosamax, which can also be purchased in generic form.  It's very important since cortisone eats away at your bones.   Try to get your clinic appointments in the morning so that you can burn off some of the 'energy' during the day. This will suppress your immune system - try to stay away from people with colds, flus, etc....  A Medic-Alert bracelet is a good idea in case you are ever incapacitated.  The fee is minimal and worth the information it will provide health givers in an emergency.  Anyone with a serious illness should have one.	F	38	3  years	7/25/2009
3	Newly Diagnosed MS	I experienced a bad taste in my mouth during the treatment.I felt the alertness (not Hyperness) about 5 minutes into the treatment. My muscles in my legs ached later each of treatmnent but was easily resolved with some bananas. My face cleared up but my neck, back and chest sufffered mildly. 1g X 3	I was lucky to take the advice that was given by other patients from this site. For heart burn that sometimes happen a prilosec OTC pill helps if you take it 1.5 hours before each time before treatment if your doctor allows. Caramal and Chocalate parfait nips candies are really good to suck on during treatment to curb the bad taste. Tums also helps with breakthrough heartburn and can be taken with the prilosec,with your docotors approval. Doing the treatment 1st thing in the morning helps with the potential for sleep problems  at night for the duration of the treatment. You should check with your doctor if you are concerned about to much hyperness as a result of the steroid and he might be able give you something to help you. I was fortunate to have xanax prescribed for me by my Doctor and it helped. The best advice is to know your body and to ask questions about this medication and what you can look for in side effects. Everyone is so different. I was able to have an experience that was not unbearable. GOOD LUCK	F	32	3  days	7/11/2009
4	Optic Neuritis	I am a Type 1 Diabetic x 24 years, just diagnosed with Optic Neuritis. Doc told me that the IV solumedrol would help but increase my sugars. After first day of treatment my sugars went into high 300's. I had to give myself manual injections as well as normal basal rate thru my pump. The only other side effect during treatment was the horrible metalic taste in mouth. Just chew gum and you'll be fine. However, now I am on day two of completeing the medication and I feel as if someone has taken a baseball bat to my neck, throat, and trunk. Im not in pain persay, just very sore. The way you feel after you've been in a car accident...very odd. Both the doctor and pharamacist said that was not a listed side effect. It has helped with the eye issues which is wonderful. No more double vision, thank goodness.		F	30	3  days	6/24/2009
4	MS exacerbation	Side effects totally different with each round (totaling 15 rounds for past 10 years.) If there's a side effect, I have had it...but not all with every round. Worst ever was SEVERE heartburn (2x) & extreme Psychosis (1x) & I can handle the rest. I did swear for awhile after the psychosis I would NEVER do again but I did after a 3yr break. But I have  lost weight/gained weight...swelled badly/no swelling...insomnia/can't stay awake...high blood sugar/normal sugars.  I always have SEVERE neck/back pain along with sudden drop in blood pressure if I don't taper (won't make that mistake EVER again!!	It seemed to have the most positive/immediate results with the initial doses 10yrs ago (and they are ALWAYS 5 days + taper.) I think your body gets "used" to it and mine just reacts so differently every time...I never know what to expect but i am aware of all the things that COULD happen and knowledge of all of these possible side effects is the key.  Always be aware of any changes going on and tell your Dr. immediately...even if you think it's minor.  He can't do anything or make changes if he isn't aware of it!! Remember...YOU are your best advocate!!	M	37	5  days	5/7/2009Email
5	MS Exacerbation	Slight headache, metalic taste within 15 minutes of IV start, lights appear brighter, lots of energy	This is my 3rd round of Solu-Medro-1 gram IV for 3 days for MS exacerbations.  Although the side effects are not pleasant, the end results are worth it.  No more pain in joints, hands, feet or legs.  All three times I've taken the IV's I have LOST WEIGHT because my appetite just goes away...I count myself one of the lucky ones!  I take 2 Prylosec at least 1 hour prior to start of IV to prevent heartburn and it works, I highly recommend doing this.  About the only this that does not have a severe metal taste is Orange Sherbert. I also suck on Carmel Nips to cut down the metal taste.  I do get extremely thirsty and urinate frequently, but this only lasts for 3 or 4 days.  If you can tolerate Solu-Medrol IV, I highly recommend.  Although it's not the most pleasant experience, it does calm the inflammation.	F	56	3  days	3/9/2009Email
1	Aalborg Hospital	I lost my daughter in November 2006. She died of Solu-Medrol due to a anafylactic chock. Pfizer were aware of the side effect but it was not informed in Denmark	,	F	15	1  days	11/18/2008Email
4	Transverse Myelitis	Worked VERY well for me, but the second three day dosing I had brought my pulse down to 49. Eat potassium rich foods and monitor your pulse. Don't leave the IV room without making sure you get a pulse reading, which they are supposed to do anyway. In the room I had 51 and the nurse thought that was great. It was not.	EAT potassium rich foods. that is what I want to get across to y'all! (I had two three day dosing IVs, two months apart for different TM episodes.)	F	50	3  days	10/6/2008Email
5	MS exacerbations	Once I was prescribed 750 mg. every 2 weeks vs 1000 mg. once a month and I had port put it, ONLY side effect was metal taste for a few hours.	I'D RECCOMEND THIS THERAPY VS LAST ALTERNATIVE...A CHEMO DRUG WTH MANY SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS.	F	65	 	9/10/2008Email
4	Anti inflammatory	I don't recall any.	I have a moderate reaction to latex. It was given to me in surgery. I had some itching, but it didn't last long. It was very effective for my autoimmune disease process as well as help with the post surgucal itch.	F	40	1  times	8/13/2008
1	MS flare-up	stroke, high blood pressure	I would strongly recommend anyone taking this drug to do so very cautiously.  My Dr. put me on IV Solu-Medrol about once a year for MS flare-ups.  She gave me 1 round followed by another 6 weeks later and that's when I had a stroke.  I have NO history of high blood pressue and my bp is normal now.  After being in the ICU for 5 days, I was hospitalized for 3+ weeks, used a wheel chair, couldn't talk and loss the use of my right arm/hand.  After lots of therapy, I can now walk using a cane, my speech is 80% normal and my arm/hand is 5% normal.  I would take my MS symptoms any day over this!  Know the risks!	F	34	5  days	4/30/2008
5	ms	Bloating, emotionaly sensitive, everything seems extremely bright, nervous, more energy, metalic taste in mouth.	I feel that it helped my episode. I had blurred vison, leg spasims, memory loss, and painful nerve signals in my legs and hands. I had three days IV therapy of 1000 mg.	F	49	3  days	4/3/2008
5	OPTIC NEURITIS	VERY BITTER TAST DURING AND UP TO 7 HOURS AFTER INFUSION, I FOUND HAVING A HARD CANDY (I.E. JOLLY RANCHERS) DURING THE INFUSION HELPED SOME. DO NOT DRINK MILK AFTER, I LOVE MILK BUT THE MEDS MAKE IT TASTE NASTY!!	WORTH ANY DISCOMFORT. I HAD 1 GRAM DAILY (BY INFUSION) FOR THREE DAYS AND THEN TAPERED ORALLY. I HAD TOTAL LOSS OF VISION IN MY RIGHT EYE. THIS STARTED TO SUBSIDE WITHING IN 5 DAYS. WITHIN ONE WEEK I COULD SEE AGAIN AFTER 2 MONTHS OF VISION LOSS!!!! I WAS LEARY, BUT NOW I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS TREATMENT!!!	F	33	3  days	3/26/2008
2	Angioedema caused by allergy to ?	One time IV dose - no side effects noted, other than tired and a slight metallic taste for a short time. Oral dosing started same day, and noticed within hours increased appetite, muscle pain (mostly in my legs), irritability/anger. Stopped taking on day 2 because my symptoms had resolved and side effects were outweighing the benefits of drug (what little there were). Also on both Benadryl 4x day, Singulair 1x day and Prilosec (all histamine blockers). Swelling has nearly completely resolved after ~24 hours from onset.	I'm sure this drug helps alot of people, and the side effects are worth the benefit they receive from the Solumedrol (such as people with MS). But if I experience this event again, I will probably refuse the steroid. Not effective for me, I believe.	F	37	2  days	3/10/2008
1	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Anaphalactic Shock within one minute from IV solu-medrol		F	44	1  times	1/30/2008
5	MS Attack	FALLING!!!!Double vision,left side weakness particularly in my hand and leg, digestive problems, memory loss	I have had to take this drug twice now for 5 days each time- I saw a real improvement after just the first infusion- I can open and close my hand so much better. But my sugar levels have shot up in the past few nights.	F	31	2  times	1/15/2008
5	lymes diease	gained weight around stomach	I looked like I had a stroke.  Pain in joints, belles palsy, pain behind left eye, felt very bad.  Started IV and with in a day I started feeling better. This was a very good experiance for me.  I haven't felt this good in a long time. I wish I had done this sooner.  Still on IV for 2 more days. Hope I stay feeling this good.	F	44	10  days	12/8/2007
3	Optic Neuritis Lyme Disease	Adding to my symtoms from last post.. now have the worst case of acne on my neck and cheeks I ever saw, its sore and cystic like and huge, also never slept soo much as I did the day after the IV was done. If you have some important event coming up, think again about taking this, your face might look the worst it ever looked after this medication		F	35	3  days	6/19/2007
4	Optic Neuritis Lyme Disease	Bad taste in mouth right away, rapid heartbeat and some excessive sweating, felt like I could re-paint my entire house.  Bloating in my belly, felt like 6 months pregnant but no pain.	got IV 1000MG a day for 3days.  My vision was back about 50% next morning after first day.  Drink LOTS of water with lemon when on this and you won't have too much bloating. I drank a ton of water after first morning and the bloating reduced alot. This works for inflammation of optic nerve (optic neuritis)	F	35	3  days	6/13/2007
4	MS Exacerbation	Metal taste during and shortly after infusion.  Try eating saltine crackers as soon as bad taste starts, seems to reduce the bad taste.Frequent urination,every 20 minutes the first night.  Exhausted. Body aches.	It helped the first day. Slurred speech was normal again.  If you get shakey during IV, have them slow the drip down.	F	50	3  days	5/20/2007
5	Diagnosed with dermatomyositis	Treatment (ongoing) - 5OO mg 3 times a week (for about 5 weeks so far) and 40mg IVIg once per week.Very few side effects so far aside from some occasional muscle cramping and a couple of sleepless nights.	I was extremely weak before treatment, unable to dress properly or do any deep knee bends. I also suffered shortness of breath associated with intersticial lung disease. My strengh has recovered significantly and the doctor can no longer hear the characteristic crackling of the lungs.	M	66	5  weeks	5/4/2007
4	MS Exacerbation	insomnia, increased appetite, psychosis, weight gain, muscle loss, metal taste (while infusion) major salt taste (after stopping infusion), thrush in mouth, solumedrol acne, reddening/burning of skin, dry skin, major bruising	I "drip down" over 18 days;  1000 3 days, 500 3 days, etc  I am much better this way coming down then pill form, really drives me up a tree!  After first few days, I feel like a new person and wonder why I waited so long.  Symptoms this time for me were banding around the mid section(felt like Scarlett in Gone With The Wind getting that petticoat tightened by Mamie), left eye felt like bugging out of head (have had iritis, optic neuritis, felt like Marty Feldman in Young Frankenstein) and the bottom of my feet felt like they were getting beaten with sledge hammers.  I think it is good idea to express self in laymen's terms so everyone else can understand or get better idea of what us MS people go thru.  Best advice is eat healthy, watch carbs, watch salt, lots of water to flush out system, load up potassium.  As far as I am concerned, it is worth the horrible side effects.  And to think that people take this crap on purpose at times, makes you wonder!  Or to know that a drug	F	45	18  days	5/2/2007Email

3	MS Exacerbation	Bad taste (chewing gum helps!)Frequent urinaton, dizziness, bowel problems, but totally worth it if it works!  Just took last dose last night---looking forward to a good result!	Diagnosis took awhile to come up with-found a great neurologist-right on top of things-got started on SM IV 2 days after results were in (big lesion in my neck, causing hands to work at about 50% capacity-ugh!)I hear that the benefits can greatly outweigh the side effects--gotta give it a chance!

5	MS exacerbation	I wanted to post here because I wish I did not read what was on this site as I was doing my IV. It works and frankly if you do right by your body (such as eating properly and good supplements) you will do well.	So here has been my experience: 5 days/lower dose - 500mg/IV.I didn't know immediately I was having an exacerbation so this whole process took about 2 months. When I had double vision in my eyes, I immediately did the IV.The IV is not too painful at all. Go slow. I did an hour drip (when I went faster it hurt a little). Eat bananas. We lose potassium. Take good supplements (multi, C, E, Flaxseed, Grapeseed extract, turmeric). Eat as much whole foods as you can.Get some meds to help with muscle tightening after we detox for a few days off the drugs. Always talk to nurses, they know how patients really feel.Don't wait and don't be afraid. I'm so glad my eyes are coming back. After five days, I dramatically improved.

1	MS: 8 months after a flare started	Hot flashes, severe symptoms like a heart attack, rapid heart beat day and night, vision got worse, could walk even less, tired, halucinations, horrid dreams, very foul mood, even more fatigued without being able to sleep, restless, belly cramps, extreme thirst, gained 5 pounds in 3 days, bladder function was worse again, headaches, minor stomach pains, pins and needles all over.	I am now a week past my 3 day of 1000mg a day treatment and still hoping for positive results. The nastiness has worn off since today, I wonder when I will see some results.

5	MS (speech and severe back pain)	Metallic taste, mild headache, shortness of breath, increased appetite, increased thirst	First time in three years.  As in the past, symptoms began to abate after 24 hours. Have also had it for optic neuritis w/vision loss, and hearing loss. I know it's a hassle and I put it off last month when the first signs came; when I couldn't talk without a LOT of stuttering, and had trouble walking, I knew I waited too long.

4	ms exacerbation	feel more "awake" during day, but no insomnia, a little spacey, strong metallic taste during IV and for an hour after	have taken 3 times, once nothing improved, 1 time improvement started on day 2, 1 time improvement after 1 week.  I have had fewer side effects with the IV than with the prednisone pills which totally throw my digestion systme off and I never had any improvement.	F	43	3  days	1/14/2006
