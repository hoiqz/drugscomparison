3	I had 2 stents in my heart	I too have had a dry cough for 2 months.  I'm not sure if its related to the Drug.  It seems to have reduced my chest discomfort.  I used to take Plavix after my first stent was placed in my heart a year ago.  When my 2nd stent was placed in my heart two months ago they switched me to Brilinta.	Most of the other Doctors I see never heard of this Drug.  I understand it is a new drug but nevertheless it makes me slightly nervous taking.  But my cardiologist wants me to stay on this drug.

2	Had a stent inserted in the heart	Shortness of breath, dry cough, blood pressure has risen	I see my Cardiologist next week concerning these side effects.  The cough I can handle but the shortness of breath I can't (especially since I already have COPD).  Really can't blame the rise in blood pressure on this med as I'm not sure.
