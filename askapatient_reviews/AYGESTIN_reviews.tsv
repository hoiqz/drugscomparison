				F M	 	 	    
2	Endometriosis	I took this in conjunction with Femara.  I experienced abdominal pain, water gain (about 12 lbs, all in the abdomen), and dizziness.	I didn't like it.  It didn't help with endo pain, and the drug itself was a pain.	F	24	14  days 1X D	12/14/2012
3	endo	heavy bleeding. crying, headaches, tried, feeling afraid. This medicine made my ovaries hurt. I do have a 2 inch centimeter cyst on my left ovary. I'm praying that I don't have to have a DNC in the next couple weeks because I'm still on. a lot of frequent cramps bleeding constantly.			38	2  weeks5mg	9/12/2012
3	Endometriosis, Fibroids, cysts	Depression, breakthrough bleeding, Melasma, weight gain, Sleeplessness, night sweats, Deciduous Cast, hot flashes	A lot of bleeding and cramping the first few months. Slowly upped the dosage to 15 mg a day, whenever we upped the dose, I would bleed and once had a decidous cast (so painful!). Now that I have been on it a few months and the dosage is stable.. I have reaches amenorea and am not bleeding at all.  Weight gain, sleeping issues and depression are the worst side effects for me. But this drug has stopped the pain associated with endometriosis and has shrunk my ovarian cysts. I will stick with this drug despite the side effects for now, because the other options (lupron, surgery) have worst effects.	F	38	4  months5 mg 3X D	8/20/2012
2	Fibroids/Endometriosis	Night Sweats, Mood Swings, Irrability	The pill stopped my bleeding right away. I took Aygestin in comb/w Lupron 3 month injection. I had "break through" bleeding after one month on the medication, it was light to where I could where a panty liner. That started June 5, 2012, I had a laproscopic myomectomy on July 9th my bleeding never stopped for the 5 weeks leading up to surgery. The lupron has run it's 3 month course and I stopped Aygestin on Aug 5, 2012 and I am STILL BLEEDING. I esentially have been bleeding/spotting for 2 months. My doctor says it's normal, but there is nothing normal about bleeding for 2 months. I read it can take up to 2 months after you stop taking aygestin for it to leave your system. So does that mean I will bleed for another 2 months a total of 4 months non-stop and then I have my period to look forward too. I will NEVER take this agan!!!	F	32	3  months5 MG 1X D	8/17/2012
2	45 day period from fibroids/polyps	weight gainirritableacne	I hade a 45 day period with extremely large clots, heavy flow and painfl cramping. Aftrer 2 ER trips and 4 trips to pcp, and three different estrogen hormones, I finally had an ltrasound revealing large polyps/fibroids. Taking 10 mg/day for a week didnt not stop bleeding or change cramping/clots. I am now taking 10mg in AM and PM.I had break through bleeding every day. Recently, incredible pain/volume/clots returned despite 20mg/day. I have to have a hysteroscopy and then a d&c. I want them to jst take it out. I have no insurance. $112 out of pocket for one med is rediculous.	F	37	5  weeks10 MG 2X D	8/13/2012Email
2	To regulate period	The first couple days I noticed that I was very bloated and so bloated that it hurt my feet walking.  I gained 6 lbs within the first 4-5 days.  I also started breaking out and I look like a high school student with bad acne right now :( I couldn't sleep well and started having some crazy dreams.  NO sex drive whatsoever and random cramping as if I were going to start my period.	As soon as I noticed the weight gain, I started drinking water like crazy, eating healthier choices and continued my normal exercise routine.  The weight was controllable. My other side effects remained the same but the acne worsened.	F	25	3  weeks5 2X D	8/1/2012Email
4	Heavy Bleeding and clots	Bloating, extreme increase in sex drive, shakes initially	Very thankful that this medicine stopped my bleeding. I was soaking 3-4 pads per hour.

F	22	5  days5 MG 2X D	4/30/2012Email
1	Endometriosis	Irritability, leg pains, anxiety, nausea, headache	I expressed significant concerns about aygestin affecting my mood to my doctor who assured me that it would not be an issue. I took it for approx 2 weeks, 5mg a day. I experienced noticeable irritability. I had leg pains (sort of like growing pains) and didnt realize why til after reading some of the other reviews. I also had anxiety. I stopped taking it two days ago...started my period today (even though I just had a period 2 weeks ago) and I have had EXCRUTIATING headaches both days. I am also experiencing nausea and still having anxiety. I hated this medicine...now my body is all out of whack.	F	24	14  days5MG 1X D	4/26/2012

3	Prolonged period (over 1 month)	constant state of PMS: light cramping, decreased libido, lower energy, cravings, irritation, light acne, etc.	I only have to take it for 3 weeks to kick my cycle back into gear. It has stopped the bleeding but added on these other side effects. Can't wait until I'm done with it.	F	35	3  weeks5 mg 1X D	6/13/2011
4	Heavy prolonged bleeding from fibro	It has controlled the bleeding very well. Also the pain is almost completely gone. I have noticed small dark spots on skin. Recently diagonosed with high blood pressure but that was after taking for 6 years. Weight gain of about 20 lbs. Hoping to soon go off aygestin because I am going thru menopause and should be able to quit taking this medicine soon. It has saved me from a hysterectomy.		F	48	6  years2.5 mg 1X D	5/31/2011
5		extreme weight gain, super tired at random times, brain farts, hot flashes, mood swings in the beginning, leg cramps at times	i had uncontrolled bleeding to the point of needing a blood transfusion (a new Dr,) and a D&C, Two weeks later it started up all over again, Fourth trip to the ER later, I was finally given this and was told to take 4 the first day, until the bleeding subsided and stopped. It took a few days but it finally stopped and was an answer to my prayers. I went from "bleeding a river" (said by an ER Dr.) to not having to stress over it anymore. I wish there weren't side effects, but I certainly would take them over the alternative ANY day,	F	48	2  years5MG 2X D	5/18/2011
5	adenomyosis	After 4 months my blood pressure went from 100/70 to 180/110 with severe tachycardia when combining this with Advil.	This med spared me from bleeding to death. I posted here to warn other users about the hypertension risk when using this at high doses, especially when combining it with Advil, Tylenol or other NSAIDs. The side effects went away a few months after discontinuing both aygestin and advil.	F	53	5  months5 mg 3X D	12/4/2010Email
3	longterm bleeding	Nausea, loss of appetite, weight gain, mood swings, depression, anxiety, leg pain, back pain, cramping, headache, weakness, and shakes.	I started taking Aygestin after having my second child and after two months I was still bleeding. Soaking up to a pad a hour. My Ob wrote a Rx for this medication. Instructed to take it every six hours til bleeding stopped, than twice a day. I stopped bleeding after a day. Almost a week later I started bleeding again very heavily. At first it was like a miracle drug, than the headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. The shakes hit almost instantly. Now with a three year old and a two month old I could not function like this. However with also going too school I can not keep getting up every half hour to forty five mins to check my tampon.	F	24	1  weeks5 MG 1X H	11/26/2010Email
3	fibroid/heavy period	at first it seemed a miracle, within 5hrs of starting pills, the bleeding stopped after 5 unbearable days! I seemed to have no real side effects besides some weight gain but then the leg pain started in the left leg and it was constant and at times increased so bad I cried. After 1 week of this my doctor told me to stop the med as it seems that it was causing damage to my common peroneal nerve. The next day the leg pain was gone but unfortunately the bleeding started again. cannot wait until surgery!		F	40	3  weeks5mg 2X D	11/8/2010
5	uterius ceis	I was so very nervous about taking this medication but, it have work great for me. I think you got to workout at the gym or do some type of walking etc. I notice the water wght gain, but, other than that it has work wonderful for me. The key is working out with this medicine will help.	Drink alot of water and workout is the key. I did notice a weight gain but, thats it and it was only 5lbs no more.	F	40	9  days5mg 1X D	11/1/2010Email
4	Endometriosis,Adenomyosis, Fibroids	weight gain, irritability, depression, insomnia	I have been on Aygestin for 3 months now.  The first month I was very pleased with it, as it took away a lot of my pain.  The next period I got lasted for 2 weeks and was very painful.  I almost stopped taking the medication, but decided to go for 1 more month.  I haven't had a period now for 2 months, and am pain-free.  My biggest complaint is the weight gain.  I am very pleased with the medication now	F	44	4  months5 mg 1X D	10/6/2010

2	Hyperplasia	Shortness of breath, depression, fatigue, blurry vision	I was was told to take this drug 3x per day for 7 days, then 2x per day for 7 days, then 1x per day for 7 days.  I'm now on my 14th day.  The bleeding has stopped but I'm experiencing depression and fatigue to the point that I can't really handle my daily activities.  I don't feel like myself and can't see staying on this drug, I need an alternative.  Have been told an IUD may be a possibility to help with the hyperplasia.	F	49	28  days5 MG 3X D	7/26/2010

1	PMDD &	Nausea, Depression, Terrible Cramping on one side, loss of appetite	I was prescribed Aygestin to help with mood swings associated w/PMDD and with irregular periods and directed to take it beginning mid-cycle. Since I'm so sensitive to medications, I was also instructed to only take a 1/2 of a pill. Each day I'd wake up with nausea & by the 4th day depression kicked into high gear.  I found it difficult to even get out of bed.  Last night I didn't take it at all and today I feel a lot better though not 100% yet.	F	34	7  dayshalf of 5m 1X O	7/15/2010
5	heavy bleeding, horendous cramping	No side effects!	This was a miracle and I avoided having a hysterectomy.  Periods stopped completely - no side effects at all and only had to take 5 mg. per day.  I went from periods so bad I could not function to feeling great and no periods at all.  I have just stopped taking this a few days ago as I am now 55 and hoping all this is fially over - but it really made my life so much better!	F	55	5  years5 mg 1X D	6/16/2010Email
4	Endometriosis/Heavy bleeding/cramps	Acne, spotting, moody, weight gain, dark spots on face, extra facial hair	I have been on this drug for a very long time. I had 6 endo surgery's a D&C and had horrible periods for years. This has cured all of that but I am a smoker and I read that I should NEVER be taking this while I smoke and am over 35years old (because of blood clots and stroke). I will be going to my Dr next week and will go over this fact with him. It has never been mentioned to me that this was such a risk. I want to come off this medication but my only hope is a hysterectomy and then I will just be on another artifical hormone anyway.	F	43	7  years15 1X D	6/15/2010
1	Menorrhagia	HOrrible mood swings, depression, swelling of feet and hands, drop in blood sugars. Irritable, very sad.	I like the fact that I have some relief from teh bleeding it does help, but the sadness that I have experience is overwhelming. I have been very depressed and iritable. I can hardly bend my hands and toes. The swelling is painfull and isn't going away even though I quit med 2 days ago. I will not ever take this med again.	F	27	5  weeks5mg 1X D	6/7/2010
3	Endometriosis	My pain during my cycle were like "birth pains". I bleed for 7 days HEAVY. I have been on this pill now for 3 weeks. The pain is gone. The HEAVY cycle is gone. Yet I have been bleeding for two weeks, I am always crying, I have acne now, and I do not know when I will stop bleeding. I have a husband and two children.  I try not to show them I worry but I am scared!		F	36	3  weeks5 1X D	5/31/2010
3	Prolonged and heavy bleeding	It helped to stopped the bleeding.  Although, by simply taking 3 Advils in the morning and 3 Advils at night (I didn't know tha Advil helped a lot with bleeding from the uterus) would have helped, before taking Aygesting.  Again, it did help the bleeding, but I will probably stop today or tomorrow after 6 days of taking this horrible drug.  My doctor prescribed for 12 days, but I cannot do this to myself.  It is toxic to me.  This is NOT a natural hormone is synthetic and has many side effects.  For me, it has given me insomnia, hart palpitations, shortness of breath, tingling in the face as if I had touched something caustic + bad dreams, mood swings, especially irritability!  This is must not be good for my health.  I cannot take 12 days of this!  Better try a higher dosis of natural progesterone.  		F	54	6  days5 mg 1X D	5/21/2010
3	Endo	I had weight gain, serious increase in appitite, terrible mood swings and irritibility, insomnia,headaches, and acne. It worked well for my pain but I began bleeding yesterday and have decided that the bad more then out weighs the good for me. I will be stopping medication as of today.	Good Luck!

5	heavy bleeding for prolonged time	swelling of legs and feet which was taken care of by a simple water pill.	it stopped the bleeding within a few hours the day i started taking it and have been on it for almost a year and a half, but am afraid when stopping, the bleeding will start up again and we are ready for kids now...	F	29	16  months5 mg 1X D	2/18/2010

5	endo	i have had no bad side effects.  actually, my breast size increased.	Has helped me a great deal.  I don't have a period or it is very very light.  Has helped with the cramps.	F	31	6  months	11/30/2009
2	ENDO	lower abdomonial pain	I was put on this med to reduce the pain and stopped the heavy/frequent periods. Since being on the med it seems that the pain is worst and i have become meaner than normal. Have stopped talking to a v ery close friend bc of this med.	F	33	12  days	11/15/2009
1	endometriosis, bad cramps during cy	I cont. to have bad cramps so I stopped using Aygestin, upon stopping I bled heavily. I soaked thru 2-3 pads and hour and had to sleep in Depends. This happened for 2 days ( 2weeks after my first post Aygestin cycle), then stopped abruptly. While I bled I passed clots so large I thought I was having a miscarriage!!! Then bleeding returned 2wks later....while lovemaking. Heavy Heavy bleeding. my gyn advised me to start taking the Aygestin again to control the bleeding until I had an ultrasound to rule out fibroids. They were ruled out and I promptly stopped the Aygestin which was originally prescribed for endo pain NOT heavy periods. I have been off Aygestion for 3 days and have started a cycle. I am very scared. I don't know what this drug has done to my body and how long it takes to leave my system. I used to have very regular periods and now I just don't know when I'll bleed. I am scared, sad, angry, and dissatisfied. Has this happened to anyone else??		F	40	120  days	11/10/2009Email
5	endometriosis/heavy bleeding	None...except when taking the meds at night I had alot of energy (2 hours worth)-so I cleaned. I slept well. and the key is to DRINK ALOT OF WATER ALL DAY and eat right. When I took the meds I drank alot of water with them and was advised to take the meds 12 hours apart..My dosage was strong. Plus I became anemic from the bleeding prior so I have been taking slow fe twice a day with no side effects.	This drug has stopped my vaginal bleeding instantly,(day 2 of meds). I was on provera prior and it didn't do the trick. I am currently on day 6 with no bleeding and my life is getting back to normal. yeah!	F	43	7  days	11/4/2009
4	endometriosis	none	I felt so much better the 2nd day I took aygestin.  I was in so much pain, so tired and was becoming more and more depressed each day that my symptoms persisted. I'm 28, a hysterectomy was not an option - this is working!	F	28	7  days	11/3/2009
3	Endometriosis	Extreme anxiety and restlessness when I laid down to sleep. Kept getting the urge to want to tense and stretch all my muscles. Very strange, have never experienced that feeling before. Starting to drive me crazy.	Got put on Aygestin after my 3rd endo laparoscopy hopefully trying to prolong the next surgery & pain.

History of blood clots, phlebitis, CHF, strokes, asthma....My life has become a living hell. I am very disabled from taking this med. I'm quitting today!	F	53	2  months	8/30/2009
2	Endometriosis	weight gain 8 lbs,  bloating, insomnia, bad dreams ,cholesterol increased 40 pts, high blood pressure, costochondritis (rib/breastbone pain),	Have been able to take a birth control pill for a few years to control endo. Started Aygestin when the symptoms got out of control again. But this med is now not able to hold back the pain either. It's like toothpicks holding back the Atlantic ocean. Not happy with side effects - especially wt gain and cholesterol increase! I am at the gym 3-5 days with no effect. Having a scope in two days and want a hysterectomy soon!! Can't wait to get off this med! Can't stop now b/c the endo pain would be too bad.	F	41	9  months	7/26/2009
4	no period/ no ovulation	EXTREME mood swings!!!! VERY irritable! EXTREME bloating! it looked like i was 5 months pregnant!	i have been trying to get pregnant for over 10 months now. all of a sudden i stopped having my period. so my doctor said to take the aygestin to make me have a period, then followed by fertility drugs. i have never been more miserable, bloated, irritable, and sensitive in my life. i actually used very fowl language to my coworkers and boss while on this medicine. i'm lucky i wasn't fired. the swelling and bloating is to the extreme. i don't fit into my clothes anymore because of my extended stomach. on the plus side.... i did finally start my period today... yay!! so that's in the right step to having a baby. i am very excited that by the doctor's instructions, i should be pregnant by this time next month!	F	23	10  days	6/25/2009Email
5	adenomyosis; breakthrough bleeding	small cramps every now and then, nothing like what I experienced before. some trembling of my hands at the beginning but now that has subsided.	I started taking Aygestin 5mg bid March 2, 2009 and have been very pleased with the results. I have completely stopped bleeding and my severe, painful cramps have stopped. I am nearing the 6-month mark and my doc recommended titrating to 15mg/day to see if that stops the small cramping.  I am just concerned about the long-term effects of this drug, especially anxious about the risk of blood clots. And, I am especially interested in knowing more about the "intolerable breakthrough bleeding" that is presumed to begin at some point after taking this drug for a while. Why does this happen and what do you do then?! Does it happen to everyone that takes this medicine?	F	28	3  months	5/28/2009Email
2	uterine fibroids	weight gain, moodiness, bleeding for close to a month and counting, fatigue, palpitations.	I will ask my doctor for an alternative solution to my medical problem, or change doctors. Before taking this medication, I experienced severe cramping, heavy bleeding, and blood clots for the first day of my cycle. Now, the only difference is, I have no pain with my cycle, but my cycle doesn't seem to want to end!	F	51	1  months	5/6/2009
3	PROLONGER PERIODS	Bloating, weight gain, calf cramping, menstral cramping, increased blood pressure, palpitations, acne, headache, muscle pain	It stopped the bleeding with some break through, but I just do not feel well taking it.  I want to stop it.  Any side effects I told my gyn (nurse practioner) she ignored them and said that they were not side effects.  I have since changed gyn's.	F	50	90  days	4/21/2009
5	Endometriosis & adhesions	None thus far... I feel alot more mellow and laid back, but this is only the 2nd day of taking the medication.  So far,within the first day of dosing, my heavy excrutiating period went away!!	I'm very greatful for the medication as I'm not ready for a hysterectomy,   time will tell, and the comments scare me to death, but I know that people are more likely to post the bad experiences than the good, I just pray it works as it's supposed to without all the awful side affects that some of you have experienced on this board.  I pray that your pain and side affects subside, and you are granted peace & comfort!	F	39	2  days	3/19/2009Email
2	Heavy period and bad cramps	none.	I have been on this for 2 months now. The frist month was great. I spotted a few days for my period in Jan. and now in Feb. I have been on my period for 11 days. Cramping like I use to and blood clots like before. I was given this after a DNC and Hysterscopy. I go back to the Dr. in April. Probably will be going before then if I dont stop my period.

3	Endometreosis extreme pain w/ cycle	Migrains, acne, irritability, insomnia, bleeding recently	I think that it has helped with the pain, although I am not supposed to have a period. I am bleeding now and it is just all different. I am a little weary though I dont need to gain weight and get the worst migraines... anyone that has ideas or experience with endometreosis and PCOS and extremem pain with cyecle feel free to give some advice... etc.	F	24	1  months	1/21/2009Email
4	Ovarian cyst	None so far	I was prescribed Aygestin to get rid of a cyst on my right ovary before being started on Clomid.  I've never had problems with heavy periods or endometriosis and my periods are always the same time each month.  I take ONE 5mg pill a day (prescribed for 24 days) and I take it with food at dinner time.  I haven't had any of the side effects others have mentioned.  We will see if it gets rid of the cyst in a another week or so.	F	35	10  days	12/3/2008

3	To relieve hot flashes	Exhaustion, weight gain, some depression and slight rise in blood pressure. Feeling bloated and some difficulty breathing.	This drug was prescribed to relieve hot flashes brought on by the Viadur implant placed in my arm after radioactive seed therapy(Brachytherapy)for prostate cancer. This drug did relieve the hot flashes but the side effects worse than the cure. I will contact my doctor to possibly change the dosage.	M	80	36  days	11/6/2008Email
2	Endometriosis/heavy bleeding	fatigue, have to stop and catch my breath, pain, cramping, mood swings, breakthrough bleeding, fluid retention, insomnia, stomach tenderness	I was under the impression that the abd. pain and menstrual bleeding would be relieved but I am on my 3rd week of bleeding. I am extremely moody and get terrible pains in my side. It made my symptoms worse and added side affects!  I do not suggest this med unless necessary. I have a follow-up scheduled and will be discussing alternative therapies.	F	30	1  months	10/15/2008
2	Endometriosis	Weight gain, breakthrough bleeding w/excessive pain, cramping irritability, mood swings, muscle pain.	This medicine has caused nothing but problems for me. The irritability and weight gain (upwards of 20 lbs in 3 months) are terrible. The breakthrough bleeding was more of a nuisance until it started happening with horrible cramps.

				F M	 	 	    
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011
3	major depression	Very drowsy all day, anxiety		F	21	3  weeks20mg	11/29/2011Email
5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..	F	25	1  months 1X D	11/14/2011Email
3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

1	deppression	shaking twitching over emotional		F	23	60  days30 1X D	11/3/2011
5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email
1	depression/anxiety	severe muscle weakness, tremors that have yet to stop 2 months in, not sleeping, pacing		M	44	5  days5mg 1X D	9/19/2011
1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email
1	depression	i would studder sweat like crazy eye twitching hyperactive cry for no reason heart pounding out my chest really high blood pressure pass out from panic attacks insomia talk really fast umm flame up inside theres more thid pill sucks i thought i was going to die		M	31	 30mg 1X D	8/25/2011Email
5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!	M	37	21  days10 1X D	2/24/2011Email
5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.
