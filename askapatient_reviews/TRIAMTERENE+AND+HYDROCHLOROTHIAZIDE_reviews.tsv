4	severe water retention	I have Lupus, therefore I'm careful to stay out of the sun. When I have to be in the sun (mowing the lawn, etc.) I always use a powerful sunscreen, but I found that no matter what...I end up with blistered ears, & often times a severe sun rash that scabs over on my shoulders, chest, and upper back. I also find that when I work out and my body heats up...I end up with a rash that appears like hives on my chest and upper back. Over the past year, I started breaking my pills in half, & I no longer experience these side effects...& still gain the positive results (no water weight gain)  The first year I began taking this medication I experienced lower back contractions after taking the medication, but they subsided.	Again, because I have Lupus...I'm highly critical of any medication I take.  It's really hard to determine what medication may be causing your side effects when you're taking many.  I'm convinced that this one is mainly sun sensitivy & you need to be slightly aware of potassium deficiency. Just pay attention to leg cramps in the middle of the night...if you get them, just take a potassium supplement. I've had some hair thinning, but so many things contribute such as age, Lupus, meds, hormones...just love yourself regardless!	F	46	16  days37.5 5-25 1X D	11/12/2011Email
2	High Blood Pressure	Hair loss has accelerated.  Lost maybe 25% of hair. Side effects subtle.  I was on five drugs so it is tough to assign problems until I stopped it.  After about a week of weaning off of HCT, feet, ankles, calves and legs became swollen.  About 30% to 40% more.  Feet are very swollen and hurt.  It has lasted about five days so far. Exercise and diet doesn't seem to matter.  Swelling is worrisome because it can be symptom of something worse--like heart trouble.   Oh, and of these drugs, Metoprolol, HCT and Hydralazine, you might as well forget about sex, especially for men.  Sexual dysfunction is very common and extensive.  Another little treat several of them have is urinary tract pain.  I thought it was my prostate going bad but it is the drugs.  Some advice.  If you have strange symptoms while on various drugs, look up each drug and their side effects, even the exceedingly rare ones and you will probably find your symptoms listed.  Don't be afraid to ask your doctor for another drug.		M	60	4  months25 1X D	9/9/2011

1	Hypertension	Made me really nervous and talkative, and my tongue felt dry at night.  Hard to make decisions while shopping.	My new doc didn't realize I had had kidney stones previously and took me off of it.  If not for that, I would have stopped anyway because I didn't like the way it made me feel.

2	HBP	Lightheaded, lethargic, and a little confused.	I was hoping to find a medication that would lower my BP without side effects. The side effects of this medication is not pleasant.	M	60	5  days 1X D	6/2/2010
