1	Broken arm	Vivid, terrifying hallucinations	I was given Demerol about 30 years ago when the docs in emergency suspected I had broken my elbow. I was 6 at the time so do not recall what other side effects I experienced. I was put under but I am unsure whether that was due to the Demerol or another drug. When I awoke in the night I had hallucinations that there were aliens in my hospital room who were trying to kill me. I also saw bees and thought my skin had turned yellow and died. A horrifying experience for a six year old who was alone because the nurses told my mother I wouldn't wake up until the morning.	F	36	1  times 1X AN	3/19/2013
1	upper endoscopy	As soon as this hit my veins my body ached and I felt pain travel up both sides of my head.  After the procedure my feet and lower legs feel week and I have been in a constant state of feeling flu-like with a constant achy body, especially in my shoulders.  Since the procedure my hands and feet feel shakey.  The procedure was at the end of December and it is now nearly the end of February and I still don't feel well.  Demerol is the only drug that I was told was used.	I am pretty sure I had Demerol once before during a difficult childbirth.  I remember it making me feel really good for a short period of time.  I think that is more typical.  This time I felt nothing but pain and achy body, no euphoria, nothing good, was totally awake through the procedure, felt everything.  Makes me wonder if they gave me the wrong drug or if something is wrong with me that I reacted this way.  I can't find where anyone else reports having a very similar reaction.  The pain crawling up my head was pretty strange.  It just traveled up and then stopped.  Ever since, I have been left feeling just awful.	F	38	  1X D	2/21/2013Email
3	Back Pain	Until recently I had no side effects, it was like taking water. You never knew you had taken anything other than a little relief for a little while. Now I take it and it makes me so drowsy and sleepy. Can't figure out what has changed.	It is the only pain med. I can take. I allergic to everything else and even have to take benedryl with it or else i will start itching.	F	50	 50mg 1X D	11/30/2012
1	Colonoscopy	I had a cough immediately as it went into my system.When got home rested all day.never felt that bad (previous)Developed bronchial spasms.  Bad coughs..extreme itching internal and rash on outer body. Benadryl..was prepared to go to theER..Dr. Called advised to to a medical default???I hate this drug glad I didn't croak!Ask and question before yourprocedure		F	70	  1X D	9/29/2012
1	Intestine infection inflammation	The nurse gave it to me through IV. I am a petite person so she only gave me half of the usual dose for an adult. About two minutes after she gave it to me it felt like a ton of bricks had landed on my body. My arms, legs, and chest were so heavy I could barely move. I felt like I couldn't breath and my heart rate shot up. My breathing got shallow because my chest felt so heavy (not tight) it was hard to take breaths. Thank goodness she was still right there in my room because I couldn't talk. She gave me oxygen right away and had some other drug on stand by to inject in my IV in case I fully stopped breathing. After a few min. my blood pressure started to come down and I was able to communicate. I thought I was going to die. They said it was some sort of histamine reaction. It was so scary. I passed out asleep after that. I will never take this stuff again.		F	29	1  daysIV 25MG 1X D	7/24/2012Email
5	Acute pain due to ulcerative colitis	No side effects, slept like a baby.	Felt fantastic. Best drug ever. I felt like a floating head with no pain and a great calm feeling. WONDERFUL.	F	43	4  days 1X D	7/8/2012
1	Colonoscopy	Sleepiness, Nausea, vomiting, weakness, the shakes	I am still feeling the affects of the drug a day after my procedure including nausea and vomiting.  I would not want to take this drug again!	M	65	1  days50 MG 1X D	5/31/2012
1	Colonoscopy	Dizziness, confusion, depression,bouts of crying, nausea, loss of appetite,general feeling of "doom"	Worked very well for its intended purpose of putting me out during the procedure. Do not remember any part of it. I am very sensitive to any medication and felt the effect about 30 seconds after the IV infusion.I slept most of the day of my procedure woke up feeling okay, just a little "off" but as the day went on I felt anxious and out of control. Very confused and irrational thinking. I remembered that I had a similar reaction 21 years ago when I was given Demerol after the birth of my son. I am not sure if this is an allergic reaction or not but I will never take it again, not worth the after effect for me.	F	40	1  days75 1X D	3/29/2012Email
5	Post hemmorhoid surgery	None. It gave me great pain relief from the worst pain of my life.		M	59	3  days 1X AN	3/18/2012
2	colonoscopy	What side effects? I was injected  with 50 mg of IV Demerol for a colonoscopy and did not even feel the drug. If you have ever taken Demerol you know that this is impossible!  I believe that either the Demerol was switched with water or the doctor faked the IV injection because of the many misses of my vein.  (The nurse tried 3 times and the Doctor tried 3 times times (6 times at first) to to give me an IV and they could not hit a vein). I was in pain from all the misses. The doctor then tried vigorously for at least 10 minutes to talk me into doing the procedure without anestesia and I was adamant that I wanted to be sedated or I did not want to go through with the procedure. About 1/2 hour went by while the Doctor kept trying to hit a vein. (7 to 8 times & all misses) The doctor tried again to talk me into doing the procedure without anestesia and I refused again and told him to keep trying to hit a vein or give me an IM shot and wait 15 minutes for the medication to kick in. The	I have had IV Demerol several times in the past and know what Demerol feels like and tastes like. When I was injected I felt and tasted nothing and immediately informed the doctor. He said don't worry you will feel it soon. The next thing I knew he was performing the procedure and I was in extreme pain. I asked for more pain medication and the doctor said "I'll be done soon". Several minutes more of severe pain went by and I complained again and he said "I'm almost done". A few tortuous minutes later I complained again and the Doctor removed the camera from my butt within a minute or 2. I was relieved but I am not stupid. I am 100% sure the injection they gave me was nothing. I believe the Doctor faked "hitting a vein" because of all the misses and elapsed time and knowingly gave me the procedure without the medication I insisted on. To confirm my suspicions I had a drug test done the next day and guess what? No Demerol in my system. This proved me right. The doctor gave me a colonoscopy without the anestesia I insisted on against my wishes. I was very unhappy and felt humiliated because I was made a fool of and  it was very unethical because it was strictly for the money and against my wishes. I was very unhappy . The only pleasant thing about a colonoscopy is the pain medication. I thought about suing for malpractice but I am not that kind of person but I can tell you this: that is the last time I will see that doctor.

5		None	I was given Demerol as a pre-op medication before a lumpectomy. I really liked it -felt like I was floating on a cloud. After surgery I felt very invigorated and euphoric and still feel like that after two days. Also sleeping like a log. I really like this drug----	F	75	1  daysunknown 1X D	2/10/2011
1	Oral Surgery	A disoriented, dissociative high with no ability to communicate effectively, or at least no memory of being able to communicate effectively. It did not mediate the pain and I had a full blown panic attack during the procedure. I could hear my heart monitor racing and the assistant had to strap my hands to the chair because I was trying to get them to stop cutting. I believe I blacked out of my own accord partway through the procedure, but I vividly recall the pain.	I was given an IV drip in preparation for having two wisdom teeth removed. I had specifically requested that an oral surgeon perform the procedure in a hospital, and that hospital then approved anesthesia use with my healthcare provider. Then when I was in what I thought was the examination chair, they told me I would be going under "sedation" right there and that they used Demerol and did not put people under anesthesia. Because I was in pain and had waited days for the procedure without any pain meds I signed a waver to allow them to administer the demerol and do the procedure. Demerol did not take away the pain, instead I had a panic attack and remember the events of the procedure, though I was so high I couldn't focus on anything in particular or communicate. It seems that there are a number of patient stories of being able to feel pain while on this medication that medical professionals don't acknowledge. I think flailing in a dental chair and needing my hands strapped down should have been a sign that something was wrong.	F	24	1  days 1X D	11/6/2010
4	Chemo pain, Arthritic pain	Demerol works without the lasting hangover feeling; however I'm beginning to feel as if there are holes in my memory. Even though I write things down, I still lose track of appointments, I struggle with simple paperwork (paying bills, balancing checkbook, etc) and chronic fatigue & zero sex drive have become a way of life. I also struggle with words & phrases. I'm extremely articulate, but I am constantly struggling for the correct word or phrase. Even typing this entry is a struggle; I have to put so much energy into focusing and concentrating to get my feelings across.		F	54	3  years50 4X D	4/27/2010Email
5	Colonosocpy	Didn't remember the procedure.  No nausea for me.  It was like a dream.  I was walking and talking, shortly after the procedure, but was actually out of it; though people around me weren't really aware of this.	The procedure was smooth; I didn't remember 99% of it.  There were no adverse physical effects aside from I was like out of it on the inside; almost like blacked out, but not (speaking of after the procedure) but my family didn't realize this.  I had the BEST sleep that night.  I felt almost euphoric the next day; don't know if it was left over from the Demerol or from not eating for almost two days.  I love that stuff!!I'm planning on fasting for a couple of days to see if I get the same euphoric feeling that I had the day following the procedure to try to determine if it was the fast or the drug.  I'm thinking the effects of the drug (taken about about 4:30 p.m.) shouldn't have lasted into the next day.  But I don't know.	F	52	1  days 1X D	4/26/2010Email
1	Labor pains	Very dizzy. Made me feel like I couldn't breath. It would make me kind of forget the pain for a second, then it would come back.	I was being given pitocin while they gave me demerol.	F	19	1  times 1X O	4/21/2010
2	Surgery - Spine	Itching - deep, burning itching. Almost drove me insane! High doseage of Benadryl did not relieve the itching. I'd rather have the pain - that's how bad the itching was.		M	47	2  days	12/5/2009
1	Knee Surgery	Dyspnea-(stopped breathing)	I must be allergic to this medicine, but I was sent to ICU because of this drug.	F	23	1  times	11/17/2009
5	Spinal Injuries	I have to take it with milk and a snack to avoid vomitting.	Post rear-end MVA multiple cervical and lumbar disc herniations, vertabrae dislocations & intrusions, loss of spinal fluid. Was taking percocet to manage the pain but developed a reaction of severe burning and itching which grew progessively worse to the point where it was almost worse than the pain itself. Tried many of the other analgesics but almost all were ineffective. Dialaudid worked well for pain relief but it made me very sick - like severe flu symptoms. Doctor hit upon Demerol. It works very well in relieving the pain. I supplement it with presciption dosage (800mg) Ibuprofin. The only side effect I experience is "dry-heaving" or vomitting. If I take the demerol with a glass of milk and some butter or cheese with white bread I avoid that unpleasantness.	M	51	4  months	10/12/2009
3	migraine	Stomach upset, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, rebound headache	Injection provides much better pain relief than oral. Always feel horrible the next day.	F	36	2  years	9/10/2009
4	migraine	drowsy	this med made me relaxed, pain free, and nausea free every time.. I don't know if something for nausea was added but that was the best thing with demerol. The ER has replaced it with dilaudid which is the opposite: scarily high, nausea and dizziness, rebound migraine - all of which never happened with demerol. Its a crime that they replaced it.	F	51	5  times	8/7/2009
1	migraine	Brief period of pain relief. BUT. Then SEVERE nausea that continued for many hours, along with agitation, and a swift return of the migraine pain. I don't vomit, but anyone else would have. Absolutely dreadful.		F	25	1  days	4/27/2009
4	Colonoscopy	They said they used very little.  I was able to enjoy the video of my colon, ask questions and remember the answers.  I felt some pushing discomfort - I think due to blowing air in, enough to make me grunt, but not what I would call pain.  I was happy when it was all over - whether that was the drug or just relief at good news would be hard to tell.	the procedure took about 1/2 hour	F	60	1  days	4/13/2009
4	hemi toe implant	eased the pain, severe dry mouth, wide awake wih little to NO SLEEP ( I think all pain meds keep me up)		F	40	2  weeks	3/16/2009
5	bowel resection	I am allergic to morphine and dilaudid so was tried on demerol and found very good pain relief but did not last long so required repeat dosages to maintain relief.	Stomach upset did occur with the demerol but used phenergan along with and took care of the problem.  I would recommend this combination for very effective pain relief.	M	38	6  days	1/2/2009
5	Colonoscopy	A little "drunk" in the recovery room and on the ride home (as a passenger). By the time I got home I was lightheaded and nauseous, but that could also be a result of not eating the previous day and not sleeping much the night before, due to the procedure prep.	Had the best 3 hour nap of my life after getting home, and felt absolutely fine after waking up. Don't remember anything at all about the procedure, which is probably good.	M	41	1  days	11/25/2008
5	c-section	excellent drug	by far the best drug i have ever taken. took my pain away during surgery and after surgery. wow this drug is a wonder drug!!	F	31	7  days	11/21/2008
5	Colonoscopy	I felt like I had a few cocktails and a little drunk.  But there was no hangover!  For me it was a marvelous feeling while the procedure was taking place.	Afterwards, I realized my headache was gone and I felt quite great the rest of the day.  It was like a got a good 10 hours of sleep!  If I was an addict...this would be my drug of choice!!!!

5	ruptured ovarian cysts and post op	a happy lightheaded feeling	i have a high tolerence to pain medication so this is one of the only things i can take. it works wonderfully for me.	F	25	4  months	11/3/2008
5	Kidney Stone	Had a shot of Demerol (in my butt cheek) roughly 3 hours into a stone while the pain was intense... within minutes I felt better after the fist shot wore off (5 hours later) i was in agony until my next shot which i could then time at 4.5 hours till i needed another shot. and I kept this up till i passed the stone.		M	26	2  days	5/9/2008
1	Post-op pain control	Extreme nausea, vomiting, dizziness, little to no relief of pain. I had this after a myomectomy and after gall bladder removal. When the surgeon doing the myo saw it wasn't helping and just made me sick, he immediately changed over to another analgesic (Fentanyl and then Toradol), and I felt much better--was able to walk around in a few hours and leave in just over a day. However, the gall bladder surgery was a nightmare (my liver got nicked), and I was in agony in recovery--what actually woke me was vomiting. More Demerol created more vomiting, and the surgeon left no orders for anything else (and the nurse refused to contact him). I threw up most of the way home and for the better part of the day. I realize some of the effect might not have been Demerol, but the fact remains that a second dose post-op made me even sicker. I know it works well for some people, but PLEASE ask your doctor to have a backup analgesic order if this makes you sick. NO ONE should have to throw up after any s		F	41	2  days	4/10/2008
4	crohns disease	mild drowsiness	works quickly and does wonders for severe pain due to crohns disease and partial bowel obstruction.  I get no relief from morphine or dilaudid.  Pain relief does not last very long requires frequent doses and loses effectiveness if taken for extended periods.	M	37	6  days	4/4/2008
4	kidney stone	Slept for 6 hours straight (in the middle of the day!), extreme dry mouth, mild headache upon awakening	I had been using Percocet when acute pain from the kidney stone would come on, but it hasn't been doing the trick.  My MD gave me an injection of Demerol today, and it pretty much eliminated the pain and knocked me the heck out, which is fine by me.  Make sure it's coupled with an anti-emetic so that you don't vomit.	M	36	1  days	3/25/2008
1	Appendectomy	Intense Nausea, Dizziness, Sweating (associated with the feeling of intense heat), Vomiting, Some Hallucinations	The story: I had a surgery late in the day, so I was staying overnight at the hospital.  I wake up and I'm offered a painkiller shot, which they inform me has to be in the behind.  At first, I resist, but the morphine from the surgery had worn off so the pain is getting pretty bad.  The nurse comes back and gives me a shot of Demerol in the behind.  After a few minutes, a crazy rush of heat hits me.  It's like someone turned up the temperature to 130 degrees in the room.  Immediately thereafter, a wave of nausea overcomes me and I pass out. Though I suppose it sounds "interesting" in retrospect, the next couple hours were a confusing and dizzying mix of reality and what I can only describe as insanity.  I had very strange (bad) dreams that were indistinguishable from reality, and occasionally I would be awake, only to SEE things that weren't actually there.  For example, the nurse came in and got really close to my face and then all of a sudden she was back at the doorway com	M	21	1  days	3/6/2008Email
1	Appendectimy	They gave it to me right before surgery in my IV. Right after I took it I started freaking out and trying to pull out my IV. I would fall asleep every few seconds and then suddenly wake up and forget where I was. The whole time I had the worst drymouth. Didn't help that all they could do me was let me have a few licks of an ice cube since it was before surgery and I couldn't have liquids. I don't remember most of it or how long it lasted but it was definitely scary.		M	15	 	2/23/2008
1	Appendicitis	I went into the hospital with a severe appendicitis attack and was given Demoral immediately. I experienced vivid and frightening hallucinations, hightened awareness of pain, and severe nausea (throwing up every 1-2 minutes). As soon as I was switched to morphine, all symptoms vanished very quickly.		F	26	1  days	2/7/2008
5	Gall Bladder	Euphoria,slight nausea which was easily control with anti-nausea meds, and extreme tiredness.	I had to have surgery several times to correct the botched gall bladder removal surgery I had. I was on demerol both times for the pain and it worked EXCELLENT! I would fall asleep nearly the minute it was injected in my IV but I didn't feel any pain. I did have nausea but as long as I was given some anti-nausea meds it was fine.  I found demerol to be much better on my mental state that Morphine or other pain meds.	F	23	7  days	1/11/2008
5	crohns decease	dizzyness, big time dry mouth when i woke up!	When i got taken to the ER they gave me demerol and fenagyn(sp?) to help with the pain. It burns when they give it to you, but it works GREAT! Very soon after I got it I felt very tired, dizzy,helped the pain a LOT and i slept pretty much the whole time!	M	19	2  times	12/9/2007
1	post surgery	Nightmares and night sweats, panicky feeling	I was given liquid demerol through an IV when I was in the hospital and woke up 2 nights in a row to extremely frightening nightmares that caused me to sweat profusely. I was told by the doctor that this is a common side effect and was taken off it immediately.	F	34	2  days	12/6/2007
2	major gall bladder surgery	I felt high as a kite. I couldn't urinate and had to be catherized after taking this. I saw Popeye the Sailor walking in my hospital room.	This drug gives you some wicked hallucinations. It does help with pain, but the side effects are not worth taking it. The cure is worse than the ailment	F	49	1  weeks	11/28/2007Email
5	Double C4 fracture, post MVA	Euphoria, drowsiness	I was sent home with oral demerol after a broked neck and major surgery following a car accident. I had been on IV push morphine in the hospital. The demerol was excellent at taking away my pain. It actually enduced a feeling of euphoria that was much welcomed considering all the pain I was in. It did make me a little sleepy, but this was probably related to the fact that I was so happy to have my pain level decreased and feel like I could finally sleep. Im told long term use can result in the acumulation of a toxic metabolite that can result in seizures. This is why you dont see it used often for chronic (i.e. cancer) pain unless there is a specific need such as allergies to other drugs. But I would say it is great for short term pain management!	F	22	30  days	9/26/2007
5	Colonoscopy	Side-effects: lightheadedness, naseau; but demerol in combination with versed worked for me.  I didn't want to remember procedure. I didn't want pain and wanted to sleep.	I am thankful for demerol and versed. Yes, I am still having side-effects a day later, but I am thankful for how the drugs helped me get through the procedure. I was scared going in, but don't remember it and woke up in the recovery room not remembering a thing. I am thankful it worked for me.	F	53	1  times	8/4/2007
1	oral surgery	Vomiting.	Did not alleviate pain at all.  I could not eat anything and could hardly drink water, so I stopped taking it.	F	32	2  days	6/17/2007
2	Colonoscopy	naseua, vomiting, chills -- lasted about 15 hours after procedure -- was very surprised the post procedure was worse than the pre-colonoscopy procedure!	next time would request anti-naseua medication as well	F	51	1  days	6/6/2007
1	Surgery	Hallucinations, inability to communicate, extreme pain.	I had this drug twice for major surgery and it did not work.  I was in excruciating pain, but reality was so distorted that I could not tell them about it.  I refused the drug on my third surgery and was very satisfied with Morphine.	F	52	4  days	4/29/2007
4	Two broken bones in lower leg/ankle	Not really hallucinations, but more of an inability to tell reality from dreams.  It was very hard to urinate, although this may have been more about having to pee in that stupid jug than a side effect of the demerol.  I wouldn't say it really took the pain away as much as it made me forget about the pain.	As stated before, I broke the bones in my ankle and required surgery to place plates and screws around the break.  I was on a demerol PCA through the entire process.  The demerol helped get me through the night, but did not really help much of the pain immediately after surgery.	M	23	3  days	3/20/2007
5	migraine	slept 10 hrs, mild euphoria	This is the only medication that complete wipes out my pain level 10 migraines in 5 minutes flat.  I would have killed myself by now to escape the pain if it weren't for Demerol.  I have to go to the ER around once a month for an injection after all other methods of relief have failed.	F	24	1  days	3/14/2007
3	lower rhytidectomy (lower necklift)	dry mouth, constipation, severe pain in hips, thigh muscles, and lower back, loss of balance	medicine did work, I guess, but had to take two every 3-1/2 to 4 hours since the surgery.  After a day and a half switched to tylenol as I could not sleep due to the pain in my lower body when lying down in bed.	F	56	2  days	8/4/2006Email
1	Administered by hospital in Miami	Administered by nurse following operation while in recovery room at hospital in Miami. Went into cardiac arrest, heart stopped & stopped breathing for 7 minutes before staff brought me back.	Never had Demerol previously  & didn't know was alergic to it. Look up in Physician's Desk Reference (PDR) here on web what some side effects can be.	M	62	1  days	4/21/2006
2	acute neck pain	none	did nothing for the pain at all. I ended up taking two 400mg ibuprofen and that was the only thing that finally dulled the pain enough so I could sleep.	F	46	1  times	4/19/2006
4	Pain in my lower back	Must take it with food or it will come back up / stomach will ache.	Doctor tried many drugs to help me sleep/Only demerol would stop the pain and allow me to sleep 5-6 hrs.	M	57	16  years	3/22/2006
1	Appendectomy	Convulsions, hallucinations and inability to concentrate; I was totally unable to communicate. Side effects (finally) stopped when I was switched to morphine.	Demerol for me was the worst nightmare of my life. The hospital staff claimed no knowlege of similar cases, seems unlikely; I've talked to others!

5	Emerg Pain Med for Ruptured Cyst	Warm tingling sensation all over my body (actually felt good). A feeling of floating and happiness.	This was the ONLY thing that worked on me in the ER when I came in for a rupterd ovarian cyst (9cm!!!) I was in the ER for 12 hours before they were able to come up with the correct diagnosis and they tried EVERYTHING and this was the only thing that workedto alleviate the pain. Only use this for EXTREME pain.. seems like it could be addictive.	F	27	3  times	1/19/2006

Reluctant too change.	M	62	1  days	12/27/2005

5	crohns disease	Only side effects that I had were mild drowsiness and dry mouth	This is just about the only pain medicine I can take when I am in a flare up of my crohns. I am allergic to so many other things and especially given IV form works wonders for me!	F	48	3  weeks	6/24/2005Email
4	dysmenorhea	Dizziness/head floating	I tried this after the other prescription med (Bextra) was proving to be not effective enough.  I took it in pill form on an empty stomach and started feeling dizzy about 30 mins later.  The dizziness was bad enough that I had to sit down for about half an hour.  I drank a lot of water, thinking it would help dilute it, but that made me feel like throwing up for a couple minutes.  It did knock down my pain from about a level 4 to about a level 1-2, and the dizziness passed in about an hour, all told.	F	27	1  days	6/2/2005

4	Kidney Stones	Dizziness	I have cronic kidney stones that are not inherited.  Percocet didn't even work.  I had a shot in my butt, 75mg demerol, it was the only thing that took the pain away after 40mg of morphine over the 12hrs in the hospital....	M	23	 	2/11/2005Email
5	post-appendectomy	extreme drowsiness, mild hallucinations, dizziness	Demerol worked wonders for my pain.  I took this by IV during my hospital stay, then followed up my treatment with Vicadin in pill form.  The plan worked quite well and I healed rather quickly.	F	20	2  days	11/30/2004
4	Chronic Pancreatitis	Itching	While the PO Demerol works, it is not optimal pain relief.  Drs. have even said PO Demerol is not the greatest pain med.  However, at the time, that was all I could take for the pain due to problems with my Pancreas.  I was given IV Demerol, which does work a lot better.	F	38	7  years	10/24/2004

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.	F	41	5  months15mg 1X D	1/2/2012Email
3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011
3	major depression	Very drowsy all day, anxiety		F	21	3  weeks20mg	11/29/2011Email
5	major depression	major weight gain, has slowed me down a bit, but I'm not bothered by it - I still move too fast anyway	best drug I've ever been prescribed - lifted my depression when used as an add-on and stopped the racing thoughts that I always had and thought were normal	F	39	2  years7.5 mg 1X D	11/16/2011
1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..	F	25	1  months 1X D	11/14/2011Email
3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.	F	62	11  days1 mg 1X D	11/11/2011Email
1	deppression	shaking twitching over emotional		F	23	60  days30 1X D	11/3/2011
5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email
1	depression/anxiety	severe muscle weakness, tremors that have yet to stop 2 months in, not sleeping, pacing		M	44	5  days5mg 1X D	9/19/2011
1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email
1	depression	i would studder sweat like crazy eye twitching hyperactive cry for no reason heart pounding out my chest really high blood pressure pass out from panic attacks insomia talk really fast umm flame up inside theres more thid pill sucks i thought i was going to die		M	31	 30mg 1X D	8/25/2011Email
5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
