5	I was very violent in psych ward.	I just remember having lock jaw a lot and being very very drowsy. I was known for having very violent tendencies towards staff and myself.  I don't remember what was given to me to stop the lock jaw.I just remember being very uncomfortable with the lock jaw. I felt like if I had to live this way I would rather die. This medicine is NOT used for migraines!! What a stupid ER doctor for giving this woman this medication for it!!! ESPECIALLY IF SHE NEEDED TO FUNCTION DAILY TAKING CARE OF HER CHILDREN!!!

1	Headache	Sleepy in a coma like state for 2 whole days before experiencing uncontrollable tongue and leg movements, and severe confusion.	I was given this medication in the ER for a HEADACHE. I have what is called scapula thoracic creptius/burstitus and snapping scapula syndrome from a car accident back in 2010. I get frequent neck spasms, shoulder pain, headached..etc from nerve compression where my muscles tense up. Even chest pain known as costochondritis. I went in complaining of a migraine for 6 going on 7 days.. they gave me an injection of phenergan for the nausea (already have an rx for this, it was unneeded) and for the Haldol. I have never in my life felt so bad. I was unable to move for two whole days, and I have kids to take care of. I wanted to do nothing but sleep. When I came out of my "coma" I was anxious and my tongue was tightening up and rolling back, my legs wanted to move and do something.. I was confused. I asked my kids "what do I normally do this time of day". My youngest is 18 months old, I nearly dropped him TWICE. This to me is considered medical negligence because I was not given a list of side effects, this is an ANTI PSYCHOTIC. NOT headache medicine. I am LIVID, to say the least. Now I have to take Benztropine, and Valium to feel halfway normal because I am on day 4 since taking it and my legs still try to move all the time, it's uncontrollable. This drug is DANGEROUS!! I will NEVER take something again from an ER or any Doctor for that matter unless I know what it is. This is insane!!!!	F	32	1  days 1X O	2/23/2013Email

3	Voices	Extreme long and short term memory loss, sleeplessness, insomnia, diarhea.	I've always prided myself on my great memory, untill I began the Haldol. Since I began taking it 7 months ago my short term memory has gone all to heck, and gotten worse, I have trouble remembering things I did the evening or day before, though long term memory is still intact, but who's to say when long term memory kicks in? But, the benefits of Haldol far outweigh the negative, the voices are gone (for the most part), and I do sleep better, when I'm not suffering from insomnia, my sleep patterns are far from normal, I'm either up all night or sleep like the dead for 12 hours, I slept 14 hours yesterday. I also have a decreased appetite, I forgot to eat yesterday, and that's not the first time that's happened. I realize I don't have the severe reaction to this drug that other people have, but as I said, the benefits far outweigh the negative. I would reccomend this drug for those people suffering from schizophrenia, voices, and anger issues, since I began the Haldol my anger issues have disappeared, which is why I can see it being prescribed in a prison setting.

1	forced outpatient "treatment"	I was lobotomized, akathisia, metabolic problems, no sense of self or feelings or likes or dislikes or opinions -- nothing.  It was a nightmare.	It took a year for its effects to get out of my system.  It is pure poison.  It was in fact used in the Soviet Union to break political dissidents.  Awful that psychiatrists in apparently good conscience consider this medicine.	F	45	8  months40mg 1X M	1/8/2013
1	BRUTALLY, UNJUSTIFIABLY FORCED	swollen face, severely restricted breathing, panic, anger, dizziness, shaking, muscle rigidity and pain, made me suicidal.	THIS DRUG IS ATTEMPTED MURDER!!!! This should be considered attempted murder because of the severe degeneration in quality of life it causes. The fact that it is being forced to people against their will is disgusting. I was taunted by medical staff until I became annoyed. They then used my annoyance as a false reason for physically beating me and administering this. It left me shrieking in agony and swollen everywhere. It made my heart beat too fast and immediately gave my a panic attack. My condition immediately declined 3000% after being given this. It has ruined my face by stretching it out and I had trouble speaking for months after. It closed my throat so badly I could not breathe and feared for my life. This will haunt me for the rest of my life. I am suffering post-traumatic stress from this and I have nightmares about this vulgar poison that nurses use because they are too lazy to do their jobs. I contemplate suicide because this drug and the deranged nurses who gave it to me have ruined my life. This drug should be illegal.	M	21	  1X D	11/25/2012Email
5	many things, especially schizophren	none!	I agree most nurses in the psychiatric ward are dumb when it comes to knowing about the effects of varying doses of Haldol. Haldol should only be given twice per day with a maximum single dose of 2 mg!!The way I'm taking Haldol is almost like a miracle. It increases my appetite, TAKES AWAY dry mouth, diarrhea, severe anxiety, suspiciousness, violent racing thoughts and impulses, OCD and worsened schizophrenia symptoms associated with a really bad rejection from a really sexy girl who I was dangerously in love with, and my tourettes. I really, really, really hope Haldol is never taken of the market! The answer is MODERATION. I really hate reading peoples negative and ignorant comments about Haldol, Haldol cam absolutely be abused by dumb or in fact EVIL nurses. 2mg Ativan comes down anxiety restlessness and panic that Haldol causes especially when Haldol is used in an intelligent and responsible manner. I strongly disagree with chemically restraining people with massive doses or even 5mg of Haldol. The key is prevention using Haldol safely and smartly, not abusing Haldol and torturing a patient after the poor person's mental health has been ignored, just for the convenience of hospital staff. 0.5 mg Haldol decreases the amount of dopamine binding to the D2 receptors through out the brain by 50% which is a very comfortable feeling in the state of a mental illness episode and mental illness. I am disappointed to hear all of the negative news about Haldol.							M	21	2  weeks0.5 mg 2X D	11/7/2012Email

1	taking it for depression, agression	I had uncontrollable movements from head to toe. Very bad headache and stiff all over. Jaw and mouth movements with extreme rigidness and stiffness. Pain. Unable to sleep at all. Drooling excessively. Did I mention my muscles were so tight that they started hurting really bad. Still get mild flashbacks of symptoms 4 months later after stopping the medicine, Thank God.	I will never take this medicine again. I've learned my lesson about this medicine and I have learned that doctors and nurses will not tell you what medicine they are giving you, they just give it to you. Just to say I took this medicine a while ago and had these horrible side effects when I was 18 years old and I'm 30 years old now. Had to go to the hospital for depression not too long ago and they just injected me with this crap without telling me what it was and once again the horrible, painful, sleepless, side effects. From now on I am asking what every medicine is the doctors or nurse try to give me and if they say that it is Haldol, I am gonna snap and tell them to take it and see how wonderful the sleepless, stiff pain is from this horrible awful medicine is. I felt like I was almost dead when I took this crap. Feel like a stiff dead person or something. Just awful, awful medicine. Do not take this medicine people. It's not worth the bad risks that come along with it. Plus this medicine did not do one bit of good for me, just stiffness, pain, and uncontrollable odd movements in my whole muscular system and very painful. Had many a sleepless nights before I found out it was this medicine doing these bad feelings in my body. All I know is I was so relieved when I found out it was this medicine doing these bad things to me I wanted to jump for joy.

1	Sexual advances-wife/Alzheimers	As a disabled RN, I know that Haldol is detrimental to our individual's (ESPECIALLY to our elderly population). Recently, my dad was at deaths door due to Haldol's side effects. Haldol causes tardive dyskinsia (muscle stiffness, alterted range of motion, etc). This week, I moved my 90 year old dad from a Rehab/nursing facility in NC - (I am dad's POA & Health Care Surrogate). The physicians knew that they were NOT allowed to prescribe ANY medication for dad unless I was notified. I was horrified when I took dad from the facility in NC and discovered that they had been "zoning" him out with Haldol. (I thought that his memory and mobility problems were due to the his aging process). Haldol has too many side effects to even be on the market. I took dad home to FL (mom passed away a few months ago, so it was time for a move for dad). Dad's legs were so swollen that they were purple: I immediately discontinued the Haldol.

3	Schizoaffective w/ Bipolar Subtype	Just switched from Abilify to Haldol D. Loved Abilify (on it for 2 years), becuase of the low side affect profile, but just can't afford it anymore. Starting out on 25mg injection that lasts 2 weeks. Will see how I do, then increase the mgs and get shot only once a month. So far after only 5 days, I still feel as calm as I did on Abilify, but now my jaw clenches to the left really bad, and was asleep for 2 days after getting the injection. Shoulder very sore still where injection was given. Mild increase in paranoia.	Hope the jaw clenching goes away, and that the paranoia will decrease after raising the dose. I am on the very lowest dose to start due to severe side effects to other drugs like Zyprexa, Risperdol and Seroquel.	F	35	5  days25mg 1X O	1/7/2012Email

1	Dementia	My 75 year old mother was given this drug and went from a healthy strong woman who did have a lot of anxiety and liked to walk around a lot to a comotose person who can't even hold her self up any more and is now in a weelchair.	This drug is terrible for elderly people with dimentia and should not be given to them for any length of time.  My mother was thrown in a psych ward after less than 1 week in a memory care unit.  They didn't want to be bothered with altering her medicine or dealing with her minor outbursts from being in a new place.  After 3 months I removed her and placed her somewhere else but she is a completely different person now.	F	76	3  months1 mg 2X D	9/18/2011
1	Agitation, Mania	Extremely dry mouth, muscular contortions, unintelligible slurred speech, drooling, inability to urinate, elevated heart rate, over-sedation, incoordination, involuntary movements, muscle rigidity, tremors	I don't recommend haldol. This is an old, outdated drug with a multitude of harmful side effects, and there are much better drugs now that are far more effective. These days haldol is used mostly to treat agitation in prisoners and psychosis in mental patients. It Is like a chemical straight jacket, or at higher doses, it is more like a lobotomy.I was given haldol in 1976 when I was 17 for agitation, a horrible experience. I lost muscle control on one side, couldn't walk, couldn't pee, felt agitated but could hardly move or function, also caused drooling and uninteligable slurred speech. I was started on 10 mg and the dose was reduced to 1 mg. The side effects were still very problematic on 1 mg of haldol. The medicine for side effects was not very effective.Haldol is not for use in psychotic conditions related to dementia and may cause heart failure, sudden death, or pneumonia in older adults. During his end stage cancer, my father at age 79 was on 1 mg for nausea and did not look at all peaceful on this drug. He looked very uncomfortable, was unable to speak and his mouth was sandpaper dry.My grandmother age 93 was given 5 mg for agitation, and was barely able to move or speak, and she looked very uncomfortable. Her heart rate became so elevated her doctor worried that she would have a heart attack.A younger friend of mine took haldol for schizophrenia which helped, but not without disturbing side effects like tremors and tardive dysconesia.

1	ER injection to calm down	HALDOL is HORRIBLE!!!!! My 17-year-old brother was brought into the ER for being disorientated and uncontrollable at the time. The ER doctor gave him an injection of Haldol saying that it would calm him down. We were in and out of the hospital for the next 3 days because my brother was having such a horrible reaction from the side effects of Haldol. The following day after thinking he was getting better my brothers neck twisted to the right side and he was gazing up to the ceiling- his arms and legs were bent in weird positions and he was not responding to us at all. It was a nightmare. He could not talk to us his heart beat was out of control, he was sweating profusely and shaking uncontrollably. This drug should not be used on anyone let alone a 17-year-old kid. He is still having to take benadryl around the clock to make sure he doesnt have yet another dystonic reaction like that-not to mention he is paranoid its going to happen again.

1	Nausea and vomiting	worst WORST experience of my life, I can't begin to describe it. Tremendous restlessness and anxiety, paranoia, feelings of impending doom/death. I "knew" I was going to die. And the whole time I knew what was going on.  let me assure you, there is NOTHING and i mean NOTHING more terrifying than losing control of your mind... I didn't sleep for 36 hrs and i LOST A DAY.  by that I mean one second it was friday and the next it was sunday.  then, my tongue swelled up which was also terrifying! it started to become difficult to get air,  I went to the ER and got a shot of benadryl which was miraculous! the relief that came over me was amazing.  Worst experience of my life because never before or since have i had such a paralyzing fear...  As if that weren't enough, haldol has an extremely long half life of weeks sometimes. My symptoms kept re-occuring for over a month.  I had to take benadryl constantly to ward them off.  it was a nightmare.	NEVER take this medication for nausea! I am a nurse and I questioned this prescription at the time but the ER doc was very reassuring.  Knowing what i know now, i would also question it's use in a psychiatric setting.  the risk of severe psychosis is too great.	F	40	1  days30mg 1X D	3/16/2011Email

He was drinking and not being coopertive with the emergency room staff so they decided to give him a double dose of the drug through I. V. and an injection. They didnot let a family member go back there with him and didnot let us know that the drug was given to him after discharge, they told us that he was given another drug and it wasn't until he had to be taken to another hosiptal because of the side effects that we learned that he was given that drug.

I had brain hemorraging and a severe concussion. When arriving at the hospital I was very out of it and anxious-seeing that my family had not been contacted (while I was a minor) and it had taken four hours to arrive at the hospital ten minutes away. Despite the damage done internally, i apparently was given an injection of haldol. The nurses claim I was being combative and my memory of the entire event has been erased. Even when I was discharged, there was no knowledge that I or Any of my family had that I had been given an antipsychotic. That night, when I began to have seizures, I went back to the hospital(in the pediatric unit this time) and was told that I was having a dystonic reaction from an injection of haldol given to me the night before. I remained in the hospital under survaillence for days.It has now been a year and a half since this injection. Ever since, I have had consistently a high blood pressure and pulse rate. In the past couple months, I have began having severe chest pain. Recently, I was, yet again, rushed to the hospital after having a heart attack. I am nineteen years old. Before being given haldol I had never had a health concern. They cannot figure out the cause of all of my medical problems now.

1	p. schizophrenia	Furious this drug is still on market. My mother had severe and continuous hallucinations even being prescribed an anti-hallucinagen back in early 80's when Haldol first surfaced for mentally ill patients as the new go-to drug. Mother on the surface seemed to be getting better but still suffered dillusions, had sleeping problems, all the same issues prior to Haldol.	Run from this drug. My mother committed suicide unexpectedly as we thought she was getting better meanwhile the anti-hallucination med wasn't working like we thought. She was leaving hints to my father and others and I didn't put the pieces together until after she died. This happened in Feb. 1982 and one year later, Haldol was supposed to be taken off the market due to the ridiculous number of suicides in a small amount of time over a year. How the drug company kept this drug active is beyond me. This is not a new drug and most Drs. don't even know how dangerous this drug is. If it wasn't for the greedy drug companies, this drug would not have been used for psychiatric patients and taken off the market. I don't even know what the physical ramifications were for my mother as she wasn't communicating her issues after taking this medicine as many mentally ill patients don't always. I was 8 months pregnant and lost a lot. Be careful with this drug and don't use it unless absolutely necessary. There have been many many people who have committed suicide after taking this drug quite unexpectedly. In 1983, when I heard how dangerous Haldol was on the 6:00 national news, I was shocked! Assuming the drug would be discontinued as the newsreport suggested it would, I never checked on it until someone told me her elderly grandmother is currenly taking this drug for Alzheimer's in 2010.

The Dr. at another hospital told us to take it away immediately, which we finally insisted on when we found out how harmful this drug is.  With physical therapy for a month and a half he has improved and now knows most of the family. He is in a nursing home now using depends because he cannot always make it to the bathroom. He also wanders and we are afraid he will leave the house and get lost.  He has severe night sweats also.  This is a horrible drug that almost killed my Dad. It should be banned!!!

The Haldol made my muscles tight..my face went to one side my muscles in my face all stopped being firm, my hands started curling in. I thought I was dying in the middle of a stroke. My husband took me to the ER, and I was assisted immediatly without delay. The Nurse who waited on me before going back to a bed in one of the rooms, diagnosed it as I was having allergic reactions, or side effects of a drug I was taking. I told him all. Then I mentioned to him my dr prescribed some for me. The nurse practitioner said..THATS IT! I was amazed he diagnosed me..Dr came in because I started crying..Help..Help..someone help me please. My tongue was so swollen and my head turned over to my right shoulder. I thought I was going to die! I wouldn't ever recommend this to anyone. The nurse gave me a shot of conginten. Which is also has lots of s		F	42	2  days	11/28/2009Email
1	Dad given it to calm him in hospita	My dad became comatose alternating with deliriouscould not walk, could not eat, talk or commuiniatehe was only given it for 7 days, but afterwards lost a full month of his memory. 8 months later he is still in bad shape cognitively	It was given to my 90 year old dad as he waited to get a pacemaker put in- and then they just kept giving it to him-]then they put him in rehab as he couldn't get around-- of course he couldn't - they'd turned him into a vegetable!It was so bad, that my over-exhausted mom then had a stroke from a-fib! what a nightmare.

1	my adopted daughters mom did	My adopted daughters mom was given this the entire pregnancy - not knowing she was pregnant.  It has created an emotionally unstable "drug baby" that has ADHD, Sensory processing Disorder, severe emotional problems, Disruptive behavior disorder among other things. I DO NOT recommend this drug.	It also turned my dying father into another person. The day Hospice gave my dad haldol, was the day my father had no more mind, it completely stole the next week of his life. He was gone after they drugged him with this stuff. There was nobody inside there any more.	F	48	 	9/29/2009

1	BIPOLAR	Bad Akathisia with HALDOL INJECTION.  Could not relax for a second, kept on getting up from my chair and pace walking around could not keep still.  My face and body felt numb.  Most terrible feeling it's called Akathisia (movement disorder) in doctors terms.  You should talk to your doctor right away if you feel like this.	INVEGA SUSTENNA will replace Risperdal Consta and Haldol injection.  Invega Sustenna is a once monthly injection of paliperidone palmitate.  INVEGA SUSTENNA WAS APPROVED ON FRIDAY (July 31).

1	My father	My father was forced to take this drug in hospice, He was like a zombie... Couldnt even talk or anything. If we had another chance , I wouldnt let them give this drug to him at all!Dont let hospice or any doctor give your loved one this drug just to shut them up and keep them quiet.	Dont let them drug up your loved one with haldol just to shut them up. This drug is horrible.	F	47	 	7/29/2009

5	Bipolar Mania Psychosis	Drowsy Feeling	I haven't experienced any bad effects from Haldol, like other people on here.  It really keeps me calmed down!!!! No racing thoughts or delusions any more	M	33	6  months	7/13/2009
1	Forced by a mental hospital	My fingers on my right hand contourted and froze and I was unable to move my right leg. And immedialtly after my first injection I slept for two days woke up disoriented and confused. Thinking that I was permately cripple.	This drug and the unscrupulous Drs. and Nurses that perscribe it especially who put it in patients food or inject them in there sleep shoud be locked up. And exposed to the media.After a stint of being a victim of Microwave Harassment. I was checked into a mental hospital for a 3 day evaluation to see if I was having a nervous breakdown. I wound up comming home 10 days later in a wheel chair do to over medication.Prior to this event I was a successful business owner , Playwright and Author. The course of events, and medicine has caused me to lose all of my material possesiona and many friends and relatives.  So in my opinion, Haldol should be band from the market. And the whole treatment of mental illness should be investigated and regulated to the fullest degree of the law.	M		10  days	7/12/2009Email
1	Bipolar	I WAS FORCED TO TAKE THIS DRUG IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM BY INJECTION SHOT.  IT GAVE ME EXTREME TERRIBLE SIDE EFFECT KNOWN AS AKATHISIA:  A movement disorder characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and a compelling need to be in constant motion as well as by actions such as rocking while standing or sitting, lifting the feet as if marching on the spot and crossing and uncrossing the legs while sitting. People with akathisia are unable to sit or keep still, complain of restlessness, fidget, rock from foot to foot, and pace.	THIS IS A TERRIBLE DRUG TO GIVE A PATIENT AND IS GIVEN OUT LIKE CANDY IN THE Psychiatric World.	M	29	5  months	7/11/2009
1	Mother wanted to get out of bed.	89 year old mother was given this to calm her down.  Given not once, but twice in one evening.  She had Congestive Heart Failure and High Blood Pressure.  Mother passed away 3 days later.  She was unresponsive, unable to eat, talk, sit up, swollen tongue.  When we asked what they did to her, we were told something was given to her to calm her down.  All she wanted to do was get out of bed.  Doctors and nurses ignored our demands/requests to call us anytime if they needed help with mom, and to never, never give her drugs of any kind, call us first.  They never called us at any time.	The pyschiatrist who gave her this never knew Mom, or probably never read her reports or our requests.  We asked him what he gave her, said he would be right back, we never saw him again, never.

1	SISTER/DEPRESSION/schizophrenia	SUICIDE	EVER SINCE MY SISTER WAS GETTING THE INJECTION SHE HAS HAD INCREASED DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS WHICH AFTER ONLY 8 MONTH ON THE INJECTIONS SHE DID ACT OUT ON HER SUICIDE MISSION, I MENTIONED IT TO HER COUNSELER AND THEY DID NOT FOLLOW UP WITH ANYMORE EVALUATIONS FOR MY SISTER. THEY JUST INSISTED THAT SHE REFUSED TO TAKE HER NORMAL MEDS AND THE INJECTION IS WHAT SHE NEEDED.	F	45	8  months	5/9/2009
1	Forced injection in mental hospital	Tounge swelled up immediately and I could not talk or breathe until given an injection of another drug. Went to sleep and did not wake up for two days. Also had a seizure  Afterwords permanent RLS, gastroparesis, depression, achalasia, stiff neck.	Nobody should be allowed to inject you with a drug that permanently lowers your quality of life. Haldol should not be used on patients to "calm them down" period. Now I will be pissed off the rest of my life because of the permanent lasting side effects. My opinion is that every person who injects that drug into patients should have to try the drug themselves. Due to the gastroparesis and achalasia I may have to go on a feeding tube and stay on it the rest of my life. Depressing.	F	26	 	5/4/2009
5		Drowsiness at higher doses.  None at low doses.	I take haldol 2mg PRN.  It works well on anxiety and calms me the hell down. Helps me sleep. Haldol is a good alternatives to benzos.  I use this instead of klonopin.	M	30	1  years	4/2/2009
1	Forced in ER	Parkinson type symptoms, curled up in a ball from muscle spasms, muscles in neck tense to the point that I felt like I could not breathe, sweating, felt like I was going to die.	Horrible, horrible drug, should be taken off the market.  Doctors in ER only gave it to me to shut me up.  Should not be given to anyone.	M	24	1  times	3/31/2009
1	Forced	EPS- my jaw muscles froze and i couldnt open my mouth. most terrifying experience ive had considering i was only 15, in a mental institution for being an angry, depressed teenager, and i had no idea what was happening to me. i thought my jaw broke.	extra pyramidal symptoms can easily occur with shots of this med. just a little too much can cause pretty much any muscle in your body to freeze.   i feel for the people that are mentally sick and given this medicine without their consent. these kind of reactions are so terrifying.

1	mislabeling	akathisia (restlessness, agitation) in the legs, quasi-narcolepsy	Stay away from all that stuff!  (I actually don't remember how long I took it.)	F	29	3  weeks	3/27/2009
5	Bipolar	felt drowsy	It seems people either hate this medicine or love it.  I can say that considering the alternatives, Haloperidol is my friend.  Atypicals didn't work for me as well.  I feel calm,rested, and generally keep a good mood.	M	35	1  years	3/18/2009
5	BIPOLAR-Seroquel didn't cut it!	A Little tired	I didn't tolerate Seroquel very well.  Made me irritable.  Haloperidol has been alot better.  Curently taking 15 mg per day.  Helps me calm down better than anything else.	F	29	29  months	3/13/2009
