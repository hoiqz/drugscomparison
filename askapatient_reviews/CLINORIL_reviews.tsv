				F M	 	 	    
2	RA	Nausea, headache, nosebleeds, foot cramps, itchy scalp	It was effective in terms of controlling pain and stiffness. However, by day 6 the side effects clearly outweighed the benefits. I am sensitive to to drugs; it may help others.	F	59	7  days150 1X D	11/7/2010
4	neck pain	It's a very mild anti-inflammory drug that works great for me with no sign effects.		F	53	1  years	9/20/2008Email
2	plantar fasciitis or "heel spurs"	None.	This was prescribed for me since, per the doctor, "some anti-inflammatory meds work better than others, for some people with some conditions."  So I decided to try it after trying others.  It was like taking candy.  I was taking 200mg 3 times a day.	F	46	2  weeks	6/5/2008
2	Pain in left hip	For one week the pain relief was great - then it just seemed to stop working and severe diarrhea set in.  Had to stop because of this.	Left an earlier rating that does not apply now!  Will just have to stick with traditional pain meds and O/C anti-inflammatories.	F	56	2  weeks	3/21/2008
5	Pain in left hip	None that I can tell.	DRAMATIC pain relief within three days!  I can now walk without limping, and get in and out of my car with relative ease.  As a bonus, this drug also seems to help my fibromyalgia pain in spite of what I've read that anti-inflammatories don't work for this condition.  I've been able to cut way down on my Vicodin intake; I haven't felt this good since my 40s!	F	56	1  weeks	3/12/2008
2	Scolios and arthritis	Ringing in ears, constipation	No better pain relief than Ibuprofen or or other OTC pain relief	M	67	7  days	1/8/2007
