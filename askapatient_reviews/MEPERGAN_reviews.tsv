5	post surgeries		This is the only pain med I can take for severe pain, I'm allergic to codeine.  Works great for me, usually just knocks me out, but I do have a hangover the next day.  So I try to take only half a capsule to relieve pain.	F	55	  1X D	1/26/2012Email
5		slight drowsy..dry mouth	great medicine help greatly..had severve mouth pain	F	24	20  days	9/3/2009
5	Really messed up hand	Wicked good mood. Real happy. Easy to sleep, as was easy to wake up. Attention to detail. Real sharp, witty feeling. All in all amazing. ONLY BAD THING=== After taking this prescription for two weeks, I did feel a slight addiction when I realized I was out..It drove me to the point of insanity.	Wow. Talking about a trip. I love That doctor! I broke my carples and medacarples in my left hand when I got it wedged between two football helmets at a game friday night, and went to the doctor tuesday afternoon. Great pain med, gets rid of it quicker then George W. Bush with questions from the media.	M	17	2  weeks	11/16/2008
5	menstral cramps	sleepy, dry mouth, nothing that would be unenjoyable. i take it for that once a month and for migranes that are sparatic.	I vote if it takes away my pain i am ok with it. it defanitely did.	F	22	 	11/4/2008
5	knee surgery, back surgery	None really, slight drowsiness at times	I do not tolerate pain meds well because of Crohn's Disease-everything makes me sick at my stomach.  Mepergan was a life saver when I had bi-lateral knee surgery.  It completely suppressed the pain, and I didn't get sick.  It's the best medicine I've ever taken!	F	35	 	4/14/2008
4	chronic pain-postshouldersurgeries	Total brain fog- kills pain.	takes (me)  24 hour  to get rid of- stay in a dazed state long after apin relief is gone.I take it several times a week, not  several times daily, when in dire need for relief...I hate the dopey feel	F	48	4  years	4/12/2008
2						 	3/22/2008
4	breast augmentation and mastoplexy	drowsiness, weakness, dry mouth		F	18	5  days	12/12/2007
4	tonsillectomy and sinus surgery	General grogginess, slightly blurred vision, mild itching, lucid dreams	I would never have believed a drug would do such an amazing job with the pain and still leave me with enough function to take care of things around the house. It does impair mental function a bit; I'll start something and forget what I was doing. It has made my dreams much more vivid, even when I was just dozing lightly after surgery. I kept answering questions no one had asked me (my family got a kick out of that). My surgery was yesterday morning and I'm just ecstatic that I'm doing so well so  far.	F	35	2  days	6/16/2007Email
5	Kidney Stones	Helps me get comfortable enough at night to sleep well all night. If taken during the day, it makes me very sleepy if I am not active. If I stay up and moving it does not make me sleepy.	Definitely takes the pain away, but it does not last very long. I could probably take it every two or three hours, although that is not recommended. Overall I say it is a very good pain med. Thank goodness I have not experienced any of the hallucinations that other people say they have had from it.	F	27	5  days	6/7/2007
5	snapped penis in mousetrap - ouch	hard to pee, dry mouth, erectile disfunction, wild hallucinations of me having sexy time with Princess Di.	Really wonderful stuff. Can I get a witness?	M	42	9  days	4/26/2007
3	Kidney Stones	Sleepiness	helped with pain for the first couple of days	F	27	7  days	4/19/2007
1	post shoulder surgery	Extremely frightening hallucinations, mouth so dry I couldn't talk, dizziness, could not walk without much assistance.	This, in my opinion, is a terrible drug. I thought I was losing my mind . Didn't seem to alleviate the pain either.  Took 3 doses, and it was truly a trip...to hell.	F	62	1  days	2/16/2007
5	Knee Surgery	No Pain, very sleepy, can't remember anything, all in all a good time	AMAZING	M	17	3  weeks	2/14/2007
2	Breast Reduction	While taking this medication, I was completely out of it.  I was having hallucinations.  I was saying things that made no sense to anyone.  When I went back to the doctor the day after my surgery, they almost admitted me to the hospital because of the fact that I passed out once, and almost passed out several more times.

5	ruptured ovarian cyst	extreme drowsiness mild hallucinations	I tried other pain medications first.  This was the only one that gave me any relief.  I noticed no pain while on this medication.	F	26	4  days	10/21/2006
4	Migraines	Makes it easier to fall asleep; I can sleep through the night without waking up (and, if I wake, I can fall back asleep easily).  Definitely impairs my cognitive abilities and makes the world blurry.  I would not suggest driving or doing anything complicated.  No nausea.	Like other drugs I take for migraines, mepergan does not seem effective after I've taken it a couple of times (in these cases, it does not relieve any of my pain). I often take it with Advil to stop pain from recurring (mepergan does not seem to have anti-inflammatory effects-- it just masks pain). The first pill I ever took made me feel like my pounding migraine still existed, but it was somewhere across the room from me (which was nice).  It has never been as effective since.  I do not take more than two pills per day, because it seems pointless (it won't help).  I have not tried upping the dosage because it is a narcotic and I don't want to become addicted. While it makes me sleepy, sometimes I cannot sleep (I remain in bed half asleep, with a weird sense of floating, for half of the night).  The cognitive impairment is such that I don't think I could write anything or evaluate anything complicated. I have developed non-thought-requiring activities to occupy myself when I have to ta	M	39	6  years	10/14/2006

5	Kidney Stones	Worked very well. Was able to function but did not remember much. Took away the pain. Very deep sleep and mild hallucinations. Cartoon like dreams.		M	32	12  days	9/7/2006
5	back pain	none	i got my life back whem i started taking it	F	35	 	8/11/2006
4	Foot surgery	Constipation, sweating, a few hallucinations	Surgery involved opening up the top of the foot, trimming some bones, and installing some pins and screws.  Mepergan really helped - I had very little pain while I was taking it.  The Rx said 1 or 2 pills every 4-6 hours - I took about 6 the first day and 4 each of the next two - I am a large man and this more than sufficed.  After three days the pain had subsided to the point where I decided that enduring the minor pain remaining was better than putting up with the side effects.	M	65	3  days	6/9/2006
5	Dental Surgery	Mildly groggy, very relaxed, slightly euphoric state.	Mepergan done what no other pain med has ever done== Relieve my pain with no bad side effects!While moving around I had a calm, relaxed euphoric feeling. When lying down I went into an extremely relaxed state with very odd thoughts and peace of mind. Awoke with a slight groggy feeling which lasted throughout the day, but got better. No nausea at all and no "hangover" effect. Only mildly drowsy.	M	31	2  days	4/30/2006
5	Surgery	Slight hallucinations; very groggy	Very effective for pain; did not make me naseous at all.	F	29	5  days	4/24/2006
5	wisdom teeth extraction	Frankly this is the best pain med I have ever taken.  Percocet, Darvacet, Vicodin, etc., none can touch the ability of this drug to nullify pain!		M	35	7  days	3/22/2006
5	dental implant surgery	groggy	The only pain med I've ever taken that did not make me feel nasuated, yet handled the pain well. In the past I've taken Vicodin, Percocet and Darvocet, all of which made me nasuated (particularly unpleasant with dental work) and didnt really help with pain. The Mepergan was excellent, it did make me groggy, but fortunately I didn't have to take it but 1 day.	F	59	1  days	3/11/2006
4	Wisdom teeth extraction			M	31	4  days	2/7/2006

1	Broken Foot	Hallucinations and incontinence.	Pain not noticed.	F	85	1  days	1/3/2006
5	Foot surgery	dizzy especially after stopping medication, sleepy. mild hallucinations - more so the inabilty to tell reality from dreams, slight skin rash around mouth, but benefits of not being ill from anesthesia and taking away pain far outweighed the side effects!		F	43	5  days	11/24/2005
5	cut off right ring finger	none very good drug	great great great	M	21	13  days	11/18/2005
4	wisdom teeth extractions	Took the first 2 days post op, script was 25mg every 4 hours.  I really took it about every 6 to 8 hours, though.  I started taking it as soon as the IV meds and numbing started to wear off, as I'm big on pain prevention. The first couple of days were good with this one. No nausea, no pain, etc.  The third day, I started hurting more.	The third day post-op, I started hurting alot more.  I took the mepergan, but it basically just made me slightly dizzy for about 2 hours and nothing else. The dizzy and disorientation seemed to distract me from the throbbing pain, but that was about it.  Once those first 2 hours were done, I was left with lots of pain and more hours to go before I could take more med.  So, I called the doctor, and he gave me a different presciption (percocet) that I'm using now.As a sidenote, the nurses said pain thresholds sometimes change after the 3rd day because of a anti-inflammatory steroid (decadron) they give me. After surgery, they gave me 3 decadron tablets to take over the next 36 hours for swelling.  They said that once you quit taking the decadron, your pain threshold lowers, and that's when folks sometimes call for more help.  So, I'm glad I wussied out and called because the other med (percocet) is helping much better right now.	F	31	2  days	7/21/2005

5	Migrains and Back problems	If you are not use to it you need not to drive or try to do anything to strenious.  Will cause you to be sleepy.	I have a disk disease, so therefore, I have to use this often. I also use it for my migrains. I am allergic to anything with codine or anything related to codine.

4	Back pain	Don't recall any side effects	This is the only pain killer I've ever taken that didn't make me sick.  It worked great for covering the pain, however by masking that pain it also made me operate as normal rather than taking care with my back.  Ultimately needed surgery for ruptured disc.
