1	heavy/long cycles	Depression, anxiety, aggression, weepy, moody, irritable...NOT HAPPY		F	28	10  months	2/20/2013Email
1	Birth control	These pills caused a hormone embalance in me.  I gained about 15 lbs in 2 months, had extreme fluid retention, no sex drive, mood swings, migraines, and caused my breasts to sag.  I do not recommend these pills as the side effects are not worth it.  If I wanted that much stress I would have had a kid!		F	29	4  months	2/13/2013
3	Preventing pregnancy	Severe headache nd my breast  are shining as if m preg		F	20	1  weeks	4/18/2012Email
2	birth control	weight gain, decreased sex drive, lethargic	My periods are extremely light compared to when I was on Ortho-cept.  They are so light that it concerns me.  I was on Ortho-cept for 10 years and no problems but my clinic stopped carrying it.  I may try to get it somewhere else.	F	34	6  months	1/30/2008Email
1	prevention of pregnancy	SEVERE moodiness	The decision to stop taking this pill came when I realized that even I didn't like the "new" me. Not saying that it is the same in everyone, but this pill gave me severe mood swings and I snapped at the least little thing. I am going back to Nordette 28.	F	32	11  months	8/11/2007
5	birth control, heavy periods, acne	As long as I take the brand version of this pill (not the generic) I have no side effects after the first month or two.  First two months I had some problems with mood swings but nothing else.  I find that my sex drive is affected negatively from the generic version but I don't seem to have as much of a problem with the brand version. I also get some other undesirable side effects from the generic - mood problems especially. I've taken two different kinds of generic pills for this drug and while one was better than the other, I still don't do as well on them.	This has been the best pill for me. I took it for about 3 years but then tried some others due to sex drive issues.  I've tried Ovcon-35, Estrostep, OTC lo, and Yaz. I liked OTC lo A LOT and it was great for my sex drive, but it took my acne from mild to severe and I'm still trying to recover. I did not do well on any of the other pills. I went back to Lo/Ovral 3 months ago.  It is a bit expensive for me because I will only take the brand name, but it's worth it.	F	26	3.5  years	8/8/2007

1	Ovarian Cysts	depression, moodiness, headaches, acne	I couldn't stand the side effects, though it did fix my spotting and cramps.	F	19	2  months	8/22/2006
3	birth control	Severe mood swings and moodiness, laziness, extreme exhaustion constantly (no matter how much sleep is obtained), insomnia, acne, possible weight gain (I don't have a scale!).	I was on Kariva (generic of Mircette), but due to depression and sever moodiness/mood swings I stopped taking it. I was then put on Lo/Ovral-28 (actually the generic, Lo-Ogestrel). Most of my issues had gone away before starting the Lo/Ovral but quickly came back from THIS pill.	F	23	2  months	6/1/2006
2	prevention of pregnancy	decreased sex drive, moodiness	i had been taking orthotricyclen lo for about three years and it worked well for me but then i started to experience breakthrough bleeding and the doctor switched me over of lo/ovral. the breakthrough bleeding stopped, but then i noticed that my sex drive has seriously decreased since i started taking it. i also noticed that i had become very irritable along with an increased appetite. i have now been switched to another brand and i hope it works!
