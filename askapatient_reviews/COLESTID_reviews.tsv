5	Runny stool	N/A	I had a major bowel resection 22 years ago due to Crohn's Disease.  After my colostomy was reversed, problems with runny stool persisted due to shortening of the bowel.  After a year of panic about not being able to reach a bathroom in time, I finally asked my doctor if there was something I could take and he prescribed Colestid.  While Colestid is a drug for cholesterol, the main side effect is causing constipation, and in my case, helps my bowels to function normally.  No more urgent trips to the bathroom!  It has definitely led to a better quality of life for me.	F	43	19  years30mg 1X D	9/14/2011Email
