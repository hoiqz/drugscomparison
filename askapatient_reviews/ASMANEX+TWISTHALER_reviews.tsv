4	Asthma	Was on Qvar previously and would end up with bronchitis and asthma flare up every time I got a cold. Asmanex has help keep the amount of times I have needed to go on oral steroids. I gargle after using and have had no side effects.		F	33	4  months2 puffs 1X D	2/28/2013Email
2	child asthma	Anxiety, inability to focus, irritable, mood swings, out of control behavior	My son has been on Pulmicort (inhaled through the nebulizer) for about 5 years (he is almost 6).

4	very low lung function	Lots more energy!  Trouble staying asleep.	It seems to work for me.  I also take albuterol and spiriva, but I think I could do just as well without the spiriva, just using albuterol and asmanex.	F	67	3  months220mcg 2X D	9/27/2010
