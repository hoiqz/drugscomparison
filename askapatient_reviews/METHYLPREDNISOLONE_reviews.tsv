3	Sinus & ear pressure/pain	Insomnia, night sweating, rapid pulse, slight headache, sore throat. I called MD because med sheet said to inform doc if develop sore throat, which I did on first day & it was still there next morning. She said to just stop taking med, that there wouldn't be any withdrawal effects after only taking it for one day. It did help my sinus congestion somewhat, but my ear fullness is still there. I couldn't sleep at all taking the 6 pills on Day 1 as prescribed.		F	42	1  days4 mg	12/29/2012

Just helped me.	Took decreasing dosage for 6 days (6 day 1, 5 day 2, 4 day 3,....)  I could not move my right arm at all before staring this drug and was in extreme pain. Within 2 hours of first dose, pain was not as bad and I was able to start moving my arm a little again.  By the third day I could even get my arm over my head again.	F	54	6  days4mg 6X D	11/7/2010

2	rash	After taking 2nd dose of this med. for rash that no Dr. or specialist could pinpoint cause of, had severe foot & lower leg cramps which after continuing meds turned into severe joint pain in a few days, and normally I don't have any joint pain. Could hardly walk to the bathroom from bed & back the joint pain was so bad, & couldn't sleep from the pain in my joints for almost 3 nights straight, also had mouth ulcers around this same time. After stopping drug, joint pain, & ulcers went completely away after it got out of my system, which took between 5 & 6 days & I drank lots of water to help flush it out. Helped rash a little, but rash came back.  And finally after 8 months of the rash coming & going, it went away as mysteriously as it came, w/no meds. Family Dr., Dermatoligist, & Allergy specialist & all their tests, couldn't really tell me what caused the rash, only what they thought caused it.  All tests came up negative.  ????  Would never take any	1st dose given for rash was 4mg. taken as directed. Rash came back so after 2-3 weeks was given 10mg to take as directed & during the 8th day had the severe joint pain where I could hardly walk.  (A year later no rash, & I have no joint pains, etc. I still would NOT take Prednisone again unless I was dying!!	F	51	 	3/5/2009
3	root canal nerve damage	No adverse effects but a slight raise in energy level	The nerve was beginning to come back to life prior to taking this medication so it is hard to evaluate exactly how helpful it was.	F	60	6  days	3/11/2008

3	Optic Neuritis Lyme Disease	Taken 1000 MG IV for 3 days.. had bad taste in mouth and felt like on speed for hours.  Raised my blood sugars to outrageously high levels and not diabetic.. yet anyway.  helped the eye problem but now not sure if will have other health issues becuase of this.	Find out from doctor before you try this medication and if you are diabetic. have insulin ready.	F	35	3  days	6/14/2007
4	Chronic Hives	You had to take this at a decreasing dose each day.  It greatly helped my hives the next day.  Tried to work out and see if steriods really worked, and they did.  For some reason, I could not lift more weights than I was used to doing, but I did a lot more reps which surprised me and my muscles never got tired doing it.  I felt a little bloated, but very noticeable and received a lot of back acne and fortunately, they're disappearing.	The pharmacist told me that this could be used for arthritis, hives, asthma, and other things	M	20	7  days	5/20/2007
