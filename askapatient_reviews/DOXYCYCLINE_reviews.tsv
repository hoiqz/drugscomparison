5	chronic Lyme	Nausea/vomiting if I didn't take it with food; dry skin; sun sensitivity and severe sunburn if I wasn't careful.	I have found this to be a very satisfactory long-term medication, being easy to take, cheap, and safe, and covered by insurance. It didn't cure the Lyme disease but keeps it under control so symptoms are minimal. I call it "maintenance" therapy.	F	67	23  years200mg 1X D	1/5/2011Email
3	Lyme Disease	Nausea, which was helped if I took the pill with some rice.	The side effects of the doxy itself were tolerable; I didn't have any of the vomiting or diarrhea that a lot of people tend to get, but I did have a Herxheimer reaction from its effect on the Lyme in the second week of treatment---I could not eat, and could barely move, couldn't get out of bed for an entire week. However, after that week I started to feel a lot better and I definitely feel better than before I started the doxy.	F	22	30  days	4/6/2008
4	Hydradentis supurlativa	Itchy skin, stomac problems	Cleared up facial acne and armpit infection but has not helped with HS in other places.	F	37	9  months	1/15/2008
4	chronic Lyme Disease	lots of nausea and occasional vomiting, occasionally took over the counter anti-nausea meds- helped. You have to take it with food!I also got sun sensitivity, which was pretty bad towards the end- I usually dont' sunburn easily, and this was bad enough to be annoying.	It worked very, very well for my chronic Lyme- I went from disabled to highly functional in two months (the treatment takes much longer than that or you will relapse, see www.ILADS.org for more information on proper treatment). I eventually had to switch to azithromycin and then herbal treatments because of the nausea/vomiting, but I would go back on doxy if necessary as the nausea was less of a problem than some other antibiotic side effects. This is the least serious of the antibiotics side effects I've felt while having Lyme. Some Lyme patients experience a temporary worsening of symptoms- a Herxheimer reaction- which is not a side effect but is caused by dying bacteria, explained at the ILADS treatment guidelines website. Other patients may need different antibiotic for their chronic Lyme or a combination, however, no one antibiotic helps everyone with this condition. Long term treatments (even years) usually put it into remission.	F	35	90  days	5/20/2007
4	chronic Lyme Disease	I already described my experience but forgot to add that it's critical to not lie down for at least half an hour after taking this antibiotic or the nausea is worse, and it can irritate the esophagus, both of which I experienced.		F	35	 	5/20/2007
1	Acne	Esophagitis, anxiety	Be careful when taking this medicine. Be sure to drink with at least 8 oz of water and DO NOT lie down after taking this. I made the mistake of going to bed immediately after taking it one night. I have not been able to eat for two days! Major pain in my chest and back when I swallow food! It's a great antibiotic but the side effects aren't worth it	F	26	14  days	4/26/2007
