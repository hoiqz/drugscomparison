4	PSVT, orthostatic hypotension, POTS	None, as far as I can tell.  I have several chronic conditions, so any potential side effects could have been explained away by me as part of these issues.	This medication changed my life for the better.  I was SO sick due to my autonomic dysfunction and all that it entailed.  I felt like I got my life back.	F	34	3  months5 mg 2X D	5/26/2011
1	Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia	Gave me migraines, depression and messed up my blood sugar...I became hypoglycemic.  Plus, I experienced severe pain in my joints.  Not a good medicine for me!		M	20	2  months	10/29/2008
