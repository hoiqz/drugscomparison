5	acne-jawline/forehead/chin/chest	NONE! I was surprised too- because all of the other topicals I've used usually will dry my skin out or irritates my skin. This does NOT!!!! It actually reduced my redness and I am less oily when I use Aczone! It's amazing!	this new medicine works fast- if you use it day and night after you cleanse your face. my pimples were red, tender, some pus-filled and within a week Aczone Gel 5% was working on my the redness and tenderness associated with my acne. It goes well under makeup and doesn't dry me out like Benzoyl Peroxide combos. I can use on my chest acne and as much as I want without irritation, even when I use with other products! It's a no-brainer- it works and my go-to!!!	F	26	6  months60 2X D	9/6/2010
