1	tooth abcess	Upset stomach, nervous feeling, mood swings, and loose stools. The loose stools resulted in hemorrhoids, which I had to get additional meds for. WORST PAIN with bowel movements that I have ever experienced.		F	36	7  days500	3/11/2013Email
1	Possible infection in breast	Chest pain, dead arm	Very scary, almost went to hospital for the chest. Only took 3 tabs cause I can't continue. Dead arm freaking me out. Didn't know I had any drug allergies but the drug combined with the amoxicillin did me no good. Hope these symptoms clear.	F	29	 500mg 2X D	2/22/2013
1	pneumonia	Hives, swelling of my hands and feet if I got cold, and severe joint pain that lasted 3 weeks, and had hair loss for months afterward.	Would never recommend this except as a last resort. The joint pain was really harsh and faded very gradually over the 3 weeks after I stopped taking the drug. I lost a great deal of hair that didn't start growing back until about 5 months after I stopped taking the drug. I don't even want to imagine what may have happened if I had taken this drug through it's full coarse.	F	18	2  days 1X D	1/30/2013Email
1	Drug-resistant E Coli UTI	Where to begin?  Hives, itching, dizziness, faint feeling, cloudy head, drugged-feeling, anxiety, depression, reflux, heavy/weak limbs, extreme fatigue.Ended 10-day course 2 days early, today.  Fought a 3-month urinary tract infection (post hysterectomy w/catheter) with five rounds of antibiotics before a culture was finally done and determined I had a drug resistant form of E Coli causing the UTI.  The side effects have been so horrible and the UTI pain still exists so I discontinued med.  Should know tomorrow results of recheck culture but expect it to be positive due to continued burning.  Doctor said he already alerted Infectious Disease dept immediately after first culture to prepare for possible IV treatments.  This drug was only a hit or miss antibiotic for this strain of E Coli bacteria.  (Note:  mfg is Sandoz, 875/125, 2 x daily)		F	48	8  days875/125	1/9/2013Email
4	Sinus Infection	been feeling unusually tired, sluggish, depressed and having mood swings. It didn't occur to me that it might be the drugs!

2	Cat bite	intermittent headache, sleepiness, minor joint pain and increased heart rate (temporary) lasting less than an hour.	I did take probiotics with every dose and experienced no stomach upset/issues but the sleepiness is a major drag.  Drink a LOT of water with this drug to dilute it.	F	51	10  days875 2X D	9/4/2012
4	Cellulitis	Diarrhea, then constipation!, muscle soreness, joint pain, anxiety, vaginal yeast infection, thrush in mouth	Make sure you take this with food, otherwise you will have diarrhea. HOWEVER, I had been taking a supposedly good probiotic, and was having diarrhea so bad I was pooping my pants. Thought it was the Augmentin, but when I stopped taking the probiotic, the diarrhea stopped. Was eating Chobani yogurt with every meal (add 4 Equal if you like sweeter yogurt), and then actually got constipated. Had not pooped in a solid week, and had to go to ER for enema. My muscles and joints are killing me. Thought it might be the infection, but lots of others are reporting this. This is the WORST antibiotic I have ever taken, but the Clavanate Potassium part is supposed to help resistant infections. Was in hospital on IV Vancomycin and Ampicillin (the IV form of Augmentin), and released on this oral form. Infection is better, but feel like I've been run over by a truck!

1	Sinus Infection	Joint pain, muscle soreness, stiff, aching joints	Took the generic form Sandoz.. Augmentin made me crawl to the doctor's office the day after Christmas. After 3 short days (3 pills), I am now recovering from the most pain I have ever felt on my life. I have been prescribed steroids, pain pills, and muscle relaxers (more meds) to treat the horrendous side effects from a med. What sense does that make?

Panic attacks, anxiety, depression by day 4 severe nausea and moderate  diarrhea.  It is now 3 days after I have finished the 5 day course and I am extremely dizzy, tired, anxious, still nauseous and have light diarrhea.  Hoping this subsides very soon as I cannot even think about work.	F	39	5  days875mg 2X D	7/24/2011
1	Bronchitis	Diarrhea, Nausea, Depression, Anxiety.	I have had to start taking an anti-depressant as I thought I was going to go crazy from the anxiety attacks I had after taking this for 7 days!!!  Thankfully my sister also has started taking this medication and is experiencing the same side effects.  And funny enough after 4 days of stopping Augmentin, my anxiety has gone.  Knowing that Zoloft takes 2 - 3 weeks to work, I am fully convinced that it was the Augmentin that made me feel the worst anxiety in my life.  I also had Diarrhea and no appetite whatsoever.  Never in my life have I suffered from such appetite suppression as I have on this medication.  I feel like these Augmentin poisened me and would say to anyone who is sensitive to medication and prone to anxiety - Beware!!!	F	35	7  days875mg/125m 2X D	7/24/2011
4	Sinus Infection	I've been on for 7 days. Depression, irritability, TAKE WITH FOOD. I puked the whole day when I attempted to delay eating with it. Pretty sure I have a yeast infection at this point	Otherwise, it's not THAT bad. It is after all an antibiotic and a large dose. There haven't been any side effects that aren't pretty normal. Suggestion: take probiotics with it.	F	25	10  days2000 2X D	3/30/2011Email
4	Bacterial pneumonia	Fourth day into the course, I started feeling wicked headaches. Today, day five, I had one of the worst migraines I remember having. My doctor thinks Augmentin is not to blame, but toxins of the dying bacteria in my lungs.I have taken Augmentin Duo Forte a few times; other than this time, I had no apparent side effects.	From the start of the course, my fever disappeared and my body temperature decreased from 40.1 degrees centegrade (104.2 F) to 37 degrees centegrade (98.6 F).I think this antibiotic should not be the first choice for minor infections, such as strep throat (as many users on this page), but it did wonders for my pneumonia.

1	Sinus Infection	Insomnia, very bad nausea, stomach pain and horrible acid reflux	I will never take this medication again.  I could have probably handled some nausea and stomach pain but the acid refux it gave me was horrible.  I thought my throat would errupt into flames.  I could not take it any longer then 7 days.

I don't even know if this is all normal or not, but I will give it my try to finish this ABX (4 more days to go) and HOPEFULLY all of my Infection related symptoms will cease, if not I fear I will end up with a more severe Infection and maybe hospitalized.

I am currently on day 5? of Augmentin, and I have 5 more days... UGHThis is the worst antibiotic EVER! I feel worse then I did before taking it. I am suffering right now as I type this... I don't know how I'm going to make it through another 5 days.I also ALREADY have anxiety/depression, and my medicine for those can't even battle off the anxiety that comes with this medicine. It's horrible!	F	20	10  days 2X D	1/30/2011
1	originally sinus infection, UTI	Immediate stomach ache several hours after taking, even with meals.  Later in course incessant hives/ithcing all over body, hands. Tingling lips	I have had this Abic several times and liked it as didn't get yeast infection.  Apparently it was responsible for an idiopathic hive response at the end of dosing (10 days) last spring that went on for weeks and only ended with steroid treatment.  Fexafenadiene couldn't stop it.  I thought I was reacting to contact with a snail enzyme preparation in the lab, but now with this last reaction and checking back on the occurence, I can link it to the augmentin.

1		Depression, sleepiness, anxiety.  The side effects did not hit me until day 5.  I thought I was just feeling down.  I continued the medicine, and side effects got worse.  I stopped after day 8 and it took about 4 days for my mood to return to a normal level.  I researched the drug.  It turns out that they are doing clinical trials on clavulanic acid, which is part of the drug.  Evidently it has had some antianxiety reactions on primates.  If a drug can produce antiaxiety reactions, it can produce anxiety reaction also.  Look up the side effects of antianxiety medicine.  I will never take any antibiotics that are coupled with clavulanic acid unless there are no other options.	Thanks to everyone who shared their experience.  I hope if you experience adverse side effects you will share also.  I am also curious the mg of augmentin administered in clinical trials?  I bet there is some threshold that the medical community is ignoring?  500 mg 2 times a day maybe?	M	34	10  days875 1X D	12/4/2010
1	sinus infection	After a few days on the medication, I began to feel extremely fatigued.  It was very difficult to move my arms and legs.  I stopped the medication, but the symptoms continued for months.  I'm glad I found this site because I began to think I was going crazy.  Spent thousands on tests and went to multiple doctors because doctors didn't believe it was the medicine.  It's been 5 months and I'm still not 100%.	Would stay away from this antibiotic.

5	chronic sinusitis	None	Augmentin XR1000 has been my only saving grace at keeping my chronic sinusitis under control. I at least can taste and smell and there is no discharge when using it as a prophylactic.Sinus surgery was unsuccessful as well as numerous other attempts such as allergy shots, Medications that were vaporized,etc. Thousands have been spent with this condition. My fear now is that the Augmentin is losing the sinusitis war as I have just had a tube put in my left ear. Extreme Congestion is also recurring. I will continue with the sinus irrigation and hopefully find a doctor that can help.	M	52	16  months1000 1X D	11/3/2010Email

1	Sinus Infection	Jaundice. Liver disease. Projectile vomiting. Extreme fatigue. Vertigo.	I was prescribed Augmentin in 1994 when I was 13. The first side effect that I remember was when I was kneeling on the floor getting a book out of my locker and I literally thought that my school was being turned upside down. Everything in my view suddenly flipped sideways, I became very dizzy, and then it flipped back again. I think that happened one more time. After I had finished taking all ten days of the meds, I became very nauseated and began projectile vomiting. This led quickly to jaundice, liver disease, dozens of blood tests, weekly+ doctor visits, 3 months in bed and out of school, and my weight dropping to around 78 pounds; and these are just the things I remember immediately about something that happened to me as a child, 16 years later. Not sure if this is a coincidence, but I didn't grow anymore after that. I would NEVER give this medication to a child or in any situation that did not already pose a threat to life or limb.

3	sinus and right ear infection	insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, itching, extreme blurred vision which I still have after being off for a week. My brain feels off. Memory loss and just feeling wacky.

3	Sinus infection	The works .... Hot sweats .. Severe headaches joint pain exhaustion	Hey just thought I'd share my experience was taking this drug for sinus infection like most people experienced severe headaches . Joint pain. Back pain .., dizziness. Loss of appetite etc etc . Within the second day I couldn't get out of bed due to feeling so yuck thought screw it I'm gonna go cook a massive meal ... Even though I struggled to eat ... I had fruit rice steak bread etc within 1 hour I was feeling so much better and was able to sleep ..... So I just started doing that procedure throughout the 5 day course of taking 2 tablets a day ... I ate ... Then ate ... Ate ate and ate ....... I made sure I was always eating good sized meals and I drank 3 litres of water a day and let me tell you it worked ..... I had still had side effects but they were no were near as powerful from the first couple days ........ At times I would literally have to force the food down my mouth with alot of water and it worked good ....... You won't feel like eating at all but .. Force at least 3 meals a day not snacks but proper portioned meals .,... And add all you can ... Eggs steak bread vegetables fruit and WATER ... Hope that helps	M	23	5  days 2X D	9/6/2010
3	post op infection	Nausea, anorexia, dehydration, severe indigestion, bloating, abdominal pains, severe joint pains.	I was prescribed augmentin 15 days post op as I collapsed with rigors. I took it religiously but spent virtually all day in bed for a week with nausea and little energy due to not eating or drinking. The joint pains started on the 2nd day. At first I thought they were due to a bacteraemia. They became so severe that I could barely walk. My doctor prescribed dihydrocodeine. I finished the Augmentin 2 days ago and my joints are so much better.	F	50	7  days625mg 3X D	8/16/2010
1	Chronic sinusitis	diarrhea (even after taking with food); stomach pain; nausea; joint/tendon pain in legs, foot, and elbow; constant fatigue; insomnia; yeast infections that began after 3 days and continued for the entire 6 wks plus another 3 after I finished the course (OBGYN prescribed Diflucan during the 6wk course to treat and prevent yeast infections, but it had no effect at all)	I will NEVER EVER take this medication again. I had been on Keflex before for a similar problem and thought that was horrible, so the doctor substituted Augmentin. 9 weeks of constant yeast infections and tendon pain are more than I intend to endure again. The tendon pain is still around 5 months after finishing the dosage. They sent me to a physical therapist for the tendon pain, which they were unable to diagnosis, but to no avail. I blame the Augmentin because I had not pain or previous injuries to the affected tendons before taking the drug. The side effects were way worse than my original sinus infection symptoms. As someone previous said, I would rather DIE than take this drug again.	F	30	6  weeks500mg 2X D	8/16/2010
1	severe ear infection	Horrible joint and muscle pain, pouring with sweat, very blurred eyesight, constant breathlessness, exhaustion, can hardly walk. Feel terrible. The infection has got worse, so all this agony is for nothing. Am, stopping the Augmetin and just hope that these effects won't last too long, but am afraid they may, as had previously been poisoned by a fluyoroquinolone antibiotic.	Will never take it again. I'd rather die.	F	63	4  days62.5mg 2X D	8/12/2010
3	infection,swollen throat	Horrible side effects!I was prescribed this after having been sick for 2 months with severe sore throat,severe cough,fever,congested chest,ear infection,etc.I was given azithromax first,which caused numb feet/hands after first day,was switched to Augmentin,which had crazy side effects.I ate yogurt and probiotics every day,and ate it with a meal,but still had horrible headaches,burning skin,sensitivity to sun,looser stools,what feels like lymph swelling(skin still tender 2 WEEKS after being off it),body aching(and still does),painful itch/burn around girly parts and when having bm.Also,my heart pounded while on this stuff,had heartburn all the way into throat,stomach pain,pain wrapping all the way from abdomen around to back,really unpleasant.Not fun,this medication seems to have cured what I had in some ways,but caused other problems that I am still having.My skin still burns, hurts and feels tender,and I really hope that goes away.	Only take this if you have a REALLY tough stomach,and are desperate to get rid of an infection-be really good about probiotics daily,they help with stomach side effects.I would never give this to a child.

3	2 Teeth removed	Hives, very bad headaches, thrush on my tounge, and emotional	Only on my 4th day and I cant take it! I had two teeth pulled and a sinus closure. This stuff is really strong. Not having the bathroom issues so I guess thats good. I have never experienced headaches like this before and its 20 min after I take the pill (Its NOT from the procedure I had otherwise it would be constant)	F	26	12  days325 2X D	7/19/2010Email
1	UTI	extreme diarrhea, nausea, dehydration; developed C.Diff infection; nearly died.	Easily THE worst antibiotic I've ever taken; it nearly killed me.  I was put on it after a course of Cipro didn't clear up the UTI I'd been fighting for nearly 2 weeks.  Within days, I was vomiting, blacking out, serious runny diarrhea, even WITH food.  I was rushed to the hospital after 5 days on the medication and was admitted due to extreme dehydration and non-stop diarrhea.  I developed C.Diff (a life-threatening infection of the colon due to the good bacteria in the digestive tract either dead or injured by excessive doses of antibiotics; often leads to septic shock) and came VERY close to dying before the doctors were able to turn everything around.  Truly one of the scariest medications I've ever taken.	F	46	10  days850 mg 2X D	7/13/2010Email
1	Sinus/upper respiratory infection	itching, rash, bloating, nausea, face swelling, jaundice, pain in upper abdomen, weight loss, loss of appetite	These symptoms appearing within a day or two of the end of the course of Augmentin - horrible itching, feel tired all the time due to lack of sleep, yellow skin and sclera, bloating, nausea... the list goes on and on. The symptoms do not ease over time. Now it appears there is liver damage due to this antibiotic. Testing starts today to determine the damage. Augmentin should be banned from use.

4	Dog Bite	At close to the fourth dose (day two of a seven day cycle) I experienced ten hours of severe diarrhea, followed by gas.  The gas has continued and I am now on day five.  I think either I got used to the medication or the constant eating of Nancy's yogurt and added probiotics has helped.	This drug was given to me as a precaution against infection.  As I have not had evidence of infection, my wound was either cleaned very well or the Augmentin worked.  If necessary I will take this drug again.	F	32	7  days875 2X D	3/24/2010Email
1	Sinus Infection	My 16 YO daughter was prescribed this med for 10 days but we stopped after 7.  Her cramps were so bad one day she was hunched over in pain and laid down on the floor at a school function. I had her eat food with the meds thinking it would cut down on the side effects but no success. Today is the 5th day after she stopped taking this medication and she is still getting severe abdominal cramps, lightheadness and fatigue.  I called the MD and he said to start her on probiotics, to date no improvement.  I am planning on taking her in tomorrow.  My daughter is normally very active and now in her spare time all she wants to do is sleep.  Do not allow this med to be administered to your child.		F	16	10  days875mg125mg 2X D	3/24/2010Email
2	sinusitis	two yeast infections, depression and anxiety	I took one 10 day course and it only somewhat helped my symptoms so I had to take a second 10 day course.	F	25	20  days 2X D	3/14/2010
4	beginning stages of pneumonia	Explosive diarrhea on the second day (did not take with enough food). Occasional upper abdominal pain that would subside after lying down. Some anxiety starting around day 7-8. Fatigue. Slight nausea.	Took a few days to clear up my infection, but after about day 5, I stopped coughing and spitting up yellow mucous. I just finished my 10th day, and am no longer coughing. The positives definitely outweighed the negatives for me. If you are experiencing stomach pain, diarrhea, or nausea, I suggest taking your antibiotic with a LARGE meal (I usually just heated up a lean cuisine). Also, it helped with I took the antibiotic at the BEGINNING of the meal, not the end. This way, the antibiotic gets absorbed at the same time as your stomach is digesting food, so you stomach will feel the effects from absorption less.	F	21	 875/125 1X D	3/5/2010History
2	bacterial infection	You are supposed to take this with food, otherwise the side effect is diarrhea.  Even taken with food, I had so much gas and frequent bowel movements.  It wasn't diarrhea, but stool was very loose.  But the gas was the worst part.  I was passing gas for hours after taking the medication, and because it's to be taken twice a day, it felt like the whole day.  It was very embarassing at work as I was constantly leaving my desk.	Medicine works.  but the side effect is very harsh considering the minor infection it cures.	M	29	10  days875-125 2X D	2/22/2010

3	sinus and upper resp infection	Fatigue/exhaustion, back and leg pain, stiff joints, foggy head, feeling of "going to pass out", loss of appetite, ringing in ears, stomach discomfort, GERD aggravation, insomnia, anxiety and agitation.  Runny nose, cough and vaginal discharge related to increased secretion production. Also, feeling of inability to get warm.  I ALWAYS take probiotics and use kefir which keeps diarrhea under control. Take these an hour before or 2 after ANY antibiotic for best results.  Am on day 7 of 10 day course.	This is nasty stuff.  My infection did clear thus far, however, the side effects are difficult to deal with.  I have Fibromyalgia and this med triggered a horrible flair up.  Many of my symptoms are "fibro like" and it is difficult to differentiate between fibro and side effects except side effects are more intense then a normal fibro flair.  FIBRO PATIENTS BEWARE!

1	oral surgery/extraction & bone graf	I experienced the usual diarrhea that comes when on an antibiotic, feeling very tired, which I thought at first was from the Darvacet pain medication, but after discontinuing the pain meds I still remained very lethargic. It wasn't until the 6th day when I woke up in the middle of the night with excruciating pain in my knee joints, wrist and shoulders, also my throat felt sore. The pain in my knees was so intense that I could barely walk, which scared me. I have taken this medication before and never had any problems.  But after talking to my doctor she said that I have developed a hypersensitivity to the drug and that in some cases a person could have taken this in the past and than all of the sudden have this type of reaction to the medication.  So I discontinued the Augmentin,and because the joint pain was so severe, my doctor put me on Oxycotin pain meds. I was told that the joint pain should subside within a of couple weeks, I'm hoping for sooner!!I		F	42	6  days	12/10/2009
4	Sinusitis, Acute URTI	severe muscle weakness in arms, anxiety, sweats,mild stomach pain and mild acid reflux	2000 mg twice daily. The size of the dose scares me, but the clinical picture is that of pneumococcal infection, so I'd rather take this than have an URTI spread to my lungs.I'm taking a good probiotic so have not experienced any intestinal discomfort.It's only been prescribed for 5 days so I hope and pray that I won't experience severe side-effects.The sinus pains and headaches I had had for three days cleared up about 8 hours after taking the first dosage.

I usually work out 6 days a week, but I've been on the sidelines ever since I started.	M	45	4  days	11/1/2009
5	Severe Sinus Infection	No major side effects...the first few day I was a little tired and down. Wouldn't call it depression just fatigued.  I'm now on 8 day of 10 day dose...2000 mg twice a day.  I think that me eating a full non greasy meal helped with not getting loose bowels. I have a little lower back pain at the moment...not sure if it's from new shoes from a pre-existing condition. All in all I'm am satisfied with my doctors decision to put me on this medication being that I am hard to treat and very sensitive to alot of Rx drugs. I have two days left on this medication...I'll keep you posted if anything changes.  The best to all!		F	46	8  days	10/24/2009
2	Suspected Sinus Infection	Lightheaded, burning tingling sensation in my face and hands, some nausea (mainly in the AM and evening). haven't had the runs yet.	Hope it all gets better for my (and our) sake.	M	42	4  days	10/22/2009
1	Tonsilitis	All over body rash and swelling after a few days of taking medication.  This was back in 1988-1989 and I was a senior in h.s.  My doctor diagnosed my rash as being measals and advised me to finish the antibiotic.  It wasn't until a year later when I came down with tonsilitis again and was prescribed the same medication that I realized I was allergic to amoxicilin.  At age 25 I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't wonder if this allergic reaction with continued use caused my system to backfire.My theory on medications now is, God never intended it to go inside of our bodies.  It is foreign and the varied side effects we suffer through with all RX drugs is our body's way of telling us not to do it.		F	38	14  days	10/21/2009Email
3	Perectal abscess	Diarhea, nausea, fatigue, confusion, depression, high anxiety	I have never had any medical history of depression or the like, but this stuff makes me feel like I'm going crazy. I'm unable to function in public and suffer from constant stomach/intestinal pain. The pharmacist said to take it with food, but because of the drug I have no appetite. I will never take this awful drug again unless I have no other choice. It destroys your quality of life to such a point that I'd rather take a weaker med and be sick longer.	M	32	7  days	10/13/2009
1	sinus infection	tired, no labido,  severe diarreaha,  stomach cramps, spotting and yeast infection	Stopped taking it after 6 days because I started to  experience severe diareaha. On the fourth day I got a yeast infection.  I'll never take this medicine again.	F	58	6  days	9/16/2009
3	Severe ear and sinus infection	Yeast infection after 7days on 10 day regime	I always took this with a hearty meal i.e. carbs and fat, so no upset stomach. The yeast infection started on day 6/7 and i got a cream to treat it. Earache went away after day 2. Headach went away after first pill. I still have congestion but on another medication to treat it. Would give 3.5 based on 5 point scale.	F	32	10  days	8/21/2009
4	Ear infection	Stomach cramps; constipation; heartburn	Two times per day regimen - felt like it started working on day 3, so ear feels much better.  Stomach cramps can be severe and woke me.  Feel like have to have bm, but no success.  Will begin probiotics.	M	32	7  days	7/30/2009

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.	F	35	4  weeks15 MG 1X D	8/29/2010Email
5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works.

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.

3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR.

5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it.

5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
4	BIPOLAR 2	Severe Hiccups, lasted for 3 days.  Nausea, severe burping, felt like I was going to throw up, lasted for a week.  Slight mania, abbreviated sleep cycles, still having these.  I feel the side effects are worth it because of how well it keeps me from short cycling, which causes way more problems in my life than a little Nausea		M	36	8  weeks15 MG 1X D	6/2/2010
2	Bi-Polar	Lethargic, Weight Gain and Depression has gotten worse.  I want to be taken off this medication.  Having indecisiveness (more than usual) and my OCD has increased.  Not seeing many benefits after being on Abilify for 2 months.  Feeling sadness daily and lack of energy.  Seems to slow me down to a sad halt.		F	53	2  months10MG 1X D	5/29/2010
2	bipolar 2	sleepiness or death tired during the afternoon even after 9 months of taking this med also i'm waking up in the middle of the night; also i decided because of the drowsiness i would go off of this cold turkey- bad decision because he had sweats, nausea and severe headache.....	the doctor wants me to stay on this but the daytime drowsiness is ruining my life and the nighttime waking is too much	F	50	9  months2mg 1X D	5/29/2010
4	bipolar	very beginning days i had a bizarre hyperactive yet peaceful at the same time cleaning mode (well the house needed it since i had been depressed before i flipped into hypo/ mania) mild restless legs, waking up middle night every other night it seems	it seems to be calming me down somewhat from my up following a depression episode...i may need to incr to 7 or 10mg  as i still am having repetitive thoughts / constant urges to shop but has lessend drastically than before beginning taking it.  i have been able to focus somewhat more than before began this drug....was in thoughts randomly shooting off in 50 thousand directions so i have actually lost a little weight 7 pounds being able to focus and be consistent on walking/jog 4 times a week, which pleasantly for me seems opposite to the majority of other posters here...
