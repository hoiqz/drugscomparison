2	Granuloma Annulare	Stomach ache which would send me back to bed for an hour each morning, frequent (5+ times per day) loose stools, severe depression.	Thought this might be helpful with Granuloma Annulare that I had had for over 30 years, but I couldn't deal with the side effects which continued even after lowering dose. I am very sensitive to a lot of medicines, so others may not have such a bad experience.	F	52	5  days400 mg 3X D	7/17/2012
4	Poor Blood Flow	None	This product was prescribed to me due to the poor blood flow to my hands and feet, making them feel like ice most of the time. At the same time, the poor blood flow was causing my serious knee injury to heal rather slowly. After taking this medication for the past 9 months 3 times a day, I am very impressed. I don't get cold as easily and the colder weather doesn't attack my joints with as much force as it once did. Very good product!	F	21	9  months	10/16/2008
