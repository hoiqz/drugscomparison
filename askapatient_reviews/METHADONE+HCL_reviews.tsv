3	Opiate addiction	constipation, sweats, massive weight gain like Psych drug gain. people hardy recognize me. Dental issues, sweet tooth that cannot be fought of no matter what, another demon to conquer. Roids due to weight owch, bad hygiene, diet, motivation lacking.	Short term brilliant problem is yearsssssss later its my legal addiction. My body has gone to the dogs, I am tied to clinics, broke as a badger, there has to be a better solution? in 2012. If i had my time again i wouldn't have gone on it, stayed clear but in saying that where would i be today?. It really is a catch 22 situation , but i believe this medication only keeps you stuck, legally and does not excately turn lives around albeit your not in a bad mess as before, get my drift??? try stay clean imho without no drugs. I also belive this is the Gubment way of keeping tabs on you.	M	44	8  years20 1X D	10/6/2012Email
2	12 year heroin addiction	Methadone is the bain of my life I carnt function without it so its as good as being on street drugs except the people who give u it wont be arrested I csuppose better than spending the full day trying to get enough money to score for me it seems the same as b4 but with out the criminal activity im not saying its no good  I would just weigh up the pros and vons before you allow a doctor to start you because there are other options available okey dokey!

4	dilaudid addiction	Sweating bad!, weight gain maybe 5-10 pounds, Munchies alot, sugar cravings, nodding several times a day (kind of like a roller coster i go up then down then up then down ect.), Penis won't get hard (and if it does it's a mission to get it to stay up. and if it does stay up i won't ejaculate even after hours of intercourse), sever acne, horrible constipation!! (i can bearly ever piss or shit)(and when i do i have to push sooo hard)	I started taking methadon because that was the only option left for me. I went to rehabs, programs, NA, AA, i tried everything and i came to the conclusion if i was going to get off the pills i would have to go on methadone. I've been on it for 3-4 weeks now and honestly even after all the side effects i am very glad i discovered it. It saved my life as far as im concerened. it totally stoppped my cravings (wich i am really surprised cause that's all i would think about before i started the methadone. I am just scared i will never get off it. It's like im scared to be off it. i know it too soon to think about getting off but it's like i dont want to. i like it alot. but i dont really understand it cause i nod off and on all day. it fucks me up olmost worse then the pills??? (wtf) but i find myself not stealing or robbing people to get money for pills. i am in a safe enviorment. Iam not shooting up anymore (IVing).(injecting) So overall if you cant get clean on your own and are thinking about methadone, if you are ready to take a chance on being a lifer, go for it! im glad i did!!

3	Opiate addiction	Weight gain, loss of energy and motivation, dental problems, excessive sweating, dependence, sleepiness (I have to nap during the day.) Sugar cravings, poor hygiene, zombie-like, fuzzy thinking, poor short-term memory. Comments: with all these side effects you are probably wondering why I rated this med a 3. Due to the fact that I suffer from bipolar, ocd, GAD with panic attacks, I must say I've had to weigh out the benefits and which were the lesser evils of the two. My cravings are 100% gone for 6 years so that has been a relief. Ill be honest, if I can go back in time I would not have started methadone. I am completely dependent on it and am extremely scared of coming off. Liquid handcuffs is right. I am a 30 year old educated woman and sadly on my  way to what we here in the clinics call a "lifer." It has taken the sharp edges off my depression and gives me a peaceful feeling but if I was being honest with myself the peaceful feeling is me being high. My days are in a haze. I have barely         any motivation to even get my behind out of bed. I wish I was strong enough to just get off. My advice, Don't get on in the first place, the methadone withdrawals are a lot worse than anything you're scared of getting off now.		F	30	6  years40 mgs	7/16/2012Email
2	Heroin addiction	Extreme sleepiness, nodding out when in any sitting position for more than a few mins (reading, smoking, etc.), body jerks when sleeping, nausea, sweating, tremendous weight gain (20+ lbs in 3 months!!!!!), crave sugars, no motivation, no sex drive, headaches, severe constipation, laziness	I was on 75mg at my highest and started tapering after 2 months. i can't wait to get off this HORRIBLE drug. Another s***** thing is you HAVE to taper SLOWLY or else you'll have withdrawals 100xs worse than coming off heroin cold turkey.	F	30	5  months60mg 1X D	7/15/2012

3	Severe drug addiction to opiates	Severe lethargy..horrible mind blowing constipation. Sever weight gain(50lbs).Zero sex drive. At it saved my life then it tried to steal my soul! I am done to 53 mgs from 115. Not so terribly hard, but it has taken me six months to get here. Have lost 20 pounds and feel great! Continuing to come down slowly. Plan to come off in 5 months!!		F	39	4  years115	2/11/2012Email
3	pain/addiction	I have constipation, severely tired, sleep all the time, at first couldnt eat and now eating everything with sugar, no motivation, depressed. Numbness and tingling in hands. Hard to concentrate. NO SEX DRIVE. I feel that this is a medicine created by the government to control people who have addictions with no where else to go. You will be made into a zombie after taking this for more than a month or two.	I got on this in hopes to get away from taking pills. At first I was taking pills as prescribed by my DR and then I got into a relationship with a guy who was addicted to oxy and I started to take what he took and I became addicted. After we broke up, I had no connections and started to withdraw but couldn't handle it. So I ended up at the methadone clinic. I dont fit in there. I should have just beared it and quit cold turkey. I can say it has helped me get over having to take pills all day. Im starting to detox and have been even more tired but I have a feeling its going to get a lot worse.	F	26	6  months55mg 1X D	1/15/2012
4	heroin addiction	Sometimes constipation,depending what I eat, profuse sweating like clockwork, between 2-3pm. Finger numbness, just one finger, totally turns dead! Just the end of it. Couldn't sleep at first. Took about 3 weeks to get used to being really high from it 30-40mg. Should of stayed at 30mg. But the addict mentality wants more. Been basically clean, help my life out 100%. Was jobless,no car, and about to evicted! Got on the methadone program, within a week I got a job, car,money, and caught up with rent! I did a 180 degree turn around. That's me ,all or nothing.....		M	44	8  years100mg	12/29/2011

3	pain management	excessive sleep, swelling, nausea, hiccups, itchy body	Plan on calling the pdoc on Tuesday. Can't handle waking in the middle of the night due to extreme itchiness all over body and to the point of being sick. Since I started taking the meds on Aug 25th; I have hiccups at least 3-4 times a day. And the swelling of my ankles, feet, legs - I just look awful and it hurts to wear shoes. I noticed the other day I am starting to get a bit of a rash here and there too.  I just can't handle this med anymore.  Started taking it because the pdoc says it would be cheaper for me to take since I have no insurance currently - compared to my regular medication which would have cost way too much.

5	iv user of opiates	severe constipation, sweats, craving sweets	I will say methadone has played a big part in me changing my life but i have to go to a clinic everyday b/c of the call-backs procedure. I have a fantastic job that requires me to travel some and attend very important meetings and the clinic i attend will not excuse me but 1-2 times and it's just a mess then. I am ready to detox due to this clinics rules, which i understand they do have, but when a person does right they should have a little repect and consideration for them and this clinic doesn't. If i file a greivance on them it just goes to the medical director of the clinic and nothing gets done! Very tired of the ball-n-chain with them and my take-homes!!	F	36	10  years108mgs 1X D	7/25/2011Email
5	pain management	Drowsiness, sweat easily	When I first started taking this stuff it really was uncomfortable. There were no nasty side effects other than feeling like I was in the fog. The best part however is that I have not had to increase my dosage and in fact am way down, only 10mg twice daily. In addition to that my pain is controlled quite nicely. It no longer makes me tired it has never made me loopy like most narcotics. All in all this stuff is much cheaper and way more reliable than the usual narcotic analgesics. I have tried, vicodin all stregths, oxycodone, morphine, dilauded and on and on. All of which worked OK but made me loopy and needed more rather quicly, like weeks. Anyone with chronic pain should at least consider this if you are to be on anything long term. The only real big pitfall is it is very addictive physically and getting off it is much more difficult than other opiate based narcotics. For me it has been a real blessing.

2		Makes me feel AWFUL	I was prescribed this stuff to help deal with my horrific musculoskeletal injuries caused to me by the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin (look THAT drug up if you want to read nightmarish stories!)  While it does help with some of my pain, I CANNOT stay conscious on this stuff and it makes me feel mentally retarded.  I can't focus or concentrate my mind and I fade in and out of consciousness for up to 12 hours at a time, all the while having odd hallucinatory "dreams."  Despite the fact I seem to sleep constantly on this stuff, I'm still completely exhausted once it wears off so evidently the "sleep" I get while on methadone is not of good quality.  I finally started cutting my 10mg pills into EIGHTHS which seems to help reduce the mental side effects, but the painkilling effectiveness is significantly reduced as well, obviously.  Often I choose to just endure my pain rather than have this stuff blast my cognitive function.  Lastly, I'm very concerned with what I'm reading here about tooth decay.  Not cool!  Why isn't that on the warning label?	M	31	 1.25 1X D	5/13/2011Email
4	Opiate Addiction	CONSTIPATION. Nothing would work, not even the "wet and wild" I take 4 SENA every night and after I drink my Red Bull in the morning, it's crap city. Also, It has negetively affected my ability to argue or keep from being manuplited.	It's worked great, for it's intended purpose but I'll have to take it for the rest of my life. I am honest with myself and know that if I got of the m-done, I would be rite back into pills	M	42	7  years100 1X D	3/31/2011Email
4	Opiate addiction	Constipation, ZERO sex drive, bad cravings for sugar, sweating, EXCESSIVE weight gain (between methadone & anti-depressants I'm having weight loss surgery in approx 6 wks), tooth problems (need top dentures since going onMethadone)	Methadone does help with drug cravings a LOT!! I went to one of the best treatment programs (addiction to Oxycontin) in the country & still relapsed after 10 months. I've been clean for 3 years on Methadone. I wish the clinic had been more honest about side effects, withdrawal & how hard it is & how long it takes to wean off Methadone (2 years from my dose).	F	44	3  years120 mg 1X D	3/17/2011EmailHistory
4	Fibro, severe spinal pain, esp neck	Tired, fall asleep watching tv or reading. Weight gain, despite hardly eating. Used to have great memory. Now I can't recall the name of anything.	I took Oxycontin which worked great for two years, then it stopped working. Methadone works okay for pain, but I'd feel better if my doctor would increase the dosage. Not only will he not do that, but he wants to cut me down, for no reason at all. I've been compliant, take drug tests whenever he wants me to. I see him once a month, and I feel like I'm sitting in the Principal's office. I have to always defend my pain and beg him not to cut me off.I took my first narcotic four years ago. Never smoked or did drugs, and just had the occasional glass of wine. Still, he's scared of the DEA. He doesn't even deny it. I've gone to two pain clinics, and they wanted me to stop taking pain medication. I'm living a nightmare. My pain is off the charts. I collect disability for my pain. Believe me, getting SSDI is not easy. The drug addicts are making it so hard for people who have REAL chronic pain. Without my pain meds, I'd probably jump off a roof. The doctors believe that I have pain, but say that people shouldn't be on narcotics long term. I'm like, "What happens to the pain if I stop the meds?"	F	53	1  years30  mg 3X D	3/10/2011Email
5	Heroin Addiction	Weight Gain, sweating more frequently,	Without methadone, I dont know where I would be today. Yes, there are side affects but I would take some extra weight and sweating a bit more the usual anyday over withdrawal symptoms, being a drug addict, ect. Methadone has played a HUGE part in me getting my life back together, the MAIN reason it helped me was becuase in my drug addiction it wasnt so much about chasing the high anymore, but to feel OKAY and not be "bogue", which i would NEVER put myself through again! So when I started methadone, i was no longer putting my life in danger, had risk of getting diseases, or dying from a overdose, on heroin i couldnt fuction normally, now i can everything any normal person does.such as have my own place, car, moneyy, pay my bills, have food to eat..on herion i lived in a hotel, took the bus and was broke and severely depressed. Methadone if taking seriously, meaning your truely want to fix your life and get off drugs, can help you tremendously,and it everyone is different, but if you find yourslef there more then a year or two, you need to ask yourslef some serious questions..

3	pain management	constipation is my main problem. Best laxative for me is propylene glycol. it's sold over the counter by a brand name or you can get a script from a doctor for a larger and cheaper supply	don't use it! stay with other opiates if at all possible.	M	62	40  years45mg. 1X D	10/15/2010
5	opiate and xanax addiction	some constipation and some upper gastro intestinal issues from craving sweets and thats it.	I was up to 400 mg of oxycodone and 4 or 5 xanax bars per day. I was able to stop using the oxy's right away and the xanax the 3rd day. For me the key is the feeling of wellness and energy  that i get from the methadone. I know that i can make it thru the day. I have been a drug abuser for over 30 yrs and have tried every treatment program there is. Methadone is by far the best one for me. I am so glad that i found the clinic that i go to. I need the professional and structured and caring assistance they give.	M	59	90  days45 MG 1X D	10/8/2010

1	Heroin addiction	Massive sweating, constipation, weight gain, extreme tiredness.	I'm in the middle of my detox and wouldn't wish it on anyone. @ 18mg I ended up in the E.R.,(1st time in YEARS)from w/drawals. I hate when people say, it's all in your head. Methadone is the most individual drug out there. Some people have no problem detoxing and others would rather blow their head off. Some can go down 5mg a week and some, 1mg a month. Again, all individual. With any opiate but Methadome/Suboxone, go cold turkey. Trust me, it's the easiest. I'm lucky to get 3hrs of sleep night. Plus, I still can't go to the bathroom, and I tried everything. It's the last 30mg that are a bitch. Anyone higher than that and you don't have any idea what people like me/us are talking about.	M	34	4  years3 gram/day 1X D	7/15/2010
3	MMT	Gained weight, sweat alot, no sex drive.	I used to get high on methadone occasionally and loved the nods it gave me. So when I got into a bad oxycontin addiciton I had been through oxy withdrawal before and thought no way not again. Well since I used to love methadone and could easily get into a clinic I chose this route. Was doing 560 mg of oxycontin a day at the time and the first day they gave me 30mg of that ass nasty red cherry liquid. I went up to 170mg in 6 months and stayed there for another 2.5 years. Well last October I started a slow 5mg per week taper. I got down to 5mg by the end of April and jumped off at 5mg. It's been really rough. Very tired, depressed, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, the poops, kicking and twisting in bed, cannot adjust my temperature. It's not as intense of a withdrawal as oxy but it's so much longer that I now dispise this and any opiate. For this is the end of the opiate trail for me. Oxy 4 day withdrawal of hell. Methadone 30+ days of slow agony, Suboxone 30+ days of slower agony. They all suck arse to come off of. Please don't start this drug unless your life depends on it and if you have no tolerance and take more than 5mg you'll be sick quick. 40mg or more and you will be dead possibly. Not for the weak willed.	M	42	3.5  years170mg 1X D	5/27/2010

1	unknown	DEATH	My friend accidently overdosed on this drug because she drank alcohol. If you drink alcohol I don't advise you to take this medicine... this pill can be very dangerous. I know dumb people that take it for "fun" well... you will die from it. Like all medication if you are not prescribed to it you should not take it! common sense is not so common.	F	22	1  days	6/19/2009
5	Chronic Pain and Heroin Addiction	Extreme sweating is the worst, and most annoying side effect. Constipation, and in the beginning of treatment extreme drowsiness.	While I began using opiates as a needed prescription for chronic pain due to a back injury and from effects of having Lupus, I quickly began abusing the drugs for the euphoric effects and for rectreational use. What started as a 10-15mg of Hydro a day habit quickly escalated to approximatly 400mg of Oxycodone, 150mg of Morphine, and as much heroin as I could get my hands on in any given day. At the end I couldn't even feel the euphoric effects anymore, I had to take the drugs just to keep myself out of withdrawl and so I could function and get out of bed. Methadone has SAVED my life. I could care less if some people think it's trading one addiction for another. Since I no longer have to spend my entire day focused on how and when I'm going to get my drugs, I don't have to do anything illegal, I don't have to lie, I'd say I'm a success, and I am so greatful to have my life back.

4	Failed back surgery L2+3..2003	as far as side effects I can Honestly say I must be one of them rare people . I dont get tired (never did even from beginning with narcs) and I never had constipation til about 2-3months ago. I feel that happened due to my diet. Methadone does make you crave extreme high doses of sugar. I take this drug after i tried kadian, morphine, Oxycontin and percocet. It was honestly the best move i ever made and wish I had done it sooner . It does effect your teeth over long term use as it has started to effect mine . And although it hasnt happened to me it can effct bone marrow also over long term use.	I have been on Narcotics for almost 6 years now and find methadone has worked the ebst for me pain wise . My Husbands friend who was a pharmacist told him to tell me to ask my Dr about it . I refused to for a year. I wish I had back then. I been taking it now since 2006. I use 60mg of methadone per day with 90mg of Roxicone per day for breah through pain.ALL Narcotics are going to have some side effects so there isnt any perfect drug out there and everyone reacts different. If I could and at times I do, I recommend asking for this drug for pain. If you have been in pain for a long time and hve a real understanding Pain physician you shouldnt have any problems getting it . I know thats also easier said than done . DO NOT SUFFER!! if your dr isnt helping you .. MOVE ON!!	F	39	3  years	2/9/2009Email
5	failed lower back surgery.	Long story short,Lifting injury. Paramedic 25 yrs. five back surgeries, L5-S1. After surgery developed a CHF leak which required 4 more operations to stop. Also left me with an arachnoid membrane problem. This left me with Severe pain in the lumbar back and the right leg, from the hip to the knee.	After trying all the other meds, I was put on Methadone 10.mg twice a day. This med works well but after 4 yrs I have the severe pain in my right leg again, I wake up unable to get out of bed without the help of my wife.	M	63	4  days	2/3/2009
4	failed lower back surgery	I have to be extremely vigilant when it comes to taking a daily stool softener and drinking enough water to be sure that it works. I have had an impacted bowel in the past due directly to my daily use of opiates and getting that problem resolved was one of the most painful, humiliating experiences of my life, so BE CAREFUL. Also, I have gained about 35 POUNDS!!! I notice a lot of people are having this problem--	I had the surgery that ruined my back in 1999 and, as I'm sure many others on this board have experienced, I hit a brick wall with regard to doctors who seemed to have ANY interest in helping me in any appreciable way with my pain. The surgeon who botched the job referred me to a pain specialist who, after seven years, had advanced in his trust and care enough to give me one percocet every 8 hours. He had me sold on medtronic and a spinal cord stimulator, until I found out from the surgeon (my pain specialist said nothing) that the procedure would require a laminotomy, similar in action but not as radical as the laminectomy that ruined me. Needless to say, I walked out of the office and never looked back. Finally, I met a pain specialist who prescribed me 20mg of methadone, 3x/day, w/2mg of dilaudid every 6-8hrs as needed for breakthrough pain. My life is my own again when I truly thought that at the age of 42 my life as an active adult was, for all intents and purposes, over. I write	M	42	7  months	12/22/2008
3	i took methadone for heroin add.	sweats, extreme sleepiness at 3 hours, nausea,	its all in your mind. i went down 70 mg in 35 days and had almost no side effects.	M	24	1  days	12/5/2008
3	Ruptured L3 disc, failed fusion	My MD used the methadone as a substitute for increasing levels of Oxycontin, which did not alleviate the pain.  Also on Fentanyl patch, Robaxin & Neurontin.  The biggest issue I have is daytime sedation.  Problems w/ sleep due to pain but helped some with Therapedic-like foam mattress, so often fall asleep when I finally sat down.  Falling asleep driving also an issue when on 80mg/day. Next biggest issueis definitely word loss; always been a bright person (hi IQ, skipped 2 grades in school, Master's degree, scored in top 11% on LSAT), but now I feel like a blithering idiot....constant mental groping for words, I end up saying "you know, the THING that sweeps dirt off the floor".  I always assumed it was due to the combination of narcotics on board and level of mental alertness, but now not sure... I'm better after a reduction to 60 mgs/day in terms of mental side effects, but have more breakthrough pain.	Be careful where you keep it.  I stupidly left it on a bathroom counter with my other meds in Boston when I went to see my daughter at college. 26 0f 28 pills were missing when we came back to the room one day and the only other person shown to have used the keycard was the maid, who adamantly denied taking my drugs. Police report filed etc.  My MD sent me to local ER, but that MD would not replace them because he said he had no authority to write for chronic use drugs when , as an ER doc, he was viewed as having to deal only with acute injuries/illnesses.  So, the upshot is, even though they are routine to you, they can be tempting to others.	F	49	2  years	11/26/2008Email
1		dizzy itchy felt high energy felt sick	i don't know how u can give this to a herione addicted when  u still can feel high off this methadone  unreal doctor's need to get with it there are non narcotics that work just as good for pain ask ur doctor's about them	M		3  days	9/16/2008
5	chronic back pain	none	Best medication for moderate to severe chronic back pain.  I have tried everything, morphine, Kadian etc.  No high if you are not Niave.  I take 10 mg twice a day,  morning and late afternoon.  It has changed my life.  It works best when taken with a muscle relaxer.  I take 350mg of generic soma, and after tolerance to that builds up I rotate to flexeril.  Works best with the Soma.  This is a great combination for people with no insurance, all three of these drugs are cheap.  The problem is finding a doctor that will prescribe it.	M	44	3  months	7/7/2008
4	Opiate addiction/pain	Constipation, sweating, weight gain other minor problems.	I had severe knee injury when I was 14 tore everything, broke my growth plate and lower leg in 2 places.  Anyway I started out on regular old vic's, then norco for the about 2 yrs after. Then I was ok for awhile with all the extensive physical therapy I did 4 times a week 4 hrs day.  Then when I hit about 20 I started having pain again, Im an avid golfer and  good also but I was pretty sure the golf had caused some sort of injury, so I went in got some norco took it and it worked for about month.  At that point I didnt have insurance, started with the oxycontin big mistake.  It took away my pain, and my life, pretty much made into a zombie. I got up to 3 80's a day along with other drugs.I wanted off so I did my research found methadone was used treat opiate addicts. I started40mg 2yrs later was at 140mg sometimes more to get that little high. Then i started to wean myself down to 80mg, finally got insurance found a doctor to help me, im now down to 30mg, and I take a benzo, and clonid	M	26	3  years	6/12/2008Email

I get severely constapated (Miralax helps a lot)but if i go to the bathroom #2 it almost takes all the pain away but if I don't take Miralax all the time the pain comes back.

5	Fibrose Dyspalsia (Bone Tumors)	Constipation and profuse sweating at high doses 60mg or above.	I have had this bone disease since birth and have had two tumors removed.  One from my leg where they removed my fibula and put it in my femur and one tumor scraped off the outside of the back of my skull.  I have many other tumors located in my arms and head.  I started with the painkillers at 19 when I had the 1st operation and they gave me morphine IM for 14 days then sent me home with 100 Tylox with a refill.  Needless to say I was addicted by the end of the refill.  I finally started hitting doctors and have taken Lortab, Percocet, Demerol, Fiorinol #3, Tylenol#3, Oxycontin 40mg x3 daily with Lortab X3 forbreakthrough pain, morphine 30mg and 60mg X3 daily with percocet for breakthrough.  You name it I have been on it.  In 1998 I went to a Methadone Clinic and finally found the relief I had been seeking.  Methadone was the cure from the beginning!  THey staRTED ME OUT AT 40MG DAILY AND i GOT UP TO 120 DAILY UNTIL i COULD NO LONGER AFFORD THE $110.00 PER WEEK FOR THE MEDICINE PLUS T	F	46	10  years	4/16/2008Email
3	Lyme Disease/Chronic Pain	65 pound weight gain that is impossible to loose. Mild constipation. Tooth decay (not related to poor hygiene).	I unfortunately and probably am an exception that I do not experience 24 hour pain relief. Methadone's pain relief is most effective 1-1 1/2 hour after I take it and lasts for about 3 hours. I split the dose to help distribute pain relief.	F	37	6  years	4/14/2008
5	Opiate addiction and Fibromyalgia	Its hard to tell which are side effects of methadone and which are from the Fibromyalgia so I'll do my best to list them.1. Sweating and being hot - the summers are nightmarish. I used to be cold natured, not anymore, 80 degrees starts feeling hot.2. Mind Fog - Caused from Fibromyalgia and made worse from the methadone? I don't know but it seems worse since I've been on Methadone and also since I hit my head in a wreck where I flipped my neighbors suv.3. Constipation - I go regularly now, pretty much every morning BEFORE I dose but after I dose it's a rare thing to have a movement.  Every time I go up on in Mg. on methadone I usually cannot have a movement for weeks or longer.  Also, my poop no longer comes out all in one chunk, It kinda breaks off into little balls, weird. Sorry for the awful mental picture :(4. Tiredness, nodding off - I nod off a lot, especially if I don't get enough sleep at night.  With Fibromyalgia I notice that I do not sleep very deeply and rarely dream	I got onto Methadone primarily to help with my Opiate addiction. I was having to take at least 1 pill/hr. to keep the sickness at bay.I felt so sick when I didnt have any.   I suffer from Fibromyalgia which is why I started taking the pills in the 1st place.   So I got onto methadone and was very amazed. I didnt have any withdrawal symptoms that night or the next day. I had found my wonder drug. I did get a rush off of the methadone for the 1st month or two but that went away and left me with a medicine that helped my pain very well & also freed me from any withdrawal symptoms.  But over time I kept having to go up and up on my doses and now I just don't feel well anymore. I hate this because I really believe in methadone and know that it saved my life but its either time for me to come off of it which I dread doing because it fills that hole inside of me that NOTHING else has ever been able to fill for very long but I am starting to feel like a junkie which was why I got on	M	32	4  years	4/12/2008Email
4	Ruptured c3+c5, migraine, arthritis	Constipation (completely cured with Miralax), dental problems, reduced sex drive and fatigue.	Compared to other chronic pain meds like Duragesic patches and extended release morphine, Methadone is the best way to go. I am taking 120mg/day due to a high tolerance to most pain meds and I don't get any euphoria from this medication. It just takes the edge off of the pain in a big way. Duragesic patches work about the same, but I get extremely sleepy with them. The patches cost about $50.00 a piece also. I also don't experience withdrawl symptoms if I stop taking methadone like most other opioids (contrary to most other people who've posted here).I have noticed that any other meds used for breakthrough pain don't work as well when I take Methadone. I will be getting 5 cervical discs fused with titanium plates soon and I will probably use Methadone for recovery.

2	Fibromyalgia	Just constipation but let me tell you I was able to #2 better with this medicine than Morphine.	I am right now taking the 5 mg 3x a day and vicodin 8 tabs in a day. The methadone is working very little. I am going to have her increase it.	F	26	10  days	1/6/2008Email
5	heroin addiction chronic back pain	weight gain, swollen hands and feet, excesive sweating, lathargic, and freedom from heroin addiction	I have pretty bad side effects but nothing compared to living life as a junkie. I can proudly say methadone saved my life as well as gave me a new and dramaticly better life. Thay said, please first Try na try rehab let methadone be a last resort for many it's a lifetime commitment.	F	29	7  years	1/3/2008
3	Osteo Arthritis/Pre and Post OP	Get really itchy sometimes, speeding heartbeat, mild constipation.	I had a para acetabular osteotomy last year. I was on the Fentanyl patch for a couple of months but my surgeon said he wouldn't touch me if I was on that patch so my doc switched me to Methadone. I have to have ANOTHER surgery to fuse my bones together and they want me off my pain meds. I'm very scared for the side effect because even if I forget to take one methadone, I start feeling horrible withdrawls..	F	32	1.5  years	12/27/2007Email
5	pain/opiate dependency	I had loose bowel movements all my life. methadone stopped this immediately. night sweating at first during constant increasing which has stopped. Lower back pain (sciatica) and kidney pain has stopped. I do not experience fatigue as I work which is a big plus. My concentration increased,basically, everything in my life has changed for the better except for sex which is almost non-existing.	I`ve been on and off opiates all my life, including long battles with heroin. I`ve overdosed on opiates three times (hopitalized) The last time my heart stopped and I was "paddled" back to life. I no longer experience any depression or any anxieties or other emotional disorders as I have had before taking methadone. At this time in my life I feel without methadone, I would not be alive. All the opiates, self medicating, along with chronic pain mostly all the time, leave methadone as a life saver and God send for me. I`d be in severe misery without it and probably will be on methadone for the rest of my life.	M	58	3  years	12/14/2007Email
5	Severe back and hip and neck pain	Constipation, choking when drink or eat due to slowed motility of gut, Itchy skin,Weight gain, crave sugar and chocolate, Menstuation stopped,sweats,fluid retention ie swollen legs and arms, suppressed personality,constantly feel fatigued.	Have suffered pain for 16 years from being run over by a vechicle, been on numerous pain medication and drug trials but methadone has given me pain control apart from numerous side effects and some break thru pain. This has been a miracle drug that allows me to get thru the day and get some sleep!100mg/day	F	39	4  years	11/18/2007
1	Rupture disk	immediate nausea, vomitting, sweating, swelling, itching, constipation, confusion, spacey, insomnia	My experience was awful. It took 3 days for the constant vomitting to stop. I couldn't even hold down water. The nausea was persistant. I wanted to rip my skin off, the itch was so bad. I swelled up like a balloon animal. I was dripping in sweat non stop. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't think. And the relatively violent nature of the vomit and swelling, we'd say this goes down in my records as an alergy. It's been 2 weeks, and the constipation is only NOW starting to return to normal. It probably did it's job killing the pain, but I didn't notice as I was far to busy dealing with the side effects.

5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium.

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS.

His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself.

4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.

I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify.

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie).

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.

1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).	F	42	16  months30 mg 1X D	9/7/2010
3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email

4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine.

2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.

5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again.

3	bipolar disorder/psychotic mania	No side effects other than lethargy for the first year. I was at 10, then 15 mg for six years after that until two months ago. My new doctor raised my dose to 20mg and I developed NMS symptoms. Fever, irregular heartbeat, sweating, blood pressure irregularities, etc. I had thoughts of suicide (extremely rare for me) could barely speak, was comatose and basically felt like I'd die from fright. After being on this for so long, my only advice is to not raise it quickly. It's a very sensitive drug. I am now developing problems with my liver, so discontinuation is likely this week. Too bad, it has worked well for years to squash mania and psychotic symptoms.	Do not raise too quickly! I went through every state of psychotic mania and depression the drug tries to suppress, and almost killed myself because of this drug being at too high a dose. After lowering it back to 15 mg my mental status is even, but now I have liver problems. I recommend this drug to the desperate and very ill because it does help, but not for a sleep aid or help with a minor or transient depression. Very scary drug.	F	42	7  years15 mg 1X D	5/16/2010

4	Depression/Unstable Moods	The first couple of days I was very sleepy, then I became activated. I wake up as early as 5, 3, or even 1am most mornings. This is the complete opposite of my usual sleeping pattern. I feel slightly agitated and restless, but I have lots of energy which is a good thing. My anxiety has been very bad, I don't know if this has anything to do with the abilify. Hypervigilance has been a problem. I have high fasting blood sugar but I don't know what my blood sugar level was before abilify. A few side effects that I got at the beginning but have gone away: photosensitivity (even though my pupils are constricted), muscle stiffness, pain and cramping, tension headaches, random hiccups.	I have enough energy to go to the gym in the mornings and I have not been depressed for more than a few hours at a time. I feel a bit calmer despite the agitation. Before abilify my thoughts were racing a bit. This medication seems to work very well for my depression but not at all for my anxiety. I have been on 4 antidepressants, none of which helped.

Take 2mg with 10mg Lexapro + 0.50mg Xanax as needed (usually 3-4x/day).  Suggest this drug as an add-on to your SSRI.  I needed something to help with my anxiety induced lack of appetite.  After 18 days going from 1.5 to 2mg I definitely feel a difference.  Still feel nauseated most of the day but now it almost feels like a nuisance vice such a major ordeal.

I was no where near this bad before i started taking it.		M	28	3  weeks5-15 1X D	4/19/2010Email
1	Bipolar spectrum disorder	Restlessness, anxiety, drowsiness, face rash	I went on Abilify at the start of an up period, so I don't know how effective it would have been in treating depressive spells. However, it did counteract some of the effectiveness of my lithium, and I was falling asleep during the day more frequently than usual. Had to go off it because of a rash on my chin/cheeks/ears.

5	for depression-w/ my antidepressant	lowering my libido. Craving more sugary, fatty foods and carbs.     I took this several yrs. ago and although the medication initially worked-I packed on more than 10 pounds. I got depressed due to weight gain, but after several months I feel medication ceased to be effective. This time  was very reluctant (2 yrs later & different Dr. & different anti-depressant medication-Prozack-2 yrs ago) but I am trying it w/ a different antidepressant than previously-Taking now w/ Wellbutrin. Sp far it lifted me out of a bad depression when the Wellbutrin alone was no longer effective (it had been initially effective.)		F	53	34  days4 1X D	4/18/2010

THIS DRUG SHOULD COME WITH A WARNING LABEL.  I WOULD AKIN THIS TO RAT POISON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	F	54	4  months4 mg 1X D	4/17/2010
4	augment other meds	Voracious appetite - totally destroys any semblence of will power. When I get hungry I will eat and there seems to be no mechanism any longer to stop me or make me feel full. I really, really fight it.	Take it in combo with Lamactil and Lexapro and it seems to be helping.I feel a little "brighter" and am more active - definitely helps with the fatigue. Negative - I find myself much more emotional - memories, key phrases, smells, songs, pictures, etc.can bring me to tears.	M	50	9  months50 MG 1X D	4/11/2010
2	Paranoid schizophrenia	Lack of motivation, low libido, flat affect, high blood pressure, raised serum triglycerides	On Abilify for three years. It never did anything to relieve the symptoms of the illness (predominantly visual hallucinations) but only added to them. I persisted because the side-effects were far more tolerable than those of previous medications, of which there had been many. Finally I had had enough and unilaterally stopped the Abilify two years ago. My blood pressure and serum lipids quickly returned to normal, and I can think clearly now. I have woken up from a 12 year-long medication-induced nightmare.	M	57	 15 MG 1X D	4/7/2010Email

When it comes to causing the "munchies" it is like pot gone nuclear (haven't had a toke in more than 35 years)	NO APPETITE CONTROL - OBSESSED WITH EATING - ANYTHING - ALL THE TIME.

2	depression	Nausea the first few days, some constipation, cloudy thinking, increased appetite	Combined with Wellbutrin XL which suddenly stopped working for me after 3 years. After getting past the nausea of the first week, it worked great for about 3 weeks. I was more optimistic, confident, energized. Then the benefits began to taper off and I noticed I was having cloudy thinking. Also my appetite increased and I started eating 6 or 7 times a day - fatty foods were especially appealing. It goes without saying that I began to notice slight weight gain so I stopped the drug. I would rather be depressed an thin than fat and happy! Seriously though, why take it when its benefits have tapered off and the depression is returning? Hopefully there's something else I can try that has no side effects....but what?

1	Severe Depression with Psychotic Ep	As an Electrical Engineer, I found it very difficult to focus on tasks like root cause troubleshooting. After some major psychotic episodes, I developed severe tremors (shaky hands) and the Abilify seemed to make these worse.	Recently, I have learned that all of my psychiatric problems may be the result of Mercury poisoning via my 4 large Amalgram Dental fillings that I had since a young teenager. My Dentist, about two year ago, looked in my mouth and said I should replace two of my fillings with ceramic because they were "leaking." I didn't know what he meant by that at the time, but had the fillings replaced and have progressively improved. I now want the other two fillings replaced asap. I learned about Mercury poisoning by Amalgram fillings from the book "Cancer: Step Outside the Box" by Ty Bollinger, can be found on Amazon.com.The term "mad as a hatter" comes from Industrial age English hat workers who were exposed to Mercury causing Depression, shaky hands, etc. Perhaps the Psycho-experts should be asking us to open our mouths before trying to shrink our heads with drugs.

5	Major Depression, Anxiety	Have had some problems concentrating.  Although I love to read, it has been a struggle to focus for a sustained amount of time.  Mild weight gain.  Insomnia (but the Seroquel has completely cured that.)	Abilify has helped me like no other drug.  I am on it along with cymbalta, deplin, seroquel and ativan.  Within just a few days I was feeling better and am now able to exercise, clean my house and just moved across the country-something I could never have done during my depression.

I feel kind of leveled out, but I hate the tiredness all the time.  I can sleep for 10 hours, take my son to school, come home and go back to sleep for another couple of hours.  Then still have little to no energy for the rest of the day.  I was previously, taking 60 mg. of Cymbalta for almost 2 years, but my dr. switched me to this when I started to feel like dying again.  I also take Valium (5 mg.) when I feel anxious and panic coming on.	F	35	14  days5 mg. 1X D	2/12/2010Email

3	BiPolar (rapid cycler)	Weight Gain	Well, Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal controlled my bipolar symptoms pretty well, I could work and get on with my life decently.  Only, the damn Abilify packed 40lbs on me in short order and now I am depressed because of my weight.  Also I am trying to date again after my husband left me (becuase of BiPolar) and now because I am fat I can't get a date!  I'd rather be crazy and skinny....at least I could get a date!	F	38	1  years20mg 1X D	2/5/2010
2	mood swings	extreme drowsiness, lethargy	Overall, it was not a terrible drug, but it just was not worth it for me at all.  It did stabilize my mood.  But it made me very lethargic and I required an extra 4 hours of sleep per day (more than seroquel).	M	18	2  weeks 1X D	2/5/2010
3	Severe Depression	Intense drowsiness, unbearable akathisia, mental instability, a feeling of dissatisfaction, acute sadness.	While Abilify (2, then 5, mg) did help with my depression, its side effects were intolerable, just like all of the other medications I have tried. I was constantly sleepy, yet restless when I tried to sit. I could never feel satisfied. I would also cycle in and out of sadness and neutrality on 5 mg.	M	19	6  weeks	2/2/2010

1	doctor's incompetence	Given drug for an off-label, unapproved use.  I now have a permanent movement disorder and feel like a zombie.	You'd be better off swallowing a pesticide.  No drug provides nourishment, least of all a synthetic chemical.  Anything with as many warnings as this drug has, for severe problems belongs off of the market.  We already have a ton of so-called antipsychotics, THIS DRUG NEEDS TO BE BANNED.  No matter what your original problem is, swallowing your own tongue uncontrollably or finding yourself being declared legally blind because you just can't stop blinking will make your original condition look like bliss.  AND FOR ANYONE DIAGNOSED AS BIPOLAR BE AWARE THAT UNSTABLE BLOOD SUGAR IS A CAUSE NOT TREATED BY THESE DRUGS, AS ARE MANY PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS LIKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS.	M	35	24  days	1/30/2010
1	depression, of all excuses	This is to the PARENTS out there who believe that if their child looks passive on the drug it is a godsend:  Beating someone over the head with a baseball bat can also make them sit still.  Would you do it?  If you wouldn't you should seriously question why you would do that with a drug. EXPECT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL RESENT YOU MONTHS OR YEARS FROM NOW IF THEY SURVIVE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG.  And get some non-drug help.  Having an overactive kid is nothing compared to having one who has permanent brain damage.	There is nothing nourishing about synthetic chemicals created for profit.  NOTHING.

1	To help me sleep	I did fall asleep- only to wake up with real or hallucinatory feelings reguarding my health. The first night I woke up and my body felt numb on the left side. FACT-I have periferal neuropathy and it is worse on the left side. Second night- I fell asleep only to wake up with  bad pain in my back sholders (lungs) and I was having trouble breathing. FACT- I do not sleep well and wind up in contorted positions- did this cause my sensation? I do not know for sure. But I do know that I am dizzy in the morning and I feel like I am loosing my periferal vision. This is a symtom I get with my atypical migraines -I don't want those to come back. Note: I am being treated for severe depression -and I am suffering symetrical pain in my limbs with the neuropathy. I take Lexapro,dextroamphetamine, Klonapin,Aspirin, Tegretol and Trazadone. 	I called my doctor -he said that it was hallucinations and to double the dose. I am stopping tonight. When I saw the commercial for this medicine on TV - and heard of all the possible side effects my husband and I wondered who would ever take Abilify - yet my doctor,even after my objections, prescribed it for me.  No more for me. Abilify- Forgetaboutit!!!!!!!	F	57	3  days	1/30/2010Email

4	schizoaffective disorder	I have no complaints with the affectivness of Abilify as far as satabalizing my moood, however after taking Abilify for four years I have developed an allergic reaction to the drug by experiencing a very bad rash on my chest and back. It is debatable if the sole reason for the rash is due to Abilify or the combination of my other mediations which are Geodon, Lamitcal, Lithium, Trazodone and Ritalin. In any case I have stopped Abilfy.		M	55	4  years	1/28/2010
2	Major Depressive Disorder & Anxiety	Extreme anxiety	I took Abilify as an augment to Cymbalta for MDD  & anxiety.  I am pretty tolerant of new medication side effects (I have been on Zoloft and Cymbalta, and tried Wellbutrin and Lexapro), but the anxiety was too extreme for me.  I was hopeful because I had read and heard very positive anecdotes on Abilify, but obviously medications effect each person differently.	F	35	1  months	1/26/2010
3	Schizophrenia, anxiety	Severe hiccups, dry heaving, nausea, sore throat.  Initially the hiccups did not happen all the time but could not be cured by any of the standard methods.  I told my psychiatrist and he suggested cutting the dosage in half from 5 mg to 2.5 mg, so I ended up taking 5 mg every other day.  Hiccups got worse, lasted hours at a time.  Once in awhile unusual methods would work to stop hiccups such as rubbing moistened cotton swab along roof of mouth between soft and hard palate, drinking cold ginger ale or black cherry juice.  However each of these methods only worked once and as I continued to take Abilify the hiccups last longer and longer, practially the whole day from the moment I wake up until I goto sleep at night.  My dad who is a doctor sent me some Motilium to stop hiccups and vomiting but it has minimal effect.  As I type this, I cannot sleep because I am constantly hiccupping.  Dry heaving started around the 4th day of taking the med, the worst thing about this is that it brings	I am currently taking 20 mg of Zeldox (Geodon).  The positive things about Abilify is that it gave me more energy and motivation to do things and it lessened my anxiety alot.  However, these benefits do not outweight the horrible side effects of this medication.  If you are having similar symptoms as I am, feel free to email me.	M	40	7  days	1/22/2010Email
2	bipolar spectrum disorder	very low motivation, depression, irritability, restlessness,weakness, inability to concentrate, anxiety, nervousness, vision worsening, cant stay standing for very long, restless around people, trouble focusing when driving, muscle pain between shoulder blades for about 3 weeks, waking more often, only 6 hours of sleep if lucky, usually need at least 8, not alert  feeling out of sorts	I was on Seroquel and Cipralex and told my doc I was way too tired so she put me on Abilify and is weaning me off the Cipralex.  I don't know which medication is making me more depressed, anxious and irritable, but I do know that all the other symptoms are thanks to the Abilify.  I'm seeing her next week and hope to try Geodon.	F	43	2  months	1/21/2010Email
4	Taking for depression	I wrote a review before but forgot to mention I have had no weight gain, but feel like I can't sit still.  The first week was the worst and it slowed down, but still can't sit for long.  I see people listing this feeling as "Akathisia."  I have had memory loss, loss of words and short term memory loss.	To drive is weird.  I cannot have any distractions, can't turn the radio station or I might drive off the road.  That part has gotten better.  I'm the one that wrote about the lack of "scruples" and am also taking generic Celexa so that could be it. I have a feeling that it is the Abilify.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010Email
4	Am taking abilify for depression	Side effects were feeling like I was jumping out of my skin for the first week.  Not jittery. It's like I had to move and move.  I still have a little of that.  I am on 20 mg of Abilify with 20 mg generic Celexa.	If you go through the "jumping out of skin" experience, my pharmacist recommended trying it for a week and it was his opinion that if that side effect didn't go away to stop it.  It did mostly go away.  I do notice a lack of feeling, or a lack of scruples.  I don't know how else to say it.  I am being brutally honest when I say if someone asked me to go to bed with them, I don't know how I'd say no.  That is NOT my usual behavior.  So I am really monitoring myself.  It's a lack of something, a lack of good judgment?  That could be the Celexa too.  I don't know.  If I take a new med, I really monitor my behavior and my mood.  I'm just sort of "flat."  I will be on this for 6 months.  I hope the "lack of judgement" will go away as well.	F	38	6  weeks	1/19/2010
2	Bipolar,GAD,Social Anxiety,ADHD	Weight gain(40 lbs), night sweats, difficulty breathing due to weight gain, extreme food cravings, constipation.  I would rather be healthy & crazy than obese & sane!	After failed attempts with Effexor,Lexapro,Wellbutrin,Paxil, Xanax,and Cymbalta my Dr put me on Abilify with Zonegran and Adderall.I started on 7mg daily then increased to 15mg daily.It helped with my depression and my panic attacks subsided within 2 weeks.The food cravings were worse than those I had during my 2 pregnancies.I continued to eat healthy, exercise and fight the cravings.The weight gain was slow at first but I was always bloated especially my fingers to the point I couldn't bend them.I tried fluid pills, anti-bloat diets, fasting, diet pills,grandmas remedies,nothing worked.Eventually I gained 40 lbs and was the same weight I was when I had my daughter. I had already expanded 2 sizes and was busting out again AND I was eating healthy controlled portions!I became self conscious and severely depressed to the point I didn't want to leave the house.I was having other side effects at night I would wake up every hour with intense cravings for sweets.If cravings weren't keeping me awake I would wake drenched with sweat. Due to the extra baggage it was hard to catch my breath,I was getting lazy,and my energy was absolutely gone.I weened myself off for a month very carefully even that didn't prepare me for the hell I was to go through. My skin broke out in severe acne head to toe and I picked at it like a crackhead for a week the depression and panic attacks were ungodly.It's been 2 months since I quit Abilify the weight is slowly coming off and no more cravings.

I am taking cymalta but after about a year, it didn't work. My MD RX'd 5mg of abilify along with my cymbalta every day. In my opinion, it saved my life.

1	anxiety and mood swings	increased heart rate that made my daughter pass out only after the 2nd day.	after first night of taking my daughter missed school the next day feeling nauseated and stomach cramps. That night she experienced indigestion/heartburn. She vomited. Sleepy but couldn't sleep. Feeling scared for no reason. Next day she passed out after being awake for 15 min. I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug. I got home and looked up the side effects and all of these were listed.  I can only say that we are glad we found out so quickly about this drug.	F	12	2  days	12/19/2009
