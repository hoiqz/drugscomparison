1		Chronic diarrhea - for 2.5 years since taking Humatin	I took it for an amoebic infection and it caused chronic diarrhea - this despite taking probiotics before, during, and after treatment. In short, the drug made me worse rather than better, and the bad effects WILL NOT GO AWAY	M	52	10  days	10/25/2009
5	Entameba histolytica	I had absolutely no side effects since I was eating 250ml of yogurt containing live bacterial cultures, 3 times a day in between medication dose. Those who complained about the diarrhea are evidently incognitive of the fact that this antibiotic, just like many others, kills not only the bad microorganism, but also the good ones in your GI tract. Hence, replenishing "good" GI bacteria with yogurt that contains active bacterial cultures seems fairly logical.	This is an extremely powerful antibiotic that completely eradicates entameba histolytica infection.	M	33	7  days	8/18/2009
1	Intestinal parasites	4 months later I still have liquid diarrhea and problems that started when I began the paromomycin. A disaster. Beware.	I had high hopes that this and flagyl would clear up my problems, but this just added to it.	M		10  days	12/16/2007
1	Intestinal parasites	It caused ongoing liquid diarrhea which is still a problem 10 days after the end of treatment	This was supposed to help my bowel problem, not make it worse.	M	50	7  days	8/28/2007
