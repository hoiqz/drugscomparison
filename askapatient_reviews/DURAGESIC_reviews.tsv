5	I have chronic RA and vonwilliebran	I have suffer with chronic pain since I was little girl due to my RA but my RA got worst know since I got pregnact so my doc put me on the duragesic patch which it has make my life easier, tho I'm concern in many ways me being pregnact and afraid that my baby may come out addicted to it, 2nd not able to sleep sometimes and getting a lot of sweats		F	26	3  months75mcg	3/27/2013Email
5	Spinal Cord Tumor & chronic pain	Loss of appetite.  Patch for 72 hours only works 48 hours for me.		F	57	4  years100 mcg	11/7/2012
5	Shattered femur-chronic pain	I have had no side effects.		F	45	2  years75	7/29/2012Email
5	severe pain disorder after a mva	dry mouth, suppressed appetite and nausea	side effects are totally worth it.	F	41	2  months37mg 1X D	5/18/2012
5	spinal fractures, and sciatica	The only side effects I noticed were dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The loss of appetite was the worst, but, well worth it for the superior pain control I received without feeling foggy, or high. A LIFE SAVER, AND CHANGER!		F	31	2  years50mcg	1/22/2012
5	Fractured spine - burst L4	Reduced appetite, occasional insomnia upon initial application, reduced effectiveness upon day 3 of patch life	After a 35 foot/5 storey fall upon concrete, I smashed myself up pretty badly and was initially given IV morphine while in hospital (1 month) and then Oxycontin the first 3 months of my 6 month stay at a rehab' centre before moving onto Duragesic 50 mcg, which was a MASSIVE improvement by the 2nd day..best thing the Doc's ever did for me!! I could never expect life to be perfect after smashing myself so terribly but Duragesic is FAR better than any other analgesic I've tried. Over time, I've progressed to 75, and recently 100 mcg as one of the discs has worsened and more pain relief has been required but no increase in side effects!!

5	Generalized internal chronic RSD	Nausea, vomiting, tiredness	I tried over 60 various medications to control the intense chronic pain caused by my generalized internal chronic RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy). Only strong extended release narcotic painkillers work for me. The one that works best for me is Duragesic (brand name fentanyl patches made by Janssen Pharmaceutica). Generic fentanyl patches do not work as well for me, if at all, and cause me much worse side effects. I can say without the shadow of a doubt that Duragesic patches gave me back my life, that is, they gave me a life worth being called a life. Thanks to the Duragesic patches, I can now work. I can also do the activities I enjoy most: sky diving, horseback riding (especially circus type), water skiing, rock climbing, mountain hiking, etc. I can never thank Janssen Pharmaceutica enough for making these wonderful fentanyl patches. The only negative point is the very high cost of the patches, for patients whose medical insurance will not cover fentanyl patches and for uninsured patients.	F	37	9  years125 mcg 1X O	11/25/2011Email
4	Lupus pain, Fibromyalgia	Reduced appetite, sweating, mild nausea	I use the generic, mylan brand fentanyl patch. I prefer this to the duragesic patch which gave me some skin irritation. Mylan sticks better and does not irritate my skin. I am so glad for this long lasting patch that gives me continuous relief for several days. I prefer it to popping oxicodone every few hours. Other pain meds caused way more ups and downs and fatigue than the patch. I feel almost normal, pain is not gone, but much reduced. Without this, its was excruciating. I can lead an active life as opposed to being bedridden with pain. Just wish it wasn't so expensive. Fortunately my insurance has been covering the cost. I would give it 5 stars if sweating wasn't an issue and if it didn't cost so much, and if it was easier to get off of. Once you start this drug, it is extremely hard to get off of because the withdrawals are so severe. So I try to stay on the lowest dose I can tolerate.	F	53	8  years175mcg 1X O	9/7/2011Email
4	Failed back surgeries	I also am suffering from severe nerve pain and have been given methadone for that.  Duragesic is the only medication that works for me and I like it due in part to a past addiction to codeine. With a patch and the fear of ODing on Duragesic it is the best method for me.	I change patches every 48hrs and I have now been on the 75mgc for so long on the second day I am feeling withdrawal symptoms of constant tiredness.	M	59	7  years75mg 1X D	8/7/2011Email
4	Severe back/leg pain,failed surgery	Severe skin irritation (scaring) when used below the belly button/pelvis area.  Withdrawl symptoms on the 3rd day)-flu like feeling (not everytime).	I was in an auto accident almost 4yrs ago and have had severe back and leg pain ever since.  I have had 5 back surgeries-laminectomy (failed), spinal chord stimulator implanted, battery changed, stimulator removed and a spinal fusion/stabalization.  Nothing has worked!!!  I have of course tried every narcotic and non-narcotic pain med out there!  I started the duragesic patch about a year ago and I think it does take the edge off the pain and it doesn't make me feel "loopy".	F	34	1  years200mcg 1X O	4/14/2011Email
4	Failed fusion			M	34	14  days25 1X D	3/17/2011
5	Complex Regional Pain Syndrome	dry mouth, occasional withdrawal symptoms, fatigue, constipation, initial skin rashes on application site	Has the potential to move you from constant intense pain and hopelessness to managed pain levels that are livable. I don't know if it is possible to get to a zero level of pain with it, perhaps because I am resistant to take more than I do. The patches do not last for 3 days for me. I take them every 2 days and try to alternate changing (sets of) patches so that I change one or more patches each day. This means: at a dose of 200 ug/h, use 100 patches. Put on patch A - 100 on day 1; put on B - 100 on day 2. On day 3 replace A with a new patch C - 100. This keeps the dosage more consistent. At 175 it works fine with A-75 and B-100, etc. Variation of temperature can cause withdrawal symptoms for me, which is frustrating. The initial skin irritation was addressed by spraying a corticosteroid inhaler on the skin in the application area, then letting it dry before applying the patch, for the first several months of use. Dental issues are a problem for long-term use, as is constipation.	F	34	6  years125-225 1X O	12/31/2010
5	Broken back. spinal cysts, CPS	Skin irritation (esp. w/ new SANDOZ patches), constipation, occasional mood swings, occasional nausea, slight "loopy" sensation rarely	The SANDOZ branded fentanyl patches are now made by ALBA (a division of Johnson & Johnson), and as of March 2009 (the copyright date on the packaging), stopped using a gel reservoir with a porous membrane covering the reservoir in its high-dose patches (by 2010, SANDOZ eliminated gel reservoirs in ALL of its fentanyl patches). Instead, SANDOZ (like competitor Mylan) uses a matrix of Fentanyl in strands that melt with body heat. The matrix is covered with polyacrylate adhesive and backed with a VERY thin polyester/ethyl vinyl acetate covering  My body does not react well to these new patches; I get nausea (not uncommon; some studies show that up to 10% of people on ANY high-dose narcotics will develop nausea during product use) and my skin gets so irritated I can watch it pinken through the semi-opaque covering.  Pain doc is attempting to reduce my overall fentanyl usage (thus, adding a box of 50 mcg/h in with the regular 75 mcg/h to facilitate switching from high to low).  I'm still having great success w/ the patch, though--nothing keeps pain at bay like it.	F	47	3  years50-75 mcg 1X O	10/31/2010Email
5	severe fibromyalgia, rheumatoid art	constipation, sweating, weight gain-I take 100 mg every three days. Take tylenol, ibuprofen for breakthrough, it's not that bad.	Gave me a life back. Battled pain from severe fibromyalgia, rheumaoid arthritis, 3 herniated discs, lups-I had just about had it with doctors and medications prescribed. I was in so much pain, my quality of life was nil. This gave me my life back, yes, with a few changes, but all I could handle. I did end up having all my teeth extracted and was told the patch was a factor in that but hey, I got dentures and all is well. If you take this drug as directed it is a life save. If you mess with it, it can kill you. A	F	59	4  years100 mg 1X O	6/16/2010Email
4	Back pain, rib cage nerve damage	Slightly spacey feeling on 100mcg patch,but just about cut all my pain.  Cut back to 75mcg and I think clearly now but some pain has returned.	I was on morphine sulfate for a couple of years, total of 90mg a day. This did little to help, made me a little nauseous. Doc switch me to duragesic patch starting at 50 mcg for 6 days then to 100mcg. The 100mcg along with 15mg morphine sulfate for break through pain. This got rid of 80% of pain and did not even need morphine. Two weeks ago I cut back to 75mcg patch, I could not  think clearly. Ok on 75mcg although I'm getting about 50% reduction in pain.	M	59	3  months 1X O	5/4/2010
5	Chronic pain from nerve damage	A little tiredness and I have noticed my memory is not as sharp as it was sometimes-these side effects are NOTHING compared to other narcotic meds I have tried through the yrs and I have tried them all!!	This medicine has been a miracle for me and I am amazed that it is not prescribed more often for people who have severe and chronic pain. It is so amazing not to deal w/ the constant withdrawal/ups and downs of oxycontin,vicodin,and other more commonly presribed meds. Morphine gave me terrible migraines and restless legs as it would wear off and it made me sooo tired. These patches give a steady stream of med. that if used properly,prevent you from ever having to deal with all that agony. It also gives me better pain relief than any other med w/o any real side effects besides a little memory issue which could have more to do w/ my insomnia which is unrelated to this med.I have also only had to up my dose once in 4 yrs and that was because my condition worsened not because the drug became less effective. So, talk to your dr. if you have chronic pain....people who have died or od'ed from Fentanyl have misused it - people don't die from using it correctly.	F	46	4  years50mg 1X O	4/6/2010
2	nerve damage, bulging disc,multi	patch crinckles and tried to peel off..fixed that...a little sleepy first day.....no effects at all now, 69 hours later.	I have had lumbar epidural's, physical therapy,tenz unit and more for severe muscle spasms in back, severe pain in right leg for 8 months after minor surgery. Been on Loritab 10 mg x4, Lyrica,75mg x3 Demerol 50 mg x4, Norco 10mg x 4,and now Percedan 4.35x6 and tinazidine 4mg x9 and now the 25mg patch. So far its only been 72 hours but I feel 0 relief from the patch. It's on my forarm and I keep it in place with bandages in an X over the patch. I am hoping my doctor will bump me up to 50mg tomorrow....I am sooooo sick of the pain. My quality of life sucks. I was working full time and walking 3 miles a day before this happened. It was supposed to be a simple surgery and back to work the next day.....that was in August 09. Do the 50's work without doping you up? I have a 10yr old to take care of. As for that person drinking the medicine...good luck and God be with you cause one of these times you are not gonna come out of it. This stuff is no game.   Can anyone tell me what happens if I change the patch a few hours shy of 72 hours?	F	44	3  days25 mcg 1X O	3/29/2010Email
5	chronic pain, spinal tumors	mild constipation, skin irritation from patch adhesive, mood swings	This medication is a lifesaver, literally.  I was ready to commit suicide because I could not stop the pain I was having from tumors on my spine and severe fibromyalgia.  I was first given it after a car accident, and within an hour after the patch was put on, I felt something I hadn't felt in YEARS:  Pain-Free.  It's not a perfect drug--it does cause constipation, the adhesive is a skin irritant, and my moods tend to swing up as the medicine gets absorbed and down as the dose runs out--and if you stop taking it suddenly, you WILL go into opiate withdrawal, no question.  But if you're a chronic pain sufferer who can't get relief no matter how many high-dose narcotic pills you take, ask your doctor about the fentanyl 3-day patch (the generic name for Duragesic).  One patch can change your life...at least, it did for me.	F	47	2  years50 mcg 1X O	3/7/2010Email
5	Fibro, herniated discs, neuralgias	mild constipation, skin irritation with Duragesic brand when worn above waist	This medicine literally saved my life.  Before it I was in such severe, constant pain that I was actually seriously considering suicide.  I had zero quality of life.  This medication allowed me to be functional again and although I am far from being pain-free, my quality of life is pretty good.  I am on disability but am able to have a life now.  I would highly recommend this medication to anyone with long-term, severe chronic pain not getting relief from other pain meds.  I change my patch every 48 hours because on the third day it seemed like the drug was wearing off and I was needing lots of breakthrough pain meds. (Many Medicare Part D plans pay for up to 15 or 16 patches a month so ask your insurance carrier if you have the same issue).  I am now on minimal breakthrough pain meds.  I have been at the same dose for 6 1/2 years and have been able to avoid increasing the dosage by using alternative therapies along with the patch.  I have found that the Mylan brand, being a smaller patch, causes less skin irritation than Duragesic, especially when worn on the very lower back/top of buttock area where less pulling occurs with movement.  Although the manufacturer tells you that you should wear it above the waist, this is only because they only studied it there, but I had no decrease in effectiveness wearing it on my lower back or upper buttock area.  The patches also stay on much better for me there, with no need for tape or overlays.	F	34	7  years75 mcg 1X O	2/26/2010Email
1	Disc and nerve pain	Tried this drug as was in horrendous pain and was stepping down from morphine following flare up with back apin and nerve pain. Vivid nasty nightmares, couldn't sleep, was then tired in the day, felt really sick. Slowly dropped dose to discontinus as couldn't tolerate side effects any longer and felt tearful and suicidal, was so depressed could hardly function. Tokk 2 attempts to stop this drug.	It doesn't suit everyone and I am one of those !!!	F	35	3  weeks	1/27/2010
5	spinal pain		I forgot to add something on my previous post.  I use the Mylan patches. Get "Tegaderm" covers.  Nothing can get these off with the Tegaderm. It works 100% in holding them on and intact. 100 showers and they wouldn't come off.	F	62	2  months	1/26/2010Email
5	C6- C7 T1 spine pain	some nausea when first changing and putting on new patches.	This has also been a literal lifesaver for me.  I also was about at the stage of suicide from intractable pain, ( back, and chest ) for 5 months. If you can imagine how horrible and disconserting it is to have chest pain 24/7 for months, and literally not be able to do for yourself.  Oral opiates just were awful, made me sick, didn't last, or just didn't work.  At first I was very leery of starting the patch, ( I am an RN ) but it got to a point where I was desperate for relief. Best thing I ever did.  It gave me back my life.  I have also just had my second cervical epidural with some relief but not enough, unfortunately.	F	62	2  months	1/26/2010Email
4	DDD, L5, perm nerve dmg in one leg	Nausea, constipation, tiredness	I have been on 50 mcg for at least 5 yrs. Without it I'd be on disability. Drug enables me to work and have a life most of the time. Some patch change days I am very nauseous to the point of having to stay in bed all day. Next day I'm fine. I have 5 mg oxycodone for breakthrough but seldom use. Also taking Lyrica, helps w/ the nerve pain in the leg & arm but gained too much weight! I lost weight on Duragesic. The Mylan generic is best, the name brand or the other generic increase the nausea. I can swim, but have to watch exposure to sun & heat or too much medicine will be released @ one time. This medicine made me able to walk on my own w/o using a cane constantly. (Bc of nerve dmg in leg/foot still have to look down & walk carefully). All in all a good drug, if one must be on an opioid.	F	50	5  years	9/15/2009
5	Severe spinal pain after car crash	Addictive.  Constipation.  Difficulty reading (weird eye strain feeling).  Mild insomnia.  Get help with the withdrawal when/if you discontinue use.  Except for the withdrawal issues all the side effects while using were totally manageable.	This drug was a miracle for me.  After a bad car accident I tried to avoid spine surgery for 3 years.  The patch was life saving for me.  My pain was so bad I was suicidal and none of the "traditional" painkillers worked for me.  I had to change the patch after 48 hours -- I could not go for 3 days as it would wear off too quickly and the third day was agony.  Tell your doctor if you think this is happening to you.  When I did finally stop using the patch I went off cold turkey, on my own, and I do not recommend that.  The withdrawal was awful and like torture so I highly recommend asking for your doctor's help.  The best part about the Duragesic patch was that it doesn't make you feel high.  You can function and think and have emotions, etc...  And at the correct dose, it will take away your pain to a manageable level.  I'm very petite and could never tolerate more than 50 mcg so I needed to take other meds for break through pain -- but so what?  The patch, while I needed it, gave me back my life.	F	34	3  years	3/19/2009
2	Chronic Pain L4-5 surgery, DDD, OA	Somewhat severe constipation. Anxiousness that at a higher dose became unbearable. Uneven release of the drug from the patch.	I've been on this drug two different times. The first time we went up to 75mg and that is where I experienced the horrible anxiety. The second time, a different MD due to a temporary move, prescribed it incorrectly and I finally asked him to take me off of it. At that time I found that the generic patch stayed on better and the drug released more evenly. I never, either time, could go three days with one patch, always only two. I also found that certain conditions such as warmer weather, physical exertion, caused the drug to release faster. Like most of this type of drug you really should decrease slowly but I found it difficult to go from 25mg to nothing without feeling quite sick. The first time I was on this drug was for 9 months. The second time was less than 2 months. The second time the MD incorrectly prescribed it along with MS Contin and as he increased it I had depressed breathing and heavy sleepiness and I KNEW something was very wrong.

2	L5-S1 spondylolisthesis,thor scoli	Did not work when used as substitute for methadone when doc went out of town and ER RXed 10.0 patch in place + my normal breakthru meds.  would have began withdrawing from methadone if i hadn't had a few extra to take every day to barely prevent withdrawl til doctor returned eight days later.	i am writing here to ask long time users about this drug.  has anyone been on methadone and switched to the patch?  what mg of methadone were they on and what mg of duragesic did they switch to? what brand? i have spoken to another friend on the patch and she tried methadone and found it much more efficient at relieving pain.  my doctor did not even mention the duragesic patch as an option for pain relieve and when i commented on it, he said that it is very addictive since the mdication is in your blood at all times.  my other question is about side effects.  when switch from pills such as methadone, oxy, or morphine, how does the patch compare to constipation and upset stomach? i have been on pills for many years and my digestive track is a mess, my disabiliy is permanent, so im hoping to find treatment that is easier on the guts.  please, anyone with any information, please contact me at pekinghouse_972@hotmail.com.   I also have a degree in biological psychology and studied psychone	F	27	1  weeks	12/9/2008Email
1	Chronic abdominal pain	After 6 surgeries and many pain meds, I ended up on Fentanyl Patch. 75mcg/hr down to 12.5mcg all had horrible side effects - on me.  I missed weeks of my life, seizures, possible unconscious at times, slurred speech, unable to walk, constantly falling and getting hurt/cut, unable to sit-up at times, stayed awake for 2-3 days then slept for same, very vivid dreams/nightmares, and even severe cigarette burns everywhere (including on my body) which I dont remember.	Not even after all my surgeries was I given Fentanyl.  Being a "widower" and living alone, I do not feel that this drug is safe, at least for me, to use without having someone around.  For me and my body it was just a horrible, horrible drug and I will never use it again unless it is in the hospital under the direct supervision of a physician and/or nurse to monitor me!	M	45	8  months	11/10/2008Email
5	Disc pain and rotatory scoliosis	None that I've noticed. I used it a few years ago when I was obese, and it made me sleep a lot. But now it doesn't.	I used it years ago and started again recently. I believe this is the best long-acting pain reliever that exists. It was one of three options offered to me: Morphine, Oxycontin or Fentanyl.  I tried the first two and didn't like them. Fentanyl is wonderful. There's no "high" like oxycontin. No side-effects like morphine. My breakthrough pain med use has gone down remarkably. I have to change patches every 48 hours, as the 72 hour schedule didn't give me enough pain relief or consistent relief.  ASK YOUR DOCTOR TO LET YOU TRY THIS. It is WONDERFUL! However, when you go off it you may have to use the Suboxone program. I did years ago and it worked to get me off the 75 mcg. dose I was on at the time. I'm only on 25 mcg now, but I weigh half as much as I did then so I figure that's why less works now.	M		4  years	10/16/2008
4	Fibromyalgia	Constipation, insomnia on first day of applying patch	Duragesic has been a God send for me. I was on Lorcet 10/650 4x a day and Ultram 50 4x a day, but it caused a lot of stomach upset and wore off too soon and it seemed I was constantly popping pills. With Duragesic I get constant pain relief. I've been on 50mcg for 4 years. There is no 'high' feeling, just relief from my chronic pain for 3 days without having to worry about having pills with me at all times. I do occasionally still get breakthrough pain(usually on the 3rd day) which I take Ultram 50 up to 4x a day to help control. I take a fiber supplement to help control the constipation, which works as long as I am consistant in taking it. I tried the generic patches for a couple months but they only lasted 2 days for me. The first day I felt 'high' on them, then, not much pain relief and sort of a'withdrawal feeling' on the 3rd day. So I went back to the brand, this medicine has given me more freedom in my daily life; I don't know how I ever existed without it.	F	34	4  days	9/5/2008
5	HepC related Perip. Neuropathy	none! I don't even have withdrawal syndrome anymore	I am on 4 100mcg patches every three days. I used to take MEGA doses of morphine (6000mgs +). I had edema in my legs, I lost my cough reflex and got double pneumonia, I collapsed one day and almost didn't wake up due to CNS collapse. I suffered supremely coming off all that morphine, but I would do it again in a heart beat. I am aware of my surroundings again, I can remember going to the movies with my wife, I can do little things around the house. I have my life back! thanks to Patches and suckers.

2	Spinal Disorders	Sweating, Nervousness, Anxiety	I started on the 12 mcg patch a month ago and cannot tolerate it. I think it can be helpful to a great many people but I am very hypersensitive to meds.  The biggest complaint I have was the non stop sweating which was supposed to abate and didn't.  I also absorbed it very quickly so by the 72 hour mark I was in withdrawals.  I did try to go to 48 hours but it knocked me for a loop.  And the most pain relief I had was probably for one MAYBE two days.  I just don't see the point of cycling like this and STILL having to take BT meds.		51	1  months	5/8/2008
1	MS	TERRIBLE SWEATING!  The slightest activity caused me to sweat completley through my clothing.  SO embarassing!	I had trouble getting the patch to stick with all the sweating.  Itching occured underneath the patch.  Without the feeling that pain meds give, I never felt that it was working.  Even at a high dosage.	F	31	8  months	5/2/2008
5	DDD Spine collapsing 3X Surg/fusion	First month diff slow breathing, but give it time.  You get use to it and no longer notice these issues.  Mild sleeplessness.  Euphoric when tired.  Black-outs when sleep deprived.  Standing-sitting-driving.  Its like sleep walking.  Only if I have no had even near adequate sleep.	WOW!  What a life changing drug.  Tried every other narcotic on the market for years ending with oxycontin 80mg.  I was gagging taking so many pills.  Though the patches must be used at 2 day intervals.   3 is just an uphill battle fighting to get it back under control.  Most will need Tegaderm or overlay from Jannsen.  Takes a month or two to get used to but when you get at the right dose you can live virtually pain free.  Don't come off it and don't run out by abusing them.  Major withdrawl, near seizure-like on high doses.  I am on 400mcg every 48hrs and have not seen anyone here even close.  Read that the highest you can go was 300.  Wrong!  Had Dr tell me he had people on 600.  I could easily go that high now after 7 years.  I was in a wheelchair and could not stand straight upright.  I have my life back.  Driving, housework, standing on concrete floors.  You name it.  I can go 90% of the day pain free with Actiq as a breakthru.  Had some issues with surgery anesthesia.

3	severe hip pain due to OA	extreme sleepiness, severe nausea/vomiting at higher dose.	I started on the 25 mcg patch for severe hip pain (I am getting hip replacement in June '08) and found it worked fairly well but I still needed 6-8 percocets (5mg) daily for BT pain. My doctor put me up to the 37.5 mcg patch (adding a 12.5 mcg to my 25 mcg) and within 30 hrs after application I developed a searing headache and intractable vomiting. I pulled thepatches off and started over the next day with the 25mcg. I tried the 37.5 two times, approximately 3 weeks apart, and had this same horrible result. Even with the 25mcg, I am so stoned when I sit down to relax that my eyes cross and I nod out. I can't read a book or watch tv b/c of this. Very annoying! I am seeing my PM doctor this week and will tell him I really can't take the 37.5 patch b/c of the N/V, and even wonder about the 25mcg making me impaired in general (I work in health care). I also have to say that the patch in general scares the bejeesus out of me - I worry I will go to bed and not wake up from the darn thing mis	F	49	2  months	1/12/2008
1	Crohn's Disease	Goose bumps, chills, large pupils,nausea, high blood pressure.  basically all of the symptoms of withdrawl from opiates...	I do not understand these effects but they are real. Happened both times that I used this drug.	M	30	2  days	1/6/2008
2	Surgical Abortion	Taken with Versed... I'm not sure which caused this, but my skin is over sensitive now, half of the time numb to the touch, the other half of the time everything touching my skin anywhere on my body feels like sandpaper. Chills, goosebumps, heat-aggrivated...And it's been over 30 hours since my procedure. My docrot told me it was my hormone level. Bull Shit.		F	20	1  days	9/8/2007Email
4	Crohn's Disease / Degenerative Disc	Weight Loss (20lbs in 4 months) Wears off in 2 1/2 days	This is the best thing I have been on so far.  Have taken just about every pain med out there.  Was on Avinzia (time released morphine) before this and it was like taking baby aspiran.  Have Crohns / Degenerative Disc Disease / 4 Herniated Discs / Osteoperosis and I'm only 45.  This has made life much easier than taken a dozen pills a day.  With the Avinzia I was still taking 3 Percocet a day with it.  Now I only take maybe 1 5/500 Vicoden a day, usually in the evening after work to give me a boost.  Some days I don't take any.  Now using 75 mcg patch.  Started on 25mcg for a week and it did nothing.  Then 50mcg for a month and now on 75mcg for the past 2 months.  Only problem is it starts to weart off sometimes after 2 1/2 days and that starts the withdrawal symptoms.  Restless legs and arms and chills.  Take zanaflex and vicodene to help.  Sometimes change the patch 8 hrs early.  Have been trying to time it out by changing the patch every 66hrs.  That way I only run out 1 day ahead o	M	45	4  months	9/5/2007

Constipation is chronic and Im a vegatarian.Best of all Opoids ever had in 17 years.	As a user of Duragesic 7.5 mcg for more than 6 years,It has totally changed my life for the better. I get Bioclisive Patchs to adhere over the Duragesic so theres no problem for adhedion. I havent gone to the pool since the patch but use a treadmill instead,the problem is mainly this drug makes me sweat terribly and Im fit.Generic sucks.	M	49	6  years	6/7/2007Email

2	Herniated Disk L4-L5	Constipation; Fatigue; irritability	My mood swings are horrible. I got pregnant and my doctor told me that it was safe to continue to use this drug while being pregnant.  Well my irritability was so bad that I would have SEVERE screaming episodes where I'd get so mad at whoever happened to be in the room.  I'd get to the point where I couldn't even breathe.  I ended up losing our baby at 18 wks pregnant because of it. I couldn't just stop taking the drug b/c of withdrawls and I had NO control over my anger. I am still on the drug and I still have so much anger.  I get so mad so easily and just scream and yell. I've never been like this before. The 3rd day is usually the worse while on this drug. The doctor really won't give me any advice on what to do. Does anyone else have this problem? If so please email me at ddifrancesco@huxcomm.net	F	36	6  months	3/30/2007Email
1	Broken vertebrae, degenerative back	Extremely tired, kept falling asleep anytime I relaxed.  Fell asleep at the wheel for a few seconds, fell asleep at stop lights waiting for them to change. Had to up the dosage becasue of withdrawal.	Be aware of this drug.  I had been on the duragesic patch 25mcg (had to move up to 50mcg) for 2 and a half years along with Actiq suckers.  I also changed this patch every 48 hours or the 3rd day was not good.  This stuff will get you so addicted you will think you can never get off of it.  It took three and a half months for me to work my way of this stuff by slowly dosing down.  It was three and a half months of hell which I spent in my bedroom.  Thank God I got off of it because when I switched insurance company's they just cut me off even with the doctor recommending I had to have it.  I told them I was on it for two and a half years and just couldn't quit because of withdrawal.  They told me "Oh well, just go to the hospital if you start withdrawal".  Three month later, after many phone calls and paper work, they approved the drug for me.  Thanks alot United Health Care.  Fortunately I had enough to carry me through the withdrawal stage.

3	Bone spurs C45 and herniated discs	Works great for the pain 75% of the time.  But lose a patch, no adhesive, all kinds of things can go wrong then you're in trouble.  I am on the 75 patch every other day.  Every third day I cry uncontrollably for about 2 hours then I'm fine.  The Mylan brand works much better than the Duragesic or the Sandoz.  Sandoz do not stick.  You have tape everywhere.  I woudld try anything first before resorting to this medication.  You are a prisoner to it.  Very bad side effects if you try to come off on your own.  I wish I had never started.  However, if your pain is so bad you can't walk some days then you have to make a decision.  It does consistently work well for pain.	Make sure on any good days that you are able to save a couple back for an emergency.  I had a steroid shot and one got accidentally removed.  Once the adhesive was not on there at all and it washed down the shower drain and once it just did not work.  My crazy doctor's office told me to take it off and stick it to a piece of paper and get the pharmacy to swap it.  What a joke?  I was stupid and believed them.  So, try to get a few ahead if you can and if you up the dosage save the old ones for these types of emergencies.  Always have a backup plan and make your appointments for your return RX a few days before you will actually run out.  I prefer the Mylan generic.  It works much better is less messy and noticable than the other ones.  Sticks better, too.  I don't have to use any tape with the Mylan brand.  Again, you had better try and have 4 or 5 extra (don't let them expire) on-hand just in case something happens to your patch.

5	neuropathy	Some nausea at first, which gradually disappeared, Constipation, which I treat with stool softeners. Some dizziness when standing up.	I have nerve damage in the nerve roots leading from C5-C7 caused by a herniated disk between C3/C4 and multiple stinosis in that same area that was repaired by 6.5 hours of surgery. I also have nerve damage from a stretched brachial plexus branch behind my left shoulder that was caused by the same fall that ruptured the C3/C4 disk. My left ACL joint is compressed causing chronic bursitis as a result of the damaged nerves. I spent 18 months post-surgery trying to treat the pain and inflammation with hydrocodone, steroid shots, Neurontin and Cymbalta. My blood pressure was averaging 160/90 during this period. A cardiology intern mentioned Fentanyl and after trying Neurontin and Cymbalta with terrible side effects, I mentioned it to my GP who agreed that it would be worth a try. My physical functionality is returning and my pain level is now at 1-2 instead of 5-6. This drug has saved my life.

Its like a new lease on life.  I'm wondering if other people get extremely tired and have to nap too. I have also lost at least 10 pounds from the loss of appetite.  Has anyone else had the same effect?I just wish I wasn't so tired however it is so much better to be tired then to be in constant unbearable pain that no pill aleviates.	F	36	4  months	9/27/2006

Have tried the Mylan and Sandoz (Sandoz is made by the same company as the brand) generic patches.  With morphine I had terrible nausea for the first 4-5 hours of the day, & mood changes.  I can eat!  Depression is lifting.  I can sleep all night!    It's amazing!  This has changed my life!  I did have some morphine withdrawal when starting, didn't know that you need to con't dose or 2 of morphine (depends)with the first patch. Patches seem to come off no matter what brand used.  A cover helps, better than tape.  I like  OpSite FlexFix, it comes in 11 yard rolls in 2 in and 4 in rolls that can be cut to size needed.  Save over $100 comparably on a roll over Bioclusive, & it is easier to put on (has this removable backing that makes it more stable, so it doesn't wrinkle up and get wasted).

Con't from prev:Many other companies make similar products to cover patches etc, but nothing else in rolls. I've found that using that a product like skin prep, or one like it (lots in the ostomy supply section), has cut down on irritation from the constant use of adhesive, & it doesn't leave the icky grey stuff behind. Go to your local surgical supply store & go nuts! Also, I can't drive after dark due to the fact that I can't see as well in the dark. It's like my headlights aren't on.

5	To get high/plus some back pain	Euphoria, being able to get to sleep at night, and I was more active in my daily life.	Wow, what can I say about this miraculous drug? I would drink the gel out of the patches and it felt like I was in heaven. Then I'd try the generic Mylan patches and it wasn't as good as the name brand, but it got me along pretty well. Whenever I'd have back pain or just want to get high, I'd put one in my mouth and things would get better.HOWEVER, withdrawal symptoms are the WORSE. It feels like you are practically dying and there's nothing to make you feel better.	F	17	3  years	8/10/2006

I have some breakthrough pain but, mostly, Duragesic helps tremendously.  I take a stool softener and wait until my bladder is quite full and those side effects present no problems.  I use the Bioclusive dressing to keep the patch on and it works brilliantly!  Change patch every 72 hours...no problems.  After over 2 years of unremitting pain, I was suicidal so Duragesic, literally, saved my life.	F	62	2  years	8/4/2006
5	neuropath pain,severe spasms,Fibrom	Initially for a few days I was tired, somewhat Skin irritation and minor constipation,& dry mouth, constipation. But all side effects go away after awhile.	Best med so far for me. On the 100 mg patch now.But for those of you who have problems with the patch sticking, You can use a cover patch and that keeps the patch from drying up. And you can get them FREE form Johnson and Johnson, and there is a program that will pay for your cost of the patch and it is Duragesic themselves. All you have to do is get your Doctor to fill out a form saying you need it, and for what reason, course they go by the income in the family and how many live in your home. But I'M sure just about anyone can get coverage. Now as far as the nausea goes, I take phenagan for other reason also, but you can take Atarax 25 or 50 mg for nausea and itching and it can help you sleep ask your Doc about this. I have been on the 100 mg for 4 years and we change my patch every 2 days and I do go through break through pain. Some days are better then others, but it just depends on the flair up I'M having.

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium.

After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS.

His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.

I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .

1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.

I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify.

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email
5	depression	none - maybe weight gain as is with everything it seems	Just a small increase recently really pulled me out of a slump	F	54	 20 mg 1X D	10/23/2010Email
5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.  Not useful at all.		F	29	3  months1mg 1X D	10/1/2010

3	Bipolar I	Increase in appetite (gained 2 lbs in 2 weeks), GI upset initially, migraines so bad had to discontinue it	I'm bipolar with mixed states. After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated. Who knows if it "helped my depression" because it made me an absolute basket case!	F	21	14  days2.5 mg 1X D	9/27/2010

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).	F	42	16  months30 mg 1X D	9/7/2010
3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.	F	35	4  weeks15 MG 1X D	8/29/2010Email
5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
