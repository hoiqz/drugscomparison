4	born with an anxiety/depressive disorder	Has a calming effect but fades away quickly	I've been taking Xanax for 45 years starting off with 0.0 mg and now 4 mg/daily and sometimes more up to 8 mg. At my age I don't think it would be worth the problems associated with withdrawal. I'd still be left with my anxiety/depressive disorder. I'll just blunder along.

1	sleep and anxiety	depression, increased anxiety, depersonaliization, derealization, fear.	DO NOT TAKE THIS MED for longer than a week or two. IT IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE to the body, meaning your body needs more for the same effect after a short amount of time. DO YOUR RESEARCH. It is HELL coming off this stuff. Ive been off for 11 months and I still have symptoms and do not feel good.	F	42	8  months 3X D	7/19/2012Email
3	airplane anxiety	made me very sleepy, I don't know how anyone could get addicted to this as it just makes you sleepy	I took this for airplane anxiety, it pretty much knocked me out (1 mg) so in that regard I guess it did work because how can you be anxious when you are asleep?  BUT, it was not pleasant and I felt groggy later on.  I do not understand how anyone would want to take more of this drug.	F	28	5  times1 mg 1X D	7/8/2012
5	Anxiety	Drowsiness like that of one alcoholic drink for the first 20 - 30 minutes.	This stuff works very well!  Yes, it is highly addictive and should not be taken daily unless you want to become dependent on it.  I take this on an emergency basis only.  Maybe once a month if things are too stressful for me to handle.  I take 0.5mg and 20 minutes later, POOF, all anxiety is completely and totally gone and Im left with a feeling of peaceful calmness washing over me for the next few hours.  GREAT STUFF FOR OCCASIONAL USE ONLY!!!	F	26	1  years0.5 MG 1X AN	5/4/2012
5	GAD PTSD	Mild sleepiness	I was prescribed Xanax for Anxiety and it has been a life saver, although I'm not sure I can ever come off of it. But then I take it because I worry too much... So for now, I am just thankful for it!	F	34	2  years.5 2X D	4/27/2012

5	panic disorder	I know to never go over the prescribed amount ....ever ...I don't always have to take 3 pills a day but that is the most I can take....It helps me very much with my panic disorder	I have seen people have seizures from coming off this med abruptly. It is very addicting so take it no more often than prescribed....ever.	F	57	10  years0.5 mg 3X D	4/2/2012Email
4	Panic attacks, insomnia	No side effects while taking this drug. Withdrawal symptoms: mostly a constant smell of burning plastic that lasted for weeks.	I took this drug after suffering severe side effects from Clarithromycin (Biaxin): panik attacks, restless mind, severe insomnia, etc. Alprazolam helped me get through the worst of it and get some much needed sleep at night. Unfortunately it's highly addictive as I've come to learn, even at its lowest dosage. I would not recommend taking this drug for as long as I did, getting off of it is difficult (I'm still taking half a dose every night).	M	39	2  years0.25 MG 1X D	2/2/2012Email
5	Panic attacks, anxiety disorder	None	Literally saved my life.  Was suffering panic attacks for 8 years. Panic became almost continuous causing extreme high blood pressure.  Doctors kept telling me nothing was wrong with me.  After years of fear and panic, a blood vessel ruptured in my eye from the high blood pressure and a doctor finally diagnosed me with panic disorder and put me on blood pressure medicine and Xanax.  It literally saved my life since he said the blood vessel could have ruptured in my brain causing a stroke.  The panic was causing my extreme high blood pressure and once it was controlled, I was fine.	F	55	20  years 3X D	1/28/2012
2	Panic Attacks	It made me groggy, incoherent, and brought me into hell which people call withdrawal after only 1 month of use.	I would strongly advise against taking this drug for longer than a month. This is a very addictive drug. If you've been taking it longer than a month and try to stop...good luck. Benzo withdrawal is possibly the worst experience your body will endure in like, and it often goes on for months.  Be wise with this pill.	M	26	1  months4 mg 2X D	10/28/2011
2	Anxiety/Panic Disorder	Some relief but it wasn't worth the withdrawal.	If I could go back, I would only have taken this on extreme emergency days. I think the drug is probably OK in that regard. Even then, I'd probably recommend Valium or a longer-lasting benzo.  Withdrawal was awful. I'm 5 months into withdrawal and just now starting to feel human.  You really need to weigh your pros/cons when using this. Some people don't have much problem, but many seem to. Very hard to come off of, and I took it at LOW doses, conservatively and tapered slowly. Still had a horror coming off. Once in a while, probably OK. Daily... you're really taking some risk.	M	43	8  months.25 2X D	10/28/2011
5	Anxiety	Relief from GAD and Social Phobia is profound with few side effects.  Nothing else has worked as well.	I have tapered off benzos before, so I am sure a slow taper will work for me if it's necessary to stop Xanax XR.	M	56	3  years2 mg XR 1X D	10/4/2011
5	Panic Attacks	None unless you consider craving foods you don't normally like.	Best benzo takes effect within 5-10 minutes if taken under the tongue. I've taken Klonopin, and Valium. This is the big hitter. If you want to get rid of panic attacks, you have to be prescribed this. Yeah it's addicting so take it as prescribed. I take as needed. Somedays 1, and somedays 3.	M	31	5  years2MG 2X D	9/13/2011
5	anxiety, insomnia	None	This medication worked wonders for me.  I used to feel anxious at bedtime and couldn't sleep.  My brain just wouldn't shut off.  I would worry about everything.  Now I take one every night before bed and I'm able to sleep like a baby and have no anxiety anymore.  This medication saved me.	F	52	5  years.5 1X D	8/9/2011Email
1	Panic attacks	Addiction is real for those who have addiction issues, and hence the two views.  This drug is the devil for those with addictive behavior.	Report your doctor to their state license board if they prescribe this too liberally.	F	46	3  years2 3X D	7/24/2011

5		It has been a blessing for me.  I take it for paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.  It also has helped me when I feel anxious when speaking to a group.		F	69	 1.5 mg 3X D	5/5/2011
5	anxiety/panic attack		This medication has made it possible for me to enjoy life.  Before it, I didn't sleep, had racing thoughts, and was phobic about so many things.  Now, I take one during the day if I need it (helps with pms symptoms wonderfully!) and I take two at night before bed to help me fall asleep.  I'm much calmer and rarely experience panic attacks anymore.  I'm sure I'm dependent on it by now but I don't take more than what's prescribed, if that, and it helps me be 'normal.'  If it's between dependent and phobic, I'll take dependence.	F	36	2  years.5 mg 3X AN	4/20/2011
2	Panic attacks, anxiety	Very mild sedation for about 20-30 minutes. About the same as drinking a single beer. Doesn't make me feel foggy or out-of-it.	It helped reduce the background anxiety that I always have, but doesn't help at all with the panic attacks. So it's better than nothing but I wasn't impressed. Maybe the dose is too low. I don't want to take more and risk addiction, though, so I'm asking the doctor to switch me to something else.	M	31	3  days0.25 mg 3X D	4/6/2011
1	anxiety	Blurred vision, cog fog, burning skin, heart palpitations, everything you can think of.	DO NOT TAKE FOR LONGER THAN 2 WEEKS !! NOT FOR DAILY REGULAR LONG TERM USE. READ ABOUT BENZO WITHDRAWALS ON GOOGLE. THIS WORKED FOR SIX MONTHS UNTIL MY BODY DEVELOPED TOLERANCE, AND THEN IT RUINED MY LIFE.	M	34	7  months.25mg 3X D	1/2/2011

3	anxiety & panic attacks	Sleepy and Basically no life	I DISAGREE ON WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT TAKING THIS PILL AND BEING HAPPY IF YOU NOTICE THEY ARE ALREADY ADDICTED TO THE PILL IF THEY HAVE BEEN ON IT FOR MORE THAN 6 MONTHS THEY ARE DEPENDANT ON IT. NO ONES LIFE IS HAPPY IF U DEPEND ON SOMETHING TO MAKE IT HAPPY. I TOOK THIS PILL AND XANAX FOR A MONTH WHEN I EDUCATED MY SELF ON PANICK DISORDER AND ANXIETY I LEARNED TO CONTROL IT MYSELF SO IF I CAN DO IT YOU CAN DO IT PLEASE DONT TAKE THIS IT WILL DESTROY YOU LIKE IT DESTROYED ME THE MONTH I WAS TAKING IT I FELT I HAD NO LIFE I WAS ALWAYS DROWSY AND SLEEPY. BE STRONG AND DONT SET yOURSELF UP FOR ADDICTION IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT THEN USE IT AS A BRIDGE TO CROSS TO STABILITY BE STRONG AND TAKE CONTROL THATS ALL YOU NEED. GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS.

4	insomnia & anxiety for dental visit	None	This is the generic for of Xanax.  I take this if I have eaten because Ambien is worthless if I take it after eating.  This works great.  I also take 2 pills (0.5 mg) before dental visits for anxiety.	F	40	6  months	5/28/2008
5	depresia			M	27	2  years	6/28/2005
5	severe anxiety, wasn't able to cope	The only side effects I experienced was on the first day I took it I was able to take a long nap after several sleepness nights.This medication gave me back the ability to think, work, focus,and get some enjoyment out of my life and give some enjoyment back to my family.  I cannot say enough about it.	I would highly recommend this medication for anyone who is goingthrough an extremely difficult period in their lives or who is suffering from panic attacks.  You just can't control panic attacks by yourself.  This medication helps you to be normal again.	F	57	6  years	1/25/2005Email
