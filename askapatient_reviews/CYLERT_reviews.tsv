5	AADD	none	Got stuff done. Had muscle control issues that were resolved. Hand eye coordination improved. Actually could pay attention to what I was doing in real time instead of thinking what I should have done.	M	56	20  years112mg 1X D	5/14/2012
4	to add some perk to Marplan MAOI	Became a bit hypomanic on this med, having too much fun, so to speak.	It was quite pleasant and gave me the extra drive I do enjoy.  Now take Cymbalta which has good push so I don't need a supplement.  But this is an interesting med.  Originally developed for the military to help soldiers pull 24-hour shifts awake, but it didn't work well for that.  DOES work well as a mood elevator.	M	59	1  years	3/24/2006Email
