5	headaches, wisdom tooth extraction	None, it was a great drug	It worked well, It helped me recover from my wisdom teeth extraction (4 done all at the same time), and helped with the swelling and pain. I used the 200mg strength pills, and took usually 400-600mg as I thought i needed it.(this was just my regimen, and is not indended to give guidance or advice on how you should take the medicine). Always contact your doctor before starting a new medication. Thanks,	F	24	14  days	7/16/2009
