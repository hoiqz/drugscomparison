2	IIH	I have only got memory loss, I don't get any tingling but do have trouble sleeping. And I take 1 x 250mg 4 times a day		F	21	4  weeks250	2/3/2013Email
2	IIH/PTC	Initial symptoms: frequent urination, excessive thirst, cloudy urine, insomnia, acid reflux, taste changes in carbonated drinks, feet falling asleep, cold sensitivity1-2 months: drowsiness, brain fog, memory loss, facial tingling, moderate joint pain and stiffness, insomnia, moderate thirst, appetite loss3-5 months: cognitive issues (concentration, memory, etc.), facial tingling, mild thirst, less appetite loss	So far the side effects haven't been worth it. My papilledema is exactly the same as it was before. Meanwhile, tasks like writing and retaining information are painful and difficult. Writing, doing simple math, recalling facts, and memorizing are much harder than they ever have been. If I ever miss a dose or take it late, I get painful tingling in my face that spreads to the rest of my body. This sometimes also happens if I have caffeine. Can't drink soda (but don't mind so much because I never liked soda anyway.) Joint problems have improved and the thirst has calmed down a bit (though I still need about 3-4 liters a day to feel satisfied.) I don't have appetite loss so much now. My sleep schedule has gotten really messed up - it's hard for me to get to sleep before midnight, so I usually get 4-6 hours and then end up passing out for 3-5 hours in the afternoon (which was happening before I started taking Diamox.) I've also found that my sleep at night is very light and restless. Overall I'm not enjoying this. I really hope that I start seeing some improvement soon. I'm tired of feeling dull, tired, and stupid all the time.	F		5  months500mg 2X D	12/15/2012Email
5	Cranial pressure, headaches and eye	Bp dropped suddenly to 90/80 without warning. Couldn't move or speak for 5 days. Bp seems ok now, but constant nausea and diarreah. Was good for headaches but I am miserable and weak now . Dr still hasn't called me back yet. probably will change neuros.		F	60	4  weeks500	12/11/2012Email

5	Papilledema	tingling in hands, feet and head. loss of appetite. Some lethargy when starting the medication.	I also had a tremor in my hands but I was also taking prednisone concurrently and would attribute that side effect to the prednisone. I found I was hit quite hard with the side effects of both medications at once including from the prednisone insomnia. I lost a few kilos but it didn't concern me and could also be attributed to the large amounts of water I was drinking. Although the side effects od Diamox are quite significant I found that drinking as much water as I physically could really made a difference to the severity of side effects. I don't drink soft drinks so I didn't have a concern with changing taste in regard to my other food. I would highly recommend just drinking as much as you can at strategic times when you're near a loo! I would get up to about 6L most days but I discussed privately with my boss that I wasn't 'slacking off' in regard to my frequent toilet breaks and she was quite understanding and discrete. When I was able to drink mass amounts of water I found I handled the meds quite well. The medication has done all it was prescribed to do. My optic discs have reduced as much as they are going to and I will be coming off the drugs in about 2months. I was able to avoid having a shunt surgically put in and neuro surgery so I don't feel I can complain as it saved my eyesight! There has been a delay in my husband and I being able to start a family, we wanted to stay on the side of caution for the sake of the babies health, at the end of the day I prefer eye si	F	29	18  months500 max 3X D	10/9/2012Email
4	Psuedotumor Cerebri/IHT	Tingling in fingers, feet, lips, elbows, & knees. Loss of appetite, fatigue, difficulty concentrating. metallic taste to some foods. Cold air/water/food, etc makes all of the tingling areas tingle more. Especially cold food, the lip tingling gets pretty bad. Forgetfulness & trouble sleeping. It's important to drink plenty of fluids and get a good nights rest. A multivitamin may be helpful for those who have appetite loss; make sure you get all your nutrients. The symptoms are really intense the 1st couple of weeks and they do somewhat improve as you continue taking the drug.		F	25	6  months1500	7/12/2012Email
3	intercraniul hypertention	I have to lay down for 4 hours after taking if I stand up my head hurts so bad and tingling in my heals.

4	IIH/PTC	Some tingling in hands and heels and my upper lip area.  Slight confusion - not so easy to concentrate and a bit forgetful.	After reading all of the comments on this drug, I was afraid to take it.  But so far, so good.  These are side-effects I can live with.  My appetite has decreased and I still have enough energy to workout twice a day.  Losing weight is a huge factor in recovery, and I'm determined to do it.  I'm not letting the Diamox take me down.

1	Pseudotumor cerebri	INCREDIBLY lethargic.  Foggy brain, memory loss, nausea, tingling in the fingers and toes.  Metallic taste with carbonated drinks and beer.  Weight loss, loss of appetite.	At first the diamox was a wonder drug, meaning my headaches and the pressure in my head subsided. Then, I slowly began feeling horrible.  Headaches would return. Lack of energy,   I developed swollen fatty knots under my skin.  Found out that it was because of the diamox.  I have been off of this drug for two weeks and I feel like my life has changed. The knots have decreased in size. People instantly see me and notice a shine skin and and all together better well being.  This is a TERRIBLE drug and I am so thankful that I am off of it.

4	IIH	I am on 1000mg per day and the side effects have been pretty status quo compared to what I've read on this board. That is: tingling in hands and feet, nausea, loss of appetite, some hair loss, foggy brain and difficulty remembering things. The most severe symptoms for me were the weakness, body aches and complete lack of energy.	I hope that this information can help someone else the way it has helped me. I went to my general practitioner and asked her if she knew of any ways to manage the symptoms so that I could function and not fall behind in my program (I am a phD candidate and am supposed to be working on my dissertation and graduating in the next year-I can't afford to not function). She told me that my symptoms were most likely due to dehydration (I had been drinking about 80oz a day). She increased me to 4 liters! It is A LOT OF WATER, but by the next morning I felt better. I have energy again and I don't hurt. My hair has also stopped falling out. I still have tingles, but they're annoying more than debilitating. She said a good test to determine if you are where you need to be hydration-wise (especially with this drug), is to continue increasing water intake until your urine is no longer yellow-but clear.   My neurologist just put me on lacix as well, so I am most likely going to have to drink more, and watch electrolytes. Anyhow, I knew that I would have to increase my water intake because this drug was a diuretic, but I had NO idea as to how much. I needed to share though because it really has made all of the difference in the world!	F	30	2  weeks500MG 2X D	2/3/2012Email
3	IIH / Pseudotumor cerebri	ringing in ears (all day), numbness in fingers (sometimes painful), knee pain, tired, brain fog, daily diarrhea, loss of appetite, anything carbonated tastes like steel, weight loss, acidosis	I started with 500 MG daily and was taken up to 2,750 MG and got very sick with metabolic acidosis because of diamox.  I'm back to 1,500 - 2,000 MG a day with better results.  It takes 6 weeks to get used to this med and the ringing ears and diarrhea is probably the worse part for me.  The positive is that it does reduce the head pressure and makes it possible for me to work and function. I'm still waiting to see my eyes get better though.  I am not overweight but have lost 20 pounds while on this because I never feel hungry.	F	44	3  months1000 MG 2X D	2/3/2012
3	IIH	The usual with tingling,brain fog,feeling the cold alot more than normal,stomach acid,pains in the legs,heart palpalations but worst of all Kidney Stones now 4 times in 5 years be aware that even drinking loads of water you stand a good chance of getting them!	I have been off and on Diamox many times as I keep getting kidney stones,every time I start back on them I get the usual tingling and feeling like I'm a dumb ass all over again,I have also had to change my job to an indoor one as the fatigue was just too much for me,as for helping with the headaches they actually make them worse at first,if you can put up with all the horrible side effects when you start taking these and believe me you will want to stop, then eventually your body kind of gets use to it,only for you to start with horrible leg cramps and feeling cold when you go to bed and sometimes can't get to sleep which makes your headache even more and so the circle of shite continues until you either give up on them or get a shunt.The only thing that this drug did for me was make me a stronger willed person	M	45	5  years250 2X D	1/22/2012
3	Pseudotumor Cerebri	Intermittent tingling in hands, mouth and feet. Cloudy urine, but no increase in urination even though I have increased my water intake. Lack of appetite. Can't drink anything carbonated. Very tired. Hard to find words sometimes. Seems like I stutter more than before. Cold all the time now.	When I had my first LP I was at a pressure of 43. I was drained down to 20, then four days later was back up to 27 even after being on Diamox 500 mg/day for four days. Drained again to 14, then ended up with a spinal headache. Had a blood patch done, where they placed 20 cc of my own blood in the epidural space. Spinal headache gone. Now up to 250mg 4x/day. Both of my optic nerves have hemorrhaged and I have lost some of my color vision. Severe eye pain and pressure and headache are for the most part gone now. Hoping that this medicine works so that I don't have to have surgery.	F	33	3  weeks250 4X D	1/15/2012Email
3	IIH/Pseudo Tumor Cerebri	Tingling/pins and needles in fingers and toes and occasionally face (sometimes very painful), frequent urination, "mind fog", depression, headache, severe fatigue, change in taste of carbonated beverages.	Almost all of the side effects go away if you drink lots of water! Also, as you get used to the medication it gets much better (it just takes a few weeks to adjust). It works! My CSF pressure went down and optic nerve swelling decreased. However, every 2 months or so my IIH symptoms (visual problems and headache) come back and they need to adjust the dosage. I am trying to be optimistic that they will find a dosage that works for me, and combined with weight loss my IIH will go away. Don't assume the worst with this drug! At first it seems absolutely awful but it works and the side effects go away.	F	21	6  months500 MG 2X D	1/14/2012Email

5	Pseudo tumor celibri	Tingly in hands, feet and face. Tired. Hard to grasp words, lost some weight.  I was diagnose with pseudo tumor celibri 6 years ago. I was not able to move from my bed due to the extreme headache. They were so bad that I would have blackouts. I started taking this drug and slowly I stopes having pain, lost weight, pressure in my head and optic nevlrve decrese. I would take up to 4000mg a day with topamax. Now I only take 750mg and thank GOD, no pain. It gets better! Believe it! I am proof of it!!!!!!		F	30	4  years750	12/11/2011Email

Memory problems & concentration problems; Dizziness;  Diarrhea, Taste changes, I am always freezing even when it was 90 degrees this summer, some vision changes	After running mri's, every test you can think of and 62 blood tests they finally diagnosed me with PTC In Jan 2011. LP was 25 took me down to 17 then i had another in Nov it was 25-29 took me down to 17 ugh not sure what good the meds are doing if its not lowering my pressures but it sure is helping with some of the headaches!!  My neurologist tried me on topamax and I had an allergic reaction so she put me on Diamox, had an allergic reaction then my husband was researching and found that the cause of my reaction was cause of how fast they upped my dosage. So I started over and am up to 4000mg a day. Its helped alot till the seasons changed and now the headaches are back full force. Sometimes I wonder why I go without my Diet Pepsi so Ill go without and have me a soda and I rememeber quick enough!! The side effects suck but even with the weather changes here what the diamox is controlling is so much better than what it could be!!	F	33	8  months1000 4X D	12/3/2011Email

4	Pseudotumor Cerebi	Severe tingling in hands and feet, tiredness, soda tasted really weird, things looked weird	My first neurologist gave me a small dosage, when I visited my neuroptomologist from John Hopkins, he told me that the dosage wasn't enough to do anything, so he raised my dosage 4x. I recently was taken off the medicine	F	19	3  months250 2X D	11/2/2011Email

4	Idiopathic IntercranialHypertension	Tingling in hands, feet, knees and spider web feeling on face. Decreased appetite. Dry itchy skin. Dry mouth, sometimes get confused.	I was diagnosed with IIH Sept 8 2011. It was nice to actually put a name to the "thing" that was causing issues in my daily life. I was waking up in the morning completely blind and it would last for about 30-45 seconds. I brought this to my doctor's attention and he sent me to an Opthalmoloist. From there I was seen by my neurologist who ordered the LP. I have had only 1 LP with an opening pressure of 32 that when we were done taking off a few tubes of fluid for testing went down to 12. Since the LP I have felt that my head doesn't feel as "full" as it was before and I am no longer waking up blind. It take a few seconds for my eyes to adjust, but I can see. I was started on the Diamox just after the LP and to me it seems that it is working. I am VERY thankful even with all the side effect for this drug. It was terrifying to me to think that I might not see my daughters grow up or to see my Husband return from his deployment next summer. There are so many FUTURE memories that this drug is going to help me see. I am so happy I came across this page it really helps to know others are having the same experiences I am. THANK YOU ALL!!! =)	F	37	1  months250mg 3X D	10/16/2011Email
3	PsuedoTumor Cerebri	Tingling in hands, feet, face, arms, and mouth; Memory problems & concentration problems; Dizziness; Vomiting; Diarrhea; Sharp stomach pains; Drowsiness; Change in taste.	Diamox helps a little for my PTC, but the side effects happen 24/7. It almost makes me stop taking it until I realize just how much it's helping my head. So if you think you'll have a problem with constantly being really tired, always having your hands or feet tingle, being sore or dizzy all the time, having an upset stomach, or not being able to taste things right.. Don't take this. Although it really does help, and so I don't mind the side effects TOO much.. Just know it'll make you feel pretty icky sometimes, but just fight through it and you'll be fine.

3	pseudo Tumor Cerebri	the usual, tingling in face and feet, blurred vision at first but then improved vision, bitter taste with carbonated beverages, nasuea.	Started using using about five  years ago 250mg usually I would get relief in a few weeks.  Six months ago another episode was cured by the same dose, but this time it didn't seem to work, so I doubled the dose to 500mg 2X per day still no relief.  My symptoms are pressure and fluid probably CSF in my ears.  The pressure varies throughtout the day cannot correlate with anything,  I missed a dose last week and it felt like my head was going to explode.  Not sure what to do I definitely don't want to have a shunt too risky for infection, so I'm waiting this one out.  I started with pseudo tumor when I was abour 20 and weighed about 120 lbs, I certainly didn't fit the usual profile.  Had surgery to repair a CSF leak in my left ear in 91 it returned a few years later then faded away only to return again and again,  Now both ears are full.  Anyone have a similar experience?

4	Pseudotumor Cerebri- IIH	Tingling in hands and feet (Paraesthesia), "Spider web" sensation on face, Taste alterations (Parageusia), Low blood pressure, Loss of Appetite, Dizziness, Fatigue, Short term memory loss, Confusion, Headaches	Went into the ER with vision loss, severe headache, and dizziness after visiting my Neuro-ophthalmologist who found Optic Nerve Swelling (Papilledema). After an MRI, Cranial CT Scan, and an Angiogram the possibility of a brain tumor or Epidural/Subdural Hematoma were ruled out. I had an LP, and pressure of 62ppm was dropped to 32 ppm. Four days later I had another LP to drop my pressure from 32ppm to 12ppm. I was put on the Diamox and Naproxen. I have had 4 more LP's since I was diagnose with IIH 3 months ago. The side effects are sometimes unbearable, but it's slowly starting to work. My doctor told me to give it 3 to 4 months to allow the medicine to start working properly. And so far my pressure has gone down slowly with each LP i have had. I have lost 35 pounds, and have since then gone off birth control since those are two very harmful factors when dealing with IIH. Take magnesium supplements, and eat lots of potassium (that will help with the tingling), drink PLENTY of fluids (since your peeing everything out), and excercise. The more I do, the more energized I feel... If you're willing to give it a chance, and it's working for you, STICK WITH IT! It's better than the alternative (Cerebral Shunt). I am still having LP's done on a fairly regular basis... But all in all I am counting my blessings.	F	21	3  months500 MG 3X D	8/5/2011Email

Saw neurologist after seeing my regular doc 3x. Had LP 2 days after seeing neurologist. My pressure was at 43 and had 14cc of fluid removed. Having another LP and possibly a 3rd. Increased my Diamox from 1x a day at 250mg to 2x a day at 250mg. Had double vision for over a month and it is now starting to go away after taking diamox 2x a day.

5	Psuedo-tumor Cerebri	At first there was tingling in the toes and fingers, Spider-web feeling on my lips, frequent bathroom visits, loss of sex drive, carbinated drinks and chocolate have a metalic taste, dry mouth	My optical nerves were swelled at 4+ and my vision was almost gone. It would completely go for about 30 sec or so when I would stand or move my head fast. I had major blind spots in both eyes and the rest of my field of vision was blurry, so bad to the point I couldn't drive anymore. And headaches... the worst ever! But I have always had headaches.  Went to my eye doctor and he determined thats probably what it was. Sent me to a neurologist. She done a spinal tap and my back pressure was at 42. They drained it down to 15 and started me on Diamox the same day. This was 45 days ago. I have visited my dr.'s since then and my optical nerves have still been swollen to 4+. My neurologist has increased Diamox by 1/250mg pill every week to where now I am on 7 a day. 2 days ago I went back to my eye dr. and my optical nerve swelling is at 1. He says this is an indication that my back pressure is going down as well. I am dieting and currently have lost 13 lbs. The hardest part is not being able to drink dt. dr. pepper, but then this may be a good thing to as soda makes you retain water!!! The other symptoms are nothing I can't deal with in order to be able to see my children grow up. THANKS DIAMOX!!!	F	31	45  days1750mg 1X D	6/17/2011Email

Side effects are piling on but there doesn't seem to be another choice for me. I'm hoping to be able to finish my semester at college. Does help my IIH headaches, only get mild headaches about 1-2 times a day. vision got better but hasn't for a few days, crossing my fingers on that.	F	21	2.5  weeks 4X D	3/18/2011Email
4	Psuedo Tumor	Tingling in hands, feet, leg cramps, nausia, appitite loss, unable to drink carbonated drinks	I have been taking this on and off for 2 years. I am not over weight and the doctors have no idea why this is happening, and yet they still tell me to lose weight. I weigh 145 lbs and I am 5 foot 7 inches. When taking the diamox like I am supposed to it makes me tired, and I lose my ambition. My condition has gotten better, but as soon as I take a lower dose or not take it at all, my migraines come back. It is like a lose lose situation.	F	22	2  years250 3X D	3/8/2011
4	Pseudo Tumor Cerebri/IIHT	Pins and needles in hands and feet, occasional stabbing pains in legs, slightly light headed, severe fatigue for the first few days.	I started taking the generic for the pseudo tumor cerebri a few months ago then lost my insurance. I was on it just long enough to get up to the 1000mg a day and past the extreme fatigue. In myself, the fatigue went for about 2 weeks then once I started losing the weight I got some energy back. Had to make a complete diet change to aid weight loss. Now have some financial assistance so back on the generic diamox. It was starting to work for me so I'm hoping to get that back. It seems to be a 50/50 chance that it will work for someone, everyone's body chemistry is different. For me this is the only thing standing between me and surgery. LPs are out of the question, the first (and only) one that I had put me in the ER 4 times with the worst migraine I have ever had. Getting past the initial side effects is my big challenge but I'm down 60lbs with 55lbs to go and I think this will work for me... I hope!One important thing to remember is that Diamox (and generic) destroys electrolites so you need to be replacing them. I've found that making a drink that's about 70% pedialyte and 30% ginger ale makes it easiest to get them back. Also I am prone to kidney stones, and diamox can produce them even in people who've never had one so hitting my 4 liter a day limit on water is super important.	F	29	3  weeks250 2X D	3/4/2011Email

I dont know if glaucoma is a side effect of the Pseudutomor cerebri but the both presented themselves around the same time. I've gone from being super active to a couch potatoe, when diagnosed to weighted 254lbs my last weight in was 232lbs. purely from loss of apetite I'm so tired I can barely get my mail.

Don't let it win! You have to be in control and not let it control you.	I am a "different" sort of case, my doctors would say. I am 4'11 and 110 lbs. Before taking the drug I had a spinal tap to reduce my pressure and weighed 115 WITH muscle. After taking I don't have as much energy to run, but am starting to get back into it. I've noticed if I remember to take the medicine at the same time each day my body and mind react better to it. I have just began to really get used to it. Instead of running 3-5 miles per day, like I used to, I have resently started a new routine to help with seasonal blues and not being able to do as much. I walk .5 miles on the treadmill (until sunnier weather), run 1 mile and walk .5 more. I recommend doing as much excersize as possible to increase your energy level! It helps with energy and mentality. No more excuses and complaining, just do it :)	F	30	10  months1000mg 2X D	1/27/2011Email
4	Pseudotumor Cerebi	Tingling in hands and feet; aching in legs; heartburn, nausea, dizziness and afternoon drowsiness; decrease of headaches and appetite; increased volume of tinnitus...	LP relieved pressure of 28 ppm to 12 ppm - removed 4 cc's of CSF. Trying to drink 2 glasses of fluid with each dosage.  By cutting back sugar intake and sodium intake (approx. 1,500 mg a day) - have lost 10 lbs. in past three weeks, with one lb a day since starting medication.  First three days, only took half a pill to ease into side effects.	F	46	5  days250 4X D	1/19/2011
5	pseudotumor cerebri with sys lupus	Tingling of the hands, feet, and face. Feet and hands stay cold all the time. Loss of appetite as well as no longer able to drink carbonated drinks. Insomnia, with extreme fatigue. Loss of weight and frequent urination like a pregnant woman!	This medication is saving my life. I went from having seizures and being practically blind to being able to drive again and be seizure free. However, I no longer feel like doing anything but laying on the couch. I have constant kidney pain and miss Dr. Pepper so bad...but it's for a good cause!!!	F	27	45  days500 MG 2X D	12/28/2010Email
5	IIH	Paraesthesia (pins and needles), taste changes (especially to carbonated drinks), ++ fatigue, dry mouth and eyes, lowered insulin requirements/hypoglycemia (Type 1 Diabetes), sensitivity to the cold, constipation.	Diamox has greatly improved my IIH symptoms. I rarely have pressure headaches (unless I forget to take a dose). And the papilloedema in my eyes has completely resolved. The intensity of the side-effects of Diamox has somewhat diminished the longer I have stayed on the medication. Pins and needles, hypoglycemia, constipation and sensitivity to the cold continue. The fatigue and dehydration were incredible when I first started on the medication. Whenever I "stopped" I'd fall asleep. It was nothing to 'nap' for 6 hours. I needed eye drops several times a day for lubrication. I've also lost weight (10kg/22lbs) despite eating more for the frequent hypoglycemic episodes.	F	35	17  months250mg 3X D	11/19/2010Email
3	Glaucoma	When I first started taking Diamox at age 14, and any time I've increased the dosage, I got tingling in my face, limbs, and even "glutes", but nothing very serious. At 24, I went off the drug for a couple of years, and when I resumed, I got the tingling and the cold plus indigestion, irregularity, trouble concentrating, frequent "spacing out" spells, crippling depression, and chronic, debilitating fatigue.	I have a love-hate relationship with Diamox. It is the only drug that has controlled my eye pressure, but it makes me feel like a wrung-out dishrag. I am legally blind, but it is thanks to mountains of Diamox and a few outstanding ophthalmologists that I am not totally blind. However, as I have gotten older, it seems the side effects have gotten worse. I've missed work, appointments, birthdays, even my grandmother's funeral because I was just too exhausted. If I manage to run an errand or just stay up a full day, I have to sleep 18-20 hours a day for the next few days to "recharge my battery". I've wanted to get off this stuff for years; I'm trying a new surgery next year. Diamox may be saving my sight, but it's eating my life.	F	44	30  years375 mg 2X D	11/18/2010Email
5	PseudoTumor Cerebri w/ Papilledema	Severe abdominal cramping/bloating/pain. Heartburn. Mild tingling in feet, hands and face. Significantly altered taste, unable to taste carbonation in soda, increased need for sleep, metabolic acidosis, decreased libido and significant weight loss.	During initial lumbar punctures, hospitalization and diagnosis my headaches got much worse than before treatment. Headaches are now about once a week. Papilledema got much better, first 3/4 in both eyes @hospital and now 1/4 and 2/4. In almost 5 months of being on Diamox I have lost 37lbs. Starting at 226lbs down to 189lbs. I try to eat easily digested foods because the few times I get hungry I have heartburn and cramp the next day. I need tons of sleep and yawn several times per hour. In my case, ALL the side effects suck but I've tried and tried and never had enough motivation to loose weight. Being overweight is my only risk factor for Pseudotumor cerebri so loosing the weight could potentially cure me.	F	22	4.5  months750mg 2X D	11/13/2010Email
2	psuedotumor cerebri	Tingling in heads and feet, sometimes around my mouth.  Tired all the time.  Stupid, forgetful and just not myself.  Dizzy and clumsy. Soreness in neck and shoulders.	I will deal with the side effects to save my vision....but I wish there was another way.  I can not function like this.  I am only a fraction of what I used to be.	F	37	3  months500 2X D	10/9/2010
3	Pseudo tumor cerebri	Pins and needles feeling on bottoms of feet, knees, and mouth, also in hands, but that has been less frequent. It's not painful, just annoying. Frequent heart burn. Ringing in ears. More frequent urination.	I have not had a migraine since I started this medication, so it has helped in that reguard. Not sure if it has helpedwith my vision yet. The side effects are mostly just annoying. Acidic foods make the tingling  in the mouth worse.	F	29	14  days500mg 2X D	10/8/2010

2	Pseudotumor cerebri	Tingling in feet, hands, lips. Dizziness. Frequent urination. Loss of memory. Forgetfulness. Soda taste really bad.	I had spinal tap on July 30,2010. Pressure was mildly elevated. 2 weeks later went back to Nero and he put me on Diamox 500mg twice daily. So been on med for 7 days now. Hasen't inpressed me yet. I will give it some more time and hope it starts to help. Still have everyday pressure headaches and my ears really feel like alot of pressure in them.	F	24	7  days500mg 2X D	8/19/2010Email
3	Epilepsy	Lack of sex drive. I used to want to have sex every day, but about two weeks after I started having diamox my sex drive died.	My weight has remain the same which is a good thing. I still get a few headaches which can be quite bad. Epilepsy is better controlled. I believe there is something better to control it.	F	27	2  years250mg 1X D	5/29/2010Email
5	Primary Alveolar Hypovent. Syndrome	Tingling of extremeties, mental sluggishness, loss of appetite, weight loss, total loss of senses of smell and taste, fatigue, diminished memory, fatigue, urinary frequency.	Diamox stimulates respiration and has saved my life.  Loss of taste and smell is annoying, but I'd rather breathe.	F	63	13  years500 Mg 2X D	5/4/2010Email
3	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I had tingling in my hands, feet, and sometimes my face.  I feel exhausted all the time, like I can't get enough sleep.  My headaches have improved as I only had one in the last 6 days and it's normally 5 or 6 a week that are completely debilitating.  My legs, ankles and feet also feel "achy".	I will give it 6 weeks when I have a follow up with my Doctor.  If I am still feeling this way, I think I will have to ask about alternatives to taking this med. I have been too tired to live my life like normal for the last week.	F	29	6  days500 mg 2X D	5/1/2010

4	pseudotumor cerebri	tingling in feet and hands. somewhat foggy feeling, sometimes low energy.	have had pseudo tumor for about 3 years.  When diagnosed, began Diamox at 250 3x per day.  However, as lost weight (40lbs), began to get low pressure headaches instead of high pressure and was able to get off meds.  Have gained weight again, and pressure is increased and now back on 1/2 250 pill morning and 250mg at night.  Hopefully, with weight loss, can get off meds.  Weight loss is key to controlling this disease.	F	51	2  times125/250 2X D	3/25/2010
4	Idiopathic IntercranialHypertension	Tingling sensation in fingertips,toes and knees. It was more frequent when I started taking Diamox. It has reduced now. Fatigue and tiredness is always there and I feel sleepy always. I feel more thirsty and my mouth&lips are always dry. I lost 2-3 Kilos within a week of taking Diamox, but weight's been pretty much same after that.I have just started taking Potassium supplement (Potassium Chloride solution). Diamox being a diuretic brings out the Potassium levels in the body.		F	26	4  weeks250 2X D	2/28/2010

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!	M	37	21  days10 1X D	2/24/2011Email
5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
