3	Contraception	Anxiety, Leg Tightness, Problems Sleeping	I started taking LoEstrin 24 Fe as a birth control almost a week ago.  I was pleased the first couple day and then I started noticing that I have been very anxious.  I thought it was from too much coffee on an empty stomach or from wedding planning.  I then noticed today that my legs felt heavy, tight when bent, almost as if they were swollen.  I was very skeptical about taking birth control.  I guess I read the manual that came with it every day for a month until starting it.  I was satisfied with it until I noticed my legs and realized how anxious I have been.  I am going to contact my doctor and see what he thinks.  When he prescribed this BC to me he said that everyone loved it and that it would be the best option for me.  I have no medical problems, am not over weight, and do not smoke.  The only reason I am taking this is because I will be getting married in a week and want to use BC as my form of contraception.  One other side effect is less discharge, which is a plus for me.  I have always suffered from alot of discharge and I noticed that it is gotten so much better.  I no longer have to wear panty liners everyday.  If you have ever had this problem, I know you understand how that feels.	F	22	5  days 1X D	7/12/2012Email
3	Can't afford any kids yet!	Gradual onset: moodiness, headaches, low sex drive, sore vagina, fatigue, weight gain, no period		F	21	1  years	7/4/2012Email
3	for birth control	pretty bad mood swings/recent heart flutters or palpitations/ no period whatsoever the entire time I have been on any brand of loestrin	I was extremely against taking birth control, i think it is completely unnatural, and I was very scared about it. However, even though my boyfriend and I try not to have sex, we sometimes mess up and because I didn't want to get pregnant, I decided maybe I should do this. I took Loestrin 24 FE for a full year, and not once did I get my period which made me skeptical because I believe every woman should have one, it's only natural. The only other side effect I had was occasionally, usually by myself, and in the car for some reason, i would have these EXTREME anger issues. I don't cuss, but when this happened, I would scream, cuss, you name it. Then after me screaming and crying because I was so pissed for the stupidest reasons, I would be fine. (That is not me!) I discussed changing it with my doctor and she recommended Lo Loestrin because it has a lower dosage of hormones and since I didn't like the foreign not real hormones in me in the first place she said i may like this option. I was on it for about 5 months and didn't have any issues except still no period. I went to go pick up more from my doctor, and they were out. she gave me a pack of loestrin 24 fe again saying that it wouldn't be a problem, but after not even 2 weeks of taking it I am experiencing heart flutters. My OBGYN said that it couldn't be from the Loestrin, but I think it is. My main doctor told me stop taking it immediately. I am nervous about how my body will react to me stopping in the middle of a pack.	F	22	18  months 1X D	5/31/2012Email
5	Hormonal Acne	Pain on 1st day of period each month.. no fun :( feels like mild contractions.	Lighter period that only last 3 days. No weight gain or added acne breakouts. I think it's starting to help with my hormonal acne flares in conjunction with Ziana topical gel.	F	33	75  days 1X D	5/5/2012Email
2	Cyst	Depression, dry mouth, constant bleeding, loss of appetite	I have been on this for a month since day 3, I have been bleeding non stop and now that I am on the brown pills I have finally stopped bleeding! I have been feeling depressed and just now linked it to the pill, I have never suffered depression and all of a sudden I have cut  out all of my friends and I am withdrawing myself from life not even knowing what I was doing! I have lost  10 pounds this month because I just don't want to eat I have to force myself, nothing seems appealing anymore. I am def. not myself and I am not starting the second pack. If this happened to me on month 1 I don't want to see what next month brings... But seems like I have come out lucky compared to the others comments..I will just take my chances with the cyst.

2	Birth Control	FYI this my 1st time to take BC in my life. And i don't feel confortable about this. I'm actually experimenting: Fatigue, body ache, indescribable stomach pain at the point the i fell the pain when im breathing, my legs became heavier, some chest pain. I've decied to stop and call my doctor i do not want this pill to harm me. Your experience can be different from mine so don't be afraid everybody's body reacts differently. But don't hesitate to contact your GYN if you feel unsafe during the pill taking		F	24	3  days1mg/ 20mcg	4/4/2012Email
4	Acne and Lighten Period	After a short 3 day period, I spotted lightly for 20 days straight with dark color discharge.	I started taking Loestrin 24 FE on the first day of my period as directed by my doctor. I am hoping for less acne and lighter periods. I haven't had any trouble with my period in the past. The continuous spotting is a drag and I think it's my body regulating and getting in line with this pill. I haven't had any of the mood swings others speak of.	F	32	20  days 1X D	3/19/2012
2	Moderate Acne, Sexually active.	For the first month I experienced severe mood swings, I felt angry all the time and began to break out even more with painful cystic acne. Thought by month 2 it would subside but it didn't ! Mood swings would come and go but the acne issue is still there and my main reason for going on this BC was for the acne. It's worked well with my period , cramps are very light as well as my period but overall I'm not pleased.  I would stick around for month 3 since your body is suppose to get use to the hormones around this time but this BC is not for me.		F	26	2  months	3/5/2012
3	birth control/ cysts	i reviewed right below and found out why i had all of those symptoms!!!!	i just reviewed a couple days ago and the doctor called me to say i had an abnormal tsh level. meaning thyroid problem it was too high. the symptoms of thyroid is depression, mood swings, intolerable to cold, anxiety, brittle nails, rough hair/skin, hard time waking up, fatique, memory loss, and gaining weight/ hard time losing weight. i thought this was my loestrin 24 symptoms but it is actually something more serious. girls i am warning you if you feel these symptoms and they are taking over your life. like extreme emotion and you realize your not thinking the same get a blood test and tell your OBGYN to check your thyroid levels. im glad i found a diagnosis, and im not actually crazy. i am going to stop taking my loestrin though because i really want to just get back to my old self. thank you for your time ladies!	F	21	1.6  years 1X D	2/24/2012Email
3	birth control/ cysts	dry mouth,depression,mood swings,anxiety, shorter periods, tired all the time, no energy, always feel like throwing up.	this is the first birth control i've taken ever. at first i was nervous to stick with a birth control option due to side effects but after having my second child i knew i didn't want anymore babies. i was very hormonal after my second pregnancy and didn't really give my body time to adjust to getting my hormones back to normal. i was very pleased to have expected periods, my periods only last about 4 days very light, and i did not see any weight gain or loss although i eat anything i want. i also didnt notice an increase in breast size either. although now im having extreme saddness, anxiety, and even though i have a happy life i can't seem to feel happy. its affecting me and my relationship with my babies father because everything he says i get offended, i constantly feel like he does not love me even though he is always home after work and buys me everything. i even got a prescription for depression but the side affects are way worse and the reviews for depression medicine ruined peoples lives. im thinking of getting off loestrin because i think this is where my problem is beginning. its just sad because i love knowing im not pregnant! but i feel pregnant everyday anyways so ill decide what to do. i might switch to para guard even though its painful to insert hormones are not for me... :(	F	21	1.6  years1mg/20mpg 1X D	2/22/2012Email

2	Replacement hormone therapy	Fatigue, severe mood swings, depression	Had a total hysterectomy (removal of uterus and both ovaries) in summer of 2009.  Was on estrogen-only RHT (replacement hormone therapy) until January 2011: ZERO side effects such as dryness, low libido, water retention.  Since I'm young (29), my new doctor was worried about calcium deficiency due to the low estrogen content of the RHT I was on.  I was put on Loestrin.  It was a nightmare- extremely moody, feeling out of control of my emotions, and incapacitating fatigue.	F	29	30  days 1X D	2/8/2012Email

2	Avoid Conception	3 months on Loestrin 24 FE - Cramps, moody, breakthrough and heavy bleeding early but no period during iron pills, bloated, acne breakouts, swollen breasts, exhausted all the time, lack of desire for relations	Tried Loestrin 24 FE about 8 weeks after a miscarriage because bf and I didn't want another unplanned pregnancy, first week was fine. I noticed I was bloated and breasts were swollen and I was getting PMS-y...Then two weeks in the break through bleeding started and it lasted for about 6 days then I had a full on period soaking SUPER tampons.  That lasted about 3 days and tapered off.  When my period was supposed to start there was nothing.  I continued taking it thinking my body was just adjusting to the hormones, and a week and a half later the break through bleeding starts again for about 6 days again, then a full period for 4 days complete with cramping and bloating and clots.  This happened again the following month.  I was also napping like I was prego again, that was enough to scare the BF and he wanted  me to take a pg test after the first month. I gave the pill 3 months but with the crazy bleeding, bloating, cramping, and being exhausted all the time I'd rather go back to condoms and counting days (we've been together for 8 yrs with this method and only 1 pregnancy). Along with the pill I take Adderall XR for adhd, this BC has me exhausted while on the adderall. That's a little frightening to know this medication takes that much out of a person that even with prescription "uppers" all I wanted to do was nap.  I've stopped taking them and am in the process of waiting for my cycle to return to it's normal "predictable" self.	F	31	  1X D	12/29/2011Email

1	Birth Control	Intense stomach pain (nauseous/ vomiting/ bloating), irritable, depressed, chest tightness, insomnia and lethargy	I have been going to my primary dr trying to figure out my EXTREMELY INTENSE stomach pain.  I am currently on Nexium, but still take tums and Pepto almost daily to deal with my pain.  I am either over eating or completely nauseous all the time.  My dr was referred me to a GI specialist to have a scope test completed.  I am so glad I came across this site because in reading others reviews it made me think about when i started having stomach symptoms among all of the other side effects.In addition I have been irritable beyond any explanation.  I started reading self help books because I have a great life but never feel happy.  I have been using a rescue inhaler due to trouble breathing.  My heart will race and I will get hot out of nowhere.  I cant sleep at night.	F	28	9  months20mcg 1X D	12/8/2011Email

4	PCOS	Growth in breast and butt, breast tenderness, extreme increase in apeitite, slight weight gain	At first I didn't like it because I would have severe cramping but after a month of taking the pill things got better, I actually love this pill its helped out a lot.. don't give up on it if your just starting out, buy also remember that everyones body is not gonna react the same way to the pill you just have to find the one that works best for you because I was once before on Ortho tri cyclin and I HATED IT!!! so just keep trying if this one doesn't work out for you.

3	PMDD	terrible rash, chronic watery diarrhea, terrible mood swings, bloating , headache. horrible cramping on lower left abdomen. chronic itching, diabetes, nausea, hot flashes, night sweats, no sex drive, lack of concentration, migraines,	I writing about LO LOESTRIN FE - there wasn't another place to put this information. I started taking LO LOESTRIN FE in 2/11...It is now 10/11... I started this prescription in 2/11 when I went to see a new OB/GYN after having my period for 6 weeks. They found fibroids and removed them and prescribed LO LOESTRIN for my PMS ( horrible) My period stopped almost immediately - YEA! And for the first 2 months everything was going well. Then the rash started. This was not a normal rash. My skin was bright red across my upper torso - everyone thought I had sunburn. Then came the lesions. They would start off as small pimples almost and they would ITCH horribly. They burst with just a touch and drained clear fluid. For the longest time I thought it was an allergic reaction to a body wash. No one, not even the doctors knew what it was. If that wasn't bad enough, when I scratched, they scarred. I currently have bright, round purple scars all over my body. Then of course came the mood swings - crying for no reason, depressed ,tired, voracious appetite... MY OB/GYN said it was my meds for depression, My shrink said it was my inability to cope. I can't begin to tell you how many days I missed at work because of it, I had to get FMLA because I would have lost my job without it. As it was, I fell so far behind on my bills that I get constant shut off notices and my bank is threatening foreclosure. Added to all this was the chronic watery diarrhea. You name it,	F	44	8  months 1X D	10/25/2011Email
2	Acne, menstrual pain	Hair loss, dehabilitating mouth ulcers, boil-like lesions on body (specifically by buttocks/abdomen region), breast tenderness, appetite increase	As soon as I started taking this, I developed awful mouth ulcers.  For months, it literally felt as if I was walking around with Lemonheads clamped in my jaws constantly.  I couldn't eat any food that was the slightest bit spicy or acidic without being in pain.  I also developed painful boil-like sores on my body, particularly on my buttocks/abdominal regions.  I typical have thick, strong hair, but it came out by the handful every time I would shower on this BC.  I also skipped a period for the first time since I was 12, and my skin broke out worse than before (I was previously on oral antibiotics for my skin that helped immensely but unfortunately also gave me oral thrush).  I quit on the last row of my second pack because it was affecting my body too negatively.	F	21	2  months 1X D	10/25/2011
3	Birth Control	period every 2 weeks, spotting, mild acne flare ups, weight gain, high blood pressure, yeast infection	The best thing about this BCP is I had no changes in mood or depression and felt overall pretty good while on it. I'm not pregnant, so that good as well.The WORST thing is the non-stop bleeding. I'm lucky if I can get through a whole week without spotting or starting a period. I went to see my doctor today and she decided to take me off Loestrin because it has caused me to have high blood pressure and gain weight in a short period of time. She's switching me to Safyral (a new variation of Yasmin). I tolerated Yasmin well in the past, so we'll see how it goes.	F	26	1.5  months 1X D	10/15/2011Email
2	Birth control	Terrible mood swings, Depression, No sex drive what so ever	I was in Zovia 1/35E for a year and then switched to Loestrin 24 fe because I gained weight on Zovia but that was a terrible mistake. I want to switch back to Zovia or try something new. But no sex drive, and being in a relationship a year & a half of that 2 years was the worst feeling.	F	19	2  years1/20 1X D	10/12/2011Email
1	Birth Control	Bloating, headache, weight gain, hair loss, appetite increase.	I have been on Ocella since 2006 and I was starting to get melasma from it. My OBGYN told me that a lower estrogen pill may fix it so I went to this. A week into lolo, I had bleeding and severe headaches. I continued to spot and I just now finished the first pack. My hair is a little bit more oily but not bad and no acne. I am 26 years old and I have always weighed around 116. I am now 120 and I have extreme bloating during my first period timeframe on this pill. I feel very self concious about it and my work clothes are pulling to make me look like I'm pregnant. I will give the pill a month or two more and if the symptoms don't improve I will get off birth control completely. It is not worth the symptoms you have to experience in my opinion.	F	26	1  months10 1X D	10/12/2011Email

3	endometriosis	I am taking the new LO LOESTRIN FE 1-10 tablet- I experienced anxiety for the 1st month that has gone away, weight loss, decreased appetite, breakthrough bleeding.	(on the new LO LOESTRIN)- I have tried everything for endometriosis.. most of which had bad side effects due to the high level of hormones. This is the lowest hormone pill on the market currently and has less estrogen. If high estrogen birth control does not work well for you I highly recommend this one. I have been able to lose weight unlike on any other birth control. I take a pill every day so it stops my cycles for treatment of endometriosis and it has worked pretty well with occasional breakthrough bleeding and cramps.	F	22	5  months1-10 1X D	10/9/2011Email

2	heavy bleeding	this pill has turned me into a crazy bitch. i used to be very light hearted and chill and don't let anything get to me. now i have insane moodswings, everything gets to me, i randomly get upset over something meaningless and can't stop crying, i say mean things and then feel overcome with remorse about it later and apologize over and over, i'm overcome with fear, sometimes don't feel like living.. then i snap out of it and i'm fine. this is miserable and i can't believe it took me this long to figure out it was this pill. definitely not for everyone.

1	Acne	Severe depression, cramps, tiredness, couldn't eat	On the third day of taking this pill the side effects reared their ugly head and I tried to "tough it out" but when I couldn't eat and was losing 2 pounds a day, I decided to stop taking the pill. The side effects were awful while I was on the pill but a couple of weeks later most of the side effects disappeared. However, it is two months later and the depression still looms over my head everyday. Since I have always been happy, the girl that always saw the glass half-full, this has been a disturbing change and has forced me to seek therapy to elevate the dark cloud. I wouldn't recommend this pill to anyone, unless they are willing to spend more money on correcting the side effects that occur when taking this pill.	F	20	5  days 1X D	9/21/2011

1	Birth Control	At first, chapped lips and dry mouth. Progressed to blisters on lips, swollen lips, tightening of throat and red skin around nose. Also got a canker sore on my tongue.	I experienced worsening side effects with each pill. I finally had to quit taking them when I had 10 pills left on my second pack. My upper lip was covered with small, water-filled blisters and swollen like I had been stung by a bee! What a horrible experience.	F	37	40  days 1X D	9/4/2011Email
1	Heavy period & later b/c	Chest pain, 2week periods twice a month, MAJOR depression, distant feeling,  major weight gain and unable to lose weight	I first went on b/c to have lighter periods since I was taking JROTC in high school. I thought the chest pain was from working out since I normally don't work out and I thought being emotional was from a friend moving away until I became emotional over everything and went from "daddies little girl" to not being able to stand him. I decided maybe the sideffects would eventually go away so I continued to take the pill. After being on it around 8 months I decided to go off it b/c it wasn't helping except for cramps. I had to wear a liner almost every day for 8months and got tired of it. When I went off the pill everything went back to normal. 3months after stopping I went back on it b/c my bf wanted me too BIG MISTAKE!!!! I was on it for a little over a month and gained over 20lbs. Since I'm overweight to begin with it worried me. One night I couldn't go to sleep because chest pains were so bad it felt like I could bairly breathe. (I thought chest pains were from Exercise the first time, the 2nd time I wasnt exercising as much) I threw the 2nd pack away after taking 6pills (during period) and my period was 2weeks long. Which started July 14th. It is now Aug. 19th and I haven't gotten my period yet as of now. (I haven't had sex after I stopped taking it) I do not recomend this b/c to anyone.On a side note, my friend is taking the same b/c and lost her appetite.	F	16	8  months 1X D	8/19/2011Email
2	PMS/Heavy Menstrual Bleeding	EXTREME BREAST ENLARGEMENT! EXTREME WEIGHT GAIN! Beware!!! Gained 20 LBS and went up 4 cups sizes in 1 year!	I started taking this for heavy menstrual bleeding & PMS symptoms-- my doctor recommended this one since it regulates length of periods. That part worked GREAT! I always have period at regular time, it is short and light and I feel great. My emotional moods seem to be regulated and this is almost a "happy" pill for me-- I feel GREAT emotionally. But this is not worth the downsides-- I gained 20 lbs exercising regularly and MORE than ever in just one year. I was already huge bra size before this (30FF) and went up to a 30HH in one year-- I had gone up an entire cup size in just a month after being placed on Loestrin24Fe. This is actually a disaster for me, I am considering breast reduction now and I stopped Loestrin24Fe and they DID NOT GET SMALLER! :( Also gain of 20 lbs dropped instantly 5 lbs when I quit it, but I have not been able to lose the additional 15 lbs. Overall: works really well for what it was prescribed, and works really well if you don't mind looking like a fat, huge breasted whale.	F	25	1  years1 mg 1X D	8/18/2011Email
1	Pregnancy Prevention	stabbing abdominal pain, weight gain, acne, discoloration of skin on face, extreme nausea for first 2 months, extreme depression after discontinuing use	I was satisfied with it at first, even with a little bit of nausea. But over time I got really bad abdominal cramps on the sides (think ovaries, not uterus) - all the time, not just during my lighter than normal periods. I also noticed darker patches of skin showing up on my face, and I always had really nice skin before taking this. After I stopped taking it I was really weepy for about 2 months and would cry for no reason for hours at a time.	F	21	5  months 1X D	8/4/2011
1	Birth Control	MASSIVE bloating. Very sore breasts. Bad, bad constipation. Basically everything to feel like you're pregnant.	This is the absolute worst pill I've ever taken. The FIRST FEW DAYS, my stomach went from completely flat to pregnant looking. I couldn't suck it in if I tried. I had big time constipation, even though I'd tried laxatives, with no results, tried drinking EXTRA tons of water...nothing. The bloating/constipation has made my intestines swell to the point that if you pressed on my stomach, it would literally feel like a pregnant woman's stomach!! This is absolutely terrible. I'm used to having a little bit of bloating at some point during the month, but not this bad! Also, I've already noticed that my lower stomach seems to have gotten a bit pouchy! This has never, ever been the case for me. I've never gained weight in my stomach, have always been completely flat. Also, most of the time, I can barely keep my eyes open. Everything seems too hard to do.	F	37	14  days30 1X D	7/13/2011Email
2	Birth Control	HAIR LOSS	Ok, I need to know, because I can't find any answers. Has anyone's hair grown back after stopping or switching to another birth control? I used to have really really thick, CURLY hair. Today, it falls out like crazy, it's limp and thin, and now it is actually straight from my roots down to about my ears. PLEASE, I need to know, Will it come back? I'm only 21 years old, I can't do this!Obviously, I do not recommend this drug. Unless you want to lose all your hair.	F	21	1  years 1X D	7/5/2011Email
1	Painful periods/ovulation	Nausea, dizziness, numbness in arms and face.	8 days ago I started taking Loestrin 24. I had never been on birth control pills before. Within days I was nauseous. On day 6 I almost passed out with a dizzy spell. Then came the left arm and face numbness. The dizzines went. But I called my PCP next day about the numbness. She sent me straight to ER because of stroke concerns. I immediately stopped taking the pill.I was tested with CAT scans, xrays and was finally hospitalized for monitoring and had an MRI. The numbness dissipated and the MRI was all clear and I was discharged.Yesterday my "coming off the pill period" started. Then I started getting tingling in arms and legs. This continued today accompanied by nausea, headache, dizziness, and overall weakness.This stuff is toxic. Think twice.	F	39	6  days 1X D	6/13/2011
2	Endometriosis, ovarian cysts	Weight gain,  headaches, acne, hot flashes	I've had a hard time finding a birth control pill that gives any relief to my cysts and endometriosis.  This pill is just another disappointment.  I'm furious that I've gained 15lbs after not changing anything about my diet or exercise routine.  You would think that running 5x per week for upwards of 4-5 miles each would keep those pounds off.  Well, think again.  As someone who's never really broken out in my lifetime, the dime to quarter sized acne on my face is not a welcome site.  This pill is awful.  Don't take it.  The benefits (I never found any) DO NOT out-weigh the side effects.	F	25	  1X D	5/28/2011Email
1	Ovarian Cyst	loss of appetite, insomnia, night sweats, skipped periods, tons of spotting, horrible anxiety, heart palpitations, loss of scalp hair	I do think that this pill helped with an ovarian cyst that I had - but I knew deep down I didn't want to take a birth control pill.  I thought that taking a pill seemed better than maybe having to have surgery later on so I took it for a few months.  It was terrible.  I have always hated birth control pills and this pill made me hate them even more.  I have never suffered such horrible anxiety and heart palpitations (that have continued since I stopped taking the pill too - waiting for my hormones to regulate - I hope)  The biggest problem with this pill is the loss of scalp hair.  I have always been one who sheds quite a bit, but I also have always had a ton of thick hair.  Lucky for me I started off with a decent amount.  2 months after stopping this pill I started losing tons and tons of hair.  After research I have found that this pill has been found to cause that and it usually shows up about 2 months after you stop taking it.  It is TERRIBLE.  My self esteem has just been shot and I have been so anxious and depressed.  If I would have known this type of hair loss would have happened after stopping this pill I would have NEVER taken it in the first place.  I say don't walk, RUN away from this pill!  I don't want anyone else to go through what I have!	F	27	4  months 1X D	5/5/2011Email
2		nausea, headaches, yeast infections, crying for no reason	I started taking this pill a year and a half ago, and was told by my doctor that my unexpalined headaches and hysterical crying must have been because theres something else going on! I thought it was just me, but this pilln is terrible! Im switching ASAP	F	19	  1X D	4/28/2011
1	ease pms symptoms	Intense cramping, heavy flow, digestion upset, bloating.	I had been taking Ortho Novum for years and decided to take a break.  When my periods became a monthly ordeal made worse by a 2 week bout with PMS, I decided to go back on the pill.  My dr. recommended a lower dose pill: Loestrin FE.  I could only manage 12 days before I had to stop taking it.  Aside from the "disconnected" feelings, fatigue, feeling constantly irritated, bloating and intense cramps, I suffered the heaviest and most painful period ever.  After one week of taking the pills (following manufacturer's instructions to the letter) a very heavy flow began with little warning, with heavy cramping and bloating.  I have never experienced anything like it and hope to never again.  Also, this pill retails for $50/month, with no generic (actually there is, but pharmacists usually won't dispense it without dr. consent) it's insanely expensive and based on my experience, not worth it.

3	period regulation, birth control	hair loss, weight gain, moodiness, extra discharge, weird sex drive, depression, acne	i just cant find the right birth control. im losing SO MUCH hair. all the weight ive gained went to my stomach (not my boobs..shame). i never had acne before taking this birth control. also, i'm either compleeeetely lacking a sex drive or its really intense. its confusing. i think im going to stop taking it and try Estrostep 21.

1	Contraceptive, Period regulation	Headaches, dizziness, tiredness, yeast infection, depression, loss of concentration, & mood swings	I have only taken this medication for a week and it has been a nightmare. Please ladies do not take this medication, it is so bad they include a discount card to convince you to purchase it. For starters I am unable to concentrate at work or school, my motivation is low, headaches everyday, & depression. It has been five days off this terrible pill & now I am getting yeast infections, like if the aforementioned side effects were not enough. I am also experiencing a lot of pelvic pain. I am praying in a week or so I'll get back to my normal self. I should also add, after stoping I have not experienced headaches, I am motivated, & I am able to concentrate on my work. Finally, do not take this medication; if this pill manufacture wants to make money, it will sure not be from me. It is highly unethical to have us women suffer from these symptoms; it sure signifies that this manufacture could careless about their consumers.	F	26	7  days 7X D	3/31/2011
1	birth control	Major Hair Loss	Worst birth control pill ever.  Lost 1/3 of my hair after being on this pill for about 6 months.  The company that makes this is not the same as the other Loestrin Pills and it it also not a pharmacutical company based in the United States.  Stay away from this pill, it is garbage!

3	birth control, irregular periods	i became a COMPLETE EMOTIONAL MESS	this is my first time being on birth control, i was nervous to go on it because i normally hate taking any kind of medication, and because i was worried about side effects. i was told that since it was such a low-dose pill, that i was not going to have any side effects.. WRONG. i am normally a happy, secure, confident and not easily offended person, but this pill turned me into a complete wreck.. now i cry at the drop of a hat, pretty much every night and sometimes multiple times a day over really minor things. i get offended at pretty much everything. my boyfriend and i used to be able to joke around and be silly, but now he'll say things jokingly and i'll be pissed for hours.. i'm exhausted all the time, have no energy at all, and i know i'm no fun to be around.. i just feel miserable. i feel painfully insecure and paranoid in my relationship with my boyfriend even though i honestly know that things are fine between us. this is why i hate taking medication! if i would have known that loestrin would make me feel this bad, i NEVER would have taken it at all. luckily i didn't gain weight, get acne, or have any other side effects that i was concerned about. now i'm switching to avaine, though i am not too hopeful about that one either. i feel like i'm doing a chemistry experiment with my own body :/	F	20	2  months 1X D	2/25/2011

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS.

1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself.

4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me.

Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.

2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out!

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!	M	37	21  days10 1X D	2/24/2011Email
5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
