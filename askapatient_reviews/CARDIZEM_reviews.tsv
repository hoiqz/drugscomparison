5	heart palpiations	None that I noticed.	Wonderful, miracle cure for heart palpitations.  Unfortunately, counter indicated with Latuda, which I start a few months ago.  (Raises the serum levels of Latuda.) Had to switch to amilopine (sp?) and I have a lot of side effects with this new drug.  Too many so I'm not going to take it.	F	38	1  years120 1X D	3/30/2012
1	Hypertension	Had experienced burning up oesophagus after taking Cardizem for approx 8 months.  Have had stomach burning and pain for 2 months.  ENDOSCOPY TODAY diagonised ulcers!!  I ceased Cardizem about 1 week ago and my conditioned improved immediately but still some burning and pain.	My doctor didn't know Cardizem caused epigastric pain until she checked her drug manual.  Thank goodness I looked it up and suggested to my dr that I was sure this was the cause of my problem. It may help to lower BP but who wants gastric ulcers?	F	60	18  months30mg 1X D	12/20/2011
3	AFIB	When I first started, ringing in ears, hot flashes/flushed.  Tired all the time.  Basic walking and tasks a chore,  just beyond tired.  Makes driving hard, maybe because I feel dizzy and out of it.  Hoping it gets better.  Taking this along with Multaq to control AFIB, pending an Ablation.  Nothing has stopped my AFIB yet.
