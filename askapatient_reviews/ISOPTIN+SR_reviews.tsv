4	premature ventricular beats	nil side effects	before taking Isoptin I was experiencing frequent disturbing symptoms of the premature ventricular beats (anxiety, lightheadedness) which resulted in my going to the outpatient department of my local hospital on quite a few occasions. Since being on Isoptin SR 120mm once per day for the last six years the symptoms have virtually disappeared.	M	64	6  years	8/17/2007Email
