5	UTI	Nothing apart from feeling really spaced out and happy. Can I stay on them please??;-)	Never had this medication before so googled it and found this site. After reading the awful experiences that people have had on here I nearly didn't start to take them. I was horrified. How ever, glad I did because all that has happened is I feel really spaced out, a bit like I've been drinking. Think they knocked me out because I had the best nights sleep for a long time. Woke up this morning feeling amazing, after feeling rotten for weeks. Only had 3 tablets but I feel like a new woman!! Only down side is I'm not sure I'd be safe to drive feeling like this.	F	40	10  days50 4X D	3/29/2013
2	I had a UTI.	Dreadful dry mouth. I could hardly talk my lips and mouth were so dry, like I'd been in the desert for week with no water. Also had a sore throat, and sniffles. Stopped taking them.		F	58	3  days50MG	3/29/2013
1	UTI	Third day took one in morning and within 20 minutes I started a dry persistent cough and then had difficultly breathing, tight chest and pains and felt very unwell. Spent 6 hours at GP clinic. It is now on my banned list of antibiotics		F	53	3  days50mg 3X D	3/21/2013Email

1	UTI prevention	Awful side effects - wheezing, shortness of breath, racing heart, nausea and feeling faint. A little research showed a scary link to lung difficulties and respritory failure. Would never recommend this drug to anyone, it can have very dangerous side effects.		F	30	1  days100mg	1/2/2013

4	UTI	Mild headache, stomach cramps, mild pain behind eyes, mild aching in arms. Most surprising was a euphoric 'high', was in extremely good mood, I'm told this is unusual for Macrodantin but it made the other side effects easy to accept.	It sorted out the UTI quickly and effectively.	F	62	7  days50mg 4X D	12/18/2012Email
5	Urine infection	No side effects. It seems to have worked extremely well and quickly, thank goodness.		F	61	7  days50mg	12/10/2012
1	Water infection	Fuzzy head, headache, dry mouth, sore throat, aching joints, strange "bruised" feeling everywhere, palpitations  and EXTREME lethergy/tiredness. The drug has seemed to aleviate the symptoms of the infection but I feel absolutely horrendous. I'm not taking anymore and going straight back to the docs tomorrow. Feel like I'm drunk and in pain all over! I dread to think what it has done to my system to cause this reaction. I have arrithmia and can't believe I was prescribed this drug!

1	uti	nausea and headache	took tablets with milk duering meals but made no differance had to stop taking them	F	57	2  days100mg 4X D	10/24/2012
1	UTI	As I was suffering fever from the UTI when I began the drug I didn't notice any side effects but by day 2 although the pain from the UTI had gone I started to feel very nauseous with constant dull headache, I felt I had no energy and was very tired all the time with no appetite.   Now feel generally unwell and depressed and have decided to stop taking Macrodantin after 4 days instead of 7.		F	60	4  days50mg 4X D	10/21/2012
2	UTI	Took 2 tablets the first day as I got it late in the day and felt some side effects like pains in my back and mouth, throat areas.Next morning uti felt better but was very anxious which carried on through the day plus really bad pain and trapped wind. Palpitations a lot and other pains in body which took my breath away they hurt that much. Seriously considering not taking it tomorrow if no UTI pain as i hate this medicine and it scares me. Suppose to take it for 7 days.	I had blood in my urine and tried lots of natural ways as I prefer them but just couldn't seem to shift it hence the antibiotics but its too hard to carry on.

1	uti	Only take as a maintenance dose to prevent recurring uti's. First dose, severe abdominal pain, worse than labor pains. Didn't equate to this, but connected the dots after next experience. Second dose...Scariest night of my life!! Swollen tongue and lips, difficulty swallowing and speaking,tingling and numbness in hands, sweats, racing heart, weakness. Rushed to hospital with allergic reaction and given Benadryl. Took 2 days for swelling in tongue to completely go away.

No nausea	Visited doc with 2 days left to go on Macrodantin. Didn't seem worried and said that the tablet changes the way your gut works and to leave a week after taking the tablet to see if side effects settle down, if not to visit again. Have to take a urine sample after 1 week of finishing tablets to confirm the infection has cleared	F	24	14  days50MG 4X D	8/23/2012Email

1		Nausea, lower back pain, and tiredness,	Taking this medication seemed to exacerbate the symptoms of my UTI .  I had more frequent runs to the bathroom. The lower back pain increased more while taking this medication.  This medication was not for me.	F	36	 50 mg 4X D	6/25/2012Email

2	Uti	After taking for five days developed pain in right side that would travel from my spine like an internal hot liquid all over my chest and down my arms which in turn made me feel anxious and panicky. It happened every evening after that until I finished the course and gradually was less intense but four days after finishing still have this but to a much lesser degree. Also had burning pain all down my spine & burning sensation also in my feet. I must stress I was also on another tablet at the same time but reading these reviews on this forum I think this tablet may have caused the symptoms. Also left me feeling anxious.	Cleared the uti	F	57	7  days50mg 4X D	5/1/2012Email
5	UTI	First day very mild tiredness, felf a bit hot flush.But UTI's also makes me feel very tired and with fever.	I get reacurrent UTI's very often and when the doctor prescribe this I was a bit concerned because i never had them before.The colour of my urine changed to bright yellow i think is to do with the pill shell,by the 3rd day all UTI symptoms  were gone but i carried on taking till 7th day to make sure i finish the course.Know pain free. Yes i would take again.	F	43	7  days100mg 2X D	3/24/2012Email
5	UTI	No bad side effects whatsoever. The symptoms of the uti cleared up after three tablets and I had to take four 50MG tablets per day. I am writing this review because of all the negative reviews here. Some people do have adverse reactions to certain drugs but that does not mean everyone will. Don't be frightened by all you read here. Try it for yourself. It worked great for me and I would use it again if needed.		F	38	7  days50MG	3/23/2012
1	Urine infection	Felt I was dying. Head one side numb couldn't walk unaided, chest tight - felt horrendous. Am so worried that any damage already sustained is irreversible.	Never ever take this terrible pill.	F	68	2  days100mg 2X D	3/23/2012Email

1	UTI	Nausea, sickness, extreme weakness, lack of strength in legs, headache, breathlessness. These developed after my first course of the drug and it was thought I had a chest infection. On taking again, however, symptoms appeared after third tablet. I was in bed for four days after first course and for two days after te second, but was very weak and breathless with a cough for around ten days each time. I was so weak that I could not push the duvet back when in bed.	Can't believe it could have passed trials with these awful side effects. My. doctor said I must never take it again. Lost in total most of December and half of January before I could leave house.	F	52	12  days 3X D	2/6/2012Email
3	UTI-unknown cause	I have noticed that I am extremely tired now and put it down to my lifestyle and the stress. I have increased my supplementation to gve me increased energy but noticed that it isn't increasing my energy levels as they used to. So, I began to look at my eating habits which then pointed to the Macrodantin which I take at night. I read the sideffects and noted that legs felt weaker and had pain and that was me.	I felt that I was becoming lazy because I couldn't go out to bring in or hang up the washing. Everything was becoming a heavy chore and just to get up in the morning and get dressed and head into the day was a task. This just reinforced my sense of laziness of which that is not a character trait of mine. It has stopped the UTI's but I still suffer with the incontence of which no doctor has ever nbothered to investigate. I feel betrayed by the medical profession as I now have a huge monthly bill to pay for my incontinence pads. I just manage to get through all of this knowing that there are people far worse than me and I find ways to help others now.	F	57	60  days50mg 1X D	12/22/2011Email
3	UTI	I took it for seven days, caused me some nausea and diarrhea for about one day during the course, and then I was fine. Got the uti again after sex about 10 days later, currently back on macrodantin for another 7 days and I have started feeling nauseous again after two days on the treatment. It works to stop the pain of uti's, but the side effects are awful.		F	18	14  days100 mg 4X D	10/5/2011
5	Cystitis	None so far !	Took first capsule 2 hours ago and already I'm feeling much better. Hope it continues but must say I have my worries after reading peoples comments on here !!!	F	46	7  days50 4X D	7/17/2011Email

1	urine infection	Heavy chest, chills and really bad headache.	I would rather of had the infection, then deal with these side effect, my chest was so heavy I couldn't even talk as it was taken my breath away, the chills were just as bad one minute cold the next hot, two days on I still have a banging head and still feel hot and sweaty. Good news is after taken only 4 tablets the infection is better, not completely gone, and still have have 35 pills left.	F	47	1  days50mg 4X D	1/12/2011
4	uti	The only side effects have been severe insomnia despite feeling very tired, and unusual night sweats.  Also experienced floaters and flashing lights in my right eye which I attributed to posterior vitreous detachment (a common non-pathological event) but having read some of the comments now wonder if it may have been a side-effect.	Eliminated acute uti quickly, experienced none of the other problems that other people have complained of, despite my allergy to penicillin and the fact that many antibiotics do cause me digestive problems.	F	66	7.5  days50 4X D	1/2/2011

1	Severe UTI	At first I had naussea and trouble sleeping. I quit on medication three days ago, and still have the WORST migraine pain I had in my entire life. I have always controlled my migraines with Fioricet, and taking them now is like I'm having placebo tablets to kill this pain. If I do something that elevates my blood pressure, or bend my head down I feel like my head is going to explode. I do not  recommend taking this medication, seriously.

1	UTI	I have chronic eosinophilic pneumonia as a result of Macrodantin I took 20 years ago.  It causes recurrent episodes of shortness of breath, chest pain, productive cough, low-grade fever.  I have to take corticosteroids with every exacerbation and am now being placed on them as a maintenance dose.  My lungs are damaged and irreparable.  It is incapacitating when I have symptoms.  Corticosteroids cause problems of their own.		F	46	  1X D	8/9/2010
5	3rd UTI in 12 weeks	I was in the worst ever pain you could imagine, and I swear I would have taken anything... Within 1 hour after taking the first tablet, the burning had halved...

1	acute bladder infection	i was given macrodantin by the hospital who diagnosed with acuse bladder infection, within an hour of taking it I had the worst head ache i had ever experienced in my life In fact I thought i was going to die. The doctor told me it was the pill fighting the infection, but I knew it was the pill. I felt if I took another i would die.The pain left me with a vice like feeling and sensitive head and face for 3 days afterwards. I have since suffered migraines, and worryingly after reading this and a year later have been back and fore the doctors with numbness. My thoughts are. . try another	It cleared up the infection almost after one tablet, I think it was just way too powerful for my system.	F	39	1  days 2X D	7/22/2010
1	UTI	Difficulty breathing - even bought ashma pump.  Pains in legs - thought is was associated with recent flu.  Only when rash appeared on arms and legs did I suspect allergic reaction.	Ceased medication 36 hours ago and all symptoms have disappeared.  I have been prescribed 42 days' medication (one 50 mg capsule per day).  Obviously I will never touch another such tablet.  Thought I had onset of Guillaine Barre syndrome!	F	62	7  days50 MG 1X D	5/26/2010Email

1	Urinary Tract Infection	I took ONE tablet at 15h30.   At 19h30 I suddenly became ill - shivering uncontrollably as if with fever; headache; pains in legs; pains in chest.   Condition worsened quickly - I was finding it very difficult to breathe. Also experienced nausea and vomiting. Cotton mouth - difficulty speaking. Sudden, heavy phlegm on chest. Was rushed to emergency where I was diagnosed as being in severe anaphalaxis. Antihistamine was administered via IV -  took 2,5 hours to stabilise. Doctor also thought I had bronchitis or early pneumonia - but this is not possible as it came on extremely suddenly.  Later confirmed it was caused by the drug!!	My doctor was shocked at my reaction to the drug.  He says in all his years of practice, he has never had a patient show signs of allergy to the drug.	F	72	1  days 4X D	4/14/2010
1	UTI	Took one pill of the generic form in evening after dinner.  During the night I felt numbness in my feet and arms/hands which awakened me.  When I awoke I was spinning dizzy and had diffucltiy speaking clearly. I reported to doctor and most effects seemed to have worn off.	I am very concerned.  I took this many years ago in college and I was fine but lately I have had a few situations where I am hypersensitve to meds.  It's been 2 days and I'm still feeling strange-dizzy again in the morning, conscioues and aware one eye sees close the other far, etc.  I am expecting this will all go away but wonder what is in it that causes this quick reaction so that I can avoid it in the future.  Beware if you have sensitivities.	F	56	1  days	1/31/2010

5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.	F	52	8  years20 MG 1X D	1/13/2012Email
2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
