1	Sciatic pain/spasms	Took 1 3 hrs before bedtime, took another @ bedtime. Woke up with extreme headache, dry eyes, dehydrated.	Cannot tell yet if it is helping the spasms, because they seem to happen at random times, but needed to sleep last night so made sure I took a couple of doses to try to assure not having them then. Did not experience any spasms. Will update in a couple of weeks since the following week starting tomorrow will be filled with extreme activity for me. I do recommend vigilant hydration while on it thus far though.	F	40	1  days 3X D	2/13/2010Email
