4	Chronic Diarreah from H pylori bact	Starting to feel better after only 3 days! My stomach hurts but not sure if its the bacteria or antibiotics. The only side effect I noticed was feeling very tired during the first 2 days of taking the pills. By the 3rd day I was working 8 hours and NOT running to the bathroom! Ill report back after 14 days of this therapy. No other side effects.	Do NOT drink alcohol with it. I drank a few gin & tonics the day before I started therapy and felt pretty crappy the first day. Slept alot.	F	44	14  daysPacket 4X D	4/6/2010Email
