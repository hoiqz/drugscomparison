5	osteoporosis	None at all.	I've taken both Fortical and the generic Calcitonin Salmon and have not experienced any side effects. The Fortical smelled a little pungent, but I got used to it.  For some reason the generic doesn't have that smell. I am very relieved to find a medication that I can tolerate so well.  Hopefully it will help with the bone loss.	F	55	2  months 1X D	11/29/2010
