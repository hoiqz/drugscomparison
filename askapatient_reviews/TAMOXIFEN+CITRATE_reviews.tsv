4	Breast Cancer Stage II	Leg Cramps,  Hot  flashes.   As long as I had a drink of   Tonic water ( Quinine) every day or so  the  leg cramps were manageable.Hot flashes were/are managed by grinning and bearing it.  Also keeping a hand fan around helps.	Took for 3   (age 51-54) years before switching to Arimidex because my oncologist figured I was post-menopause.  (My periods stopped due to Chemo at age 51 so we weren't sure )   The leg cramps were a drag. Now I don't get them.	F	56	3  years 1X D	5/31/2013Email

2	stage 1a breast cancer in 1 breast	Extreme constipation with bleeding and sore rectum, vaginal dryness outside with soreness and bleeding, painful sexual intercourse, ear ache, leg cramps, sore teeth and bones, first time ever low red blood cell count, weight loss. I drink 8-10 glasses of water a day and increased my finer from 35-40 grams/day to 40-50 grams/day to no avail with the constipation.		F	46	4  months10mg	11/30/2011Email
4	Breast Cancer Stage I Grade 3	Hot flashes and night sweats (annoying at worst), weight gain, infrequent bowel movements, increased tinnitus, upper back pain, frequently wake up during the night.	The hot flashes may be a result of chemotherapy (Cytoxan) which has stopped my menstrual cycle. I've gained 10lbs and no matter what I try, I can't loose it. I used to have regular bowel movements but now I have to take additional measures. I had slight tinnitus before but now it's noticeably worse. I also have unexplained upper back pain. I take Melatonin to help me get through the night.  Overall, other than the upper back pain which may be from something else, my quality of life is pretty good. Currently cancer-free.

1	Breast Cancer	In order of negative effect on quality of life: Memory/cognitive/sequencing problems, fatigue, foot and leg cramps, night sweats, short fuse.	I'd like to know whether these symptoms and problems will diminish if/when I stop taking Tamoxifen. I feel as if I've aged ten years in less than one. I came up from radiation and then went right back downhill.	F	55	9  months20MG 1X D	10/2/2011Email

1	Stage IIA Invasive Lobular	Only hot flashes at first, then more and more side effects each day, the worst being extreme fatigue, loss of muscle strength, constant stomach problems, constipation, depression/anxiety -- finally to the point that living longer doesn't seem like a big deal if it means living like this.	With adjuvant therapy, about 4 women in a thousand will have a recurrence.  Without adjuvant therapy, about 8 women in a thousand will have a recurrence.  This means that out of 1000 women taking Tamoxifen, Arimidex, etc. 996 women wouldn't have needed it.  (10-yr followup)  The side effects might be worth it if you're one of the four, but if you're one of the 996...  I have no way to know which group I'm in (the 4 or the 996), but I know what the odds-makers would say...	F	56	79  days20 mg 1X D	4/19/2011

1	Stage 2a node negative breast cance	No side effects that I can tell, except making my menstrual period go irregular, which could be from the onset of menopause. Side effects are supposed to be uncommon and I am so sad that these many posts are about very bad side effects. I will quit taking tamoxifen because the 2009 Christopher Li et al study shows that 25% of 5 year tamoxifen takers get a non-ER-positive (a much worse cancer) in the other breast. Endometrial cancer chances are indeed small, 1 in 3000, but 1 in 4 for a contralateral worse cancer is a humongous freaking chance.		F	51	4  months20 1X D	2/9/2011Email

Experienced memory loss, brain fog (to the point that my teenager said she was really worried for me)loss of concentraton and not much interest in life.  After 2 1/2 years, suddenly bled like crazy.  Had to be screened for cancer of the endometrial lining.  All this was attributed to tamoxifen. Was told to stop taking this to remove the risk.		F	49	2.5  years20 mg 1X D	2/4/2011

1	breast cancer	Some hot flashes. I cannot tolerate it as I am desperately trying to take it every other day, and it is making me manicky. I have made three attempts. Also, some loss of hair.

3	breast cancer Stage 3 mastectomy	Have posted previously at 2-year mark. At 3 years, my fatigue became so bad, I asked oncologist if I could take a break from drug as I was unable to function. He agreed; said many women do. I have only been off less than a week, but am beginning to notice some slight physical and emotional changes. Will think about going back in 2-3 months. BUT, if you are suffering -- use your common sense and ask your doctor if a "break" is do-able.		F	61	3  years20 1X D	12/6/2010
2	Breast cancer, stage 2	Took arimidex for 15 months, changed to tamoxifen for 6 months, still have side effects. Are now choosing fate. Unfortunately, had all side effects. Worse was the loss of short term memory, was in corporate position, now have trouble with what day it is, funny, I leave my diary beside me to remind me of what has to be done!!!!  Oh, an what day it is. I don't work now, not possible, but maybe again in the future. I was a gym junkie, very fit, now, my bone density has decreased and taking the supplements, my joint pain is excruiciating, I have bad arthritis and everything that goes with that. But as I have mentioned its all about the brain, and that I cannot tolerate, and if my life is cut short, so be it. There is not enough research to justify the anguist. Why should 55 weight take the same medication as 95, why isn't there research for amounts of toxins we put in our bodies?

3	stage II breast cancer	Extreme tiredness 9 out of 10 days, can barely function at work. Extreme hip pain; it sometimes feel like my legs are being pulled off. Started taking 12,000 iu of Vitamin D3 per day, that finally helped more than any other remedy for the hip pain. Still have excruciating heel pain, and feel achy in the morning. Zero sex drive, it's just gone. I feel bad for my husband, but just cannot make myself be interested. Fuzzy, foggy brain. Can no longer add or spell!	I sometimes fantasize about going off this drug, but really don't want to have cancer again. My quality of life these past few years hasn't been much, but it's better than the alternative.

5	Breast Cancer Mastectomy	I tolerated Nolvadex well for 4-1/2yrs; no noticeable side effects. I felt happy & energetic. There's history of blood clots (strokes) in my family & Dr didn't want to put me on TAMOXIFEN because of that. ARIMIDEX has lower occurrence of blood clots, but I struggled with extreme side effects on Arimidex for 6mo. & it was crippling me with severe joint & bone pain all over my body. At the 5 yr mark Dr tried FEMARA & was on that for 5yrs very successfully. Few noticeable side effects other than thinning hair & weight gain. At 10yr mark Dr took me off of everything (6mo ago) except annual iv for ZOMETA which I also tolerated well. Dr switched to RECLAST & I have joint pain & bone pain from that. I attribute my 10yrs in cancer remission to TAMOXIFEN, FEMARA & GOD. All drugs have side effects, even Tylenol, so I don't read the side effects that the pharmacy puts in with the medicine, I just want to do anything I possibly can to give my body a fighting cha		F	76	4  years 1X D	9/24/2010
4	As a Precaution after Radiation	No side effects thus far.	I have not experienced any side effects in the two weeks that I have been taking it. I am hoping I do not.

3	Stage 2a breast Cancer, node neg.	Hot flashes, not too bad because I'm on an antidepressant. Occassional leg cramp and hip pain. A little brain fuzzy, but not all the time. Some days I'm extremely clumsy, very strange.Weight loss is extremely difficult. Sometimes I suddenly become so tired I can hardly keep my eyes open. I take it at night and that helps a bit.	I was on Arimidex for about 5 months. I had shoulder tendonitis and bad tendonitis in my wrists. Things were so bad in my hands I could hardly use my right hand. Have had multiple shots in my writsts to calm things down.Went off the drug for 2 months. I told my doctor I was getting off it. Then went on Tamoxifen. Side effects so far aren't anywhere near what the Arimidex caused.	F	54	6.7  months20 mg. 1X D	8/10/2010
1		Searing pain, right hip - generalized hip pain most of the time, especially in the morning - I felt like I was 85 instead of 55. Pain and stiffness in left hand. Depression, fatigue, weight gain. Not worth it for DCIS. Quality of life on a slow decline.		F	55	500  days20 mg 1X D	7/28/2010Email
5	Breast cancer stage 1	Minor hot flashes. Some vaginal discharge. Period was regular for 2 years but in the 3rd year, I started getting super light periods sometimes skipping a couple of months.

3	breast cancer stage III	Initially very few side effects except "hot flashes," which were bearable; However at 2-year mark noticed substantial memory loss -- inability to form words; also noted an emotional "flatness" Recently have had shortness of breath -- fluttery feeling in chest.

1	stage 1 estrogen fed cancer	Confusion, tiredness beyond all means, lack of interest in doing anything. First I was hyper then tired. Felt drugged when taking it. Plus I had to constantly get up and go to the bathroom during the night.	I am not happy taking this drug. I need to be able to work and Tamoxifen is not going to let me. I took Arimidex and that was bad too. Will check with the oncologist for something else.	F	57	3  days	10/4/2009
4	Stage 1 BC, Bi-lateral Mastectomy	None so far although weight gain looks like it might be an issue. I am exercising and watching what I eat but am not losing.Feel blue....but that could be because my baby just left for college and I miss him.	When my oncologist first spoke of taking tamoxifen I did not want to do it because I was still feeling crappy from my surgery.He said that my risk was small (because i had a double mastectomy) so my benefit would be small. However, the thought of a reoccurrence is truly terrifying so I decided to give it a go and I've been lucky so far. It's only been 54 days so I'm still a newbie to the drug but I am hoping for the best. I can't say whether the med is helping me or curing me....that remains to be seen but it is what I am hoping for!	F	47	54  days	9/23/2009
1	Breast CA Stage II, 1 positive node	For the first five months on Tamoxifen I experienced only hot flashes and vaginal discharge.  The hot flashes have been severe.  I would be constantly breaking out in a sweat and feeling as if I was on fire.  Breaking out in a sweat ten times during a shift at work was very inconvenient and uncomfortable.  I was soaking through my clothes.  These sweats and hot flashes interferred with sleep.  I was only able to sleep for short periods and then would be awake the rest of the night.  I couldn't get comfortable.  After five months I began developing arthritis in my hands.  My left thumb has been very painful now for four months.  Both hands feel stiff and hurt.  I also had transient joint pain in the lower back, hips, and shoulders.  Around this same time I began having terrible fatigue.  I was a marathon runner when I was dx'd with cancer and continued to run through the chemo and before and after my mastectomy/reconstruction surgery.  During months 6 through 8 on Tamoxifen, I began to	After three weeks without Tamoxifen, I feel so much better.  I didn't even make it a year on Tamoxifen.  I went into this with an open mind believing in the importance of taking it.  It seems to me that the damage Tamoxifen can cause due to short and long term side effects is SIGNIFICANT.  My question is why are the drug companies and the doctors reinforcing the idea that side effects are minimal to noexistent?  If they lie about this then why should I have any faith in their so-called studies?	F	48	8  months	9/22/2009Email
1	Breast cancer prevention	Hot flashes that had no flash -- just extremely HOT ALL THE TIME! I had to sleep with ice packs. It felt is if my blood was boiling inside of me and my fingers felt like they were about to explode. I was just miserable the entire time I took it. When I stopped taking Tamoxifen, everything got much better.		F	51	4  months	8/17/2009
4	Post-breast cancer treatment	Hot flashes; nothing else significant	I began tamoxifen following mastectomy and radiation.  Quite frankly, reading some of these reviews had me scared to death.  My doctor, pharmacist and another breast cancer patient assured me that severe side effects weren't common and I'm glad that I listened to them.  I'm blessed in that my side effects have been minimal and the drug is not bothering me.  It's important to realize that the chemistry that makes up our bodies is different and that bad side effects exist with some patients and not others.  So, keep an open mind if you're going to be taking the drug and go in to it with a positive attitude.  I'm confident that this drug will help prevent recurrance of the cancer in my body.	F	45	5  months	8/14/2009
2	metastatic breast cancer	Tiredness, dizziness, brain fog, loss of interest in people and doing things, slight nausea at times, depression, weight gain, hot flashes.	I took Tamoxifen nine years ago and wasn't aware of any side effects.  I was also taking Paxil at the time, and I attributed the weight gain to that, but it was probably the Tamoxifen.  Didn't have hot flashes then because of the Paxil, or depression.  I have since read that Paxil interferes with Tamoxifen, making it less effective against progression, so can't go on it this time around.	F	59	2  months	7/21/2009
2	to prevent breast cancer recurrence	pelvic pain, uterine cramping, severe anxiety attacks and vaginal discharge	I have a history of panic disorder, always dealt with it with no meds,just relaxation exercises.  The panic from the Tamoxifen is nearly crippling- probably because it changes the hormonal balance, even though I had an uneventful menopause as well as happy pregnancies. Also, the pelvic pain is unsettling - no one knows what it is, even after two ultrasounds.  But it's there and I don't know if I can continue on this medication.MD's say anxiety and pelvic pain are not symptoms - not so.the pelvic pain is very unpleasant	F	61	14  days	7/14/2009
4	Breast Cancer recurrence prevention	None so far. Fingers crossed.	I am taking the generic Tamoxifen. I am giving it a 4-star rating because I still don't know how well it will perform its chief function, to prevent cancer.	F	41	6  weeks	7/3/2009
3	Hypogonadism	No bad side effects so far but it has seemed to make my testicles bigger and increased my sex drive which is why I am taking it in the first place.	Excellent med for me!  I am taking 10mg twice a day.  I would like to see even better results but I have only been on it a week so far.  I will add more comments in another week.	M	51	1  weeks	5/8/2009
4	Stage 2b breast cancer	Sweats not so bad.  I was already on Effexor, so that may have helped.	I think Tamox restarted my periods after they stopped from chemo, so I went on Lupron also to suppress my ovaries & their estrogen production.  After 2 years had significant hand & bottom of foot swelling/pain especially in the morning.  Also, constant throbbing in lower legs, cramps in feet & calves, numbness in arms when bent.  I tried switching to raloxifene (Evista) but that made me mentally confused and I feared for losing my job. So I stopped Evista after 4 months. After reading about AIs, I will probably go back onto Tamoxifen for 3 more years...seeing my Dr in a week to discuss.	F	47	2  years	4/22/2009

5	Stage 1 ER+ Breast Cancer	I seem to need more sleep - I become suddenly exhausted in the evening, and must go to bed, then I sleep for an average of 9 hours, & find it difficult to get up because I'm still tired upon waking.  But once I'm up, and for the rest of the day, I'm fine.	I have not had any major side effects, but have started Leupron injections to stop ovarian function, and so will now switch from Tamoxifen to Femara for hormone therapy.	F	39	6  months	1/11/2009
5	Breast cancer stage 1	I am also very surprised at minimal side effects. I had only drowsiness - so I take it at night, and now this is no problem. Also get mild skin itching - no big deal. So far, that is all.	I have not gained any weight.	M	44	14  days	1/9/2009

Felt worse and worse until I begged off.  Everything was becoming such an effort.  I thought I was taking a long time to recover from chemo and rads (1 yr since chemo, 8 monts since rads), especially since chemo slammed me into menopause, I was anemic a lot, and had slight cardiotoxicity.  But it didn't seem I should be losing ground in some areas, instead of improving.  After three weeks off Tamoxifen, I am WORLDS better.  I had no idea how many of my symptoms it was either causing or intensifying.  I am functional again--even getting some things done around here.  Back in touch with my emotions, feeling so much more normal, able to think again, not nearly as tired, not dizzy, not nearly as short of breath, hot flashes still here, but not as often or as bad, can SLEEP at night, interested in life again, feel lighter, more flexible, appetite is normalizing, abdominal areas feel better, heart rhythm improving, feet and right ankle still hurt, though.

1	breast cancer	Unspoken collagen issues	Most body tissue/ligaments etc is composed of collagen including the retina.  Estrogen promotes collagen production and when estrogen is suppressed collagen in the tissues is reduced.  Since my collagen loss started I have experienced a torn rotator cuff, retinal tear with floaters so bad that I cannot read with my right eye, vaginal dryness, loss of elasticity in my urethra which causes leakage, ACL tear, and numerous other joint problems with associated pain.  I am not overweight and WAS a power walker for 40 years.  My quality of life is zilch...was it worth it? I think not!!!  I will not take anymore anti-estrogen drugs.	F	61	2  years	9/10/2008

5	Recurrent Ovarian Cancer	Extreme hot flashes, weight gain, very thin hair, and memory problems	I was given tamoxifen after my ovarian cancer returned in a single lymph node after chemotherapy.  It will be 4 years in October that I have been cancer free.  I was only cancer free 11 months after chemo so this is great to me!  It is impossible to know if the tamoxifen is what is keeping the cancer at bay, but my oncologist expects I'll be on it forever.  I truly hate the hot flashes which are severe.  I am a children's librarian and sometimes when I do stories for classes I'll sweat so much I'll drip on the pages of the book.  I am very self conscious about this, but except for taking effexor there is nothing I can do.  I'd rather be alive than dry.  The memory problems are scary and make me less effective at work.  But, to balance...my cancer is at bay I don't want to stop the tamoxifen.	F	48	4  years	8/3/2008Email
1	To prevent breast cancer recurrence	Initially I only experienced fatigue, which continued to worsen.  My blood pressure soared even though it had been under control for 10 yrs with cozaar.  After a few weeks on the drug, my eyesight became blurry to the point that I was unable to read the phonebook listing on my cell phone.    Also developed mouth sores along with other symptoms I have since forgotten....oh yes, significant short term memory problems too.  It's been four months since I stopped taking it (only took it for 5 weeks) and am feeling well now except my bp is still up.   It took a long time to start to feel normal again.

I started getting all these side effects after a year and onco didn't think it was the meds. I went off of the med for 5 months and felt fantastic-all the side effects went away. Started taking the meds again Dec. 1, now all the side effects have returned. I will be going off Tamoxifen in 2 wks and trying Lupron/Arimidex, but am terrified of feeling even worse. If the Lupron/Arimidex are as horrible as I keep hearing they are, I will seriously consider stopping all the meds.

4	stage 1 bc lumpectomy	Constipation, hot flashes, vaginal discharge	I started taking Tamoxifen last August after two, terrible years of joint pain and weight gain caused by taking Arimidex and Aromasin.  At first my doctor prescribed 20mg per day, but I did not react well and became so constipated that I did not want to continue the treatment.  The doctor advised me to try taking half the amount, i.e. 10 mg daily.  He said that for those patients who metabolize slowly 10 mg were sufficient.  Since changing to 10mg I have felt much better and have only occasional constipation.  I still have hot flashes, especially in the evening, but not so severe as before, and I no longer have the joint pains I had with Arimidex and Aromasin.	F	65	1  years	4/10/2008Email

Somewhat achy and insomnia, but on the whole feeling really well.	My tumer marker is 16. Just had Pet CT and bone scan to check status and all stable. I never expected to do so well on this drug.

1	DCIS Stage 2a-N0-M0, ER/PR+	Soaking hot flashes, continuous weight gain, extreme calf pain/charlie horses, joint pain, extreme upper extremity muscle pain and weakness, numbness/tingling in fingertips, headaches, hypertension, trochanteric bursitis, arthritis symptoms, concentration problems, and I am fighting depression.	Status post lumpectomy, chemotherapy/radiation, BRACanalysis negative:  To note, after four cycles of AC chemotherapy, my body has literally aged 10 years with the chemical menopause. After reporting my listed side effects to oncologist: "muscle, bone, weight gain, etc. not related to Tamoxifen, maybe you have carpal tunnel, you could probably use a support group".  Could a doctor be more condescending?  I purposefully submitted myself to EMG and nerve conduction studies plus x-rays to my hands - negative. I type for a living and had become so debilitated from pain - could not vacuum, wash my hair, etc. with so much pain in my hands and arms.  Pain in my left calf so severe I could barely walk at times.  PCP and I decided to go on a drug holiday, and within 10 days a lot of the pain started to disappear.  Naturopathics have advised adding milled flax seed to diet.  I have decided my "quality" of life is more important than "quantity" of years just existing	F	43	18  months	12/16/2007Email

1	Depression, Panic Disorder	After being on this drug for almost 2 months the side effects never went away. I had severe blurred vision to the point of not being able to read properly without squinting. Extreme hunger. Terrible headaches, constantly fidgeting. Ended with a pretty bad case of a Dystonic Reaction and an ER trip.	It seemed to work well other than the horrible side effects. It's been about 2 weeks since I've stopped taking it after my ER trip and the DR telling me to stop and see my Psychiatrist ASAP hoping to find something that works other than benzos as my tolerance is through the roof	M	23	2  months10mg 1X D	2/6/2012Email
1	Depress or  Bipolar	All side effects what listed on Abilify's instraction. was hospitalas, digestiv sistem  not functionable for  3 dayABILIFY : best killer	only 5 MG of Abilify can kill you in 4 Hs	F	52	1  times5 1X D	2/2/2012Email
4	Bipolar	Extreme restlessness at first but eased off by two weeks.		F	30	14  days10MG 1X D	1/28/2012Email
5	Borderline Personality Disorder	lethargy/insomnia, all resolved within first 4 weeks	This worked miracles for me. I don't say that lightly. Resolved my mood rollercaoster, lessened the paranoia, just generally made life a better place to be. I was previously on Celexa, then Paxil, neither or which made any impact one way or the other, then Wellbutrin SR. After 90 days on Wellbutrin, I attempted suicide (possibly related to Wellbutrin, but this wasn't the first time, so really not sure), and was placed on Abilify in the hospital. It made it easier to get my head in the right place to do the things I needed to do to really get better. Amazing.	F	29	1  years5mg 1X D	1/23/2012Email
5	Bipolar II with Severe Depression	Weight gain of 40 lbs, severe muscle cramps, decreased night vision, wakefulness and wandering at night, uncontrolled eyebrow movement, tooth decay, intermittent anxiety	I would not be alive if it were not for this drug.  It completely changed my life after being on just about every other type of drug there is out there.  Worked within days.  Tried to get off of it once due to the weight gain and fell into a deep depression that was extremely scary.  Can't get off of it even if I wanted to.  Too scared.  Take it along with Seroquel and Topimax.  Depakote made me a vegetable.  I will have to live with the side effects, even though some have been mistaken for more serious illnesses such as MS.	F	52	8  years20 MG 1X D	1/13/2012Email
2	depression	intense headache, extreme nausea, involuntary jaw clenching, muscle spasms in jaw and neck.	Truly felt that I was being poisened. Frightened that my clenched/twitching jaw muscles would not return to normal (known to cause twitches, sometimes permanent). Just felt very sick, like my whole body was rejecting this drug.	F	32	3  days5 mg 1X D	1/13/2012
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
