3	ERP cancer stage IIB	Have been taking tamoxifen for two and a half years.  Worst side effects are hot flashes, weight gain, lack of energy, bone/muscle pain, leg swelling.  Take glucosamine/condroitin/msm for bone pain, great results.  Take meds for fluid retention as needed.  Neurontin for hot flashes, great help but makes me dizzy and foggy some days. Take calcium and vitamin D.	Gave this med a 3 rating simply because of the side effects.  I am assuming that it is helping.  Diagnosed in '08. ERP. Chemo on clinical trial, surgery (bilateral mastectomy) and radiation.  Difficulty losing the 25 lbs I have gained since start of this medication. Lack of energy also makes it hard to lose weight.  Leg pain and swelling make it hard sometimes to walk for exercise.  Stand for work, and have had to cut back on work schedule.  I will try to finish out my recommended five year therapy plan.

2	Follow-up for DCIS breast cancer	I have a very sensitive nervous system.  Tamoxifen totally aggravated my fibromyalgia.  I felt like I had the flu 24/7; I had no energy and muscle aches. It made my varicose veins throb constantly. It also caused severe mood swings (mainly weepiness) and interfered with my ability to think straight.  My hairdresser also noted that my hair was thinning.  All of this happened after only 9 days!	My oncologist was very understanding and allowed me to come off of the medication.  She felt that in my case, the risks outweighed the potential benefits.It took almost 3 weeks for the vein throbbing to cease.	F	53	9  days20mg 1X D	10/2/2011
