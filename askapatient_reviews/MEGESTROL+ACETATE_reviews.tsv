5	Appetite Loss	Night sweat	Megace works wonderfully.  I have not experienced any side effects besides sweating (only at night).  It has brought my appetite back and I have gained 8 pounds in 3 weeks.	F	27	3  weeks625 mg 1X D	5/25/2011Email
1	appetite stimulant	My 92 year old father was in rehab following hip surgery; Megace was prescribed as an appetite stimulant. Two days after starting this drug, he experienced vivid (and often scary) visual hallucinations. Prior to this he was alert and oriented, with slight short term memory deficit. I couldn't believe this was a side effect, but after an internet search mentioned hallucinations several times, we requested the drug be stopped. It took several days for his mind to clear. We were challenged by the doctor and nursing staff, but stood firm in our request to stop this drug. We feel vindicated since the symptoms stopped when the drug stopped.	This and ALL drugs should be considered carefully before being given to an elderly person, AND they should be carefully monitor for side effects. In fact, in the elderly, the fewer medications, the better.	M	92	4  days40 1X D	10/29/2010
1	to gain weight	manic-type side effects. Could not sleep for days and would fall  over finally to sleep. Began "manic" binge of purchases and I'm told grandiose ideations. I am being weaned now but am having severe "crying jags." I turned against everyone who loved me and was arguing with everyone and extremely mean, even verbally vicious to the people I love and who love me. I didn't want to go out but stayed inside on my computer and made excuses for everything people tried to help me with, even my sister who is an RN and my brother in law who is an MD. The doctor who prescribed this for me to gain weight (I am 5 feet 1 inches tall and weighed 80 lbs but wasn't malnourished) is a very elderly guy - 88 - 89 yrs. old)and didn't explain anything about this having steroidal or hormonal effects.	This is a very powerful drug and ought not be used for someone to just gain weight. My underlying illness is COPD and I'm a 62 yr. old female. I felt so good and "high" I couldn't see that I was angry and attacking my loved ones constantly. I only knew that I felt good and so "high" that I went on an $8000.00 buying spree online, thinking I could completely remodel our house on my own.	F	62	5  weeks30 mls 1X D	9/27/2010
5	To gain weight	None	I had lost about 12 lbs. and had no appetite.  Didn't care about cooking at all because I never felt hungry.  After starting Megace ES, I started getting an interest in eating again.  I have gained the 12 lbs. back!	F	69	3  months1 tsp 1X D	5/8/2010
