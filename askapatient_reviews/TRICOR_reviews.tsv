1	High triglycerides, cholesterol	Extreme fatigue, legs feel weak, hips hurt, no energy	I feel like I barely have enough energy to get up in the mornings.  Legs feel like rubber.  Bad history with statins...was kept on various meds while complaining of severe hip pain.  Evidently no one connected that to joint pain and I continued taking the meds until I researched it myself and dc'd it  Stopped taking TRICOR today!	F	58	12  days145 mg 1X D	8/20/2012Email
1	cholesterol	We all know how painful a charlie horse is. Now imagine that pain in your legs, neck, ribs,(especially ribs) arms and every where else imagineable. Sitting, standing, or lying down I have cramps. Add having to be on your feet all day at work and you're really talking pain.	I went to my doctor about this pain because it was disrupting my home life as well as interfering with my job. I had body scans, blood tests, (more than $600.00 worth) ultra sounds and was even sent to a specialist and just two days ago she decides to take me off of Tricor. When I looked this drug up I was shocked and furious to see this site. Why wasn't this done in the first place? Now I have to wonder if this will be a permant problem or if it will cause permant damage. I was also told I have an accelerated heart rate. Is this also a symptom?	F	55	1  years48MG 1X D	9/29/2010
