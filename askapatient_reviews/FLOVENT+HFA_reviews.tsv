4	asthma	flovent works good,but you have to take it regulary for it to work.I have no side effects from this medicine.I think most of the side effects that some of the people are talking about would disappear once the body adjusted to the medicine.		M	51	10  years220 2X D	4/1/2013Email
1	Asthma like symptoms	I began Flovent at around 5PM the first night. I took my second dose around 7AM the next morning, and by the time I was at work at 9AM I was feel tingly, my heartbeat was 96, I was coughing, I had a lump in my throat, and I was fatigued and dizzy. It got so bad I had to tell my boss I was leaving. I almost started crying when I told him, which was very strange, because while I was concerned about my condition, I was in no way upset or sad, but I couldn't seem to control my emotions. I spent the rest of the day at home, sitting in a chair, feeling totally out of it. Scary stuff...		F	60	2  times88 mcg. 2X D	3/5/2013
1	asthma	Made me irritable/depressed and sad. This came on gradually over several days.	Since this drug doesn't seem to do much for asthma I don't think I'll use it. The degree of help is not worth the side effects, which are pretty spooky.	F	58	3  days 1X D	1/31/2013
3	Asthma	Sadness, depression	My otherwise happy go lucky 12yr old, who has been on this medicine about 18months, has recently become depressed, and cannot explain why he feels this way. There have been no recent events in his life to cause these feelings, and the only medicine he takes regularly is Flovent HFA. After doing some research online, it seems that although this wasn't one of the reported symptoms in the clinical trial, many people have reported depression as a side effect of this medication. I have called his respiratory specialist and asked for another medication.	M	12	18  months44mcg 2X D	8/9/2012Email
5	Chronic Acute Asthma	occasionally lost voice and had oral thrush once	I didn't rinse my mouth or use a spacer all the time, that is why these things happened...but also my doctor reduced my dosage to the least amount and it still works well.  Before Flovent, I had to be on a prednisone burst once a month.  Now I only need prednisone maybe twice a year if I have a bad virus or if I'm around an allergy trigger for too long.

1	virus-induced asthma	SOBBINGcrying all nightwaking up each hour at nightsadnessweepingcrying all night long after only one puff of this drug	My son has mild asthma, wheezing for just 2 days after an upper respiratory tract infection. He was prescribed Flovent HFA. I was very worried about giving this to him, based on all of the possible side effects. But after a lot of pressure from his doctors, I decided to start slowly and give him just one puff (44 mcg) yesterday morning to start. He had a pretty normal day, maybe a little bit more clingy and irritable, but no problem. He went to bed fine for bedtime, but he then woke up each hour ALL NIGHT LONG, SOBBING. He was just weeping, inconsolable. I have never seen my son like this before. He is such an easy-going boy who never complains. Even when he is teething all of his molars and in the middle of a bad cold, he does not cry and sleeps through the entire night. Last night, after just ONE PUFF of Flovent in the morning, he had the WORST NIGHT OF HIS LIFE. He woke up each hour inconsolably crying for 45 minutes until we could console him back to sleep, just to wake up again a little bit later WEEPING. Flovent is a HORRENDOUS medication. What kind of poison must be in this drug to cause such a horrible reaction after just ONE PUFF ?!!!! I will never give my son this medication again.	M	1.5	1  days44 mcg 1X D	3/27/2012Email
4	Asthma	I have had no negative side effects except a slight metallic taste in my mouth sometimes.  Of course, you are supposed to rinse out your mouth after each inhalation.	I had my allergy doctor switch me from Advair to Flovent (since Flovent does not contain a Long-acting Bronchodilator).  An LABD can cause heart failure, so needless to say that was a concern.  Advair has both an LABD and a corticosteroid.  Flovent just has a corticosteroid, which I felt more comfortable with.	M	49	30  days110 mcg. 2X D	10/25/2011
