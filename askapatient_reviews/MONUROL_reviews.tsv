5	UTI	I am absolutely way too sensitive to nearly ALL antibiotics that treat UTI's; I cannot take Flagyl, Cipro, Bactrim, or Macrobid.  My doctor gave me this medication as a last ditched effort; it worked!	No side effects at all!  This med is old school, and insurance does not cover it.  It was $65 and is found at compounding pharmacies, or old school pharmacies.  Walgreens does not carry it.	F	41	1  times1 packet 1X D	6/13/2010Email
1	UTI		NO PHARMACIES HAD THIS MEDICATION AVAILABLE. WALGREENS, RITE AID, ETC... IT IS HARD TO FIND AND WAY EXPENSIVE. NO INSURANCE COMPANIES CARRY IT. THIS ISN'T A GOOD ALTERNATIVE IF YOU NEED IMMEDIATE RELIEF AND HELP WITH YOUR INFECTION.	F	22	0  days	1/21/2006
