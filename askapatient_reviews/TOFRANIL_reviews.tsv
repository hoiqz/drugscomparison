5	Depression, panic disorder	Dry mouth, occasional constipation, lowered blood pressure, slightly elevated pulse.	This drug, along with therapy, saved my life. The side effects (for me) are minor compared to the vast benefits--an end to panic attacks and depression.	F	53	24  years75-150 mg 1X D	3/19/2013Email
1	TR Depression	Mouth dryer than a desert, serious urinary retention	I'm talking standing in front of a toilet for 15-20 minutes and giving up. This med would have Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins on their knees begging god for pee. Awful	M	31	24  days150 1X D	1/25/2013Email
1	depression	psychosis, tiredness	I forgot the dosage, its been awhile but immediatIy i was hearing strange noises, I was convinced there was a ghost in my house. Doors opening, music playing, footsteps. It started the day I started taking it, when I told my doc he got me off immediately and switched to lithium which has been a blessing	F	27	14  days60 1X D	6/6/2011Email
4	panic/generalized anxiety		This stopped some serious panic attacks dead in their tracks.  For that I am grateful.  I tapered off them due to my aversion to drug therapy, but would definitely take these again if needed.	M	37	45  days	5/28/2008
1	depression/bipolar II	i was already depressed before taking this but it did keep me from doing and self mutilation. in fact i couldnt do anything. I couldnt talk to anyone without crying, i had terrible headaches, barely moved at all, never left the house and couldnt sleep... basically cried all day long the entire duration of time that i was on this drug and could not do anything else.	horrible-killed my social life	F	19	2  months	2/25/2008
2	anxiety, depression, insomnia	125 mg at night: dry mouth, mild weight gain (8 lbs), dizziness on standing, cravings for sweets, headaches, very tough to stop taking this med.	I switched to this med for 5 years because it was only one of 2 antidepressants offered at my college health center. Previously, I took desipramine for 1 month, which was much more effective. Because I did not know much about antidepressants meds back then, I was not aware of just how great the difference was between these two meds.Tofranil helped me sleep somewhat. It also helped me concentrate and focus, and it reduced my anxiety, but not by much.  My sex drive was fine, I had NO sexual side effects at all, nor did I have any memory loss that I was aware of. I have tried 3 tricylics and had no sexual side effects on any of them - so take note that not everyone has that side effect!BUT, after 2 years of taking tofr., it activated restless legs syndrome, which continued until I stopped the med. I also got headaches. Stopping it was extremely difficult, I had flu like symptoms and went through a very tough withdrawal. This drove me nuts, as I felt like i could not stop these meds.

3	vvs	tired all the time, moodiness, inability to focus correctly on tasks (including driving), weight loss	withdrawl was hard..don't up dosage to fast.  Make sure to take at same time each day..if you don't you might start to get jittery.  It helped a bit with pain and at least let me sleep.  I was so tired all the time and just well..stoned..that the small amount of pain relief I got wasn't worth it.	F	29	6  days	1/13/2006

3	anxiety	I had insomnia at the beginning and then memory problems started. I read up on some studies linking imipramine to decreased memory and I am a med student and can't lose any memory which I really need. So now I am trying to come off the drug, but experiencing insomnia again.	Has anyone else noticed the decrease in memory?	F	23	30  days	9/1/2005
3	psychotic depression, panic, ocd	rapid weight gain which leveled off after 6 mths.  I gained 30lbs.  This drug has a soothing quality to it that I find wonderful.  I am on a high dose at 150mg.	Also helps to calm down, relax and sleep.	F	26	14  months	8/2/2005

5	generalized anxiety/panic attacks	When on high dosage, had some lightheadedness upon standing up quick and some dry mouth. it allowed me to be functional again and then lowered dosage considerably (to 10 mg) - still need that dosage to keep from jumpiness, generalized anxiety. when on low dosage, no visible side effects.
