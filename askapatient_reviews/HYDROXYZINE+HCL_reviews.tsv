4	Eczema, food allergies	extreme drowsiness; mild vertigo; cognitive difficulties	I've been taking hydroxyzine for food allergies and eczema since I was almost four years old. It never helped much with the itching, but if I take it before I eat something I know I'm allergic to, it kills any reaction that might have occurred. This is great, because it allows me to still enjoy food that I love without having to worry about the reaction. The drowsiness is a big pain, but oddly enough, did not start until a few years ago. I've noticed that it's gotten somewhat better over time, so I'm guessing it's just a phase. Either way, it's no big deal since I only take it every now and then, when the family decides to go out for seafood. I'd recommend it if you have food allergies as well, but seek other options for skin conditions if the drowsiness is too much of a problem for you.	F	18	  1X AN	8/3/2012
5	Anxiety	Felt drowsy about 30 minutes after taking 20 mg.  Flat affect.  Cognitive difficulties.	This drug, combined with Xanax, helped calm me down considerably.  People around me felt unnerved by my lack of facial expressions and emotional responses.  I felt like I was dependent on it in a short amount of time.  However, I am not sure if that was simply because my stress levels were so high.	F	29	14  days10 mg 6X D	12/13/2011Email
5	allergies - hives	none	Nothing else worked at all to control my hives until I was finally prescribed this two years ago. I take it as needed, anywhere from 20-50mg per dose (depending on severity), and it works incredibly quickly. I tried it for a week several years ago, at which point it made me very drowsy. However, I stopped for several months and then tried again, and now no drowsiness, nausea, or any other side effects whatsoever.	F	20	2  years20 - 50mg 1X D	7/19/2010
1	Itchy rash	Extreme drowsiness, confusion, slow coordination.	This drug did nothing to help my itchiness.  The only thing it did was make me extremely sleepy!	F	32	2  days25mg 4X D	6/9/2010

5	Itch - atopic dermatitis	Drowsy	Good stuff. My little green footballs always come through for me when I need them.	F	44	30  years	9/4/2007
4	skin rash and itching	I took the first pill on an empty stomach, in the middle of the day, because most over the counter pills that are known to cause drowsiness usually do not cause me sleepiness. I was extremely nautious and vomited about a half hour later.  I took the 2nd pill later in the evening with a snack, no nautiousness at all and slept like a rock, (which has NEVER happened!) FOR ALMOST 12 HOURS!  I forced myself to get out of bed, or else I could have easily slept longer!	I found that I was MUCH less itchy within about an hour, and that it did help me get the sleep I much needed, but the rest of the next day I was pretty drowsy.  Not suppose to be taken if you may become pregnant due to risk of birth defects if taken in early pregnancy. (unfortunately, I did not know this and was actively trying to get pregnant, and even told my Dr. of this.)  I took a 25 mg dose, and will try cutting it in half tonight to see if it still works for the itching, but doesn't make me sleep so long.	F	32	 	5/3/2007
5	itchiness/allergens	nauseau at first; DO NOT use before consuming alcohol, 1-2 drinks can make me intoxicated to the point of severe vomitting; sedation	This medication was what I had been searching for. I have bad allergies, always sneezing itching, etc. Had been using Allegra for years for common irritants, but did nothing for my dermatological concerns. My ezcema was most severe on my legs, behind the knees and at my worst point right before starting the Atarax covered my entire lower legs with thick, dry, itchy scabs. It also appears on the insides of my elbows and scalp. I was always given a cream, then demanded an ointment - both of which came in perscriptions that would only last me a week at best - and finally, upon a desperate visit to the other doctor in the practice he perscribed this for the itching, and Singulair for my nasal allergies. MAGIC.I'm finally comfortable in my skin, during times when I go without the hydroxyzine, there is a NOTABLE difference in how ITCHY I am!!	F	18	1  years	1/16/2007Email
