5	Schizoaffective Disorder	None except some yawning an hour after taking.	This is by far the best antipsychotic I've taken with the fewest side effects too.  It helps with thinking straight, being unafraid of people, sleeping at night when I need to, and it even has increased my libido.  Overall I've become much more functional than when I took any of the so-called atypical antipsychotics, including the revered Clozaril.  I only tried this older medication after trying all the newer ones over the course of ten years, and supposedly having no other choice.  It's a shame I wasn't tried on this first.  It would have saved me years of agony and excess body weight (I'm losing all my Zyprexa weight now while I've been taking Trilafon).  Just remember that just because it works so well for me, it doesn't mean it will for you.  Everyone reacts differently.	M	39	1  years24 mg 1X D	9/20/2011
1	psychiatrist didn't like me	Akathesia. This drug is pure poison. NEVER voluntary use it. 	If you have used it for 1-2 days STOP IT IMMEDIATELY. I did and I survived (28 years old) although I it was terrible. I used seroquel to help with sleeping thought.If you have used it for longer periods of time. I don't know. You maybe doomed. God bless your soul.	M	30	3  days8 MG 2X D	1/14/2011

2	Schizo affective disorder	nausea, restlerssness sleeping problems, nightmares, vomiting, dry mouth, drowsiness rapid heart beat, difficulty urinating, problems breathing, sor musles hurt real bad, shaking body or hands during different parts of theday, dizzy, confused, cannot focus	I take as my doctor prescribed, but have problems one momment and better another. Feel like the world can do without me, only friends and family seem to understand. others want me to kill myself and stole my profile pictures and posted them on the Software Problem and other Google groups. While I am not suicidal, I am very sad adn am mocked and made fun of on most web sites. I try to keep my mental illness a secret, but they know and follow me around the internet telling me to kill myself or that the world would be better off with out me. I even get phone calls asking for someone with a different name who does not live here and it happens during the day. It used to happen at 3AM a few years ago, but why are they doing this?I guess I don't belong here, tried to stop thinking about it, tried to forget, but medicine brings those bad memories back.My crime they say, is that I exist and that is reason enough to hate me and why they want me dead. But I will survive this and be with my friends and family as long as I can. Even if I am suffering and in pain a lot with a sore neck, back, and head. I've had my head hit many times in my life and recently bumped it on a wooden TV stand trying to get a computer part that fell back there.Even my own son disrepected me, my father died his grandfather, and I try Love and Logic and be a good father, but he keeps doing these things to me and he knows they get on my nerves. I love him, but if he keeps it up somehow the stress reacts	M	42	60  days12 1X D	10/3/2010
2	Psychotic episode	Cognitive slowing, major confusion, painful muscle spasms, feeling sick and zombielike, made me too disorganized to read	Some people love it. It does have a lot of good about it, but I would never consider taking it again. Ever.	F	17	2  months24mg 1X D	8/30/2010
5	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Rapid/Pounding Heart Beat, Palpitations, Muscle Cramps	I have had hardly any side effects from this medicine, and I feel really good on it. It doesn't increase my appetite like some other antipsychotics.	F	22	2  weeks	12/20/2009
1	some sort of psychotic disorder	Severe depression leading to intense suicidal ideation	Normally I can sometimes THINK about suicide, but Trilafon made me so depressed that I started OBSESSING about it. It got so far that I made exact plans, before I decided to seek help before it was too late.	M	34	1  days	7/14/2009
3	Bipolar II	Dry mouth, muscles aching, sore throat, draining sinus, forget short term memory (most of these went away until I upped the medicine), sometime but not alway, wake up early ie 4:00 am increase oragms?	I just increase from 12 to 16. The side effects aren't horrible but annoying. Most of them went away at 12 but came back when I went to 16. Perphenazine has made be ok better, I still have some have my moment. Perphenazine did make them less and not as bad as normal. I am really hoping this works because I think I have been on most everything and either it didn't work or side effects that I could not live with. This is an older drug and there is a small chance of getting Parkinson. My Dr. told me to take 800mg of vitamin E.	F	39	1  months	7/21/2006Email
