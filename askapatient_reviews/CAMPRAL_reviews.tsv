4	Alcohol Abuse	None, really.  Maybe a little flat feeling.	I posted a year ago after being on it 9 days.  I managed to abstain for a full six months, at which time I quit taking the Campral.  I started drinking again within a few weeks.  Though it seemed very subtle at the time, the stuff does work; which is much easier to see in retrospect.  So today I'm starting back on the Campral.

5	Alcohol abuse	Maybe a little tired, but taking Lexapro, too	Once I stopped drinking for about 5 days while taking Campral, it worked. Cravings mostly gone. It repairs the prefrontal lobe, which is needed to make good decisions about drinking and drugs. Really, a miracle drug. I highly recommend it to any alcoholics, but you have to not drink for around a week, and give it a chance. It did not help when I took it and still drank!!!	F	48	1  months2X333mg 3X D	9/12/2010
3	Drinking out of control	Lowered libido, weight loss, food tastes different.	1) Only on day 9, alcohol-free, so I will update.  I had been drinking a 12-pack a night for years.  Seems to help with cravings.  I usually cave after a week or so, so we will see....	M	46	9  days1998 3X D	6/29/2010
3	alcoholism	None that were appreciable but I was on a "cocktail" of medications.	I was on campral, depakote and zoloft. The morning and afternoon dose made me sleepy.  Afer rehab I went down to 2 doses a day for around 3 months.  Then didn't feel that it was helping all that much and stopped treatment. Have been sober for almost 3 years but have other mood disorder that I have to medicate.	M	39	4  months	3/25/2009
3	alcoholism	None so far, but it's only been a week.		F	34	7  days	5/1/2008
1	alcoholism	suicidal thoughts, increased depression, anger	I am on Paxil as well as Campral and the effects may be due to the mix of the drugs.  But I got off after only a week so I may have to find another way to stop my obsession with drinking.	F	47	7  days	4/15/2008
