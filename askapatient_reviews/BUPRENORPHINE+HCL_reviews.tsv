5	chronic knee pain	none	I love this stuff.  It beats narcotics.  Things I've learned about it; 1) it can come in troche form which is a lot less than suboxone (with an anti-inflamatory added which makes it for a unique use). 2) docs are limited in the number of addiction recovery patients they may have but not in the number of pain management patients. 3) unlike traditional narcotics, this works continually with no lessening of pain relief.

5	Back Pain, Severe	Terrific pain killer. The only side effect for me was insomnia. Being a partial opiate agonist and partial antagonist it is a safer medication than pure agonist opioids. Used extensively in Europe, but here in the USA any doctor wanting to prescribe this medication must take an 8 day course and give it only to addicts.	Use it in the USA for pain. It works great.

4	Opiate withdrawl and cravings	None actually that i noticed	You cannot use any other opiates, from codiene to oxy to heroin for 24-48 after taking bubrenorphine. Buprenoprphine is a partial opiate, but does not make one high, but totally eliminates withdrawls. 	M	31	 	5/22/2004Email
