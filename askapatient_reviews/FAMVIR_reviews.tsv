5	Shingles	Had mild case of Shingles: -a little pain & annoying itching, blisters.  Had low level headache for first three days taking Famciclovir; no headaches after that.	Also used 0,25% Desoximetasone Cream applied to sores and rash three times daily.  Between the Cream and Famvir there were daily improvements in pain, skin tenderness, itching, etc.  A slight tenderness in one spot caused me to continue the cream for two days after finishing the Famvir treatment.

5	For shingles	No side effects.  I was taking it for shingles and it seemed to work well.	Took away the pain and the shingles I had on the back of my leg.	M	49	2  weeks 1X D	4/16/2012
4	Shingles	Helped. The nerve pain and weakness. I seemed to have a boost when in wa in my system but when my dose would start wearing off id start to feel jittery and panicky kinda weird n felt like I wanted to scream or cry Idk just weird. Hope it's temp tho I have anxiety anyway		F	37	1  weeks250 mg	3/3/2012
4	Shingles	I was on Valtrex for 3 days but I could hardly urinate, if at all. Also had constipation. I also thought I was going to jump out of my skin--unbearable jitteriness. I was switched to Famvir. It is much easier to tolerate. No problems urinating! A little jittery, some brief heart palpatations, and some headache but it's nothing I can't stand for a week. I just think these anti-virals are heavy duty drugs. Famvir seems to be a different class than Valtrex and Zovirax so if you can't stand one group try the other. Both drugs dried up the shingles.

1	shingles	First time I had severe shingles and started taking Famvir. On the 5th day I began to feel extremely disoriented and shaky. Took my BP which was very high and my pulse was close to 200. I drove myself to the hospital and stayed there for several hours while I experienced several episodes of atrial fibrillation. I was given intravenous salt solution and some pills under the tongue. Then I was released but had another atrial fibrillation episode again the next day and went again to the emergency. It was less severe. I did not finish the prescription and have not had any heart problems since then. This all happened 4 and a half years ago.		M	72	5  days500 3X D	10/16/2010
5		Mild headache has been my ONLY side effect.  Controlled best by one naproxin taken along with one famvir, as they last about the same length of time.	I am so grateful for this medication.  I had recurring shingles until I started this medication.  Full workup and specialised tests revealed no known cause whatsoever.  It was surmised that I may have been born with a low-normal immune system.  I tried to go off the medicine for a month or more so that I could try the shingles vaccine; but after just three days I got shingles again.  So I am back on famvir and may just need to take it for life.  Are there any long-term negative effects to watch out for?  NOTE: I am interested to know whether others who are susceptible to shingles had a particularly strong case of chicken pox as a child.  Mine came at age 2 1/2 concurrent with measles!  My fever spiked to 106F, I had a febrile seizure and went into a 3 hour coma which included a near-death experience.  Is there any chance this severity is why I get the shingles so easily now?

2	erythema multiforme after herpes	Very tired, sleepy, hard to stay focussed, irritable, anxious	Taking maintenance dose to prevent herpes outbreak leading to EM. Haven't been taking long enough to know if effective. Side effects have improved somewhat over the week, but if they don't clear soon, I'll need to reconsider this.	M	54	1  weeks125 mg 1X D	5/21/2010
1	herpes	fatigue, headache, fuzzy head, spots and vesicles on body and mouth ulcers.  Worse than herpes.  I don't take any other medications so it was not an interaction.  Horrible medicine.	Famvir has put me right off seeking help for herpes.  I will just plod along and treat it as I have always done with betadine solution.	F	64	4  days250 mg 2X D	3/11/2010
5	Cold Sores	Headache (mild, brief), sometimes vertigo (mild)	I just had a major victory with Famvir, I felt the 'tingle' stage of a cold sore coming on and- per Dr's prescription- took a single dose of 3 pills. Only ended up getting 4 papules and two days later it is almost entirely gone. Yay!	F	30	1  days	12/30/2009
4	herpes	I am diabetic and my blood sugar soars the entire time I am on this medication.  The amount of insulin I need to control my blood sugar levels is easily four times what I would normally take.	However, this medication does work well.  If I take it at the first sign of tingling I can avoid the outbreak all together.  If there is already a blister it will cut the cycle in half and the outbreak is far less severe	M	40	18  months	8/10/2009
5	Cold Sores	Elevated heart rate for about 3 hours.  All day headache/migraine and tiredness.	Famvir does clear up the cold sores extremely well and fast.	F	39	1  years	7/8/2009
5	genetal herpes	a constant, mild, headache. No outbreaks since taking 250 mg twice a day. Twice a day works better than one 500 per day. Not sure if lower energy levels & weight gain are related to the Famvir or the fact I'm now 50. No blood pressure related issues.	Wondering about effects longterm. Not wanting to get off it as it is wonderful not to have outbreaks again.	F	50	7  years	6/17/2008
5	CNS problems likely realted to VZV	Occasional Minor Headaches	Got hit with Bell's Palsy about 6 years ago.  After that, I expreienced all kinds of weird aches and pains that I wrote off as "getting older". Then things got really bad, and took Valtrex at 3G per day. It fixed all my pains, but made me feel sick.  Switched to 500mg famvir twice daily, and it keeps all those pains at bay.  Very expensive even with insurance until this year when they released a generic.  Now it is fully covered by my insurance.	M	38	2  years	5/1/2008
5	Oral outbreaks	None that I am aware of.  After 7 years I am wondering what the long term impacts on my health are.  Does this cause loose bowels, affectimmune system's efficiency, etc.	Have been on a 500 maintenance regime. Recently took a 90 day break and am returning to a 250 mg daily maintenance.  Frequently experience tingling but breakouts are limited to twice a year.	F	47	7  years	2/13/2008
3	Cold Sores	Elevated heart rate- it beat faster than usual and made me shaky		F	18	 	12/5/2007
3	Oral Herpes	Sever headache, flushed, dizzy, confused, ringing ears, neck pain.	Had the same symptoms the first time I took a single-day dose but I had dismissed them. I think that this confirms my reaction to Famvir. I will not be taking it again. Did not have these symptoms with Acyclovir. Both were moderately effetive in healing cold sore outbreaks.	M	32	1  days	11/1/2007
5	HSV II	sometimes slight headache.  important to drink plenty of water with it.	works great.  for me, better than valtrex.  i have bad, persistent obs for 5 years, and i couldn't live without famvir.  without it my obs are unbearable, with severe nerve pain that can last weeks.	F	31	5  years	10/14/2007
1	anti-viral pre-surgery	Although my Dr. said I was an "ultra-rare" case, it caused my red blood cells to break up and force me into severe anemia.  I had horrible headaches, extreme dizziness, fainting, very weak.  I eventually was hospitalized and had to receive three blood transfusions because my rbc count got so low.	I am NEVER taking it again!	F	23	7  days	9/14/2007
5	Cold Sore	none that I could recall	I took this immediatly when I felt tingling of a cold sore, It stopped the cold sore before it ever came to be a nuissance.	F	21	 	6/6/2007
1	genital hepes	skin rash....	L-lysine is the best remedy that can help to suppress the herpes virus.	M	41	1  weeks	4/25/2007
5	herpes keratitis (in the eye)	none ever	This has worked at 250mg/day as a maintenance drug to keep my flare-ups in check. limits severity, frequency, and duration of flare-ups. Have been on it for 6-7 yrs at least.	M	44	7  years	4/11/2007
1	shingles	Extreme headache, nausea, diarrhea	I took 2 doses and woke up the next morning with headache, nausea, vomiting. Although my doctor feels it is generally a safe drug, she didn't want me to continue it.	F	58	1  days	2/11/2007
3	Labial Cold Sores	Pain in Joints, other strange unexplainable pains, similar to what I experienced taking Acyclovir, when I stop taking medication pain goes away.	Not worth the extremity pain	M	44	7  days	12/15/2006Email
4	Chronic HHV6 reactivation/M.E.	Headache--dull, mild to moderate, usually about an hour after taking dose. Controlled by Tylenol.	I am taking 500 mg three times a day. I've had M.E. with very high HHV6 titers for 21 years. My daily activity level was reduced to 20% of normal, with daily migraines, flu-ish feeling, chills, body pain, weakness, cognitive problems. After 2 months on Famvir my migraines are greatly reduced in frequency and intensity. I feel about 50% better overall. So far, so good. I think I'm getting my life back after many years of suffering.	F	55	2  months	7/19/2006
3	genital herpes	Headache, all day long for the entire treatment period of 5 days every time I take it. Acyclovir and Valcyclovir caused headaches and vomiting so at least Famvir doesn't make me throw up.	L-Lysine seems to work just as well but the doc insists I take this.	F	54	4  years	6/8/2006
2	Genital Herpes	No side effects but I still have several outbreaks each month so I'm not sure it's worthwhile taking it. I'm trying to research whether I can increase the dosage I am taking (250 mg twice a day)		F	53	6  months	3/15/2006
5	genital herpes	ringing in ears, may hav low back pain - could be due to other cause. other than these, no problems	it has been a god send.  had an outbreak on vacation w/ no famvir and it was awful for 2 weeks.  next outbreak, had famvir and it stopped fatigue, pain and discomfort within 3 days.  went @ 11 yrs without outbreak, in menopause having many.	F	56	20  weeks	11/27/2005
5	neuralgias asso w nasal cold sores	none	It offset the accute neuralgia symptoms, but most surprisingly, it also had a general positive effect on the everyday aches and pains that I did not associate with herpes.  I have tried to contact the mfgr with no luck. VERY EXPENSIVE! No long term information available.	M	52	2  years	11/7/2005
3	shingles	headache, fatigue,	had high blood pressure when I initially went in with symptoms. Have never had high blood pressure before. The high blood pressure has continued throughout the week I have been on the medication.	F	46	7  days	3/26/2005
3	herpes	none	best i can tell, it will reduce length of outbreak only if taken at first tingle.  So, instead of 8 days of sores and healing, maybe only 4 days. I only take when i feel a tingle, rather than daily.	M	38	5  years	12/22/2002
