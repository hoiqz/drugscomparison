5	Mild vaginal yeast infection	Very mild warmness after application of 3-day cream internally and externally.  I used CANESTEN 3-day Cream, the Canadian equivalent of MYCELEX 3-day Cream.	I tried Canesten 3-day cream (Canadian brand by Bayer), which has the same active ingredient - Clotrimazole - as Mycelex (American brand).  I had developed a yeast infection after taking antibiotics for a bad bout of bronchitis.  This was my first yeast infection.I had tried Monistat 3-day cream treatment and discontinued use after 1 treatment.  Monistat was a horrible experience for me as I experienced very intense unbearable burning.  I have a pretty high tolerance for pain so I was surprised how much it hurt.  My doctor said I was allergic to Monistat's active ingredient or the carrier cream.I'm happy to say that I experienced NO PAIN or intense burning with Canesten/Mycelex.  I will continue the full 3-day treatment and hopefully the yeast infection is gone for good.		35	3  days	12/26/2007
3	thrush	headache and nausea like a virusI took 15 troches but have a rx for 40.	I had 3 days on the troches but stopped when I got side effects.Tongue and sores much improved but I am afraid they will return.Eliminating sugar from the diet is key although my doctor nevermentioned this.

1	Vaginal yeast infection	After using the applicator with cream, I experienced abdominal pain -- it felt like the uterus does when you're going to get your period or are on the first day only not terrible. Also had some pain in lower right side (ovary area). I have a retroverted uterus and have been told that sex could be painful because of that so I'm wondering if I just bumped my cervix with the applicator and annoyed my insides? The pain went away in about ten or 15 mins. I noticed just after that a tinge of pink in the cream -- just a little bright red blood like you'd get from a tiny cut or a papercut, mixed with the cream. I used the cream again the next day and had the same tinge of blood when I wipe myself. Today's day 3 and I didn't take the cream last night but today I still saw the faintest little bit of blood. I didn't have that before the cream!	I'm heading to the doctor this week to see what's going on. I think I may be allergic to the cream.	F	33	2  days	9/10/2006Email
