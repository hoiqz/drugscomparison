1	Ocular pressure	My hair has begun falling out after a month on combigan following cataract surgery. Apparently this is a little known side effect. Have been switched to xalatan so am hoping I stop shedding soon!		F	50	1  months2 x day	9/28/2012Email

1	Glaucoma	After 15mnths developed red eyes, itching eyelid margins, tear ducts and other areas around the eye, particularly below the eye where the skin became red and raw.	Caused Uveitis and Iritis which are being treated with steroid and dilatory drops which in turn are raising the eye pressures and the replacement (preservative-free) Cosopt drops are not strong enough to counteract this. Will probably end up needing surgery.	M	66	2  years 2X D	10/14/2010Email
3	temporary use to lower pressure	Dry mouth, bad taste in mouth, feel a bit tired.  Am getting some palpitations but not too serious as a deliberate cough or two stops them.  I was a chronic A-Fibber for 10 years before surgical cure (mini-maze surgery 4 years ago), so am quite familiar with heart palpitations.	I am only taking this temporarily in one eye after cateract surgery because corticosteroid drops caused high ocular pressure.  Would not want to take Combigan long term.

1	glaucoma	I am exhausted almost immediately upon administering the drops.  I feel drained, lethargic, no energy at all.	I took Combigan 2 weeks ago for 2 days, felt exhausted, gloomy, so I stopped the drops and felt great once again.  I waited 2 weeks, tried again, and immediately felt drained, just like before.  I also take Xalatan with no ill effects.  I will continue with that and substitute Dorzolomide for Combigan.  I have 3 children, so I can't sleep all day, I need my energy back.

4	high IOP	Puts me to sleep immediately, so I take it right before bedtime.	Been on it 2 years and only now have been experiencing redness in one of my eyes only. Stopped the drops in that eye only and redness goes away. Until now I've had no problems with it.	F	40	2  years	12/23/2009
