3	urine leakage	None so far	It hasn't been effective to this point....however I have been on it for only 10 days. I'm interested in the experience of others in taking the 15 mg tablet.	M	70	10  days	6/30/2009
5	bladder control		my nights sweats stop almost completely with 15 mg.  also very effective for weak bladder.  WILL NOT RUN OUT! the company could make a fortune if all women had that side effect.	F	63	8  months	5/21/2009
5	*urge* incontinence	severe dry mouth, gas.	after trying oxybutynin and vesicare, which did absolutely nothing for me, my doctor gave me enablex (15mgs) to try...i had little hope that it would be effective - boy, was i WRONG! -after just ONE pill, things were "normal" again!  however, due to the side effects of severe dry mouth and gas (not noxious, lol - just the kind that rolls around your gut and won't leave!), i'm now going to see if the 7.5 mg strength would be as effective with less side effects.

5	overactive bladder	dry mouth at first, but it went away.	I cannot be without it.  It has helped me immensley.	F	65	12  months	5/3/2008
