5	Diabetes	So far a lot more energy, less sleep needed and sugars went down. A little more vivid dreams, but no  nightmares. If it stays like this I highly recommend byetta!		F	50	1  months2x 5 mg	1/18/2013
5	to lose weight	Been lucky - no side effects whatsoever so far. No nausea even at the start.	In tandem with a couple of major changes to how I worked my diet which has given me much more control in splitting up calories per day and a much more varied diet, Byetta has led to me losing 6 stone over 7 months after 30 years of failure. I feel great! My support nurse says she's never seen such a positive response to Byetta.	F	51	7  months10 mcg 2X D	12/9/2012
1	Type II Diabetes	My husband started taking Byetta and was in heaven because he lost 40 lbs that insulin put on him. He plateaud and went crazy trying to lose more weight. He eats all junk food and high fat , high carb meals and then starves himself and eats Adkins Bars and shakes. He has lost all his friends, he is acting abnormal, has an obcession with weight loss. He is almost 49 and I am afraid he will kill himself on Byetta! He litterally has lost his mind! All he thinks about is weight loss, shaving all the hair off his body and buying new clothes, from 38, to 36 to 34 inch waist and says he is going to keep losing weight. His hair is thinning on his head. he is out of control with spending money and running us into debt. I called his doctor and told the office nurse he was eating all junk food and playing a dangerous game with this drug and the dim wit told him he could lose 16 more pounds! He is killing himself and ruining our lives, marriage and hurting our children.	It makes people lose their minds!!!	M	49	1.5  years 2X D	8/18/2012Email
1	Type 2 diabetes	MASSIVE angina,pain in the abdomen, dizziness and nausea	I have heart failure and this created very severe side effects. This was a very severe reaction and yet I take Januvia without trouble.	M	60	1  days5mg 2X D	7/14/2012Email
4	Type 11 diabetes	Nausea and headaches for first week which has now subsided appetite supressed eating much smallar quantities of food lost 7lbs	I am going to stick with it as I really want my weight to come down and I feel better in myself now less tired more energy	F	56	3  weeks5mg 2X D	6/17/2012Email
4	high blood glucose #s	heartburn, nausea, weight gain at first	I was on 5mg 2x a day, and it helped a bit, but I gained weight, contrary to what I've read. I also had daily heartburn and nausea and kept antacids closeby. A month ago i went to 10mg since blood sugar #s were going up and am having a much better experience. I've figured out that if I don't each much in quantity at a meal, I have no heartburn/nausea and great #s. However I do have slight abdominal cramping and a bit of diarrhea - will ask dr about this the next time. I've also lost 6# now.	F	64	2  years10mg 2X D	6/10/2012Email
4	Diabetes II	Get lethargic if I eat too many carbs, but now that I figured that out, I have more energy than the last 6 months.  My stomach sometimes gets a little jumpy, but none of the naseau which is the most typical side effect.  I have had several bouts of diarhea, which can be linked directly to eating too many carbs/too high fat carbs for dinner.  Appetite has been interesting.  I go through long periods of not being hungry at all, then instantly hungry.  Then a little bit of food, and I am full again.  Blood sugars in a more controlled range (was averaging 200, down to 150 in first week).  Have periods of intense warmth, usually after eating.  Slight increase in rosacea, but I had that prior to this drug already.  Well worth a shot twice a day for these kinds of results.  Glad I am not having the severe reactions of others.

1	diabetes	My first dose and I feel bad. It was almost instant tiredness and sick feeling. I wish I had seen this site before I took the dose. I may have just changed my mind		F	57	1  days5 2X D	12/5/2011Email
1	Type 2 Diabetes	Began 9/18/10.  Had extreme nausea, chronic burping first 3 months.  From onset, had violent, vivid nightmares which  resulted in chronic insomnia.  Cut dose in half after 6 months (3/17/11) and dreams continued, but went from violent to just crazy, but insomnia continued.  Stopped Byetta 8/3/11 and this post is 10/4/11 and the crazy dreams continue.  I fear I will permanently suffer from the dreams and insomnia.		F	64	11  months10 2X D	10/4/2011Email
4	glucose resistant	bruising and pain at injection site, hiccoughs	I have been on Byetta for over a year. It worked great at first with a feeling of satiety and fullness after eating a normal amount. After about 11 months I no longer noticed this. I am going to try taking it closer to meal time instead of waiting the hour.	F	43	16  months10mg 2X D	9/6/2011

5	Diabetes	Had a little nausea the first two weeks but well worth it.	Its been great on it for 4 yrs lost 40 lbs and A1C's stay around 6.5. I can't wait until the once a week version comes out.	M	51	4  years10 mcg 2X D	8/3/2011Email
4	type 2 diabetes	slight metalic taste in my mouth after the injection, my I,m intolerance to any type of fatty food inclusive of meat,has some initial nausea but its settled down, BSL from around 18 down to 7 ,when taken with metformin and amryl 5 mg .	seems ok, feeling a bit flat and tired	M	57	14  days5mg 2X D	7/27/2011Email
4	Diabetes Type II	When first started, nausea and lack of appetite pretty strong. Bit of dizziness and headache as well.	Was told for best results, have Byetta 45 minutes - 30 minutes before a meal. Any more, effect could be lessened, any less, and doesn't have enough time to kick in. Overall, helps control appetite a bit, but not miracle worker if you're not willing to work with it. If anything, helps you be conscious of examining how "hungry" you really are if you wait the requisite time.	F	43	1.5  months5 mcg 2X D	5/28/2011Email
4	type 2 diabetes	i have been on byetta for almost 2 years now-i have lost about 50 pounds-but have notice my hair has thinned out-my knees bother me-and i don't sleep well. but my blood sugars are better now.  i have notice a decressed sexual senation in the past 6 months.		F	52	2  years10mg 2X D	5/11/2011Email
2	Metabolic synd/Insulin resistance	Diarrhea, soft stools, frequent evacuation, bloating, gas, headaches (went away), 8 lb weight gain so far.	Ummm... isn't this supposed to help one *lose* weight, not gain it?	F	40	30  days5mcg 1X D	4/9/2011Email
4	PCOS	i get nausea almost every time i take it for about an hour and I have vomited a few times. It leaves a metal taste in my mouth for a few hours. Loss of appetite and weight loss. The smell and taste right when i take the injection bothers me.	It's hard to deal with at times, and i resent the fact that im 18 and have to do this but it could be worse because It definitely beats Metformin. I can tell when i don't eat right. I'm definitely getting used to what it does to my body. It's nothing i can't live with. It's been the best medicine i've tried for my PCOS (and i've tried metformin, glumetza, and actos) even though i get sick 8 out of 10 times i take it, over all im happy with it.	F	18	2  months10mcg 2X D	3/28/2011Email
3	weight loss and BG control	I briefly felt heaviness in my eyes with blurred vision. As of yet, no other side affects	I was surprised that the injection was painless. I have a fear of needles, but if every needle was as pain free, I would overcome my fear.	F	49	1  days5mcg 1X D	3/23/2011Email
5	better blood glucose control	I took Byetta for 2 years. Switched to Victoza for 6 months. Now back on Byetta.Superb A1C control (also taking Metformin and glyburide)---6.2 with Byetta; 6.6 with Victozamain side effect is constipation--controlled with dried fruitmild nausea for first week when starting	Byetta gives me much more energy and stamina, improved color, reduced need for sleep, appears to increase intelligence and focus, improves skin color, and generally seems to make me younger (noted by others about 2 weeks after re-starting)Really. Some kind of amazing unintended side effect.	M	58	2  years10 mcg 2X D	3/17/2011Email
3	type II, pcos, glucophage intoleran	Very mild nausea, bruising around injection site, some heartburn, tiredness, legs feel weak and jittery after 8 days, some headaches.	Haven't lost any weight yet but BG levels have reduced slightly. Came on here looking to see if anybody else had weakness in their legs as wasn't sure if this was a side effect or not. Will definately persevere with this, giving injections not as bad as expected, and worth the eide effects to see my sugars reduced. Just on Gliclazide tablets with the injection.	F	45	9  days5 2X D	3/16/2011
1	lower my blood sugar, loose weight	Started great, then nausea started. Hives, metal taste in my mouth, sores on my tongue. Now get so sick can't function lasts about 2 hours after injections. Little red spots where I inject.  Muscle weakness, pain in left shoulder, stiff neck. Am switching to victosa - hope it works better.  I think this stuff would probably kill me...symptoms feel like early pregnancy only worse.	There has to be a better formula; side effects are pretty severe.	F	58	40  days5 mg 2X D	3/12/2011Email
1	control my A1C	Nausea,headache's,extreme aches in left shoulder and neck and chest pain's mainly in the heart area. Weakness in left leg.	When first started taking it I was feeling fine. Then about 45 day's after taking it all type's of pain throughout my body started. Also diareeha also. I also had a stroke in the past few years from being a type 2 diabetic and did not know that.	M	52	75  days5mg 2X D	3/6/2011
4	Diabetes II	Nausea, decreased appetite, lower blood sugars, some weight loss	I'm very happy with results but this dose take work. You must eat a well balanced meal and excercise. I can definitely tell when I have eaten wrong or not at all my sugars shoot back up to the 200's. Nothing is a miracle and it may take a couple of weeks to get adjusted to the medication. My sugars are now in the 140-160 range.... and have lost some weight :)	F	40	39  days10MG 2X D	2/18/2011
5	dm2	extreme nausea and vomitting for first month or so. Some weight loss first few months-perhaps from byetta but perhaps from going off of meds that caused weight gain. Feel this med is a god-send--sugars good and stable all day-no highs or lows.  The downside is the cost of this medicayion-almost prohibitive.		F	56	4  years10mcg 2X D	2/15/2011
4	PCOS	little nausious	I started taking Byetta today. I had insulin resistance that was tied to my pcos, so I knew eventually it would turn to diabetis. 2 yrs after having a baby my blood sugars are higher and so I am now trying this. After reading all the info others have provided I am very excited to see what the positive effects this is going to bring for me. I took the first shot 2 hours ago, and 25 minutes after the shot ate a sensable lunch. I feel a little nausious but nothing terrible.	F	28	1  days5-10 2X D	2/14/2011Email
3	Type II Diabetes	I have experienced some nausea about 1/2 hour after the injection which lasts approximately an hour.  It eventually goes away. I've also noticed I've been tired during the day, which is unusual for me.	I take my injections before lunch and dinner.  I have found the lunch time dose bothers me more so than the dinner time dose.  I'm not sure why there would be a difference but I have less nausea at night.It has definitely helped with my appetite.  I'm a night time eater.  I now come home and have a light meal and have no desire to eat anymore the rest of the evening.  I'm extremely pleased with this side effect.  I'm hoping the appetite suppressing continues and the nausea goes away eventually.	F	46	3  days5 mg 2X D	2/10/2011
4	PCOS/Increased HgbA1C	Feeling weak and tired for about the first 2 weeks (after eating) Has went away in the past week of continuing treatment	I have lost 6 pounds in 3 weeks. Loss of appetite is a good thing for me. I am having to make myself eat a majority of the time. I have an appointment with my endo in a week to check my A1C (was 5.7 on first visit). After the first 2 weeks the side effects I was having went away and I feel it has been good for me.	F	30	3  weeks5 mcg 2X D	1/12/2011
3	Type 11 Diabetes	Nausea real bad, have vomited with it also. Started on Byetta 5mg 3 months ago and have been increased to 10mg 1 month ago. Constipation often, hair loss getting real bad, really tired, only positive have lost 18kgs. Sometimes wonder if drug is slowly killing me lol		F	44	4  weeks10mg 2X D	1/6/2011Email
3	Diabetes Type II	Severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, pain at the site where byetta was injected and the pain lasted for a few hours. Tiredness and feeling weak.	The good thing is that it is helping my sugar levels but the side effects make me look for other options. Please email me if you know of other medicines that can be taken orally and work similarly like byetta.	F	26	5  days5mcg 2X D	12/18/2010Email
4	Type 2	Blurred Vision, around the injection site hive/rash the size of a quater apear gets a little red around the injection site	Since I've been taking Byette I have lost 10 lbs	F	46	35  days10 mg 2X D	12/16/2010
3	Clinical Trials	Slight nausea,insomina,fatigue,diarrhea,	Bg running about 110,lost about 25 lbs since I started the LAR Byetta, can't sleep well and suffer from acid reflux lately. I thought it was just me until I came across this site. I don't feel that badly now that it is common with other people. Going to stick with it.	M	59	29  days 1X W	11/9/2010Email
5	PCOS	The number one side effect that I had instantly was feeling tired, weak,sicl to my stomach and at times vomitting without warning.I did notice that my sense of smell went to the roof. I could smell things that noone else could. Almost like a pregnant woman.  When I first started Byetta in Feb of this year the first two to three weeks were horrible. I talked to my GYN and said to take tums and if needed take Zofran for my stomach. After the medicine got used to my body, the side effects went away and was able to eat an hour prior to a meal, without problems. If you go off your dose for a while, you experience the side effects all over again. That's mainly why I took so long to get back in the groove of things.	Since February of 2010 I have lost 70lbs. I have PCOS and the Byetta helps a lot with my body making too much insulin. And since I have been taking Byetta I noticed I haven't had as much woman problems. The weight factor is awesome, just another perk. But I love the way the medicine works with my PCOS. I love Byetta! (Once the side effects are gone by week 3)	F	23	 10 mg 2X D	11/3/2010
5	Type II Diabetes	No drama whatsoever! :-)	Excellent appetite control!  Don't feel hungry all the time anymore.  A1c is near normal- and I've had diabetes 17 years.Avoided this drug a year due to scary comments from users in online groups, coupled with my fear of needles.  Wish I'd begun it sooner.  Feel great!  No big weight loss (maybe 10 -15 pounds in over 2 years) but it's easy to be good when you're not starving.  I already ate low carb before Byetta, now I still do... but can be bad every now and then without falling asleep.Yes, sometimes the shot stings a little, or I hit a tender spot... but for all the good this is doing for me, I can live with it.  I hope like heck they never find anything really bad that this drug does to one's body, because sugar-wise and appetite-wise, this is a winner.	F	50	2.5  years10 mgs 2X D	10/12/2010
3	Type II Diabeties	Severe nausea, My muscles ache, my feet feel as though I'm walking on bare bone with no cushion.  I do not have an appetite at all.  Very thirsty, I also have a hard time with the smell of the Byetta, it too adds to my nausea. I'm going up to 10mg in a few weeks.		F	47	30  days5mg 2X D	10/6/2010Email
3		generally I feel unwell. nausea ,can not eat hardly anything and the worst side effect for me is that my heart is going very fast.on the upside my sugars are great and I have lost 12lbs in 15 days.	The wonder if lilly (makers)could do something about the ingredient that makes us all feel sick.	F	56	12  days5mg 2X D	10/5/2010Email
4	Side effects of Metformin	Nausea, diarrhea, stomach ache, feeling very tired at times, like I am walking through high water.	I have lost about 10 lbs so far, and this drug has really affected my appetite.  Food doesn't taste the same, I feel full almost immediately.  Sometimes I don't feel "well", and can't put my finger on it as to why.  I must avoid high fat meals or food at all costs, because it causes major diarrhea.  Once I adjust how/when I take this medication, I think I will do fine, and overall, it beats being on Metformin which caused me to have instant uncontrollable diarrhea.  I don't mind taking the injections, and the pen is easy to use.  It really helps to know that others are experiencing the same/similar side effects.	F	62	60  days10 mcg 2X D	9/26/2010Email
3	High Blood Sugars	Severe headache, nausea, vomiting, hot/cold flashes, jittery feeling, tiredness.	I've taken Byetta for 6 days.  I dislike it very much!  I have not had one good day since being on it.  I have had a horribly upset stomach since the very first time taking it with severe vomiting and nausea. I am going to ask my doctor to change it.  I also don't have insurance so paying $250/month plus needles really isn't fun either.	F	39	6  days5 mcg 2X D	8/28/2010
1	replacing GLP-1 hormone	nausea, headache, extreme exhaustion, general unwell feeling	I am a RN, so I work with this medication all the time, but I wasn't prepared for the side effects it would have on myself.  I had my ilieum removed in a surgery, so I do not produce GLP-1, which regulates insulin. I started out using Victoza to see if the replacement would work (I got samples through my endocrinologist).  It did, but my insurance wouldn't cover it, so I had to switch to Byetta which is twice a day and you cannot "play" with the doseage amounts.  It has made me feel absolutely AWFUL. I am going to follow up with my insurance company and see about going back to Victoza.  It is once a day and you can personalize the doseage much better.  It isn't set to either 5 or 10, you can titrate it much easier.	F	36	3  days50 2X D	8/26/2010
1	Early diagnosis Type II diabetes	Extreme nausea, diarrhea, reduced urination, lower back pain, muscle aches, dizziness	I felt like I had been poisoned during the few days that I used this drug.  3 days after ceasing use of the drug I was back to normal - felt good again.	F	62	5  days5 mg 2X D	8/12/2010
3	Type 2 Diabetes	Like most people, I started with some nausea and occasionally experience it still. But, just last week after being on antibiotics and prednisone for an upper respiratory infection, I started getting small red bumps that itch like new mosquito bites however, with what seems like a little boil on them. These started on my stomach and over the last few days have erupted on my inside left thigh, then my lower left leg, my upper left arm, and tonight on the inside of my left forearm. I think that former injection sites on my stomach are reddening and beginning to swell, but clearly, many of the blisters are not injection sites. I see my doctor in a week, but I wonder if I'll be able to wait that long.On the positive side, Byetta has noticeably reduced my appetite, and I've lost 24 pounds since I started taking it. Until about a month ago, my BG numbers also looked good; however, with the UR infection and then the prednisone, those numbers have been wildly fluctuating. As the itching has g	I'd like to be able to continue on Byetta, but I realize that other meds are out there. Does anyone who experienced similar side-effects have a better history with Victoza?	M	58	4  months10mg 2X D	8/10/2010Email
4	insulin resistance/PCOS	Feel full much faster while eating, nausea, vomiting, dizzy episodes	Have lost 9 lbs since starting byetta, this is day 2 on the 10 mcg, started on 5 twice a day.  Also take 1000mg metformin twice daily.  Byetta was added to metformin due to beginning to gain weight again.  Will stick with it and find my niche with timing on shot and eating and food choices.

4	insulin resistance	When I started the first month with 5 mcg twice per day, I had no side effects that I knew of.  With the start of the second month on 10 mcg twice per day, I did experience nausea, but never enough to vomit.  Now the nausea has subsided for the most part; it only occurs every now and then when I don't eat enough after the injection.		F	32	2.5  months10 mcg 2X D	6/15/2010

5	bs were high a1c was 7.1	I had some nausea at first and few low blood sugars.	I have been taking byetta for 4 months now.  I have lost 20 lbs and feel great.  My blood sugars are great.  About a month ago I went for a checkup and my A1C went from 7.1 to 5.9.  I also take 500mg of metformin 2 times a day along with the byetta.  I take my byetta an hour before I eat.  That seems to work great.  If I try to eat before the hour is up I do get sick to my stomach.	F	42	4  months5mg 2X D	5/24/2010Email
4	T2 Diabetic/ Glipizide didnt work	I was going to the restroom often and it hit me twice as hard as the Metformin. Sometimes I feel like my Sphincter doesnt work- But then in the last 3 weeks Ive been constipated....go figure.	I dont mind it a bit. It has helped lower my BG Numbers. I was never nauseous and Ive lost 10 pounds. The cool part about it is that I can taste it within Seconds of taking my shot.I have no major complaints I would say.	F	45	3  months10 2X D	5/18/2010
5	Type II Diabetes	Mild nausea that went away after a couple of weeks.	I love this drug, it evens out my blood sugar levels so I am not constantly feeling like I'm starving even after I just ate.  I eat less and am slowly losing weight.  Do NOT let it get hot by leaving it in your car though, that will make you sick like food poisoning, throw it out if that happens.	M	49	6  months10 mcg 2X D	5/12/2010
5	type II diabetes	weight loss, appetite loss.  I take two times a day before meals with Starlix  (120 mg), Glyburide (d)  (2.5 mg), and Metformin hcl er tabs  (500mg)	If I watch my diet the above mix of medicines work great for me. The byetta injector gets air bubbles once in a while which, if I a don't notice them, prevent me from getting the full volume of meds that I should get.	M	73	2  years250 mcg 2X D	5/10/2010
3	Type 2	Nausea, sever vomiting, sleepiness.	As a long term user of Byetta I have tried just about everything in terms of controlling the side effects. With respect to nausea/vomiting, I have found eating a low carb (i.e., less than 30 carbs per meal) diet works best. I have eaten bacon, eggs and cheese (i.e., high fat) for breakfast many times without any impact, so fat doesn't seem to be a problem for me. However, if I eat more than 30 or so carbs the nausea starts. One key point that I have noticed is to minimize the swings in my high - low glucose readings. All in all, follow a typical Type 2 diabetic diet regime, low carb....and things seem to fall in place.I have not found any correlation with respect to the extreme sleepiness I get some mornings. I thought it may have been low glucose levels, so I tested and typically am in the 140 - 160 range when it happens. Still trying to figure it out.	M	52	4  years10 mcg 2X D	5/8/2010Email
3	Diabetes II	The most persistent side effect is nausea.  I also get extremely congested, like I have a bad cold.  The more congested I get, the more nauseated I get.  I have lost 5 pounds so far and have little appetite.	I was on Byetta before (10 mg 2 X daily) but got off it because of the nausea.  Sometimes it hits, and sometimes it doesn't.  I went on Janumet, which was great, no side effects at all, but it didn't lower my A1C.  So back on Byetta.	F	52	6  weeks10 mg 2X D	5/7/2010
5	Diabetes type II	None once I stopped also taking Gliclazide	Have lost 3 stone since I started taking Byetta!  Feel better than I have done for all of the 10 years since diagnosed d taking Gliclazide and Metformin.	F	64	6  months10 mg bd 2X D	4/27/2010
5	Type II Diabetes	Initially, I was very nauseous. I would eat 45 mins after my injection. if I ate anything with fat - pure diarrhea. After 2 months, all side effects have subsided - i have lost 20 lbs	still going strong after 6 months - i still have only lost 20 lbs - keeping it off - feel great & energized..self esteem has increased tremendously - all b's real low	F	52	6  months5 mg 2X D	4/6/2010Email
1	To try to control my high blood sur	At first I did fine but the longer I took it I started getting a rash that looked like flea or mosquito bites. They spread all over my body. Then they turned to red welps all over and constant itching & could not even stand for anyone or anything to touch me without going into an itching fit. I have now skipped 3 doses and the welps and itchy rash/bites are now disappearing. I think it brought down by high blood sugar but what a price I am paying, having to hide the red welps under clothing and asking someone to scratch my back, arms anywhere I could not reach.		F	57	4  months10 mg 2X D	4/2/2010Email
2	type 2	Unpleasant crushing chest or rib pains and crushing headaches whole or one sided. When I injected left side stomach immediately heart rate went racing fast and when I switched to right side, heart was ok. But a little while after the heart rate gets jumpy and I get chest pains coming. Appetite not noticeably reduced. BG is all over the place. Even a small banana will spike it up few hours after shot. Take it around same time twice. Alone byetta. No nausea or vomitting of noticeable diet change. Very very concerned about chest / rib pains and do not like the feel of these nasty headpains. I don't read a lot about other users mentioning chest pains or fast heartbeat. How come I haven't noticed any appetite suppresion ? I eat 15-30mins after injection. Also my stomach feels harder like a rock is this normal ?		F	33	7  days5mg 2X D	2/7/2010Email
1	Diabetes II	Fine the first few weeks, but then suddenly I am getting EXTREMELY itchy red welts at the injection site, and they keep itching even as they fade away. Worse than mosquito bites! This stuff may be okay for gila monsters but not me. I even switched from abdomen to upper arm and now my arm itches like a mother&^%ker. Just say no to Byetta!	They say Byetta simulates the saliva of a gila monster. But more frightening is the big red itchy welts on your body which simulate the worst mosquito bites ever. This stuff is bad news.
