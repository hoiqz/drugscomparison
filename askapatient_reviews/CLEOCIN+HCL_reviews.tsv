1	Abcessed Tooth	Diarrhea an hour-and-a-half after taking 3rd dose.	I had a small yeast infection after taking penicillin a few months ago, so, my dentist decided to put me on this stuff.  He told me it would give me diarrhea and I was like, ok.  Well, when I came home from the pharmacy and read all of the labels and literature that came with it, I was concerned.  I looked this medicine up online as well.  I called my pharmacist and he told me that even though you see tons of negatives about this drug, that the people it has helped have had no reason to go on and tell of their positive experience.  So.  I went out and bought some Greek yogurt with live cultures in it.  Took my first dose at 5pm, next dose at 11pm and my third dose this morning at 10am.  I ate the plain yogurt with each dose, trying to be positive about it.  Well, I started diarrhea and it's only been 1-1/2 hours.  I have had it twice already.  I called my dentist and told him I'd rather chance the yeast infection with the penicillin.  Too many warnings for this drug and he said, well, if you read the stuff on most of the medicines, you probably wouldn't take any.  I guess that's true, to a point.  But I take other stuff and without a doubt, this one has way too many warnings.  I'm sorry I ever took it. It's going back to the pharmacy when I pick up my penicillin, which won't be today as I am too scared to leave the house!	F	59	1  days150mg 3X D	12/14/2012Email
1	tooth abcess	real bad stomach cramping, the next day my heart rate and pulse dropped, made me feel like my heart was trying to stop, scared me to death! never taking this med again!		F	42	1  days150 mg 2X D	11/30/2012Email
1	Skin abscess (boil)	After taking Cleocin I was diagnosed with antibiotic associated C Diff. C Diff is a nasty contagious bug that affects many health care workers ( which I currently am) and many patients with prolonged stays at the hospital. C diff causes watery stools among many other symptoms, Cleocin is the # 1 antibiotic causing c diff which the physician failed to mention.		F	21	10  daysN/a	6/25/2012
1	root canal	anxiety, depression, panic attacks, diarrhea stomach pain, foggy mind, dizzy, joint and muscle pain	I won't take this anymore. i have only been taking this for a day. my mind is unclear. I'm using the delete button more than all the other ones combined. i just can't think clearly. i have a deep feeling of something being wrong. and I'm so dizzy, and so depressed. I've had a panic attack today. my heart races, my joints and muscles hurt, especially my back. and i just want to go to sleep and never wake up. DO NOT TAKE THIS	F	20	1  days150mg 3X D	2/29/2012
1	tooth infection	violent full body tremors and very high blood pressure. Diarrhea for one day. Was hospitalized for allergic reaction, Benadryl cleared it up. Scariest day of my life.	Before taking any oral antibiotic for a tooth infection, see a high quality endodontist. She drilled down and put some stuff right in the infection site and it cleared it up.

1	Yes	A dentist gave this poison to my wife. It nearly killed her. She has C-Diff now and it has been 5 months and she is still sick.	This drug was banned in China.	F	56	  3X D	12/4/2011Email
1	chest inf/bone infection	flu like symptoms.  headache, muscle pain, joint pain.  fatigue, rapid heart beat, chills. my throat feels swollen on one side - but subsides as i have to take an anti-inflammatory as well.  I cant see my doc for 48 hrs - but wow - dont know if i can continue this!  i need to clear up the bone infection.  :-(		F	50	4  days300 mg 4X D	11/5/2011Email
5	tooth abcess	NONE whatsoever	You MUST take this with a full meal and after the meal you take the pill WITH 8-16 oz of water.  You will have no heartburn, stomach issues, etc.  Also do not lay down for at least 30 minutes, so dont take it before bed.  I bet most people giving a low rating didnt take it properly!	F	43	7  days150 mb\g 3X D	7/3/2011
1	tooth infection	I stopped med the minute I felt odd. Got C-Diff. Look it up. Took 1.5 years to get rid of this disgusting disease.	It could save somebody but let it be known you are more likely to get another life threatening superbug from this antibiotic than from any other, and it's not always easy to get rid of. C-Diff is a nightmare. Docs don't tell you the risk of C-Diff.	F	55	4  days125? 3X D	5/26/2011
1	Potential tooth infection	Tired, anxious. I had heart pain and I thought I was having a heart attack. Had to go to ER and get examined for a large amount of money. They finally told me that it was *probably*  heartburn. Besides these things, minutes after taking the drug I would feel like I am exploding inside, or rather like there is a giant burning stick inside me. So I can only sit still, and can't bend!	The product has some serious side effects!	M	23	3  days 1X D	4/28/2011
5	Root Canal	Must take with a full glass of water.  If you don't, stomach will hurt.  I could take this med with next to no side effect.  Not everyone can.	I had some problems taking Keflex as it increased the amount of Metformin I was taking in my blood stream.  That caused a lot of very low blood sugar readings.	M	45	14  days150 4X D	3/29/2011
1	Had teeth removed	Made me deathly ill only on 2nd day. Thought I was dying...seriously. Noticed my face looks sunburned and I am rashing out all over.	This is not a fun med! Not taking it!	F	43	2  days 3X D	2/24/2011
4	Root Canal	None	It help to clear the infection.I have to take probiotics after treatment to prevent diarrhea.For most antibiotics take with good amount of dairy free food and drink plenty of water...		42	10  days 2X D	2/6/2011
4	Tooth Abcess	Metallic taste in mouth, and intestinal upset (mild)	I can't take any of the "cillins", and this really works for me. This is the second time in 10 years I've been on it, and the mild side effects were easily tolerable.	F	64	10  days2 capsules 4X D	11/19/2010
1	cystic infection	diarreha, severe heartburn, high blood pressure, dizziness		F	57	5  days300mg 3X D	10/23/2010
1	skin abscesses	Diarrhea	Within 30 minutes of my first pill, I was racing to the bathroom with agonizing stomach cramps & diarrhea. This continued so badly for 48 hours, I couldn't be away from a bathroom for 30 seconds, so if I had to leave my house, I'd just not eat.  The 2nd morning I managed to drop my dog at daycare, returned home, ate a yogurt and took a pill. Within 30 SECONDS this time, I was running to the can. Fluorescent yellow diarrhea I might add.  It was so horrible I asked my GP for something different--Erythromyacin, which has caused no problem, even though the insert says it might.BTW, to anyone who has "Montezuma's Revenge": it severely dehydrates you, and drinking water doesn't replenish you--you need to drink Gatorade to get those enzymes back.TERRIBLE drug (for me).	F	48	2  days150 4X D	10/11/2010
4	Various	None.	I used to have to take Clindamycin, for various infections,  because of a suspected Penicillin allergy. It turns out I didn't have a Penicillin allergy and haven't taken it since. I never really had any problems with the medication, though I always had one eye over my shoulder given the possibility for colitis issues. Talk to your doctor immediately, stop taking the med if you start experiencing any GI issues. Anyway, it was always effective at clearing up my infections.	M	23	2  weeks? 1X D	7/11/2010
1	Possible Toe Infection	Severe chills, Severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rapid heart beat.	Podiatrist prescribed this for possible toe infection. I am allergic to penicillin and sulfa so this is what he came up with.I felt like I was on death's door just after 3 pills. I got chills in my body like I've never experienced before. When I got out of bed the next morning I immediately vomited and then had to rush to the toilet for the diarrhea. My heart beat shot up to 110 beats per minute which was the last straw. BE VERY CAREFUL when taking this drug. If something doesn't feel right - trust yourself and stop taking this. This pill taught me that when docs try to prescribe me something in the future I will ask for only 2 days worth of 'script to see how things go first then I won't be out so much money and stuck with a zillion poison pills. Terrible experience - I hope I don't suffer long lasting effects. Good luck.	F	39	2  days300mg 3X D	5/6/2010
3	sinus infection	Great the first few days.One of only a few Antibiotics i could stomache	I started day one on this with Prednisone also .Within an hour i had Diarreha but didnt know which one caused it but have to say after that i felt the best i  have in months.Also had Diarreha on day 3.I,m going in  for sinus surgery on the 3rd May but Doc was trying to clear up at least the left sinus so he didnt have to get into both. Stopped taking Prednisone on day 3 as my blood sugar hit 199 and i,m not diabetic.Continued with Clindamycin til end of day 4.Last dose i took made my lungs feel really tight..hard time breathing.I was a little upset as i thought i was doing ok on this one. Then didnt have a bowel movement at all for 5 days which concerned me.I didnt even feel the need..had this horrible suspicion it was something to do with this med but everything ive read indicated Diarreha..not the opposite.Went to ER last night..they gave me a laxative..told me it would work immediately.Nothing until the next day when finally i had a bowel movement.I Think if you can stomach this Med make sure you take a good probiotic along with it to keep some good bacteria in your stomach. .It did seem to clear one of my sinus's, or make it feel like its cleared. I wont know til i have a CT scan on Thursday.I,m keeping up with Probiotics for awhile to make sure my stomach is back to normal	F	51	4  days300 3X D	4/26/2010
4	Root Canal	Bad, metallic taste in mouth.	I didn't not have any intestinal problems, just the bad taste in my mouth.  I am on my second round of Clindamycin because the first did not completely clear up the infection.	F	34	7  days300 mg 4X D	4/2/2010
1		First, bad gas, then constant going to the bathroom.This is a VICIOUS TORTUOUS drug. DO NOT LET YOUR DOC/DENTIST give you this. Switched to Zmax (Zinthromax) and it was much milder.	Find the inventer and put him/her on the stuff for a week and see how long they last	M	50	2  days 3X D	4/2/2010
1	Root Canal	Diahrrea -- Very bad diarrhea. So bad that it continued for months after stopping it.	Dentist would not accept that this antibiotic gave me the diarrhea but my doc was surprised she didn't know. My doc even told me that he never prescribes it because of the side effects. I had to eat tons of yogurt for months to be back to normal	M	40	4  days	12/6/2009
2	strep throat	vomiting from taste, diarrhea	Penicillin is really a much better option.This will give you bad infectious diarrhea and you will need to go BACK to the doctor to get treated	F	21	2  days	11/25/2009
1	Clindamycin HCL- before root canal	I HATE CLINDAMYCIN HCL!!!! in bold, caps, red!!THis is the worst drug ever. Even my dentist did not warn me about its side effects. Early mar'09 i take this pathetic medication. Mid mar'09 i m bed ridded with severe diarrhoea. I contact my phisician , do stool tests, other tests, start probiotics n yogurt. lil better. After 4 months, little better. When diarrhoea seems to clear up, surprise, i get BV n yeast infection - as a side effect of anti-biotics. Now i have to take Flagyl, Diflucan-june-09. Something lead to urine infection- Now ampicillin-another bad anti-biotic. My anti-biotic inducted yeast iinfection is back. July'09 !! Now i m visiting my gynec again!!i feel like sue-ing that dentist!!!!i might!		F	26	1  weeks	8/6/2009
5	post-surgical incision infection	Mild nausea and mild heartburn.	I had to go on two rounds of clindamycin plus one round of cipro for an infection at an incision site. I ate something every time I took this med so I wouldn't feel sick. That worked well for me. However the one side effect I question has to do with menstruation. One of the rounds fell in the middle of my cycle and this one is abnormal as it is literally on again off again. Abnormally light cycle with sporatic and intermittent menstruation. When I researched to see if it might be a side effect I couldn't find anywhere that might have a clue so I decided to put this in so if other women have the same problem they would know they are not alone. Other than the menstruation my side effects were very few and I have been very satisfied with this med. It cleared up my incision in just over one week.	F	30	12  days	8/4/2009
4	tooth infection after root canal	Burning in stomach, metallic taste in mouth, mild diarrhea	I found that taking this with food helped with the stomach burning.  Also I couldn't lay down too soon after taking or the burning was worse.  I usually get some side effects from antibiotics and this one was easier to take than most.	F	48	2  weeks	7/28/2009
1	wisdom-tooth extraction abcess	NO APPETITE, fatigue, lost weight, my JOINTS (knees and Elbows) were very achy - felt like i had arthritis (and i'm only 24 years old!, I felt like my head was in a cloud, very foggy feeling- only took this medication for 3 days then stopped bc of the side effects (prescribed a 10 day course) DO NOT TAKE THIS ANTIBIOTIC! two months after taking it, I developed a C-diff infection from this antibiotic! IT IS AWFUL! now im on flagyl for the cdiff that was caused by the cleocin.. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG! DEMAND ANOTHER ANTIBIOTIC, and TAKE LACTOBACILUS tablets when on the antibiotics!		F	24	3  days	7/15/2009
3	Sinusistis, bronchitis	Slight nausea, foggy headed, severe depression, anxiety, breathing trouble	I was pregnant, had recurrent sinus infections traveling down into my chest turning into bronchitis. Since i have asthma, i figured antibiotics were the lesser of two evils esp. Since i was pregnant. The depression and the fogginess of my mind were so severe, that i was near suicidal and it took me 5 days to figure out that the medicine was causing this, because i was so unable to focus and think straight. The anxiety and trouble breathing may have been a result of the illness, though i normally feel better a lot faster once on antibiotics when things begin to clear up, and yet i still had breathing trouble while the infection had already begun to clear. Once off the med, within a week i was a lot better.	F	37	7  days	4/29/2009
2	toe infection after physical trauma	Podiatrist first claimed there was no infection, but admitted there was one when toe in alternate, unharmed,  leg also became infected and a very large abcess formed in my groin. lesson learned avoid podiarists like the bubonic plague, find an orthopaedist MD who specialises in foot problems and stay away from hospitals run by large  multi hospital organization  who claim  'NON Profit' status and camouflage huge profits by granting humungous salaries to mtheir insiders, like a 1.2 million dollar to a laundry manger when for a equally large military laundry, the Feds who pay on the high scale pays between $40,000 and $50,000 a year	only partially effective must be used or followed by Cipro or infection will return as a anti biotic resistant organism.Itook several 7 day sessions of intramuscular injections of Gentamycin to conquer the resistant organism and now it may be back again and resistant to most modern anti biotics(I am allergic to pennicilin so I may end my days with this infection	M	79	2  days	9/7/2008Email
1	Prophylatic for arteriogram	Severe sneezing,nausea, terrible diarrhea not affected by Lomotil, low residue diet, fasting,probiotics, polyarthritis.	I am not sure I'm reporting on correct list as this was IV Clindamycin but the effects would be the same. This "wipe-out" drug should not be used unless there is no other resource. I spent 10 days trying to "handle" it and then had to take Flagyl (good/bad antibiotic) for another 8 days.This was a one time dose only.	F	68	1  days	6/12/2008
1	Possible MRSA	DO NOT TAKE THIS MED! TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT OTHER MEDICATION! THERE ARE OTHER MEDICATIONS TO TAKE FOR MRSA SO TAKE THEM! IF YOU HAVE ABNORMAL BOWEL MOVEMENTS DEMAND (YES DEMAND) A TEST FOR C. DIFF! I'm 20 years old and got C. Diff. from this medicine, it's a super bug in your bowels and it's HIGHLY contagious. After being butchered by the doctor i was place on this medication for possible MRSA. Now i have to take Flagyl (500 mg) and it has awfull awfull neurological side effects. REFUSE TO TAKE THIS MEDICATION AND DEMAND YOU'RE PLACED ON ANOTHER DRUG. I've been sick for 2 months because of this and the doctor will never tell you about possible C. Diff. It wasn't till i went to my family docotor that i was told about this, and the extreme meassures and treatment i had to take to get rid of this awfull resistant bacteria.	DEMAND A C. DIFF. TEST OF YOUR STOOL IF IT IS ABNORMAL. The medication gave me a super bug! I'm only 20, and HAD A GREAT IMMUNE SYSTEM! This medication kills protene which good and bad bacteria use. I was almost septic and i have no immunity now. It's sad for a 20 year old, it's even worse that there are other people expieriencing this.	M	20	10  days	11/28/2007
4	sinus infection	I experienced the stomach burning after taking the 1st pill. THereafter was sure to take with LOTS of water and eat some crackers. Also ate yogurt everyday with live cultures and avoided intestinal upset. I'd highly recommend the yogurt from now on when taking any antibiotic.		F	48	9  days	8/22/2007
2	After 2 Root Canals, prevent infect	I feel nausea, not too extreme, after like 2 days I am experiencing different types of bowel movements. Diarehha.. extremely soft stool that seems to always come when i urinate. Every time I go to the bathroom, even if i do not feel anything or see anything, I wipe there and there it is. Everytime! I also am tired, i do not know if this is related. Mild headache.	I am counting down the days. What it says exactly on my bottle... Clindamycin HCL 150mg capstev.  I have to take one capsule 3 times a day. I am really hoping this embarrassing side effect passes soon. I am afraid of sexual intercourse. There is no warning.. never have i had an accident but everytime i guess i relax myself to urinate it comes. I hope I was of some help. I think I didn't even need to take it in the first place. I can't blame him he's a dentist.	F	22	6  days	7/26/2007
2	absess	couldn't breath, low blood pressure, depression, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress	now having other problems and not sure if that was a cause.	F	36	5  days	6/17/2007

2		cleared up my abcsiss in no time..but gave me infection of bowel,s diarrhea has been horrible and its been 2 weeks..now im on flagyl to combat the diarrhea		M	28	3  days	4/11/2007
1	salivary gland infection	Metallic taste, dizziness,bad headaches, confusion, panic attacks, paranoia, nausea, itchy skin	I was taken to the hospital for a penicillin allergy and after I was treated, they gave me clindamycin to see if I could tolerate that since I'm allergic to most antibiotics. They were satisfied that It was O.k., so I went home. All these things started happening to me and I thought it was just penicillin getting out of my system. But now it's been almost 9 days and I seem to be getting worse. I punched in my symptons on the computer since the pharmacist said it was highly unlikely that this was caused by the drug. This site came up with reactions to metronidazole or Flagyl. Used for bacterial infections also, I'm calling my Doctor tomorrow to see if I can stop taking it. My heart is racing, my neck muscles are in a knot, and I'm feeling like I have a brain tumor!! Scared the shit out of me. Thank God for this site...	F	49	9  days	10/2/2006Email
1	Tooth infection	Intense heartburn. My chest was on fire, for not one, not two, but over three hours. I thought maybe it was something I ate but then took it the next night without food and immediately after same thing. I also have gastritis however.	I'm not sure if it works or not. I have gastritis so it's hard to say because it lit my chest on fire.	M	24	2  days	3/13/2006
