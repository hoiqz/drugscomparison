5	asthma preventer	Seems to lift my mood a little.    I had bad side effects from steroid puffers and Tilade is the only one I can use.   It took two months to be working really well.	The only puffer preventer I can use without any bad side effects.	F	61	1  years2 puffs 2X D	5/12/2013
4	Asthma	At first it's a bit "chalky" on your throat	It is the only asthma preventer style medication I can use. It is not as powerful a preventer as the steroidal preventers. Having said that the steroidal preventers send me into an anxiety ridden insomniac. I'm so glad Tilade exists.	F	51	12  years	4/30/2009
4	Asthma	None that we know of (possible weight gain, but she is also on Singulair)	My daughter has been on this medicine for over a year and even though her asthma is not completely under control, it has been a good option for a non-steriod asthma drug.  We really did not want to have her on a steriod for long term.  She has only had an ocassional night-time flare up, but we are still working on her endurance during exercise before she has to stop because she can't breath.	F	9	14  months	3/27/2008
