5	Low-T	none	slightly more energy. feel better in general already. Willy is starting to wake up.	M	53	6  days4mg 1X D	5/17/2013Email
1	hypogonadism	Large itchy red spots.  I think from the testosterone itself on the skin.  I went back to the injections		M	34	10  days4mg	4/1/2013
5	low T, <Mood	Absolutely no ill effects, EXCEPT ugly, itchy WELTS that last around 3 weeks (!) at application sites. Looks like paint-ball hits. Endocrinologist and Watson hotline recommend hydrocortisone and Trimincolone, no help whatsoever.  Will discontinue and switch to Androgel, too bad. Works as advertised though...	Only regret waiting so long to go in for a physical, blood work caused MD to refer me to endocrinologist, who prescribed the Androderm.  Within a week, I felt better, day and night difference.  Restored sex drive, much better mood, better sleep/no more insomnia (not sure how that works), increased strength, better mental focus / feel smarter / improved memory.  See a doctor today if you feel low T, don't wait like I did.	M	42	3  months2 mg patch 1X D	1/31/2013
3	Low T	My body is just weird anyway dealing with medications.  I tried a 30mg under arm application right off the bat and obviously that was overdose.  Felt like I was having a heart attack.  So I changed to 2mg Androderm patch.  Energy has increased.  Mood has improved in less than a month.  The only problem is HORRIFIC hot flashes!  About every 15 minutes and they last anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.  It's like an internal blast furnace has been turned on.I just have to walk into a deep freezer somewhere and cool off .  If this keep up into summer - forget it!  Sad because it is working and I do feel better overall.  I have total sympathy for ladies in menopause!  It completely rules your life.  You absolutely have to stop everything you are doing and fan yourself or use cold compresses on chest and neck.  Stand in front of an open refrigerator.  Turn the AC as low as it will go in the middle of winter.  It's horrible!  I haven't seen anybody else complain of it so I'm know I'm just weir	It does make the skin itch where the patch is but only mildly.  Would be better if the adhesive were revamped to a more hypoallergenic formula.  Itching seems to be a complaint of everybody on here.	M	46	30  days2.0 1X D	1/9/2013Email
5	Low testosterone (Hypogonadism)	Better mood, better sex drive, clearer mind. However, my skin is turning red in any spot that has received the patch twice within 2 weeks so need to rotate. Must use a scrub brush to remove the patch glue outline in the shower. Sleep cycle improved.	Terrified that I would have to discontinue this treatment because of the redness caused by the patches.  I feel 100% better than I used to feel and my sleeping is extremely regular, including waking up fully rested on my own without needing an alarm clock.	M	41	30  days4 MG 1X D	10/24/2012
2	low testosterone--constantly tired	Immediately after the first patch I have been extremely fatigued all the time. I am giving it a full month and after that if I am not more energetic, I'm stopping it. I went on it because of being constantly tired and this is signficantly worse!		M	53	21  days2mg 1X D	5/20/2012
2	low testosterone	In the last year pain in my thighs,legs and ankles has been increasing.  I thought it was just my arthritis flairing up. I had not noticed any great positive increase in my energy or sex drive so I just stopped applying the patch a week ago. I can not explain how much better I feel it is almost like a miracle. I don't know for sure that stopping the androderm patch is the reason but I have a pretty consistent daily schedule and nothing else has changed that would cause this improvement.		M	66	4  years5MG 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Low Testosterone	I have pretty bad skin irritation every time. A large red spot lasting over a week, with significant itching for the first few days after removing the patch.	I was originally using Testim gel, which was okay. I didn't like having the gel on me and my clothes. Within a few weeks of switching to Androderm I had more frequent erections and a clearer mind. I just wish it didn't irritate my skin so much. It was more severe on hairier areas. Applying a hot compress for a minute or two before peeling of the patch helps a lot.	M	37	2  months	1/29/2009
3	low level testoserone 172	depressed, no energy, red blotches where patches attach. started at 5mg per day for 20 days raised to 10 mg per day for 35 days.		M	52	55  days	12/15/2008
4	Borderline Low	Red, dorky oval spots all over the place.  Goo that won't come off.	Really levels out the highs and lows.  More interest in sex.  Feel somewhat more engaged in life.	M	45	40  days	12/10/2008
3	Low Testosterone due to a tumor	I have to udpate my previous 5-star evaluation of this drug. Over the fist several months it worked well and I was only concerned about dirty spots on my skin after I removed Androderm. But then my skin stopped to tolerate it and I developed red skin and rashes each time I used it. Also I had anxiety from time to time.	I had to discontinue using Androderm due to serious skin irritation. Now I am on Androgel.	M	28	5  months	11/12/2008
5	Low testosterone (pituitary tumor)	None	Hepls to improve my mood, libido, energy.	M	28	4  weeks	6/16/2008
5	Low Testosterone	Slight skin irritation; low blood-sugar occasionally; increased appetite.	Starting taking for low testosterone (154). Fatigue levels improved after one week and mood improvement after two weeks. Libido increased after about three weeks. Not sure how long it takes to get homone levels and your body back to normal. This stuff works very well.	M		40  days	3/9/2008
5	Low Testosterone levels	When my Testerone level was low (230), my allergies/Asthma went away. But now that my testosterone level is increasing, I feel my allergies coming back and I'm sneezing more. A doctor should research this connection.	I'm not sure why my testosterone level is low, but I would work out all the time, and still be fat. When my level was normal, this was not the case. Since I have been using the patch, my muscle tone is coming back, and I'm not as anxious as I used to be. The only problem is that the 5mg adroderm patch does not stay on very well. I have to put a large adhesive bandage over the patch for to stay on. Overall, I would say it works pretty well. Although I would really like to find out the underlying cause of the Low testosterone (pituary tumor?).	M	45	7  days	11/4/2007
5	FTM	Itches like crazy if I put it too close to my spine. Stick well on my back, doesn't stick as well on my arm.	Before this, I was injecting every week and the levels would fall before the next shot. I have more energy now that testosterone levels are consistent.	M	20	1.5  months	12/5/2006
