1	dementia	Weight loss, horrifying hallucinations, worsening delusions	My dad was on this drug for 4 months before a doctor would agree to withdraw it.  His weight dropped 25 pounds during that time, his appetite was non-existent and his behavior worsened significantly.  He thought he was in the war and people were shooting at him.  He lived in absolute terror during the time he was on this drug.  After stopping Exelon, which did absolutely nothing for his memory, his behavior improved and his eating has almost returned to normal.  I know he will continue to decline from the Alzheimer's Disease, but this drug is not the answer.  Why these drugs were EVER approved by the FDA is a mystery to me.  They have significant side effects and are not evidence based.  Why make a loved one with dementia suffer even more?	M	77	4  months4.6 mg 1X D	7/12/2011Email
1	mild dementia	nausea, loss of appetite. loss of weight, bleeding in the intestines and stomach, tired, no energy	Dad is 89 and I am his caregiver. He started  on the patch in the spring. He had been on Aricept and the doctor recommended trying the patch. Over the summer he lost 20 pounds  and just didn't feel well. In September, his hemoglobin was so low that he needed two blood transfusions. In November, he was bleeding heavily from the rectum and was hospitalized. They didn't use the patch in the hospital and his appetite improved . His blleding was from the stomach and intestines. When he returned home, we used the patch for three days and the symptoms began. I called the doctor and dad is now on Aricept and is feeling much better. I would never recommend the patch.	M	89	6  months9.6 mg 1X D	11/24/2010
2	Dementia	urinary incontinence + gamut	It's difficult to determine with any real certainty which side effects are from which drugs my 93 yr old mother is taking, each having their own SX. Then, too, dementia and Alzheimer's is a progressive condition. It's accepted now that Aricept doesn't work. Nothing stops it, with the possible exception of cannabis oil and Reversatrol. Exelon is a $300 + per month drug that may or may not be helping or may even be making the condition worse. Dosing is important. 9mg is the target dose but my 93 yr old mother is prescribed 1.5 x 2 because after briefly using the 4.5 patch she had skin reactions and went bananas prompting a 911. 3mg per day lessens the severity of the urinary incontinence, (also symptomatic of dementia) and again, may or not be helping with the dementia. Generic now available, at least.	F	93	24  months1.5 2X D	11/19/2010Email
1	dementia	muscle weakness and loss of coordination, urinary control, hallucinations, increased dementia	My father took Exelon to replace Aricept.  In a matter of days his health took a rapid turn for the worse so severe it required nursing home support.	M	78	6  days	4/22/2008Email
1	Improve Mental Function	My mother with Parkinson's but NO other health issues started it on Dec 1 and experienced severe congestive heart failure December 27.  The drug was withdrawn and re-tested twice and each time she had a life-threatening decline within 24 hrs on the patch.  Since finally getting off it her heart function has improved dramatically, though there is some permanent damage.	Her mental condition declined significantly while on the drug.  Doctors had no idea Exelon had CHF as a listed side effect and then were slow to believe it until the testing proved it.  DON'T RISK THIS DRUG ON SOMEONE YOU LOVE.	F	86	27  days	4/14/2008
1	dementia	intense vomiting, feeling nauseated all the time, bladder was uncontrolled/ rash at patch site/ had to put patch on a different place of upper body each day/	Caregiver here - switched my uncle from aricept to exelon patch cause Dr said it might work better for his memory problems.  Wrong! It made everything worse.  Run from this drug - do not let your Dr switch to this drug. It is awful! It should be pulled from the market or used as a drug to induce vomiting! Total waste of money and his med pt D did not cover it.  Also found out Dr (neurologist) was paid $$$$ to speak about this drug to other Drs in the area to get them to switch their patients from other dementia meds to Exelon patch.  Shame!  He is nowback on Aricept and does not have any side effects I can observe.	F	62	16  days	4/12/2008
5	vascular dementia	Initial sedation; anorexia.	My father was prescribed Exelon in patch formation to avoid nausea that is common side effect. After 4-6 weeks there has been a significant improvement in his orientation. He is much clearer.	M	90	6  weeks	12/18/2007
1	Parkinson's dementia	My mother started taking Exelon for increased confusion after taking Aricept for about a year. Not only didn't the drug help, but confusion increased and she had other bizarre symptoms we never saw with Aricept.  Much more delusional and 'out of it'. Also started to urinate excessively at night.	The prescribing MD kept telling us to give it more time, and when symptoms kept getting worse, wanted to increase the dose. Her decline was so dramatic that we asked to take her off Exelon and go back to Aricept.  After less than a week the excessive urination has stopped and although she's still confused at times, there aren't the really strange behaviors now.	F	86	5  weeks	4/24/2007
1	Alzheimers	Vomiting, diarhea, headaches, tremors	Aricept had none of these adverse effects.  Exelon didn't even help either.	M	69	30  days	3/7/2007
1	alzheimers	severe convulsions	if you can avoid using it, please think about it	F	58	4  weeks	5/15/2002
