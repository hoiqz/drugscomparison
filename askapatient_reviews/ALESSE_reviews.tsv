1	Prevent pregnancy	Vomiting  severe fatigue. Itchy and burning labia moody very depressed and lethargic		F	33	4  months	1/22/2013
3	Heavy period bad pms	Had some spotting but helped with cramps. Gained  10lbs though and some anxiety depression started. Switching to Loestrin 1/20.		F	42	1  years20	1/10/2013
2	To prevent pregnancy	Abdominal cramps/pains. Loss of appetite. Stinging during urination. Depression. Moodiness. Fatigue/Tired		F	21	2  weeks	12/28/2012
1	Skin and bc	I felt so numb emotionally! I felt the effects right away, 2 days after taking it. By emotionally numb I mean that I couldn't find purpose or joy in anything! I also get huge cramps and I have never had cramps before! Horrible, horrible pill!		F	22	4  days20	11/18/2012
1	birth control	Depression, irritablily, extreme exhaustion	This is horrible.  I was previously on MinOvral with no problems.  My ob/gyn switched me to lower dose estrogen - huge mistake.  I was a mess.....when you go from being a normal person to wanting to stick your head in the oven - something is terribly wrong.  Despite my ob/gyn (an elderly male!) telling me it couldn't be this pill, I insisted he switch me back.  It's only been 4 days and I already notice a huge difference.		46	3  months 1X D	11/3/2012Email
5	irregular periods	First few months I spotted but after that its been perfect. Better skin,regular periods for the first time in my life. Tried yaz but was switched to this because I smoke occasionally. Hated yaz but love alesse!		F	30	6  years	10/30/2012
5	Regulate periods and birth control	No known side effects. Noticing now a lighter period and shorter which I will gladly take!! :)		F	32	3  years1 a day	10/28/2012
2	Contraception, heavy periods	Migraines, nausea, breast tenderness, very high libido	For the first two months I was nauseous every day, all day long, and especially right after eating. I have been on two other BC pills before this one, but had to stop because they gave me migraines (which i have never had when not on BC). When I was on Yaz I stopped because I got a migraines and the left side of my body went numb. After getting another migraine on Alesse, I've decided BC pills are something my body can't tolerate. I did, however, enjoy that in the second month of Alesse my libido was much higher than usual, and my boyfriend did not mind!	F	20	2  months 1X D	8/24/2012
1	Birth control	At first this pill was awesome- like 1 yr x awesome. No side effects at all until my face got brown patches (melasma)  everywhere that get worse with sun exposure. Not even SPF helps. I've been able to reduce the color by staying out of the sun as much as I can, photo facials ($$$), and daily SPF and lightening creams but it still remains!! I'm quite conscientious about it. Can no longer do my hair certain ways or go out without make up. Buyer beware!! Or if anyone knows of a cure - pls help me!		F	30	2  years	8/7/2012Email
1	Birth Control/ Regulate Periods	Acne, Nausea, Racing Heart, Tingling/Numbness in arm and leg, Headaches, Dizziness (Hospitalized)	I had been on Yazmin for 6 years, but due to the warning my Dr said to try something else. She recommended ALESSE and said it would work well. WELL.. IT DIDN'T. After about the first week I noticed a lot more acne than usual. I figured I'd stick it out and see if it would get any better. During this time I noticed my mood starting to change and one moment I was happy/feeling like myself and the next I was down and anxious about everything. Things went downhill after the 17th day of taking the pill when I woke up with a resting heart rate of 125 and tingling in my left hand. After calling 911, an ambulance took me to the hospital and I was told later on to get off the pill IMMEDIATELY for I was having a severe reaction to the hormones (Most likely the hormone Levonorgestrel found in Alesse). After being discharged that day and told it would get better I had similar episodes of tingling/numbness in my leg and arm and the racing heart continued. I was back in the hospital within 24 hours. ALSO TO NOTE I HAD NO UNDERLYING HEALTH ISSUES AND WAS ON NO OTHER MEDICATIONS WHILE TAKING ALESSE.It has now been two days since I've been off the pill and I am out of the hospital. I have not had tingling or a racing heart in over 24 hours. I am slowly getting my appetite back. Also, my acne is starting to clear up. I will not be trying any other birth control pill for the next 3 months.I would NOT recommend this pill to anyone after my experience.	F	20	3  weeks 1X D	6/13/2012Email
2	Birth control	I took these exact pills back when I was 19 for over a year with no problems. The I went completely birthcontrol free until I was 25. I went back on for 4 months ( no I did not use expired pills, i got new ones). First month into it and I developed severely itchy skin on my labia. No rashes tho. I couldn't even sleep at night... For 4 damned months!  Yeast infection test came back negative. Then I realized perhaps there is a connection. I went off the pills and the symptoms were better within a week. It took bout a month or two to get back to normal. I've been Off of it for a year now but I find my skin gets sensitive now. I can't even wax my eyebrow without it itching for a few days after. And I've been waxing everything since I was 17		F	25	4  months	5/3/2012
4	contraception and PCOS	Short period, extremely lighter flow, fatigue		F	22	4  months	4/9/2012Email
2	Contraception	The first and only side effect I had for the first 3 months was nausea. At the time, it was almost every day. I still have nausea for about a week every time I start a new pack, but it goes away and isn't as severe. On month 4 I started to get really sore breasts about a week or so into a pack, that would last about a week. Month 5, and currently month 6, I had the initial nausea at the start of a pack, followed by sore breasts, followed by extreme irritability and high emotions. I am having trouble dealing with my daughter (almost 3) because I'm so emotional. I find I'm getting angry at her and expecting things from her she can't do yet. I find that on top of this I'm obsessing on those things which makes me more angry and feeling like I'm spiraling out of control. This month, I'm noticing that my face is really breaking out. I haven't had acne like this since I was pregnant with my daughter, and before that, highschool.	At first I thought this pill was great, now I don't think I can stay on it. I don't want to end up harming my daughter or causing emotional scarring due to my inability to keep my emotions under control. The week before my period before Alesse I used to be able to step back, take a deep breath, and let an issue go. Now I seem to be unable to prevent myself from working myself up to the point where I break down in tears. I'm sure there are many people this pill works wonders for, but I don't seem to be one of them.	F	27	6  months 1X D	3/27/2012
1	Period	Throwing up. Feeling sick after everything I ate. Heavy periods with bad cramping. Higher anxiety.		F	18	1  months	1/4/2012
2	Birth control	Moodiness, depression, anxiety, lighter periods, no sex drive	I had been getting more and more depressed and anxious while on this pill, but I thought the cause was environmental. My boyfriend finally suggested I try going off Alesse, and I started feeling much more level-headed. I had been feeling suicidal, crying all the time, unable to cope with stress--although I still get anxious, HBC was definitely contributing to how I was feeling. I switched to Alesse because my doctor thought the lower dose would be better than my previous brand (I forget the name). I guess it didn't work.	F	25	4  years 1X D	12/13/2011
3	Releave heavy periods	in between period bleeding;weight gain;mood swings;no libido; yeast infection; fatigue; bloating; lighter periods; shorter periods;	I took bc to help with heavy long periods, which did help they are shorter and lighter but I gained at least 10 lbs. in 4 months. After the first round of pills I had in between bleeding which I bleed till my next period it was mostly spotting and light bleeding but still a whole month ! I got 2 mild yeast infections, When hubby was in the mood I was dry and never really in the mood, I felt tired all the time like I had no energy to do anything. I also woke up several nights with cramps in my calf. It felt like I had a charlie horse. I think I am going to stop taking them just because of all the side effects I have experienced and worried about some of the ones I could experience!	F	35	4  months.02 1X D	11/9/2011Email
1	treatment of acne and long periods	HORRIBLE breakouts. I still have scars half a year later.		F	17	3  months 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Birth control	mood swings, extreamly emotional, couldn't stop crying,anxiety, panic attacks, forgetful	I had a terrible time on this pill, saw my docter and went off it right away. Later tried Micronor a pedstrogen only pill but had tingling on whole left side of body and had to go off right away too	F	20	2  weeks 1X D	8/18/2011
1	Contraception	Hair loss, some weight gain	This pill made so much of my hair fall out, I have about half as much as I did before I started it, and it's been a few years now and it's still as thin as it was!  I would lose way more than usual when brushing and big clumps of it in the shower, it took me a few weeks to realize that it was probably the pill, it stopped getting worse when I went off it, but even now, I still lose a lot of hair.  I've tried lots of things to make it grow back and nothing will.  Don't take this if you don't have lots of hair to lose!  I also gained about 15-20 lbs but barely noticed that because of how bad a problem the hair loss was!	F	25	2  months 1X D	4/18/2011
5	birth control	Maybe breast tenderness	Took Tri-Sprintec and another BC and had a lot of anxiety/depression etc. I looked up online what changes in BC might help, and decided to ask for Alesse. From what I can tell, I have not had any more mood issues. I do have low libido, but this could be due to other things. Period isn't super heavy, it's on time, no pregnancy, no noticeable/shocking weight gain, and especially no mood changes = a winner for me!	F	23	3  years 1X D	3/1/2011
2	lutera actually, birth control	extreme hair loss, mood swings	within the first two to three weeks I noticed I was losing more hair than I usually did each day. I thought perhaps it was due to something else, but it was not. I know they tell you to wait through a few cycles and I continued taking the generic Lutera for two months (generic because my pharmacy didn't carry Aless). I stopped taking it because I couldn't take the hair loss. I've always had really thick hair but now I have thin hair. I lost a weeks worth of hair in one day. It was coming out when I brushed and washed, as well as throughout the day. My hair is still thin however the amount I'm losing has decreased dramatically, it appears i'm back to normal and I have been off Lutera for one month. Also I noticed that I was having more trouble than usual controlling my mood swings, and I was a lot more irritable. I am already a moody person and I was worse for those two months. But my periods were really light and short. So since I've been off, I'm only shedding my usual amount of hair daily, and I my moods are more stable, well at least back to normal.	F	27	2  months 1X D	12/8/2010
5	control menses	I started out taking brand name Alesse and then changed to generic Lutera for the past ~2 years - no side effects for the entire the time I've been on it, until just recently - I'm starting to get a little spotting now between periods and also PMS symptoms at unusual times, so I'm hunting for a new pill - I don't think there is a problem with the pill, but rather my body has changed - I've gone through this a few times with oral contraceptives over the years	I actually take Alesse/Lutera a little like an extended cycle pill, but I do mine for 6 weeks on, 1 week off - it's been great to have fewer cycles and I didn't have any problems with it until just recently (but like I said above, I think this is just because my body is changing) - my gyn offered to write the script this way for me when I was considering Seasonale several years ago - so I've taken Alesse as directed and 6 weeks on, 1 week off without incident, as well as generic Lutera 6 weeks on, 1 week off without side effects, but this golden age is coming to a close for me, and after many years of menstrual bliss (light flow, no cramps, perfect clockwork regularity), the hunt begins again to find another that will do this for me	F	34	10  years 1X D	9/7/2010
1	Birth Control/Period Regulation	Extreme mood swings, Depression, PMDD, Severe cramps, vision problems, Numbness in legs, Breast Sensativity, No labido, No self-esteem, Paranoia, Anxiety, Should I go on?	When I started Alesse last summer I had little to no side effects and was generally happy with it. As the months went on however I pretty much started to slowly lose my mind. When it came time for my period to start I would have so many mood swings that I was pretty much a different person. I could probably write a book on the problems I had with it. I don't recommend this pill, but that's just me, it effects everyone differently.	F	20	1  years 1X D	8/11/2010
1	birth control	severe cystic acne, rashes, period every two weeks, binge eating, severe depression.	I was told by my doctor that this pill had the least amount of side effects.  If you want to feel and look like crap while on this medication, take it. You will feel so great about yourself once the medicaiton settles in.	F	29	4  months 1X D	7/15/2010
5	Birth control	I did not experience any side effects.  It was a good pill for me.		F	30	2  days 1X D	6/8/2010
2	Birth Control	cramps, mood swings, break-outs, early period	after taking Yasmin for a year (and having no problem with it) my doctor wanted to switch me off because she was worried about its effects on my health later on in life. so she put me on alesse: the first two months in the middle of the pack i was having horrible cramps where i couldn't get out of bed. on the third month i skipped a pill and took it the next day (which i had done before on yasmin) and a few days later i got a heavier, longer period than i'd had in over a year while i was still taking the pink pills. i also had awful mood swings and flipped out at my boyfriend for no reason and cried a lot more. not for everyone i guess	F	18	3  months 1X D	5/11/2010
4	birth control	Dryer eyes, rendering me unable within a month to wear contact lenses (even the dry eyes single use kind)	Altogether I had no big side effects. No weight gain whatsoever. This pill worked like a charm. The first month of taking it was punctuated by some light bleeding and nausea if I took the pill a few hours later than usual, but those went away after that first month. I'm very satisfied of this product, apart from being forced to wear glasses because of the extremely dry eyes (resembling that of the elderly according to my optometrist).	F	23	4  years	1/24/2010
4	Birth Control/Regulate Periods	Mood swings	Best pill I've used. 3-4 days of semi-light, little cramping periods. Every period was right on schedule, unless I missed a pill. Had slight mood swings/feelings of hostility, but it was manageable. Was on it for 10+ years, never had problems.	F	27	10  years	1/15/2010
1	Contraception	Moodiness, enxiety, anger, irrationability, breakthrough bleeding, acne	Alesse eventually made me crazy enough to go off it. Everything made me angry, I was screaming all the time. And I am a really easy going person. Then the acne, migraines and the breakthrough bleeding (after years on it) made me quit for good. Aviane (generic) was even worse even though they claim it's the same formula. No pill works for everyone.	F	30	2.5  years	1/11/2010Email
1	other birth control is too pricy	nose bleeds, nausea, weight gain, loss of appetite, no sexual desire at all!	OMG I HATE THIS PILL! I have been on this pill less than a week and I'm stopping it now. I started it on a Monday and today is Friday and in those few days i started getting severe nose bleeds, gained weight(significant) but at the same time I had no appetite. Every time I ate I felt like I was going to throw up and the worst part to me is I didn't want sex. That is weird to me because I ALWAYS want sex and now it is the last thing I want. I feel bad for my boyfriend:( I'm going back on my wallet-buster pill as of today. YAZ is amazing I was dumb to stop it.	F	18	4  days	10/2/2009Email
2	Birth control	depressed, mood swings, loss of sex drive (terrible, to say the least), weight gain	I used to be on this pill about two years ago for 2 1/2 years straight and did not feel any side effect. I got off bc pills all together for a year and went back on it thinking it would be the same.  Very wrong. I spoke with my dr. he said it all depends on your body, what might of worked for me then will not work for me now.  I went now to Zovia and experiencing the low sex drive and weight gain, so I'm concidering stoping the pill. The only positive to bcp is increase in breast size, but still not happy with all other aspects of it.	F	28	3  months	5/8/2009
5	birth control	Recently, breakthrough bleeding. Otherwise, only positive effects -- less acne, lighter/easier periods, very regular periods, stable mood.	I have LOVED this pill. I am very sensitive to hormonal contraceptives, and have tried a lot (including Depo), and when I found that Alesse worked for me many years ago, it was a life-saver. But now (at almost 30), I'm having breakthrough bleeding, which my doctor thinks is due to my body changing and needing a higher-estrogen pill. Fingers crossed the new pill works ok...	F	29	8  years	4/29/2009
2	Pregnancy prevention, lighter perio	-Mood swings! (Angry)-Anxious-Acne where there was none before.	Things were fine while I was on the generic version of Alesse (Aviane) for 3 years. 2 weeks ago, my pharmacy offered brand name Alesse at the same price, so I got it. Since then my moods have been AWFUL! I am angry and anxious all the time, for no reason. I snap at every little thing. And my face is breaking out even worse.	F	30	3  years	3/24/2009Email
2	cramping, irregual mestuarl cycle	Unpredictable periods, extreme mood swings, panic attacks, depressed, couldnt lose weight, irritability. Always tired, no sex drive at all, bloating, Chewing (I know it sounds weird but I was constantly chewing the inside of my mouth)	I started this pill because I was having completely painful and irregular periods. I got to the point where I would have to call out of work the first day of my cycle because my cramping would be so bad and I was always in the bathroom. I found out that I had IBS and my DOC said that I should try BC for the period pain. My OBGYN told me to try Alesse and I did it for 9 months. I NEVER would get my period on time and my period would last anywhere from 10-12 days. My periods werent heavy, they were actually pretty decent, but it would so long. My cramping wasnt as bad as before. I was finally able to go about my normal life during the first day of my cycle. Dont get me wrong, I still had cramps, they were just more tolerable. I was ALWAYS moody, depressed and irritable. And worse of all, I would take it out on those closest to me. I started to get panic attacks during my 4th month on the pill for no reason. I just couldnt take it anymore. I went back to my GYN	F	22	9  months	1/6/2009
1	Birth Control	Significant weight gain, depression, complete loss of sex drive, moodiness, increase in breast size, rash when out in the sun, acne	The only positive side effect with Alesse is that it did regulate my periods. But it made everything else worse. I am in a committed relationship of almost 3 years, and ever since taking alesse my sex drive is non existent. I have also gained about 30 pounds at least. I made an appt with my dr. to change, and was prescribed yasmin. after reading horrible reviews about that i am deciding against taking either. im kind of at a loss.	F	20	2  years	11/21/2008Email
5	BC & Severe menstrual cramps	Fatigue	I loved Alesse.  Alesse cleared my skin 100%, had short, light, and cramp free periods, never gained weight and sex was fantastic.  The only reason I went off Alesse was because it ran out and then I was switched to Yasmin, which was nothing but hell!  I'm finally going back on Alesse after a year and a half of no birth control, I can't wait.  Alesse and Yasmin both made me more tired but that's minor.	F	25	6  months	11/4/2008
3	Birth Control	Constant bleeding for first month, leg cramps, acne, heavy discharge	Had continuous bleeding for 1st cycle, but after one month, no problems.  Lighter periods. Severe leg cramps first month only.  Acne started after 3 months and I haven't had acne in years.  And heavy discharge that has not changed since starting pill.  Lots of comments about sex drive, moods and weight gain, but I had no problems with any of these issues.	F	31	3  months	8/18/2008
5	Irregular Periods/Menstrual Migrane	1st time around:  They don't put this on the package - what I call chewing anxiety.  Always felt the need to chew on my lip or bite my nails or pen or pencil.  Addicted to gum now.  Leg pain (NOT blood clot related).  2nd time around - still the chewing and leg pain, dry mouth. Very very very short/light period.	I was put on it to stop my severe menstrual migraines.  It was discovered I have a very low estrogen level, it cured other things we didn't realize were related to it.  7 years into it, I built up a tolerance to it and started having breakthrough bleeding.  I spent 4 months on Ortho-tricyclin and gained 30 pounds.  Dr. switched me to Yaz, and for the next 3, I was vomiting and having migraine aurae.  I pleaded with the Dr. to let me try an Alesse generic, and I've been on Aviane and happy ever since.	F	23	8  years	7/11/2008
5	birth control, regulate periods	nothing of note	This is the one pill that I've been on that didn't give me hormonal migraines or crazy mood swings. I've been very happy with it. The only thing that has bothered me is that my period has gotten a bit irregular after 4 years of use from time to time, even with proper usage.	M	35	4.5  years	4/7/2008
1	birth control	Major depression, increased anxiety, weight gain, breast tenderness	I was on Alesse twice; the first time I went off it was because I started smoking again (lame), and the second time, I got severely depressed and my anxiety increased (I was previously diagnosed with both illnesses three years ago)	F	28	1.5  months	4/2/2008
3	Endometriosis/Menstrual Cramps	Exhaustion during first week, minor headaches, minor nauseau, spotting during the first month	I was a little nauseous for the first couple days. I was extremely exhausted, constantly, during my first week. I randomly started bleeding quite heavily in the middle of sex in my second week of taking alesse, oops, sorry about the mess! These side effects all quickly went away, and Alesse never affected my weight or moods. Although, I randomly got minor headaches during the full year that I took it (And I used to never, ever get headaches). However, it didn't do very much for my cramps. It took the edge off but I was still in a lot of pain and bled heavily for the first two days. I'm on Loestrin now, I like it better.	F	17	1  years	2/15/2008
1	cramps, heavy period, acne	Pro: No cramps (first time in a few years!)Cons: constant headaches, chronic fatigueness, mood swings, severe depression, constant vaginal bleeding, decreased sex drive	Worst pill ever!After 2 days of taking this pill I noticed vaginal bleeding that didn't stop until after I was off this pill and I was upset a lot...almost like I would be before my period without birth control.As soon as I began having almost suicidal thoughts and my mom constantly seeing me cry,I made an appt with my dr and immediately took me off.The headaches and always being tired did not help in school as stress is the name of the game in college.	F	19	21  days	2/10/2008
4	Birth Control	NO WEIGHT GAIN! Yay!! But, frequent yeast infections, nausea and milk production for first 2 months (stopped after), slightly prolonged periods (mostly spotting-style though).	Honestly, despite some of the negative side effects, I really love Alesse. I have been on it nearly 4 years, and have had almost no problems except those mentioned above. I did have small ovary cramps for the first year on the right side, nothing major. I used to take OrthoTriCyclen and HATED it. That's where my yeast infections started (once a month!) and weight gain was severe and very hard to lose. Since being on Alesse, I've lost all of the weight easily, and gotten my yeast problems reduced. The first couple of months were hard, I had nausea, breast tenderness, and some very slight milk production, but it all stopped soon. I still have slightly longer periods than I'd like. On Ortho my periods were 4 days, but I'd rather be 30 pounds lighter with a very light 7-8 day period than the other way around!	F	24	4  years	2/3/2008
1	perimenopause systems	anxiety, dizziness, itchy skin and irritability were the worst symptoms.	This pill seemed to work for the first couple of months and then symptoms gradually began to get worse.  The last 2 months I had severe anxiety and dizziness and only felt good while having my period.  So I discontinued use.  It's taken 3 weeks to actually get back to feeling normal again.		36	6  months	1/20/2008
3	heavy flow , severe anemia	Melasma spots on face when in the sun for only minutes a day, after a year I began spotting all the time.	Alesse cleared my skin up completely after 3 months on it.. I literally did not get one zit, did not gain weight, lowered sex drive but potentially from the SSRI I take.	F	28	2  years	11/11/2007
4	contraception	NO Libido -- very low except for a few days mid-cycle.  PMS symptoms and very snack for the last 2 weeks.  BUt the best bcp for me compared to Triphasil and even the generic AVIANNE.  (AVIANNE gave me bad acne, increased appetite, and moodiness.  Even though its bio-identical to Alesse.)	Very disappointed to learn they have discontinued making Alesse.  Have been taking it for the past 3 years after many expts with other bcps.  WHAT WILL YOU BE SWITCHING TO NOW? I'm looking for suggestions. The generic Avianne does not work for me.	F	30	3  years	11/3/2007
1	birth control	severe migrane, headache, body aching, heart bumping, loss of sex drive	I really had to stop taking it even a month of cycle was finished, cuz the medicine was literally making me sick.	F	24	10  days	10/23/2007
1	birth control	extreme moodiness, suicidal after not ever having this problem before	Two days after I quit taking it, I felt much happier and suicidal thoughts completely stopped!	F	22	 	10/10/2007
4	birth control/mood swings	After about a year of taking it, I experienced breakthrough bleeding.	I loved this pill so much.  I have been on many trying to find one that helps my mood swings.  This pill was great for my mood.  I hate that I started having breakthrough bleeding because I have not been able to find a new pill that doesn't make me crazy one week a month.	F	29	1  years	9/16/2007
3	Make periods regular/less painful	Irregular periods.	It was great besides irregilar periods...No nausea or anything.	F	16	9  months	6/23/2007
2	Pregnancy prevention; cramps.	Loss of sex drive; anxiety/emotional imbalance; HUGE breasts	I didn't notice any effects at all the first month or so, but since being on it after about 5 months or so I have had horrible anxiety (which I have a history of already), am very emotional (I well up with tears for just about anything), and generally feel out of balance with my emotions.  On top of that I have almost no sex drive and want sex only a handful of day out of the month.  This pill is driving me crazy it seems and am thinking of switching to a tri-phasic pill like Ortho Tri-cyclen esp. for the loss of sex drive.  Also my breasts are huge, I've gained some weight, and have experienced vaginal dryness and breakthrough bleeding.  The only good thing about this pill is that my skin is clearer and my cramps are not nearly as bad.	F	25	5  months	6/12/2007Email
3	Ovarian cysts/family cancer	Killed sex drive, gained a little bit of weight, acne in the beginning	I had NO libido w/ Alesse...it took care of my ovarian cysts and I gained about 3 lbs on this - when I got off the pill, the weight came off.  Cystic acne was sporatic in the beginning, esp behind my ears but this tapered.  No nausea or other side effects.	F	33	18  months	5/21/2007
5	Endometriosis	Mild acne, mild fluid retention.	I prefer Lo-Ovral, but have high blood pressure so I was switched to a couple different pills.  On Alesse, I now have longer periods (about a week and a half) but they are VERY light and only happen every three months!  I get mild acne and fluid retention on occassion.  I haven't had any weight gain except for the fluid, which goes away.  I don't have any of the crabbiness that I had on a progestin only pill (THOSE pills were bad-caused skin infections!) Overall, I think Alesse is a great drug and it stomped my endometriosis symptoms dead.	F	37	9  months	5/17/2007Email

5	birth control / irregular periods	I took Alesse for 8 years and last years started crying 2-3 days before period.  Dr. switched me to Desogen which made me gain weight.  In 8 years on Alesse I did not gain one pound, on Desogen in two months I was huge.  And no sex drive at all on Desegon.	I would rather cry for those two days and be skinny and have regular sex, and feel like a pig and wake up every morning mad on the whole world.	F	29	8  times	4/26/2007
1	Birth control	Extreme depression, crying, nausea, panic attacks, sleeplessness	If I had the money, I'd be launching a lawsuit. I am in good health, eat well, exercise and am (well, was) in a great relationship. But for about two months on this pill I was a raving maniac. From day one I was crying every single day (and I am not a cryer) and getting into fights with my boyfriend over nothing. I knew it was the pills, but everyone told me to wait it out three months and these bad symptoms would go away. (Also, in the accompanying literature, while side effects like limb numbness are cause for emergency, the only warning regarding depression is for people who were *already* depressed before taking the drug, and even then the side effect is 'minor'). After crying at work and a near suicide attempt, I went to the doc who told me to stop taking the pills. Immediately. And guess what? I immediately felt better. No depression, no crying, and I got my appetite back.The odd part is I felt like a failure, not being able to 'tough it out.' I thought the birth cont	F	25	60  days	4/20/2007

1	Birth Control	ACNE ACNE ACNE.  Didnt start until 8 months in.  I had no idea that the pill could cause this so i continued the pill for another year.  My skin was so bad and painful.  I never had acne before at all and now my face is hideous and ugly and i can barely cover it up with makeup.  2 years later and its still a mess.  The only time my face clears a little is when i have my period.  Had to go on spiro to block the adrogens that my body is still producing because of this drug.  im  hoping it works.	Besides the acne also experienced severely reduced libido and mood swings/irratability/depression.  Just use condoms... its so much better for your body!  I used the generic of this pill called aviane.	F	28	2  years	4/7/2007
3	Birth Control	anxiety, moodiness, decreased libido	I'd stick with Alesse but for these anxiety attacks that I keep having (and the super decreased libido).  Never suffered anxiety attacks on the pill before, so am switching to Yasmin.	F	38	3  months	3/8/2007

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself.

4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.

Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out!

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify.

3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control.

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011

It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months.

1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication.

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works.

5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010

3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.

3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR.

I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010

1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.

2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.

3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
4	BIPOLAR 2	Severe Hiccups, lasted for 3 days.  Nausea, severe burping, felt like I was going to throw up, lasted for a week.  Slight mania, abbreviated sleep cycles, still having these.  I feel the side effects are worth it because of how well it keeps me from short cycling, which causes way more problems in my life than a little Nausea		M	36	8  weeks15 MG 1X D	6/2/2010
2	Bi-Polar	Lethargic, Weight Gain and Depression has gotten worse.  I want to be taken off this medication.  Having indecisiveness (more than usual) and my OCD has increased.  Not seeing many benefits after being on Abilify for 2 months.  Feeling sadness daily and lack of energy.  Seems to slow me down to a sad halt.		F	53	2  months10MG 1X D	5/29/2010
2	bipolar 2	sleepiness or death tired during the afternoon even after 9 months of taking this med also i'm waking up in the middle of the night; also i decided because of the drowsiness i would go off of this cold turkey- bad decision because he had sweats, nausea and severe headache.....	the doctor wants me to stay on this but the daytime drowsiness is ruining my life and the nighttime waking is too much	F	50	9  months2mg 1X D	5/29/2010
4	bipolar	very beginning days i had a bizarre hyperactive yet peaceful at the same time cleaning mode (well the house needed it since i had been depressed before i flipped into hypo/ mania) mild restless legs, waking up middle night every other night it seems	it seems to be calming me down somewhat from my up following a depression episode...i may need to incr to 7 or 10mg  as i still am having repetitive thoughts / constant urges to shop but has lessend drastically than before beginning taking it.  i have been able to focus somewhat more than before began this drug....was in thoughts randomly shooting off in 50 thousand directions so i have actually lost a little weight 7 pounds being able to focus and be consistent on walking/jog 4 times a week, which pleasantly for me seems opposite to the majority of other posters here...
