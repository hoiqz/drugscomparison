1	maliciously diagnosed paranoid Sz	Drug-induced Parkinsonism, akathisia which was so bad I felt as if I was going to explode and attempted suicide as I could not stand it.  Also twitching of neck and jaw, losing control of my tongue so speech became incomprehensible.  I paced about 24/7, even eating while pacing about.  I was so mentally and physically exhausted I thought I would drop dead.  I stayed awake longer than the medical profession claim is possible.  This was 23 years ago and I still relive the experience in nightmares.  I was left with a life-long sleeping disorder.  The side effects of this drug are horrendous.  Some psychiatrists still use Haloperidol as first choice - these shrinks are normally also sadistic in other respecst.	When I appealed to the Mental Health Review Tribunal the independent psychiatrist said I had the strangest psych records he had ever seen - they made absolutely no sense.  He said "3 Consultant Psychiatrists have given you a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and there is not a single word in the entire notes to even suggest such a diagnosis"!  The level of psychiatric abuse in UK mental health is a national scandal.  I would give this drug a rate of 0 if this choice was available.	F	66	3  months10 3X D	3/3/2012Email
