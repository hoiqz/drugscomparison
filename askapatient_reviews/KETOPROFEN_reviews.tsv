3	neuropathic pain C5/6 disc slips	severe dyspepsia (indigestion), "sunburnt" feeling on skin, red skin on face.	I was prescribed this in France, following intravenous morphine treatment for severe chronic pain associated with 2 slipped discs in my neck. Ketoprofen was taken in combination with atarax, tramadol, amitriptyline and inexium (the first 3 work on neuropathic pain while the fourth is to limit acid production in the stomach). GOOD: Ketoprofen was a very effective painkiller, reducing my severe nuropathic pain by about 70%. BAD: despite taking a drug to limit stomach acid, AND taking 16 additional over-the-counter antacids daily, I was still having bad indigestion with blood in my stools. My British neurosurgeon was horrified and told me to stop taking ketoprofen immediately or I would need surgery for an ulcer as well! Happily as soon as I stopped ketoprofen the indigestion subsided and after about 10 days I felt OK again....but the pain was back instantly. I am now on gabapentin and codydramol (and hate the gabapentin). WARNING: my neurosurgeon told me that ketoprofen can cause UV-hypersensitivity. You shouldn't expose your skin to daylight while on this drug. That explains the "sunburnt" feeling I had on my face while on this drug.	F	37	1  weeks50mg 4X D	9/16/2010
