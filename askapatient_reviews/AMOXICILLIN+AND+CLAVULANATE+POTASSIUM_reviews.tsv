3	dog bite on hand	Extremely loose stool	By the morning after the fourth dose, stools are so loose that I am afraid to leave the house - these side-effects are far in excess of those I've experienced on other antibiotics - however, the nurse said Augmentin is the best antibiotic to use for dog bites so I need to get through the next five days the best I can - I should have taken the probiotic pills from the first day - started on them yesterday and they help!

3	double ear infection	tooth staining, loose stools	my son, age 3.5, had stained teeth by the 6th day of taking this.  We brush his teeth 2x a day and had just been to the dentist 2 weeks ago for a cleaning.  I know the meds caused this staining.  It says on the paper from the pharmacy that it may cause staining of teeth in children and to tell the doctor if it occurs.  The doctor stated that this does not usually happen from amoxicillin but to brush his teeth with baking soda and water. I don't know how that will go over with a 3 year old who doesn't know how to spit very well yet.	M	3	10  days5.1 ml 2X D	2/8/2011
4	sinus infection	Diarrhea	After 3 pills I got pretty bad diarrhea.  I couldn't cough, sneeze, or blow my nose without going a little.  Before taking the pills, I was not eating right for a few days because I had a really bad sore throat and I hadn't gone #2 in three days. I did try to eat before I took the pills.  A friend told me to eat yogurt like Activia. I'm on day 4 of a 10 day prescription and the diarrhea is better, but I still have "bubble guts". I might go get some yogurt tomorrow!

3	Sinus Infection	Nausea, bloating, diarrhea, yeast infection, general itching	I learned the hard way that you must take this right before, during, or right after a meal.  The bigger the meal the better.  I got a bad yeast infection after being on it for only 3 or 4 days.  I didn't think to take probiotics with this medication until after the yeast infection showed up.  I have also noticed general itchiness over my whole body, especially at night.  I am now on probiotics and only have a day and a half left of this medication.  If I ever need to take this stuff again I will be sure to load up on probiotics!!	F	28	10  days874-125 2X D	6/30/2010
