2	Torn rib cartilage	None	Didn't work at all for my pain.	F	36	8  days	5/13/2009
5	cramps	none, must take with food though!	I have SEVERE cramps, to the point where I would vomit because I was in so much pain. My doc prescribed me this after I told him that I was taking motrin every two hours to control the pain. I only have to take one pill and it works all day! I'm very satisfied.	F	25	1  years	12/19/2008
4	severe menstrual cramps	diarrhea or constipation, tiny red dots all over my body-only noticeable if you look very closely	I start taking 2 pills a day a few days before my period to stop the severe cramps and then continue taking the pills until my 3rd or 4th day on my period. I learned to take the pills w/food, like halfway between a meal I will take a pill and then finish the other half of my meal. I have very tiny red dots, almost like pin pricks all over my arms due to my long-term use (10+ years) of this medication. Verified w/doc that the medication is what caused this.

1	Back Pain	The absolute worse Drug I've taken. Didnt work, bad Headache and Vomiting for 2 hours on 500mg. I should have never listen to the Urgent Care Doctor. Tanks for nothing.	This Drug is Generaly givin to Females for thiere monthly cramps, not a 35yr man with back pain!!!	M	35	2  days	11/16/2007Email
5	severe degenerative joint disease	Effective for me in reducing joint swelling in a way no other NSAID has, but I had to discontinue for several months due to stomach pain. Stomach problem was easily cured with licorice tablets.	Anaprox relieves my pain without the grogginess of narcotics, and enhances my mobility. Worth it to me, despite possible stomach upset.	F	54	5  years	11/28/2006
4	cramps	none	This is the only medication that really helped my cramps. This and Motrin 800mg which leaves me dizzy. I start taking anaprox 2 days before my period is to start, then follow through with a dose each day. It allows me to function and live without the disabling cramps I used to have.	F	21	2  years	11/18/2006
1	menstual cramps	headache, upset stomach	Try to take 6 pills of Black cohosh a day for menstrual pain.  I took it for 4 months, and now have no pain. This drug doesn't cure, just hides the problem.	F	20	3  months	5/10/2006
2	Rheumatoid arhtritis	No side effects	Didn't work at all for me even on the maximum dose	F	31	7  days	7/6/2005
4	severe menstrual cramps	It aggravated my colitis.	It worked great for unbearably bad menstrual cramps. Before Anaprox, I couldn't leave the house for over a week during my cycle. Unfortunately, it aggravated my colitis, and I had to get off it.	F	27	2  years	8/2/2004
3	carpal tunnel syndrome & tendonitis	I have been taking 500mg of naproxen sodium  for 2 weeks now and I am experiencing  ear pain almost like what  the begining  of an ear infection feels like . The  right side of my  face is very tender around the ear.		F	28	2  weeks	9/23/2002
1	plantar fasciitis	severe headache and stomach pain	I took the prescription-strength naproxyn (500 mg, 2x/day) torelieve inflammation.  It didn't work any better than other nsaids.	F	51	30  days	6/24/2002
5	menstrual cramps			F	44	3  months	10/22/2001
