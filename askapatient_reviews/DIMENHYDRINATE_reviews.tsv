5	Motion sickness	Sleepiness, super relaxed	It's wonderful. The first couple times I took a full pill, but then started taking only half. This decreased my sleepiness slightly but still took all the motion sickness away.	F	23	10  times25MG 1X AN	3/8/2011
5	anti-nausea and painkiller	It works very well for me, but unfortunately can cause severe drowsiness and lethargy.	a.k.a. Gravol - I take it daily for my intracranial hypotension headaches, and was also recommended to take it for hydrocephalus-related headaches. I have not found anything in the online literature regarding why it is successful for some people with hydrocephalus, when other analgesics, including opiates, may not work. It works very well for me, but unfortunately can cause severe drowsiness and lethargy.	F	27	5  years	9/14/2008Email
