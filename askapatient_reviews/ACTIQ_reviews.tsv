5	clinic pain syndrome	not much other than the teeth decay, root canals, ect, the up side was it was the only medicine that worked for me, for the break through pain I have, this all due to multiple surgeries,I think around 30 or so, for one problem  or another, so always had this constant cronic pain, that for the most part can be unbearable. now at my wits end I'm through pain management x 12  some years now. Dr started me on percecets, but they don't help any, and still taking my Oxicontin. wish my insurance would pay for my actiq, would be cheaper than the hospital,  which I know it's going to end up back to. is there anything out there that is around the same strength as my actiq, that I can take.I take Oxicontin 80 mgs,3 times a day for the past couple of years now. insurance just changed through husband's employment, so the new insurance no longer covers my actiq, So looks like I'm back to square one, prob and up in the ER Again on a weekly basis for pain control. tried everything else nothing helped like the actiq, and my Oxicontin combo, and even the Oxicontin insurance after may 1st is going to stop.		F	43	8  years800	3/6/2013Email
5	chronic back pain&stomach pain	Lost teeth and can't afford new ones.it is the only medication that lets me live without severe pain and now no doctors want to prescribe it because of the ridiculous price and the fda won't approve for chronic back stomach pain and they don't care how much pain u are in they can provide a better quality of life pain is curable but they don't care about people who need it for chronic life changing pain can't work and missing out on my kids best years because of junkies who ruin it for people who need it to live and work and I would like to enjoy life and be able to sleep more then ten hours a week if it wasn't for my kids I wouldn't want to live for much it is sad I loose all my teeth and they went from less then a thousand a month to fifteen thousand a month just because of the fda won't approve for back pain and the clinical trials proved it is a safer and faster breakthrough medication that is a shame in the best country in the world I wish doctors would prescribe it and take their oath seriously there the doctors not insurance company's		M	40	7  years1600&800mc	10/9/2012Email
4	Avascular necrosis and severe back	I also lost my teeth, but it turned out okay. I always wanted braces and we couldn't afford it so now I have straight teeth now and a great smile. It was a lot of suffering though with the jaw pain and the extensive surgery I needed. Actiq works but I don't understand as an RN why they can't find a formulation besides the patch which I also wear, that will help a breakthrough dose of Actiq last longer than the pops. These pops are addictive but I have one of the best pain specialist in the country and he put me on a maintenance dose of Methadone that helps with that withdrawel feeling in between. The addiction is not addiction, it is a physical dependence when it comes to a person who legitamely needs pain medicine. I have severe Avascular Necrosis and had both hips replaced already. My back is basically collapsing from arthritis and degenerative disc disease as well. I finally accepted the fact that I need the narcotics as much as any diabetic needs insulin, to live a productive life.		F	52	7  years800 mcg 4X D	2/8/2012
5	Bilateral TotalJointReplacement TMJ	I LOVE this medication because it has been the only medication that has really helped my severe chronic pain from my total joint replacement of my tmj. I also take avinza. From the first day that I started this medication I had NO idea that I would lose all of my teeth. It has been literally terrible on my quality of life. There should be a class action lawsuit because all most EVERYONE that has taken this drug has lost most or all of their teeth. Since my total joint replacement I cannot open very wide at all. I just had to have a total mouth extractions last Oct. and I have had terrible problems. One being that they (meaning the dentist) left me with literally NO ridge at all so I am unable to wear a bottom denture. Now I have to have implant surgery that my insurance will NOT pay for even though all of my doctors say it is medically necessary because my total joint replacment will fail since I have no proper support. My top denture is completely crooked and I have been in more extre	If there are any attorneys who are considering a class action lawsuit please email me as I would be interested in getting on board. Although I am not sure that if you sue you would have to stop using the medication and Actiq has been the only pain med to really help my severe chronic pain. It is a very difficult situation and now since my insurance will not pay for my medically necessary implants I don't know where to turn. I cannot eat anything but very soft food and have lost my appetite and only eat 1 meal a day. It is usally oatmeal or applesauce or something along those lines.

5	severe degenerative disc disease	only side effect; I did eventually lose all my teeth except 5 on the bottom	Actiq was the very best medication for pain relief without causing sleepiness and lethargy.  I was able to care for my mother who had a terminal illness and live a productive lifestyle. I'd trade my teeth again for a quality life.  They would not prescribe it for my mother for fear of her falling asleep with it in her mouth; gave her fentanyl patch instead, which I believe contributed to her respiratory failure.  She was 79 yrs. old.	F	62	6  years400mcg 3X D	4/14/2011Email
4	cerv/lumb herniated discs; more	I had to stop the Atiq several yrs ago, so I don't remember exactly how long I took it. I think it was 2-3 yrs. I also don't remember the dosage amount. It worked quite well, however, if I had known what it was doing to my teeth, I would NEVER have taken it.	Worst thing I've ever done to my body.	F	56	 don't reme 6X D	3/20/2011Email
5	arachnoiditis,5 spinal surgeries	I had perfect teeth, always from childhood til date seen dentists and kept great oral hygene. I began a couple of years ago with extensive decay to now 2 teeth and 16 drilled to the gum all of which will be extracted on or about March 1st. Dental Caries cause by Actiq has caused me to need a full mouth recunstruction after 60k of root canala,prostho to help save and oral surgeon as well as infections. Just yesterday my face blew up and I waqs rushed over and had two teeth removed and grafted to releive the serious infection. I have been hopitalized for c-diff colitis fro clindomyacin 3 times. I am at my wits end and now a full mouth recunstruction after all this work.I have been so sick physically and mentally and without our Government thinking out mouth is part of our bodies when it comes to medical coverage it is making people struggle even disbled with no where to go when these problems occurr except blogs like this for us to vent and know we are all not alone.	I think we all need to get a class action started, I am sure any attorney would take this on as there are enough of us out there if anyone agrees or is interested respond here or to my email and put it on any site you see someone has to help us allget some help with our teeth and medical issues compromised from this as well. thank you	F	48	6  days600 mcg 4X D	2/19/2011Email

5	Fibromyalgia	Tooth decay & sleepiness	I actually take 12/day, but the pull-down menu didn't offer that choice!This is a miracle drug for me! I tried just about every other pain medication out there, and few worked. The few that did work, I quickly built up a tolerance to and they quit working after 3 months to a year. I was mostly bedridden from Fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis in my right knee before using Duragesic patches (3 50mcg patches at once, change oldest patch each day) and Actiq. My husband's company switched from Express Scripts to Cigna, and now I'm having to fight to get my Fentanyl. We got my patches approved with just a preauthorization. But it's taking us forever to get the Actiq approved. I just pray that they eventually do approve it. I don't want to go back to being bedridden. For me, it's worth losing my teeth to get my life back. I have two young daughters who need me.	F	44	3  years800mcg 10X D	1/24/2011Email

5	severe cronic back pain neck &low b	Like just about all pain meds. DRY MOUTH is main one. if these other people would have read the inclosed drug info they would have read that BRUSHING YOUR TEETH more is necessary with sugar content of Actiq. Any dentist will tell you side effects of dry mouth: the decaying of teeth & gum disease!! drinking soda is the worst...but it worked for me. Dentists can also prescribe special toothpaste to help. The best side effect.....I was able to  have somewhat of a more normal quality of life! So many meds. make you feel so tired, ACTIQ didn't for me. Can someone tell me why it's so expensive?????? The cost is just not right. The people that need it can't afford it.	ACTIQ name brand works. It's the only one. The first generic to come out did not! Not at all. Pharmacists kept telling me they were the same. Who would you believe the person one it for years or someone that never used it! Most Insurance company's would then only pay for generic (which wasn't much cheaper) then they said unless you have a severe form of CANCER that they will not pay for it. It was the best pain regiment I had when ACTIQ was included. I told my Dr. that it made me feel like a real person again. I felt great! now I can"t have it. Why is it so expensive??????

1	spinal surgery and constant pain	Why is there no class action law suit on this drug??? Everyone I meet that has taken it has lost their teeth or half their teeth and my doctor will not even prescribe it any more because all his patients had tooth problems. I brushed before, after, it does not matter.  This stuff just sits on your teeth and rots them away.  THe company is now in trouble because none of the insurance companies are willing to pay for it anymore. So between the price and the rotting teeth the company has some real PR work to do. I think a big law firm should take them on. There are thousands of patients who have lost their teeth and this company could care less.	Stay away from this drug at all costs. That is my best comment.

1	CANCER	EVERY SINGLE TOOTH IN MY MOUTH HAD TO BE REPLACED ALONG WITH 4 OST AND WORKING ON AT LEAST 2 MORE.

I JUST REPORTED MY DENTIST TO THE BOARD OF DENTISTS AS HE SKIPPED TOWN BEFORE THE JOB WAS COMPLETE.THE REVIEW BOARD SAID THAT ALL OF THEM NEED REPLACED AS IT WAS A SHOTTY JOB. NO PAIN MED IS WORTH THIS KIND OF PAIN AND COST. DO NOT ADVISE TAKING IT. I AM AN ATTORNEY AND AM CONSIDERING A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT AFTER SEEING THIS INFORMATION. I HAD NO IDEA OTHER PEOPLE WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING. MY DOCTORS TOLD ME IT WA BECAUSE I HAD A CANCEROUS SALIVA GLAND REMOVED AND MY DRY MOUTH ROTTED MY TEETH. SEEMS THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

4	Severe back pain-surgery/ sciatica	the only side effect I've had are to my teeth-they do not warn you of the sugar content in this drug. I always use it on the right side of my mouth &  all the bottom teeth on that side of my mouth now have cavities at the gum line. I just had to have a bridge made for a cost of over $3200 all because of this drug. We should all sue them to get our dental paid for-this is horrible. I'm disabled & don't have the money to pay for the rest of my teeth	Besides the teeth the other problem is insurance. I will not be able to afford this drug much longer as I've had to pay out of pocket. Even though AARP Medicare D assured me 4 times they would pay for the drug no matter what my DX, once I signed up they refused to pay because I'm blessed not to have Cancer. What a rip off with these companies. This drug costs very little to manufacture, why does it sell for hundreds of dollars a box? What is wrong with this picture.

4	Broken in half by car accident	At first my stomach was up set, but that faded away. I was on this drug Actiq for 2 years, until I could not pay for it anymore. And, disability refused to pay for it. The drug was good the side effects now are devistating, making me home bound because like other's I no longer have teeth. I spent 5 years in braces, first 3 through Jr. High then when my wisdom teeth came in,they had to pull them and I had to spend 2 more years in braces and while I was just about done with my retainer at 16 I had a car accident where the car rolled 5 times and I went halfway out of the sunroof the car rolled over ontop of me, broke me in half, and rolled 2 more times. While in intensive care with a resperator and no retainer my teeth all spaced out so about 8 months again in braces. Now with Chronic pain, closed head injury, back broken in 7 places, and 33 corrective surgeries since. Actiq worked good compared to other pain med's. But, now I have 7 teeth left. I am so embarassed to go out. Who would wan	If I knew then what I know now, I never would have taken it. At this time my next option is a Morphine pump or shotgun. I didn't go through all the pain of wearing head grear, the throbbing of the orthodic rubber bands. The stanless steal smile as a teenage girl. Actiq did work sure, but I really would like to actually EAT SOMETHING that is solid SOON. I have no molers, both gold crowns snaped off and my last 5 on the bottom in the front are not looking so good. So, they will be next. What the HECK is a person TO DO? I sure hope that the Manufacture and Disributor get to read some of these. Being Disabled is bad enough, but the medication they give you that is suppose to help make's all your teeth fall out, is a very-VERY BAD thing. I am in Tampa, FL is there anyone out there that can help. I get $599 a month, how am I suppose to pay for the dental surgeries, extractions then dentures? HELP! Any Pro-bono Dentist's around?

5	DDD, Cervical Radiculopathy, etc.	4 surface cavities plus 11 teeth with no enamel at the gumline (high risk for future cavities). These were my first cavities ever.  I brush my teeth 3x/day & that's probably why I went 6 years with no problems, but now my teeth are a mess.  It is not just the sugar, but also the citric acid in Actiq that supposedly contributed to them.  I always put the medication on one side of my mouth -- that's where all the cavities were & most of the teeth with the stripped enamel.	Works great for pain.  Fentanyl is the only narcotic I'm not allergic to.  Tried Duragesic, but even the lowest dose available caused an overdose.  No other side effects besides the tooth decay.  I've gone off it for a month or so at a time to manage tolerance & didn't have any issues.	F	32	7  years	12/19/2009

Although it gave me a "life" ALL MY TEETH ARE FALLING OUT NOW AND I CANT AFFORD 30K WORTH OF DENTAL WORK. I AM A YOUNG-LOOKING ATTRACTIVE WOMAN WHO NOW HAS THE SMILE OF A CRACK AND METH ADDICT. LOVELY. NOW WHAT?	DONT TAKE THIS MED IF OTHER OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE AND WORK FOR YOU!!!

4	Severe Back Injury 9herniated discs	I have been on Morphine(200 mg. 4x daily) & Actiq-Fentynal(1600mcg. x 8 daily) for severe back pain since 2002. I have suffered with serious side effects - Respiratory Problems, bouts of unconsciousness & waking in middle of the night uncontrollably freezing with severe hallucinations.  Also, mouth ulcers, tongue lesions, Dental Problems - losing 4 rear molars, having 4 or 5 root canals , multiple bonding's to repair crumbling teeth, and many, many cavities since 2005 . Just recently, I  had a very painful root canal done which almost ruined my entire Christmas, only to have 1/2 of another tooth fall out in my hand a week later.  That day (a few days ago) I seriously felt like I was losing my mind and realized that there must be something way more serious going on with my teeth than I had imagined. Miraculously, I happened to go on the Internet and read on a web site regarding Actiq and Tooth Decay Lawsuits.  It gave me the answer to my constant horrible teeth problems that no	Actiq does help with the excruciating back pain when Morphine is'nt enough, but they should have "worked out all the bugs" before they put it on the market & get chronic pain sufferers addicted to it. I would definitely like to see Cephalon punished for their GREED, keeping people in the dark about all the side effects.  Getting some type of settlement to recoup my losses would definitely help give me some needed relief. I could buy some new teeth for starters and then get surgery done to fix my back so I could get off these evil suckers.Does anyone know of a Law Firm that is suing the makers of Actiq for all the EVIL side effects associated with Actiq use?Please Email me the information. 	M	45	5  years	1/31/2009Email
5	Chronic Back Pain Syndrome; RSD	My ONLY side effect was the rotting, decay, breaking of, all my teeth that are in desperate need of extraction, to the average person this side effect is similar to photos of "meth mouth!" When first prescribed Actiq it contained NO dental warnings, approximately 1 year later the package insert was changed and included consulting and visiting your dentist. However the damage to my teeth had already been done. I'm in desperate need of dentures with no way to pay for them due to this medication. No physician, pharmacist, or dentist warned me of this problem. My dentist seems to be unaware of the problems it has caused to date. Next: I will find a caring dentist.	Actiq allowed me to participate in my life; for the first time in over 5 years! The back pain and bilateral radioculpathy was so unbearable became totally bedridden for 5 years. Actiq afforded me the luxury of a pain tolerant life. (I controlled the pain, the pain no longer controlled me.) During my divorce proceedings I quickly learned that Medicare and Medicaid would not pay for this MIRACLE drug. I stop taking this medication because I lost the luxury of private health insurance during my divorce in 2004. I stopped Actiq cold turkey on my own without side effect or symptoms (pain came back with a vengeance). Was placed on 100mg MS Contin, 3x a day and 2 Narco 10mg 3x a day. I am bedridden again!  I hope one day all clinicians will learn to be more sympathetic when treating their pain patients and realize they're not "drug seekers" attempting to get high.

5	DDD Spine collapsing 3X Surg/fusion	First month was hard in summer getting used to slow breathing/then no side effects until 5+ yrs later teeth began to decay/breaking off.  Though part my fault-poor dentist habits may have been controlled otherwise.  Issues with coming out of anesthesia from surgery.  I have such a tolerance-I wake up way too soon and am totally coherant within minutes while everyone around me is out cold.  Nursing staff amazed.  Euphoric when I'm very tired and sleep deprived.  Weak cough reflex.  All in como w/fentanyl patches-lethal dose.	I see alot of the remarks about Actiq and wonder how many of these neg. issues are from a combination of the additional narcotics we are on.  I don't believe Actiq on its own is causing all of these dependency problems.  I have been taking Duragesic patches for nearly 7 years along with Actiq for break through.  Quickly got up to lethal doeses @ 400mcg every 48rs and 1200mcg Actiq 6X a day and could easily raise both of those now to 500 & 1600 mcg's.  Have been at current dose for 3 years.  Took 5+ yrs b4 teeth became an issue, though I take care of them at home I also have not seen a dentist in over 18 years since I had perfect teeth and no known problems.  Was wheelchair bound and could not stand/walk straight.  Fentanyl has been an amazing drug after the full gamit of pills for years ending w/oxycontin 80mg and the 20+ useless epidural injections.

Unless you deal with severe pain every second of the day you probably shouldn't be on this type of pain med! I Thank God I found a doctor that gave me this option. I take Avinza (1 a day)with my Actiq and I am finally able to tolerate the "left over pain."  If you think this will erase all your pain it won't and shouldn't.  Even with Actiq my pain is never less than a 6 (on scale 1-10). I'm tired of people judging others that suffer as I do. Believe methere are days I wish I would just die since I've had to live in so much pain ALL MY LIFE.

Instead of ending up in the hospital monthly I was given Actiq. I was finally able to eat again without pain. After being on the drug for a year the Oxford will not pay for Actiq. So now they will have 3x the bills to pay every month while I am in the hospital. Oh the drug is approved for me to take while in the hopspital! When will these insurance companies ever learn!

There was an article in the Wall Street journal that stated that the insurance companies were suing the manafactuer of Actiq because their salesman were "hawking the lollipops to neurologists and pain specialists and not just oncologists as it had an FDA approval for cancer pain. Physicians can prescribe a medication for a condition even if it was not FDA approved for that condition. I would put my nerve pain against any cancer pain any day. My pain radiates into my testicles and every morning I feel like I just came out of the OR without medication. Aetna is making this decision to save $$. Making Billions a year isn't enough.

After using this medication without issue for 5 years, all the sudden Aetna isn't going to cover it unless you're a cancer patient. This reeks of a big insurance company trying to save money due to the popularity of Actiq. Instead, it's being presented as their team of doctors and consultants have determined what's best for the patient.  It's amazing without ever seeing me, they know better than a Pain Managment doctor who specializes in treating patients who live in pain.  Oh, but if you do get their approval, they'll allow 15 lozenges for 30 days. Why bother?  Again, it's all about money rather than what's best for the patient, regardless of the amount of money paid monthly for premiums.	M	46	5  years	7/11/2007
1	Migraines	Severe constipation, personality changes, dependency	Found to be a great pain reliever if taken in time.  Better than ER visits every week.  Had to go to rehab twice to get off it for good.  Accupuncture & herbs & anti-seizure medication work better w/NO addiction/dependency. Visit MAGNUM website if you suffer w/migraines.

5	Migraine	I had nausea and vomiting from the Actiq (on top of the nausea and vomiting from the migraine) until I learned to titrate the dose better.  Slower dosing & removing the lozenge from my mouth after a minute of application and waiting a few minutes before using more has eliminated the opioid-induced nausea I used to get (unless it's tolerance that explains it).  I was concerned about my teeth from the start so I always brush after Actiq as soon as I feel up to it.	Actiq has been wonderful for my migraines.  Nothing else had worked, and trips to the ER had been miserable experiences.  The rapid time to onset of relief coincides perfectly with the time from my migraine aura's time of onset to the onset of pain.  My migraines, averaging about a dozen times a year, used to make me non-functional for a couple days feeling like I was going to die in tremendous agony.  Since Actiq, they are now just a tolerable headache through which I can function adequately.  I can't benefit from oral meds because my migraine makes me vomit whatever I swallow (and I didn't respond to injectable Imitrex).  Now, I can often even avoid vomiting from the migraine if I am cautious about the rate at which I absorb the fentanyl.			4  years	4/15/2007Email
1	migraine	it help right away but I needed to take more very fast, very addicting, this drug was only approved by the FDA in 1998 for cancer patient and the company allows the representative to go to othher doctors office like sport medicine and medicine to peddle their drug for pain management, knowing very well that this drug is extremely addictive	I had sever problem getting off the drug, develop severe abdominal pain, had abdominal surgery. This drug has totally messed up my life. I wished I had never taken it. It has 8o times the strengh of morphine, it should never be in the hands of people who have a life to live. It should only be given to terminal patient whom addiction is no longer a problem. This company is a joke. All they were after is making monies at the expense of the patients. The docs are not to blame, they found out too late that it was not what is was intented for. Shame on the pharmaceutical company. many people have dies from this drug, children thought this drug was a lolipop and died!! I think they should go to court and pay for what they have done to all the patients who have  been administred this drug and who were not cancer patient. This is negligence at its worst!!!!

1	migrain pain even after neck fusion	Took actiq after neck fusion & along with the durigesic fentynal patch around 1999.  It was working great & every 4 hours, my migraine would come back & then the actiq would stop it.  This continued until they changed the production of it from the US to the european method.  For some reason, the actiq in the new formulation never did work.  As soon as I used it, the migraine continued & continued without working at all.	I have no idea why the new formulation changed the working of the fentanyl in the med but it no longer worked.  Besided it not working, while using it, the new formulation was so rough that it rubbed sores on my cheek for the time I was trying to see if it was going to somehow start working.

No decay on my lower teeth where I never put a stick.	the only way to sleep when you have level 10 pain is to put one or two sticks in your mouth against the upper teeth (more natural placement) and let them sit and slowly dissolve for hours.  I wasn't aware that they were made with confectioners sugar.  My tooth damage happened below the gumline first so by the time the damage was discovered, it was bad.  One tooth fell in half one day!  I have had root canals and pulled teeth.  I am only 41 years old, so I didn't want to go with dentures yet, but I am very interested if anyone has filed or heard of someone filing a lawsuit against Cephalon Inc. to try and get reimbursed for the dental damage.

1	Nerve Damage - 9 years	Lost, broken teeth.  Still affecting teeth after switching to Duragesic.  Personality changes.	Why the hell would they put sugar in something like this?  I set up equipment at Pharmaceutical Trade Shows and have talked to the reps from Cephalon.  They have two more formulas in the Pipe Line.  One is like the instant disolve breathe sheets and the other is suger-free.  Since switching to Duragesic, I'm doing better than ever.  Between the patch and Vicoprofen, I can manage my pain with less problems.  Everyone is different, so I won't pass judgement on some of the other comments seen here.  I would suggest that people still taking Actiq wait until they are off the medication before giving an opinion.  You don't realize how much the drug changes your personality until you are off of it.  After 9 years of managing my pain and handicap, I can offer a pearl of wisdom.  Accept your pain and your life the way it is now.  You'll never get anywhere hoping to return to your former life.  For most of us, there is no cure.  Also, stop thinking that the drugs will take away all the pain, or	M	45	14  months	12/12/2006

5	Chronic low back leg and nerve pain	Occaisonal constipation which is manageable.	I have had great results with this medication. I have been in pain from a back injury/surgery for almost 18 years. In reading the comments I noticed that the word addiction and addictive was used very frequently. I believe there is a major misunderstanding of this word. Within the chronic pain community as well as within the general public. Addiction is an aberrent psychological condition where one beleives they must have this drug and would do anything to obtain the drug. Dependency is when a persons body becomes dependent upon the drug and one will suffer physical withgraw sysmptoms should the drug be stopped abruptly. I am dependent on actiq just as I have been dependent on the morphine, oxycodin, and methodone that I have taken to control my pain. Remove the pain and I do not need these drugs. If you are addicted the pain is of no consequence. You require the drug to satisfy your addiction, not to control your pain. Far too many people are labled with the word addict when the real	M	43	3  years	11/3/2006

1	Chronic headaches from brain tumor	Hi, I have been on actiq between 5 to 6 years now. And yes, I have had teeth problems.  In fact, I have lost every tooth in my mouth.  It stunned my dentist when he saw what the actiq was doing to my teeth.  Before the actiq, I had really good teeth, no cavities, just a couple crowns due to age.  I have had many bad side effects from the actiq.	I am taking 1200mcg 8 times a day.  My doctor will NOT go any higher.  I have had a brain tumor discovered in Aug. 1996.  Right now I have been on just about every type of pain killer with no effect.  I have been on the max legal dose of morphine that hospitals can give walk-ins.  It was like putting water in my veins.  I have been through most of the neurologists in a major hospital to try to find something that would give me any relief.  Nothing.  I was sent to the best pain management center in my area of where I live. In the end, my doctor just threw his arms up and said he had nothing more he could do for me.  Finally, a major cancer institute was built in a drivable distance.  I was lucky and got to see a doctor in the Pain and Palliative Care unit.  She has tried everything (including actiq) with just a little relief from the actiq.  And I am still on the 8 a day, 1200mcg actiq.

The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.

I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email
1	depression/anxiety	severe muscle weakness, tremors that have yet to stop 2 months in, not sleeping, pacing		M	44	5  days5mg 1X D	9/19/2011
1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!	F	49	2  weeks2 mg. 1X D	6/21/2011Email
1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011
4	Paranoid schizophrenia	Middle range sedated	All anti psychotics slow you down. I found this med to be better than most	M	48	5  years30 MG 1X D	5/12/2011
1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!	M	37	21  days10 1X D	2/24/2011Email
5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.
