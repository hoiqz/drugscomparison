				F M	 	 	    
1	Seizures of unknown cause	Anxiety, Rage, Depression. This drug, within 3days, made me basically manic. I was at a point where no one could speak to me I was so angry. I had no specific reason for the anger & knew this, so I phoned my prescribing neuro. & got yelled at to continue taking the Keppra as my Lamictal she prescribes gets to level. Bite me! I listened to my body & cold turkey discontinued the Keppra. I felt instantly better after skipping my next scheduled dose. I, as well, would not wish this on my worst enemy. (just for the fact that it could turn you into a raging maniac!) No bueno.		F	32	5  days1000mg/day	3/11/2013
1	secondary epilepsy	I didn't get immediate side effects but they slowly developed. So depressed, anxious, emotional and tired all the time. I don't know how this stuff is legal. I got taken off half my dose and realised all the depression, anxiety, cutting myself off from the world, thinkking that would not stop, fear and all the other stuff that I would have been better off dead than endure... It was the keppra!!! This stuff is something I would not wish on my worst enemy		F	35	3  years1000	2/21/2013
1	Precaution after brain surgery	I was depressed most of this medicine. I was also very tired and my moods were all over the place. I didn't just notice it but my boyfriend and family noticed the difference in me. I don't know how people can take this long term.		F	25	1  months500 mg	1/25/2013
1	Seizures from brain surgery	Oh my God!  This medicine is like an evil spirit in the bottle.  I had severe neck and leg and arm pain, more seizures, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, vomiting, dizziness and confusion.  Felt like I was dying.  My arms and legs felt so heavy that I couldn't lift my extremities.  I don't understand how doctors can think this crazy med will help anyone.  It's so dangerous and makes me feel the worse I've ever felt in my life!!!	I had more consious seizures on Keppra and I begged my doctor to wean me off of this.  Even being weaned off of Keppra sucks!  I don't even understand how this medicine was officially approved.	F	45	7  days500 2X D	1/9/2013Email
1	SEIZURE'S	I am very sensitive to medicine ill take the neurotin any day over keppra,trouble eating,coping just in a daze like a dream and NO appetite,confusion,anxiety,weird thoughts.cry .sad for no reason	it sucks	M	35	2  years500 1X D	11/17/2012Email
1	Migraines	Made my anxiety worse.  Severe lethargy and irritability, which got progressively worse.  Still experienced migraines even while on this.	Was prescribed this for prevention of migraines after seeing a neurologist.  Originally given 2-weeks worth of samples of the XR-version, then switched to the immediate release; told to take it twice a day (1000mg tabs).  Made me very agitated, and after about 3 weeks after taking it I felt like the world around me was moving in slow motion;  I didn't want to be bugged and it felt like just getting off the couch was an agony.  And when I ran out of samples of XR and got my script filled for the non-XR, gave me mild anxiety attacks.  Finally called my neurologist back and told them I was sick of it, and stopped cold turkey with no adverse effects.	M	29	4  weeks1000mg 2X D	11/8/2012
5	Crainiotomy/brain damage/seizures	Foggy headed and balance off for few days now no issues and mixes with other meds		F	45	3  years750 MG 2X D	10/25/2012
2	Epilepsy	Tiredness, gradual sadness, bad memory, anger, rage, crying, wanting to leave my life, trapped feeling, anxiety, suicidal thoughts.Lack of feelings like joy and love. Not being able to think straight. These side effects came on gradually	I went to drs about how i felt, they offered me cbt, then diagnosed me with GAD, put me on pregabalin which also gave me suicidal thoughts, i tried to commit suicide, failed and came off pregabalin, although the drs denied that they could be the cause. I still took keppra not realising it was this causing the anxiety, just after going on keppra i'd met someone and we later moved in together. They stood by me throughout all of this but in the end my thoughts were so distorted that i blamed them for all the things i was feeling, when they left i felt nothing, after 5 1/2 years i felt NOTHING, not until i started to have a breakdown and decided it was the keppra did i feel anything, months after they left i went through the process of them leaving me(me breaking us up). They'd moved on by then, i lost them, friends and a god son. Keppra did control my seizures but at the cost of my life, i'd rather have the occasional seizure!

2	seizures	I was told my attitude changed, memory loss,I can't sleep, constant arguments with people. I was taking 6000mg a day.		M	34	2  days6000 mg	10/14/2012Email
1	possible seizure	extreme sleepiness, irritability, loss of balance, nausea	I took only one dose, it's been 24 hours since and I'm still feeling somewhat hungover:  Physically exhausted.  This stuff is garbage and I refuse to take any more of it.	F	59	1  days500 mg 2X D	8/20/2012Email
5	I had a seizure	Just sleepiness		M	31	1  years2000 MG 4X D	8/17/2012
2	Seizures	After 2 doses, KEPPRA turned me into a MONSTER!  I had extreme unexplainable rages, anger, and mood swing and eventually ended up with suicidal thought and that when I call it quit (3 days)	Love that it is somewhat safe for Breastfeeding and I heard that if KEPPRA XR works better than generic. My second AED, LAMICTAL gave me even worse side-effects so I might just go back to KEPPRA and try the brand name instead of generic.	F	37	3  days250mg 2X D	7/31/2012Email
3	JME (Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy)	TIRED 24/7 Not getting things done on time. Always forgetting things I did or said just a day before. SEVERE chest and back acne, zits and pimples. I thought it was my diet but it isnt. Keppra WILL cause acne. Most people (including me) feel weak and unable/unmotivated to do things. It's hard enough to even leave my bed after Ive gotten 10+ hours of sleep. I just want to stay in bed and veg out all the TIME!!	Keppra on one note is helpful. It is EXTREMELY good for you in the sense that it is totally filtered through your body and digested. It is not stored, absorbed or residual medication left behind in your system. This was a breakthrough for seizure medication because it had little to NO harm on your body. No liver or kidney issues. Its great. But the side affects of this medication (AED) really mess up a SOCIAL and UP BEAT persons life big time. If you work in a cubical, hate your life and or job and arent married or have children... then this medication is for you. If you like to laugh, be physically active, play sports, be sexual and romantic, have a loving and caring relationship or have a life then Keppra is NOT for you. Keppra, although, did stop my seizures and at a VERY low dosage of only half a pill (250 MG) a day. Occasionally I could ween off of it for a few days and then would get small twitches or minor seizures that I Was conscious for.	M	24	6  years250 1X D	7/16/2012Email
4	Temporal Lobe Epilepsy	Controls seizures well. I did experience rage but my doctor then prescribed Metanx which counteracts the rage!! The night dose is interfering with my sleep and sleep aids. I do have severe acne on my back which I am not happy about but it is helping me.	For those experiencing rage if it controls your seizures ask your doctor about Metanx. Its a vitamin but its prescribed and it does counteract the rage effects at least for me it does so I hope it will for you too.	F	42	2  months500 2X D	3/11/2012Email
4	temporal lobe epilepsy	Newly diagnosed epilepsy at 22 and this was the treatment prescribed. I suffered initial drowsiness and slurred speech but this resolved after a couple of months. Had my dose increased after 1 year as I was still having simple partial seizures. The increase rectified this and I am now seizure free except a couple of occasions when I've been ill and had a fever. I suffered some depression buy am not sure if this is due to the medication or the epilepsy diagnosis.		F	24	2  years1750 mg	2/18/2012Email
1	Seizure Prevention	I wasn't having seizures, so I thought. My husband said he'd wake up in the middle of the night and I would be stiff and my eyes would be open! Rage, major mood swings, horrible focus, lack of regard  for family and friends at times.	Beside the rage, major mood swings, horrible focus and lack of respect for family...etc. 1.5 yrs after starting it I had so much of these side effects that I got divorced from the most loving man ever. I felt caged, mad, sad, disassociated and not understood. It's been 1.5 yrs since the horrible things I said and did...now I've been on Lamictol for 2.5 wks and am recalling all the good things about the relationship! I've felt guilty and disconnected for so long and now I just wish I never used Keppra XR. I was on Tegretol 200mg for 15 yrs and never had seizures or side effects (except drowsiness). Keppra XR put me into a mental state to let me ruin the best thing in my life. Even my massage clients noticed my attitude change while on it and that is the most relaxed environment I am ever in. Ugh. I'm trying to reconnect with my ex...I hope the meds change doesn't come across as an EXCUSE	F	33	3  years750 mg 1X D	9/23/2011Email

4	Seizure disorder	Had depression and crying spells, as well as insomnia.	Had complete seizure control on this medication, but eventually had to go off because I couldn't stand only getting 5-6 hrs of sleep per night.  Depression was helped with an antidepressant and did go away after going off Keppra.	F	39	6  years500 mg 2X D	7/27/2011
3	temporal lobe epilepsy	With each increase took longer to adjust to side effects including:  sudden mood changes, depression, bad memory, felt disconnected, episodes of mania and sensory sensitivities (noise, light, movement) which created a lot of anxiety.	Given for newly diagnosed epilepsy and started at 250 mg.  Most symptoms resolved (after a month or so) except sensory related ones which my doctor believed  were seizure related.  I hadn't had side effects like these before and they 95% went away after getting off.  Felt horrible getting off but after two weeks I could go out in public again without sensory overload!  This drug truly governed how I lived my life.  I believe this is typically given to older adults???	F	28	8  months1000 2X D	6/29/2011Email
3	my son has seizures. he takes it	he was very tired, and very moody!! and later he was falling a lot. which is one of the side effects from the medicine!!	I did not like this medicine at all.  he fell all the time, i know he was young, but it was a constant thing, after they switched his medicine he stopped falling. he was also sooooo cranky!!!!!  and it didnt help much with his seizures  (he was 2 at the time he was on this medicine)	M	2	 6ml 2X D	5/29/2011Email
4	Myoclonus	SLEEPINESS! I just want to sleep all the time, which is a problem cos I have a busy school and social life. Also, irritability but I don't know if this is just when I can't sleep. Short but quite severe headaches.	I haven't been on Keppra long (still in the process of upping the dose) but I am seeing an improvement that I haven't had on other drugs, hence the higher rating. Although I have had side effects I am coping ok with them at the moment and I'm hopeful that I'll get used to it after a while.	F	17	2  weeks250 2X D	4/15/2011Email
4	Temporal Lobe Seizures	Breif lack of coordination in the begining and again with my dose increase. increased aggitation & Insomnia which may or may not be related to Keppra. Increased aggitation seems to have accurred for me for a breif amount of time every time i have had a sizeable seizure weather i have been on meds or not. And Insomnia was a previous issue i had that seems to provoke my seizures and increase the severity. I also had terrible migraines in the begging but im pretty sure that was related to my siezures as they went away completley when my dose was raised.	I would like to add that i noticed many ppl that rated this drug when they listed side effects listed things that may be a result of the seizure not being controlled by the med or dose or both and not the med itself causing it.  Not saying that thats the case for everyone but i know for me some of my symptoms it turned out to be that my dose was not high enough to control my seizures as my agression and migraines completely went away with my new dose. Granted im only 1 week into my new dose so things could change but i noticed a pretty big difference right away with the dose change.	F	29	2  months500 2X D	4/1/2011Email
2	Migraine prevention	sedation, irritability (in the AM), loss of coordination, brain fog, more easily frustrated, increased anger, mild hair loss	Haven't noticed any significant difference in the frequency of my migraines/headaches.  Certainly none that outweigh the side-effects.	F	27	30  days500 mg 2X D	3/24/2011Email

1	epilepsy /brain tumours removed	Horrendous! Lamotrogine working well but Keppra added to help further.  Dreadful, angry, depressed, aggressive, wanting to drink alcohol, suicidal, unreasonable, considered self harm.Poor balance, cried a lot.  I did not recognise myself and neither did my family.  Normally, friendly and good tempered.Laughing a lot!  Behaved well through all surgery etc and not one to make a fuss - positive thinking is the best way.KEPPRA was a nightmare.  GP had not prescribed - the hospital controlled medication for epilepsy etc. They were excellent at all times - but when the effects were seen, they immediately said Keppra - slowly come off. I have now down to 500mg am and 500mg pm and hugely better. No longer depressed angry or suicidal but I am cross that such a drug can be given with no warning of the possible side effects.  My General Practitionerwho had known me for years - did not see these side effects and recommended me to a psychiatrist!!  Fortunately, the consultants took over and n	Panic attacks for 6 years - diagnosed eventually as epilepsy 2 brain tumours.  Removed through superb surgery and care.Some remaining epilepsy hence drugs to control  Resulting inbeing given Keppra.	F	65	 2000mg 2X D	1/4/2011
1	Epilepsy	I took this 11 years ago so I don't remember what the dosage was, only that it was increased each month.  The first month, not much as far as side effects, and certainly no help.  Second month at a higher dosage, still no help but gained 5 pounds.  Third month and a higher dosage, smidge of help and gained 10 pounds.  Fourth month there wasn't much more help, but I gained FOURTY POUNDS!!!  The thing was, it also took my appetite from me so I wasn't eating at all.  I got pregnant, went off the medication, and the pregnancy seems to be what stopped the seizures for a while.	The one good thing it did was to muck about with my hormones and put them back where they were before I had gone on birth control when I first got married.  It made it possible for me to get pregnant by shortening the length of my cycle from 14-16 days down to 10.  Other than that...nothing.	F	38	4  months 2X D	11/28/2010Email
2	siezure	At first, loss of memory, trouble thinking and recalling words. Blurred vision. Dizziness, numbness tingling in hands and feet. Weakness in hands. And RAGE!! Most of the side effects went away after several months. Reduced over time. The rage reduced only slightly. No Seizures at all for 2.5 years. I felt it was worth it to continue.	About 1 year ago, I started to get some mouth problems. At first it was a metalic taste and dry feeling, but also a lot of saliva. This got worse and worse over time. I asked for help from everyone. Doctor, dentist, neuro, hygenist. They all said my mouth looked normal, but one said she could refer me to a dermatologist. I lived with it, then 10 days ago I got a rash. The neuro switched me to lamictal. All was fine for first three days. I felt better than I had in 2.5 years. Then I increased dose  to 50mg2x/day and had two seizures. Then I when the dose was to 75mg2x/day, I got the same mouth problem as with the keppra, but 10x worse. Yesterday, I got the rash again, only it came on in 30 minutes (instead of over three days like with the keppra) and is much worse than on the keppra. Apparently my body is rejecting both of these meds. Now, I have to change again and all the options sound really bad. I'm really scared.	F	45	2.5  years5oomg 2X D	10/25/2010Email
4	Epilepsy	At 500 2 x a day at first very tired, but otherwise ok. Recently neuro increased me to 1000mg x2 a day and I am NAUSEOUS!! my legs hurt, I cant even stand up for 3 minutes without pain. It has reduced my seizures quite a bit though.		F	40	90  days500 2X D	6/30/2010
1	Temporal Lobe Epilepsy	major personality changes, anger, depression, irrational thoughts.  I would constantly remember and rehash horrible events from 20 years ago.  Things that used to never bother me all of a sudden did.  I hurt my loved ones very badly while on keppra	I would not recommend Keppra to anyone.	M	44	1  years 2X D	5/2/2010Email
1	Seizure  Disorder	Irritability, insomnia, severe headaches, anxiety, tremors, fatigue.	Had only had 1 seizure ever (2 months ago) when neurologist prescribed this for me.  Side effects were horrible and effected every aspect of daily life.  I'm on lamictal right now and not doing so well either.  Was ok at 50mg, but as soon as I began 100mg daily, I began having severe nausea and fatigue.  Am miserable again, but hope side effects level off soon.	F	37	2  weeks500MG 2X D	4/21/2010

2	Partial complex seizures	Major insomnia - was getting maybe 4 hrs sleep per night, even when taking sleep aids.  Other effects were significant irritability, depression, SUICIDAL THOUGHTS (have never had those before - very strange...seemed like a reasonable course of action), fatigue, jittery, lack of energy, lack of mental focus.  Dizzyness - was diagnosed with BPPV, a form of vertigo - not sure if Keppra caused it, but it diminished as soon as I stopped.  Some weight gain.  Not sure how many of those symptoms were a direct effect from the drug or the insomnia.	Despite the side effects, it was effective in controlling my seizures.  I ramped down off of Keppra and within days had multiple seizures.  I have now switched to Depakote but haven't taken it long enough to judge.  I have to take something, so hoping one of them will work for me.	M	48	4  months250 mg 3X D	2/21/2010
1	Seizure	Started at 500mg 2x/day, then after 5 days went to 1500 mg/day, with scheduled increase. I was fine for the first week, then went to an unrelated doctor appt. While there, I got shaky and confused. Thinking slowed. Difficulty walking, needed wheelchair. Caused seizure like activity.  Speech became elongated , distorted, and slow. Speech became VERY slow, then could not move arms.  Tears for no reason(I mean HYSTERICAL!) Apologized all over for everything.  Started making odd noises and could not stop.  Started shaking all over.  They took me to the ER and I became very tired.  They kept hollering at me to keep my eyes open and talk to them. Might get exceptionally quiet/softspoken.  Doctors believed these were side effects of Keppra, not seizures.  They tried reducing the dose fom 1500 mg/day to 1000.  The next day I was in the ER again for the same symptoms, but also noticed my upper back ardhed backward.  After 3 trips to ER, they took me off  & switched me to another drug which	I didn't have much luck.  I did notice that someone said the generic can hit you differently than the brand name drug.  I took the one made by Torrent.	F	51	2  weeks500 mg 2X D	2/15/2010
4	Frequent seizures; then Grand Mal	I am constantly sleepy and several times a day I experience a brief feeling of utter melanchholy.  Everything seems dismal.  These feeling disappear in a matter of 30 to 60 seconds but are very disconcerting.	Keppra has completely stopped my seizures.  I take 500 mg. a day.  Was trying 250 a day, but started having mild seizures again, so am now trying 500 mg. timed-release once a day (at night).  I don't want to go on a different drug which may threaten my liver health.

3	partial complex epilepsy of the tem	When I first started taking Keppra, I recall having dry mouth symptoms. Later, I started detecting an allergic reaction to what might have been the fillers used in Keppra.  I complained to the drug manufacturer a few times.  Whether it was the quality control department or the pharmacies that got down to the problem I don't know but I stopped getting sinus inflammation or an upset stomach.  When this was going on it wasn't every time I got a prescription refill that I had those symtpoms. It was happening every now and then. I was told that the fillers used in Keppra were not always the same ones. The problem got fixed along the way and this was the brand Keppra not the generic.Recently, I am now on the generic but I have to give it time.  It seems that I might be having a reaction to my amalgam-silver fillings and a gold crown molar tooth.  I have dental expenses to take care of before saying it is a side-effect of the generic brand.  I plan on removing amalgam fillings and getting	When I first started taking keppra, I had a sharper focus on studying.  Additionally, I felt more alert and energetic. Over the years, the heightened energy wore off.  I continued to take Keppra because it helps me feel more balanced.  Additionally, it does not cause fatigue or sleepiness like other anti-convulsants.  I do not want to take a supplement with Keppra because I don't want to encounter adverse side effects from other meds that could have more serious consequences.  Keppra is regarded as to be low risk for kidney problems.  I experienced no aggressive behavior on this drug.As for seizures, I was told at the beginning keppra alone is not going to stop seizures. I was diagnosed with an underlying seizure of the temporal lobe of the brain at that time. Additionally, I was diagnosed positive for meniere's disease before I started keppra. I had several meniere's episode before taking keppra. Later I was told that in my case meniere's episodes were likely to be part of the epilepsy condition rather than an independent disorder.  I agree with this because I get over the meniere's episodes in a shorter time than people with true meniere's disease.I continued keppra because it made me feel balanced. Over timeseizures which only happened in my sleep became more graphic but the frequency of seizures was the same (occasional). No pattern was evident and I do not relate this to keppra because the causation is the environment.  Keppra did not increase frequency of seizur	F	57	8  years	11/5/2009
5	Epilepsy (GrandMal)	Minimal. Nothing I didn't already experience on other medications thus possibly eliminating them as actual side effects of Keppra.	This one's been a godsend for me. I failed Dilantin (aggression), Neurontin (made seizures worse), Tegretol (ineffectiveness after 5 years despite increase in dosage along with interactions with other new meds I had to take) and Topamax (I flipped out on this after the first, lowest dose. 6 hour panic attack). My neurologist was initially hesitant to put me on this because I did fit the general profile of those who tend to be affected by the aggression side effects of Keppra... but this has never happened to me. I no longer have to deal with the brain fog side effects common to anticonvulsants, and that alone makes this one a dream. Seems to be very effective in monotherapy for controlling my seizures despite this not being explicitly approved for such. Have not had any seizure attacks requiring hospitalization to break them since starting Keppra.	M	30	3  years	8/7/2009
4	Cavernoma & Craniotomy	Rage, Extreme anger issues (broke someones car windshield for making me angry) had no previous criminal record, need a daily nap in the middle of the day, hair loss, dry feet, Generic Keppra does NOT WORK! This drug caused me major weight gain of 100 pounds in 6 years.	I am on 3,000 (yes three thousand) mg of Keppra and still having breakthrough seizures.

Am no where near as tired as I used to be, and am glad that I don't have to go take tests to see if my liver is doing okay. The only things I don't like about it, is I do feel more irratible around people (especially at work), and I think it may make my sinus very dry. All together better than depakote though.

Keppra clearly has enabled him to walk better and stay awake better during the day, and he's been happy with it. (I actually wrote to the company that manufacturers Keppra to thank them because we have been so grateful that he is off Dilantin.) No more seizures till 2008, after which Keppra dosage increased from 1000 to 1500mg/day. Now has more sleepiness, muscles not as strong.  No mood issues, but he takes Zoloft concurrently.

4	posttraumatic epilepsy	I started taking Keppra immediately after having a craniotomy, so a lot of what I've now found out are side effects I initially attributed to the surgery.  It makes me retain water like you wouldn't believe - goodbye chin!  I'm also pretty slow to think when I take it.	Optimizing my dosage has really helped with the side effects, but I'm going to give it a few weeks to find out if it's enough to keep me from having seizures.	F	26	6  months	10/2/2008Email

I presented a very sexy and I am available and looking demeanor and anyone who responded, got what they were looking for.  I had no control and did not see anything wrong with what I was doing until well after I was off the drug.  I stiil try to justify everything I did (in my mind) but know I really did do all of those horrible things and hurt my wonderful and loving husband so terribly much.  It made me become very promiscuous, I went from extreemly shy to very bold, constantly demanding attention, especially sexual attention.  It ruined my marriage and has left me devistated, even though I am off of it and no longer have any remaining ill effects.

5	Brain biopsy induced seizures	First couple weeks were rough...very angry and tired. The "rage" has passed. Still a little sleepy during the day from time to time. My nightly dose helps me sleep great!! After trying 3 other seizure meds ...Keppra is the only one that I don't have any bad reactions to.	Keppra is highly expensive but very much worth every dollar. It has helped me so much by controlling the seizures. Immediately after I take it I feel better and well protected. I love it and would recommend it to anyone.	F	34	8  months	8/8/2008
5	surgery-induced partial simple seiz	Reduced appetite - I can't eat enough at meals and am starving a few hours later.  Some slur in speech, though I can't be sure it's due to the drug.		F	26	5  months	7/29/2008Email
5	Epilepsy	memory loss, fatigue, sun sensitivity (easily sunburned), heat intolerance,	I am on 1000mg twice a day of Keppra and 100 mg twice a day of Lamictal. I had been on a really high dosage of Lamictal, but it wasn't helping, so we added the Keppra, which has completely stopped my seizures. (Complex partial and simple partial TLE, first seizure 1.5 years ago). I would like to be completely off the Lamictal, but my doctor doesn't want to stop it completely, sigh...Some of these side effects MAY be from Lamictal, but I've tried to narrow them down.	F	30	1  years	7/21/2008
2	Epilepsy	VERY short fuse, lots of rage over little things and towards loved ones.	After a couple months became more and more filled with rage and anger.  Got to the point where I didn't care about anything or hurting anyone.  Another couple months and I would have been divorced.	M	37	8  months	7/21/2008
2	seizures	Insomnia.  Fatigue.  Weakness.  Cannot recall words -- will be stopped in mid-sentence not able to come up with the word I want/need. Generally feel unwell.	Have not had any further seizures -- so it does work BUT there are side-effects.	M	85	1  years	7/17/2008
3	Complex partial seizures	I am experiencing lower and upper back, neck and hip pain.  It is especially difficult to straighten up and bend down in the morning.  It started when I began taking Keppra, so that seems to be the problem.	I am much clearer than I have been in a long time.  I must have been having small CPS's for a long time before I had one that required a trip in an ambulance to the emergency room when I was found confused, wandering around my neighborhood with one shoe on.	F	56	1  months	7/4/2008Email
5	Epilepsy - complex partial seizures	The only side effects I expereinced were in the first two weeks I started to take the drug. I felt very irritated, angry, and like I was constantly looking for an argument. This was very ususual for me and I disliked the side effects so much that I asked to stop taking Keppra. But the doctor asked me to hang in there for another two weeks and changed my dosage so now I take the bigger dose at night (250mg AM/1000mg PM.) The side effects stopped completely after that and I haven't had any since.	My seizures are finally under control, at last in my 30s.  I take this in combination with Lamictal, and as long as I take them both on time I have no seizures, even when I suffer from extreme stress, sleep deprivation, or other former triggers. Two thumbs up from me, it works!	F	33	2  years	6/9/2008
1	temporal lobe epilepsy	Lower lip became strangly numb, then tingled, certain fingers went also went numb and then tingled constantly. And no, I did not chew the pill and smear it on my lips and fingers. Frightening dreams, disturbed sleep. Had odd seizures, almost paralyzed and aware. The numbness and tingling went on for at least two months after stopping the drug.	I took this in conjunction with Dilantin, which I had already been taking for several years before. Doctor vomited out drug rep/seminar teachings of no syptoms reported for KEPRA was very very aggressive about this drug and my questions, I feel there are incentives for physicians when I see them pimp a drug and lie about side effects. Not the first time, oh well.	F	45	1  months	4/11/2008Email

1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication.

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011

2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out!

Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
