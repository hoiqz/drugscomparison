5	Depression, IBS, Insomnia, Pain	None	Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS; CFIDS; M.E.): Trimipramine and sleep and pain relief I have found trimipramine to be very good at helping me sleep and as a result of this has helped with pain relief. I have tried other antidepressants but had bad side effects. As part of my CFS/ME/ I also have IBS-D I have found the side effect of constipation has meant that I have better bowel control. I take 250 mg at night along with zolpidem which gets me off to sleep and it is the trimipramine that keeps me asleep. I have lots of anxiety with my IBS-D but trimipraime helps with this. I came off trimipramine for a week and my bowel was really bad it was not until i went back on the trimipramine that I realised what a difference it it makes to my life. I would recommend this drug to any one with ME/CFS and IBS-D.	M	47	3  months250 1X D	6/3/2013Email

5	insomnia	No additional side effects. It makes me less drowsy than elavil with none of the anxiety Lunesta caused	Hsd to increase the dose to 50mg. That seems to be working well	M	51	 50 1X D	3/15/2011EmailHistory
5	Insomnia/slight depression	Slight constipation. Slight weight gain, (3 pounds ) consistent with tricyclic antidepressants.	A fabulous medication, for me, that was discontinued many months ago because the manufacturer sold to another company. I have now found it though, in Canada!!! :) Cheap, too. I take the generic. 50 mg. at night with 22 mg. Chlorazapate  for sleep and I have been on this perfect night time cocktail for 21 years. My insomnia was very bad. ( that pesky divorce! ) The 50mg. really stopped the tears and the sadness of the slight depression. It is not a theraputic dose for depression but it sure help me, in that category.The two medications I tried, before finding Surmontil in Canada, were Trazadone, then Nortriptyline. Traz., wiped me out and after 3 months, switched to Nortriptyline and compared to Traz., that was great, but then all those horrible side effects including never tasting food, etc. became too much and after three months of it,  I went online looking for Surmontil and Eureka!!! Canada. With your Dr's., prescription.This medication has been around for 30 years and has a great safety record. And I am sleeping soundly, like a baby, for 7 to 8 hours every night. Feel great all day long. Happy person, again..lol. A good night's sleep makes all the difference in how your world looks the next day.Thank you.	F	65	21  years	12/18/2009
1	Anxiety because of Tinnitus	Worsened Tinnitus, new Tinnitus sounds, hearing loss		M	38	28  days	7/2/2009
4	Fibromyalgia: help with sleep, pain	Dry eyes, mouth, hands. Eye-drops, drinking more water, and nightly application of lotion to hands mostly solves these problems. I've also experienced slight acid reflux at doses over 25mg/night. But a nightly Tums seems to have solved this problem. The side effects were intolerable for me at over ~25mg/night, but at ~20mg/night they're manageable, and I currently plan on staying on it indefinitely.	I'm overall pretty pleased with Surmontil. I've been taking it for ~40 days now, at a relatively low dose of 20mg/night. I'm taking it for poor sleep and for widespread body pain. It's effective on both these fronts, but more so with sleep. It also has helped tremendously with my social anxiety (it literally almost goes away). I was worried that it would impair sexual function, but contrary to others' experiences, it strangely increases it for me.	M	30	40  days	4/2/2008
5	All things considered it works	In the beginning I had a very dry mouth. Some drowsiness expescially when raised to 300 mg.It was like magic 150,200 and even 250 didn't work but after 3 weeks at 300 mg the birds sang and the sun came out. I have been taking this medication for 22 years!	At this time I take 100 mg of surmontil with 40 mg of prozac. Also 1000mg of Depekote. Things are mostly good.	M	54	22  days	5/25/2006Email
3	anxiety caused by tinnitus	I was only prescribed 25ml per day.  I noticed after about 2 months that my muscles in my legs and arms became quite stiff	I was told that surmontil is quite successful in helping peoplewith tinnitus.  It did not reduce it but it helps with sleep.	F	41	6  months	7/7/2004
4	anxiety	Very tired at first, but gradually tapered off.  Hand tremors & rapid heart rate which as of yet, has not decreased.		F	39	3  weeks	4/22/2004
