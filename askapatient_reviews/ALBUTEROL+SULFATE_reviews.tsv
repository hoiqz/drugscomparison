5	Asthma	Extreme jittery-ness, shaking, irritability	Despite the side effects, I am pro-albuterol.  It has saved my life on numerous occasions. I take both the inhaler and the nebulizer solution.	F	48	10  years2.5 mg 4X D	10/25/2011Email
2	Albuterol Sulfate Inhaler - TEVA	RED REPLACEMENT MINI LOOKING inhaler. Replacing the old ones. did not stop asthma attack in progress. Wasteful priming of the inhaler before use, after taste.	Red inhaler made by Teva. Did not seem to stop the attack without excess use. It tells you to prime the inhaler before use which wastes doses. Left a gross after taste. Half the size of the other inhalers with a double the price tag on it. Not impressed. Helps some.	F	35	2  years	4/17/2009
1	Asthma	I now take ProAir HFA, since the old generic albuterol is no longer available.  No side effects, but I fear death because the ProAir HFA just DOES NOT WORK to stop an asthma attack.	I used generic albuterol for over 10 years as needed for asthma attacks.  The old albuterol WORKED great, but the FDA & EPA had a problem with the propellant in it, so now we have ProAir, which costs more, but does not work.  Instead of 2-4 puffs during an attack, I have to take 8-10 puffs of ProAir.  I don't know if they have changed the drug or just the propellant, but as it is today, the ProAir is a waste of money.

I discontinued the Albuterol Sulfate. She started to get better. Two days later I took her to the doctor for a checkup. The doctor insisted with the prescription.She is having a bad cough again. It is non-stop!		F	2	4  days	12/13/2008
