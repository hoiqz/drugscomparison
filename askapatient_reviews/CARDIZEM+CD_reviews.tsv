3	hbp and 1st time a-fib	Warm flushing feeling in chest, slight dizziness, slight lightheadness, heart thumping, tiredness. Told doctor bout symptoms he told me to take every other day. Gone give it another week to see how it controls my blood pressure.		F	34	4  days120mg	10/3/2012Email
1	atrial fibrillation, high blood pre	severe depression and suicidal thoughts, lack of energy or desire to do anything, constipation	This medicine is used to treat bipolar disorder, to even out moods, even though it's not approved for this. So for me, who is not bipolar, it made me a couch potato with depression and thinking of ways to end my life. I stopped dancing and socializing and had zero creativity.I was offered another calcium channel blocker but research showed the same side effects for that one. What next? This is the second BP drug to do this to me. I am normally very high energy and active and creative. I stopped the drugs and returned to normal in one or two days.	F	64	25  days120mg 1X D	6/26/2012
2	Inappropriate sinus tachycardia	Since I've started taking the medicine I've had a terrible headache that will not go away, its joined with worse chest pain than I had in the beginning, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, concussion, insomnia, and extreme fatigue.		F	20	6  days	1/11/2012Email
4	To help control Blood pressure	Slight light headness once in awhile. Slight racing heart once in a while. Short term headache once in a while. Slight tightness in esophagus once or twice.		F	61	3  weeks120 mg	1/8/2012
2	a-fib	IBS returned (diarrhea, minor incontinence); urinary tract pain with frequency (PL 4).	First maintenance drug prescribed after diagnosis, I guess to control rate.  It may have reduced rate slightly but seemed to reduce BP too much.  Subsequent opinions question this choice and I've tried a couple of other meds but I'm skeptical about all of them.	M	67	5  days240 MG 1X D	8/6/2011
5	High B/P	None	Two and a half years ago I had to go on long term steroids (2 yrs) and for the first time in my life I developed high B/P after 3 months.  I was put on Norvasc at that time and it controlled my pressure very well until 3 months ago.  My Dr. changed me over to Diltiazem CD (generic) and it's working fine.....no side effects, no problems.

M	57	9  days180 1X D	12/21/2010Email
4	Esophageal and LES spasms	First two days I was extremely fatigued, tired, slept for more than 16 hrs in one day, consistent headache, out of breath, hungry, and just out of it. Since the 3rd day I have been very energized, accelerated heart beat and chest fluttering, hunger loss, a bit nauseous, weightloss, headache. VERY vivid dreams and acid reflux.	I have very low blood pressure, I was nervous about trying this medicine but it has helped so far, probably going to get a higher dose because my pain is still bad.	F	22	4  days120mg 1X D	12/19/2010
5	atrial fibrilation	I get a fluttering (atrial fibrilation) on occasion. I don't think I would ever want to get off this medication. Some times the ''fluttering'' isn't bad at all. I would say that this only happens for me, about once a week, or (LESS.) Hope this helps anyone out there. I'm listening.Jane	Nothing much else to say, except it has helped me a LOT!

1	Rapid Heartbeat	HOSPITALIZATION FROM FROM VERY SEVERE DIZZINESS,TROUBLE BREATHING,VERY LOW RESPIRATION,KIDNEY FAILURE	THIS MEDICATION SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET.	F	56	2  years360 MG 1X D	11/6/2010Email
5	chest tightness under stress	Since this drug can lower your blood pressure sometimes I feel fatigued.	Helped with the chest tightness tremendously. I can still get a little of it when I have a panic attack which isn't very often (3X/year)	F	49	2  years60 mg 1X D	8/26/2010
3	SVTs	I read about the side effect of having nightmares . I have only had dreams - some good , some bad . I never had dreams before taking this med .		M	67	4  months240 1X D	8/25/2010
3	A-fib	Have had swelling of hands and feet - even up in to calf and shin of (L) leg.  Makes you feel miseralbe to be that swollen!Going to give it one more week and then calling doctor to see if he can suggest something else.	Go	F	58	3  weeks180mg 1X D	8/9/2010
5	palpitations, high blood pressure	Slight headache first 2 days, some constipation but manageable.	Great drug! stopped all heart palpitations, and lowered bp to normal, feel relaxed and well!	F	64	5  weeks240 1X D	7/8/2010
4	Atrial Fib	I have pretty severe fluid retention in my feet. Started to have very vivid nightmares, almost every night.	Heart Specialist had me on Amiodarone which really had bad side effects, such as enlarging breasts, Very Bad Vivid Nightmares every night. Finally took me off this medicine and started the Cardizem which controls the Atrial Fib much better. Increased dosage from (2) 120 mg capsules to (2) 180 Mg Capsules each day.	M	63	2  years180 2X D	4/16/2010
3	Atrial Fib	I was hospitalized and put on Tikosyn for Atrial Fib. The physician was concerned that my pulse rate was in the 130-140 range so decided to add Cardizem. I didn't start on it until after I got home and then the depression/fatigue set in BIG time! I've seen other comments here about" feeling out of it." Yes, apathy about covers it for me.		F	59	30  days120mg 1X D	4/7/2010Email
3	Arrythmia	Reflux.  Lump in throat.  ENT had to put me on Prilosec because of what the reflux is doing to my vocal chords.	Cardiac doc says it's not the Cardizem.  That's crap.  When I skip a dose, I have good days.  When I take it, I have reflux days.  Cardiac doc won't take me off this stuff because it's working for the a-fib.	F	48	4  months	12/17/2009
2	Isolated Systolic HBP	Headache, depression, confused thinking, palpitations, lethargy	It was effective for two days, then ISO BP returned to pre-med level. Now only have side-effects without effect, but this has been the case for every med tried so far. However, this is the first med for which I have had side-effects.	M	67	14  days	12/14/2009
4	high blood pressure	Dose has been gradually increased over last 12 months to now 360mg which I have been taking for 4 days. Have tingling in the lower arms  constantly and was wondering if this is another side effect.  It has really slowed me down but bp alot lower.		F	56	15  months	10/24/2009
2	Migraine headaches	Started feeling very depressed.		F	36	3  days	10/18/2009
1	Prescibed by Doctor	Tightness in chest. Some slight swelling in throat and gums.Some nausea. Light headed. Breathlessness.		M	65	7  days	9/27/2009
3	high blood pressure	constant yawning and fatigue for about a week then went away.	Took almost a year before my blood pressure went low enough.Before I was put on medicine my blod pressure suddenly shot up to 200/143.I am only 110 lbs so this was very high.	F	40	15  months	9/20/2009
4	A-fib/A-flutter	180mg daily. First 3 weeks or so felt woozy, sleepy, tired, lightheaded, nauseaus, the works, even though I was taking it at night.  About the 4th week I felt better and now I have very few side-effects, even the constipation has eased.	So far it is working for the A-fib and A-flutter.	F	55	8  weeks	9/6/2009
4	Atrial fibrillation	None really.  I take at night. I get a little drowsy, but that's not a bad thing.  I get a good night sleep.	Still working on the dosage, but for the most part, the heart flutters and afib are under control.	F	48	1  months	8/2/2009Email
4	atrial fibrillation	experienced tiredness when I first starting taking this. Constipation problems but use over the counter remedy for this.	Didn't completely eliminate a-fib episodes but greatly reduced severity. Seems like mild side effects and low risk compared to the sotalol that Doc now wants to put me on.	M	59	10  years	5/13/2009
5	FSGS	Not aware of any. On a daily dose of180mg.	Take it conjunction with tritace ,micardis and a diuretic. At the start of treatment my scarred kidneu filters were leaking 3 grams of protein a day 150 mg a day is the baseline. After 6 momths my protein loss has dropped to 750mg a day.  I am not saying this drug has no side effects just that the other drugs I am on ,prednisone and methotrexate, may well be masking them. It certainly is controlling my kidney problem.	M	59	6  months	4/5/2009
2	SVT	dizziness, nausea, weakness, lethargy, sleepiness, severe depression, more frequent anxiety attacks, weird dreams that were vivid and bizarre	the cardizem helped keep my massive attacks from happening [the episodes that i have largely lead to me nearly passing out], but i felt like i was having a lot more mini-attacks. i began to have attacks even in the shower/bed. i'm thinking they were more anxiety attacks, but i'm not 100% sure. the cardizem also took my stress and anxiety and exacerbated it to the point that i got full-blown depression. the depression got so bad that i was having suicidal thoughts, and my college counselors intervened. also, the bizarre dreams i had were laughable on occasion, but sometimes they were absolutely terrifying, especially because they felt so real; they were so vivid. while on the medicine, i had many bouts of nausea, and i was always tired. i also have almost no energy, and just walking to class makes me out of breath. i should be in decent shape as i am on the college's dance team, so this made me worry.i'm coming off of cardizem now because the side effects weren't worth it, really. t	F	19	2  months	3/14/2009
2	rapid heart rate and HBP	Rapid heart rate, Pounding heart in chest, head ache lots of palpatations and lots of fatigue.	My heart doctor switched my medicine from Metoprolol 50 mg 2x daily to cardizem cd 120 mg 1x day.  From the start it didn't work for my heart rate.  After a week my blood pressure did ok but my pulse rate was very high, and where from 95 to 170 bpm.  The doctor raised my does to 180mg 1x daily and it got worse.  My palpatations and rapid heart rate was continuale, and couldn't do anything.  I will never take this med again.	F	28	10  days	3/5/2009
2	hbp	my tongue became very irritated and i had taste disturbances, also felt dizzy and out of it. didn't work well to lower blood pressure	took for 2 months and will try atenolol next. have nearly tried them all and having a hard time finding one I can tolerate	F	62	 	2/27/2009Email
2	High Blood Pressure	Weight gain, swollen hands and feet.  Can't walk a block without becoming winded.		F	55	4  days	2/12/2009
2	SVT	Depression, uncontrolable crying, fatigue, temors, agitation.		F	41	4  days	2/11/2009
2	HPB	It's just starting to take full effect, since I began taking it two weeks ago. I am tired, sometimes dizzy, and I am going through bouts of depression.	I was on this med about two years ago, but can't remember why I was taken of of it. It was replaced by Toprol XL, which was far worse than the Cardizem. Toprol XL was  making me so week that I could hardly walk from room to room. I may be patient with this Cardizem for a bvrief period of time, but if I continue to be so tired, I will ask about a lower dosage.	F	70	2  weeks	11/13/2008
2	High Blood Pressure	Irregular heartbeat, waves of feeling like my heart was racing.	Had to wear a Holter monitor for 24 hours to see why the sudden race in heartbeat.  Don't know yet if the doctor will change to a different medication, or if he thinks it will subside with time.  I have an appointment in two days to discuss with him.	M	61	6  weeks	11/1/2008
3	Hypertension	Weird, tingly feeling in face, Sadness, mild depression (never was diagnosed with depression before) which feels physical and notpsychological, take in am, BP under control		F	65	8  days	9/18/2007
4	High blood pressure/Tachycardia	With Crdizem i'm having some bad dreams,not sleeping well,gas,headaches,they went away after a while.I feel whoozy,don't feel like my self.I pee alot,drink,dry mouth, i think this is the best med. i ever been on so far. I do have leg cramps.I eat alot. I'm tired complaining cuz all meds have bad side effects. I thank God I'm alive with my babies.	I could have went years & years with high blood pressure and die. I mean we complain about medicines but also we need help. We can't have it both ways. All meds. have side effects. We can post things on here to help each other figure out where different pain and other things that's going on with our bodies while on the medications so we don't have to keep running to the doc. every week trying to figure out where this or that coming from. Post your pain or bad experience. i know i would love to hear and read about them. This is a good drug. Just remember to eat bananas and take a vitamin every other day.Also i'm on metoprolol as well.	M	23	1  months	9/8/2007
4	ARRYTHMIA	SOMETIMES DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING BUT I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS RELATED... ASIDE FROM THAT NOTHING ELSE	IT HAS HELPED MY ARRYTHMIA ALTHOUG SOMETIMES IT RECURS... I FOUND IT BETTER TO TAKE IT BEFORE GOING TO BED BECAUSE DURING THE DAY AS I TAKE IT WUITH LISINOPRIL FOR HBP  MADE ME SLEEPY	M	66	3  years	7/20/2007
3	High BP	Weird/nervous feeling when trying to go to sleep, have to be exhausted. Greater fatigue than normal in the afternoon. Anxiousness.	Have stopped taking for several days and the effects wear off.	M	40	7  months	7/5/2007
5	Atrial Flutter, Atrial Fibrilation	Constipation, but don't really know if it's related.  That's about it!	I hated Toprol, which I've been taking now for over a year, so my doctor switched me to Cardizem.  So far, it's lowered my blood pressure, practically eliminated the pain in my heart, I don't feel so fatigued anymore and the fluttering in my heart has stopped.  I actually feel normal again.  Also, I've been sleeping GREAT at night (I take it at bedtime).  I've only been taking it a week, but I think it's working great for me!	F	49	1  weeks	7/3/2007
4	tachycardia/palpitations	Swelling of my feet for the first 4 days of taking the medication (I couldn't wear anything but loose sandals), and hot flashes/sweating that resulted in low potassium levels when going off of the medicine.  I also had a lot of fatigue going off of the medicine before my procedure, but this may have been my fast heart rate returning that was making me tired.	I had a lot more energy and less side effects on Cardizem versus Toprol XL, but decided that ablation is a better treatment for me because of my age.  And at 22, the hot flashes sucked!!	F	22	13  months	5/23/2007
1	Atrial Fibrilation	It made my very depressed and very greatly decreased my ability to think. I am back in school and I went from an A student to an F student in a few weeks, then the depression set in. I wasn't able to figure out the problem for 4 months, and the doctors never even asked about side effects.		M	58	4  months	3/25/2007
4	a fib	Mild, persistent headache during the first few weeks.  Skin became more sensitive, skin itching.  Constipation.	Toprol for two years brought about problems and my doctor replaced it with Cardizem.  I found myself with more pep, less fatigue.	M	76	25  days	2/20/2007Email
2	High blood pressure	Tickle in the throat leading to a lot of coughing - especially if I didn't drink enough water. Almost 100% improved when I began taking it in the morning, then I'm OK by bedtime.	Blood pressure still not fully controlled. One day it is 117/80 the next it is 140/100 I've even cut way down on salt intake but it continues to fluctuate. Any ideas out there?	M	54	3  months	12/19/2006Email
4	atrial flutter, arthrimiya	At first deeper tiredness, loss of wind but is much better as long as I exercise and eat well. I had great difficulty with my heart rate so this drug has kept my pacemaker from going off. I take a mild dose of 180cd. I take a few other meds so I am not sure as to the negative side effects.	Found it benefical to take at supper time so the effects are not noticable so much during the day. I believe it takes practice to know the best time to take a medicine with the least side effects. Blood pressure is fairly well under control.	F	52	3  years	11/12/2006Email
4	HBP	faster heartbeat.	I had taken atenolol for 10 years and it stopped working, so my doctor prescribed cardizem.  It took 4-5 months for my body to get used to changing the med.  It works okay now, but only if I continue to eat right, exercise and not get stressed.	F	52	14  months	11/11/2006
4	Arythmias	Fatigue, light headed, vivid dreams		M	55	2  years	11/4/2006
4	heart arrythmias, spasms	Worst side effects are severe flushing and dry skin.  A little bit more fatigued.  A bit of depression I think from this.	Much better than Toprol, had terrible side effects. What really helps also is learning to do deep breathing exercises, they help to regulate heart beat and lots of milk which also helps heartbeat.  Not putting myself under heavy stress anymore.  Heart is much better after one year of meds and therapy.	F	50	1  years	10/29/2006
3	sinus tachycardia, angina	mild fatigue, bloating, insomnia, itching, anxiety and mood changes	this med has less side effects than others i have tried, less fatigue, and more moderate control of heart rate	F	23	2  weeks	9/7/2006
4	HBP	Took almost a year to get over the very bothersome side effects--anxiety, headache, itchiness.  Am sensitive to fillers in drugs so it was difficult to find this one. Did control the blood pressure at 240 mg twice a day	Anyone out there?  The doctor prescribed 2 CDs a day. Is this safe?.  Am I compounding the release factor?  My ears start really ringing after the second pill.	F	66	1.5  years	4/28/2006
2	chest pain	very light headness almost panicy and jumpy, accelerated heart rate,blood pressure lowered but pulse higher.		M	62	14  days	4/19/2006Email
3	HTN, Aortic insufficency	Lightheaded, weak - but this is all on the first day.  Hoping these inmprove.  Also feel somewhat "out of it".	Switched to this because the toporol XL was causing such lightheadedness - even though it did control my htn well.  Hoping this will do the same with the LH.  I'll give it a week.	M	45	1  days	2/16/2006Email
3	Hypertension and palpitations	fast heart rates, disorientation, feeling "out of it"	I was put on Toprol-xl two years ago for my hypertention and palps.  It helped, but caused me to have asthma symptoms so i discontinued the toprol and started taking 240 mgs of cardizem cd a day.  The pain i used to have in my chest is gone now but my blood pressure is still kinda high and ive been having fast heart rates.  But overall, i feel better on the cardizem then i did on the beta blockers (toprol).	F	22	5  days	2/9/2006Email
2	high blood pressure	excessive coughing.....fast heart beating.	does this drug contain seldane?	F	62	 	12/25/2005
2	Hypertension	I'm fine as long as I don't exert myself. When I walk more than a hundred feet the fatigue hits me hard. Have to sit down. BP is down nicely.	Will ask my doctor to change drugs.	M	56	7  days	11/30/2005
4	coronary artery spasms	Depression, uncontrollable crying. Shortness of breath. Difficulty sleeping. Very strange physical symptoms during sleep having to sit up during sleep to stop the symptoms.	Worked great to ease up the coronary artery spasms and subsequent radiating chest pain.	F	39	15  days	10/7/2005
4	ischaemic heart disease	slight headache for a couple days, increased urination, difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.	Had breathing difficulties, fatigue and Raynaud's syndrome on Noten.  These went away as soon as it was replaced with Cardizem.  I have increased energy, and the minor side effects I'm dealing with are preferrable to the one's I had on Noten.	F	50	7  days	10/5/2005
1	high pressure	Severe chest pains. Had to pull over and stop driving.		M	60	2  days	7/15/2005
3	rapid heart beat and chest pains	hives and rash, intense itching on body trunk, coughing spells	Lowered heart rate but blood pressure elevated	F	67	14  months	4/14/2005

3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

1	deppression	shaking twitching over emotional		F	23	60  days30 1X D	11/3/2011
5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.	F	12	10  months10mg 2X D	10/1/2011Email
1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.	M	47	1  years10 mg 1X D	9/21/2011
1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email
1	depression/anxiety	severe muscle weakness, tremors that have yet to stop 2 months in, not sleeping, pacing		M	44	5  days5mg 1X D	9/19/2011
1	depression and anxiety	I had terrible side effects to abilify, my reflex started getting slow and slow, i could not move fast, i started acting slow, had difficulty driving and working. My doctor said i was having parkison like symptons, so i stopped and now i am back to normal.		F	39	6  months10 mg 1X D	9/18/2011Email
1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011
5	bipolar	i love this pill it has been so good for me no more mania and just finally feel normal again...life was grim before this med!!!!		F	33	2  months20mg 1X D	8/23/2011
2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

1	Bipolar II	Permanent muscle twitching, rapid weight loss, inability to function much less concentrate or sleep.	I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify. Within a week I started hving uncontrollable facial twitches and my neck was turning on its own. It has been 2 years since I hae stopped taking it and the facial twitches are still present. Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression. Free of depression for the first time in my life. And no agitation (manic).	F	54	3  years10 MG 1X D	6/11/2011Email
5	depression, paranoia, anxious, angr	hungry......otherwise I feel like a real person for the first time in YEARS!!!	I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
