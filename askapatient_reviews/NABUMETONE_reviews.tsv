1	ankle pain	burning in the stomach	this medicine made my stomach burn like fire.  i took about 6 days straight and then stopped taking it becuase the stomach pain hurt so much.  Also it gave me a very very heavy period with large clots and large amount of blood loss.  Side effects definatley not worth it, id rather keep the ankle pain!!!!	F	25	6  days	10/4/2007
