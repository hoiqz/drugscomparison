				F M	 	 	    
1	Strep Throat	Severe Palpitations with Abnormal Heart Rhythm (AFIB) started an hour after taking the second dose. stayed on for 24 hours (the half life of the drug) until the concentration in the blood was low enough; heart started beating normally. spent over $6000 in hospital fees for those 24 hours.	Garbage.. stay away from it.	M	31	2  days 1X D	5/12/2010
1	respiratory/bronchial infection	severe nausea, vomiting, severe headache, blurred vision, dizziness, delayed yeast infection	A couple of hours after taking just one dose, it made me feel worse than I was already feeling.  I also broke out in a severe skin yeast infection after taking it- totally miserable- imagine feeling like you have millions of microscopic bugs crawling all over you!!!  It seems to have affected my immune system.  It has been a couple of years now since taking it and now I suffer from chronic yeast infections anytime I take any antibiotic- even antibiotic ointment!

1	sinus infection	None except the anxiety about possible compromised liver function.	Ketek cured my sinus infection but other meds probably would have done the same thing without the dangers.  My Doc is too free with the samples from the Pharm. Cos. I was not a happy patient and let him know not to do that again.	M	66	5  days	10/3/2007
4	Throat and respiratory infection	None. Didn't notice any side effects.	It cured my throat infection and seems to have helped my respiratory infection - doesn't hurt anymore - but I'm still coughing quite a bit and producing lots of phlegm. I'm going to my doctor to see if I should try something else now.	F	39	5  days	8/29/2007
1	bronchitis, sinusitis	severe abdominal pain, painful urination, flushing, headache, blurred vision, double vision, insomnia	This stuff did absolutely nothing for my sinusitis or bronchitis two years ago. It is no longer approved for these conditions due to people dying from liver failure, and should never have been approved for any condition by the FDA who knew its safety studies were compromised by fraudulent data.	F	34	2  days	8/26/2007
1	bronchitis	tingling / numbness in hands & arms		F	33	2  days	6/22/2007
