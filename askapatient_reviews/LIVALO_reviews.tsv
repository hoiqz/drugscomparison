1	Very High Cholesterol (generic)	Severe leg pain, general malaise throughout body.	For the first 2 wks I didn't notice any reaction then all of a sudden I had worse pain in my legs than when I first got fibromyalgia (which I've had mostly under control with meds for 9 out of the past 12 yrs). The pain radiated up & down both legs and my whole body felt weak. Nothing helped.  Basically it doesn't matter if it helps lower my levels as I can't live like this.  I have tried several statins and so far Lipitor has had the least side-affects for me.	F	52	2  weeks4mg 1X D	3/24/2013

4	Low good; High bad cholesterol	Constipation, dry eyes	Was taking simvastatin for 2 1/2 years and had to change due to muscle and joint pain. After taking Livalo for 3 months my numbers remain good as with the previous medication. The constipation has required an additional medication.	M	60	4  months4 mg 4X W	8/6/2012Email

1	Low good and high bad cholesterol	Ugh!  Already the hair loss, dry eyes and dry skin has begun.  No doubt I will lose my memory too like I did on the other stain.  I hate statins!		F	52	2  weeks2mg 1X D	7/25/2011Email
2	cholesterol	Ar first I had no side effects that I could point to. However, over the weeks I began to experience muscle pain and weakness. I thought most were due to working out at the gym until I got busy at work and couldn't go for a week. My muscle weakness and pain continued to get worse - without going to the gym. Around week 6 my arms felt very heavy and weak. I also felt very fatigued and a general felling of malaise. My doctor stopped my meds and the pains and weakness are slowely going away. Woke up this morning and actually felt like getting out of bed for the first time in weeks.	I think that I have tried every statin drug made. I was told that Livalo would not give me the muscle pain and weakness that I had with other statins. I had side effects from Livalo MUCH faster and more severe than with any other cholesterol drug.
