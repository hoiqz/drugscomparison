2	ADHD Anxiety	It seemed to be helping his ADHD as he could not take stimulants due to "seizure" type reaction. Tenex caused really bad night terrors that he would not remember the next day. We correlated the meds to the sleep disturbance. During the night terrors he would not recognize me and he saw people that were not there. He has never even had dreams prior to this. He is almost 8 yrs old.	Keep a sleep journal.	M	7	2  weekshalf tab 2X D	7/25/2012Email
3	Rocking, Pdd	My daughter has the same rocking in the car. She is also age 8. Guanfacine actually increased aggression after we increased it from .5 to 1 mg. she had rages. We now dx it and she seems happier.	Seemed to do better on .5 than 1mg for an 8 year old.	F	8	3  years1 mg 2X D	7/14/2012

4	ADHD/Anxiety	this drug makes you very tired at first and emotional. STICK WITH IT! These side effects lessen after about 2 weeks. Eventually, you may still need more sleep, but you won't feel as tired as the first couple of weeks.	Works great for both my boys to help control hyperactivity and impulsivity. Does not work as well for attention.  My son also takes Strattera to help with focus or attention.  Has helped also control any tics that he might get if he's stressed out. Has not lowered his blood pressure.  Has done WONDERS for his anxiety. Without this drug, he'd need an antidepressant for sure.  We'd like to stay away from drugs like Prozac since they make you hyper and that would make the ADHD worse.	M	9	3  years1.5 mg 2X D	4/28/2012
4	ADHD, Asperger's, rocking		Daughter takes .5 mg am and again at night. Seems to calm her body. The car rides she would rock alot, she does not rock when she is on this med. No side effects. Started when she was 6 now she is 8. She has rages 3x per week does not help those.	F	8	2  years.50 mg 2X D	10/12/2011Email
4	Autism/ anxiety	Son was tired at first and complained of moderate head ache...went away after 2 weeks.	We are very anti- prescriptions for our son. This just takes the edge off of his anxiety and helps him to function more effectively.	F	10	2  months1mg/ qd 1X D	7/21/2011Email
3	ADHD	aggression, lethargy, insomnia, anxiety	Prescribed in August 2010 at 1mg per day in the evening.  Increased over Christmas break to 2mg per day.   He did okay for a few months, but in April began becoming very aggressive.  He was in trouble at school, so much so that I was getting phone calls every day.  This did not normally occur at all!!!  After being suspended twice in one week, I chose to take him off the Tenex.  He doesn't complain of insomnia like he used to, nor is he tired all day long.  Yes, the hyperactivity is there, but at least he's not aggressive and acting out.	F	7	8  months2mg 1X D	5/21/2011Email
5	bipolar I, PSTD, dissociative dis	none	guanfacine works great for my symptoms. it keeps my dissociative disorder under control. it also helps control my PSTD.	F	32	1  years1mg 3X D	2/5/2011
1	pdd-nos	tried this for my eleven year old son with autism spectrum disorder.  Noticed a spike in ocd behaviors like needing to line up all his toys in a straight row, if I put something back on the shelf of the fridge and it wasn't "just so," he would open fridge and fix it the way that seemed right to him. He was always uncrossing my legs if i crossed them, knocked all my towels off their hanging spots. He also had wild outburts of screaming, very aggressive behaviors, and he was hitting himself on his face and legs repeatedly. I told his doctor to stop this medication.  He is now on 10 mg of celexa and the only side effect is increased urination. Behaviors still fluctuate, but nowhere near as severe.		F	45	4  months1 tablet 1X D	11/5/2010Email
1		increased aggression, imsonia, increase OCD	autistic teenager. just can't seem to be able to sleep. drinks and goes to the bathroom 4-6 times at night. is irritated and aggressive for no apparent reason. all side effects showed up once the daily dosage was introduced.	F	19	30  days1 2X D	8/20/2010
5	hypertention and anxiety	Some drowsiness and dry mouth for the first three days.	Significantly reduced anxiety without creating a "drugged" or sluggish feeling.  Reduced BP from 130s/90s to 120s/80s.  Couldn't tolerate metoprolol (exercise intolerance), lisinopril (sluggishness and weakness) or amlodipine (anxiety).	M	47	5  days	1/31/2010
1	ad/hd,ocd, tics	terrible nightmares,my daughter was up all night! had no effect on tics ,was more anxious but so lathargic she didnt feel well enough to do anything, BP droped to 76/52.was not able to communicate how bad it made her feel until it was out of her system, its like she was shutting down	this is not a medicine for children! to give it off lable & not monitor blood pressure is totally irresponsible!	F	10	2  weeks	10/26/2009
5	Aggression, Tics	None	For my son this has really worked like a charm! He may even not take his adderal in the fall. He has much less tics and when he used to get extremely angry he can just calm down now. IT takes at least 3 months to work and he's on 2.5 mg twice a day.	M	12	1  years	8/24/2009
1	Autism	Staring into nowhere for 15-20 min at a time. Increased aggression. Eyes half open look.	Taken by 8 year autistic boy diagnosed with ADHD, and perseverance (OCD on compulsive side like condition) + temper issues. Made his eyes look drugged (2/3 open). He'd stare for 20 minutes into nowhere. Took for 10 days - doctor said these could go away after few months-stopped anyways.	M	8	10  days	6/4/2009
2	Autism	splotchy coloring after being in tempid bath water, slight right head tilt	My 5 year old daughter was put on Tenex to decrease her tics and impulsivity. The 2 weeks she was on it everything was still worse. Nothing changed, it didn't even get the benefit of her going to bed any easier at night along with her melatonin-she still would wake up at the same time everyday.	F	29	2  weeks	4/11/2009
1	Bipolar	Temperature changes, increased agitation, mentally was just "off".	My 7 1/2 year old son was put on Tenex to decrease his aggression and impulsivity.  The 3 weeks he was on it everything was even worse than before.  He complained of getting very hot especially when he was aggressive.  He also seemed to be in a wierd place mentally and his rages increased.  After 3 weeks we took him off this.	M	7	3  weeks	3/29/2009
5	PDD autism/tourrett's	Thirsty more than the norm	My son was prescribed this medication at age 6. He had never slept through the night ever!  After taking the med has slept through the night ever since. It also has helped mellow out his outbursts and helped control the tics. Has been taking this medication ever since and has not had any side effects.	M	8	2  days	9/18/2007
2	ADHD	None	Tried Tenex for our young son's early ADHD symptoms.  It was like drinking water for him.  Zero results, zero side effects.  Didn't even get the benefit of him going to bed any easier at night.	M	4	2  months	7/3/2007
4	ADHD	None	My eight year old son was prescribed this medication to help him sleep once his ADD/ADAD medicine has woren off.  He mellows out and is able to sleep on 1mg tablet.	M	8	4  days	2/20/2007
