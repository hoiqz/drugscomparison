This has been a wonderful tool for assisting me in maintaining focus and increasing my desire to accomplish tasks set before me, yet it also increases my desire to over-achieve in areas which are not pertinent to daily tasks. Prior to this regimen I was constantly irritable, and short-tempered, yet while currently on this drug, I am on an even plane. Occasionally I feel "emotionally neutered". Ampheta is an extremely addictive drug that can easily be abused and cause adverse conditions to the life of the individual if the regimen is not strictly followed. Sad story, one of my friends is on the drug and takes his prescription amount within half of the allotted time given. Most of the time this person is sleeping for days, or up for days. This would seem to be the life altering outcome that one would wish to avoid.		37	2  years20 2X D	1/27/2012Email
