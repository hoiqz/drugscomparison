5	Part of anti-rejection regimine	None that I can point to.	Kidney transplant from living donor 16 years ago.  Cyclosporin, Cellcept, and Prednisone are my anti-rejection drugs for rest of my life.  Was originally on Serolimus study after transplant, but found I was having severe water retention in arms and legs to get off it and be put on Cellcept.  Wish I didn't have to take any drugs, but I feel privileged to be here.  In excellent health otherwise.	F	62	8  years500 2X D	5/21/2013Email

Kidney transplant soon to be 9yrs Cellcept, prograf, predinisone is my rejection meds.... Have a  Blessed day...		F	43	8  years500 2X D	1/31/2013Email
5	Autoimmune Hepatitis	Hair loss, fatigue, insomnia, neuropathy.	I hate the hair loss and insomnia the most, but I have not had a flare since taking Cellcept.	F	59	4  years500 MG 1X D	1/30/2013Email
5	Severe uveitis and ? Lupus	None yet, joints are "popping"like crazy but no other side effects. My doctor is telling me it takes apps 7 weeks to take effect. And I have no insurance and the generic  ost is apps 100.00 a month. I really hope it works.		F	53	5  months1500 twic 2X D	10/8/2012Email
5	heart transplant	I had no side effect what's to ever also on prograph and they work well together		F	22	3  years	12/8/2011
3	Mutiple Sclerosis	   Large amount hair loss	  I guess my neuro exams better but really upset about hair loss. Not due to my age as I am on estrogen. Does anyone else notice this?	F	65	2  years1000mg 2X D	10/28/2011Email
3	kidney transplant	anemia, neutropenia (low neutrophil count), leukopenia (low white blood cell count)	Hemoglobin is stuck at 12, most likely due to cellcept. The drug seems to have caused sudden crash in low WBC around the 3-mo mark. Doc is still trying to figure out how to correct this. Bone marrow seems to be struggling with upping WBC counts.

5	To help me get off of Prednisone	Fatigue in the beginning	My original post was on 6/26/10 when I'd been on Cellcept (Mycophenalate) for 3 weeks. I was prescribed Prednisone in Nov. 2008 for Bullous Pemphigoid and had several attempts at weaning off of the steroids without success.  Finally success....I took my last Pred. on 11/20/10, thanks to this drug!  I've been slowly tapering off of the Cellcept since Jan. 1 and am now taking 1 Cellcept every other day......April 9th will be my last one.  I am optimistic that the BP is now in long term remission and I can put all of this behind me finally!	F	73	9  months250 mg. 1X D	3/25/2011Email
5	Behcet's Disease	Obviously I am now more susceptible to secondary infections, since this is an immunosuppressant.Also, diarrhea - worse with higher dosage.	I have previously tried several different immunosuppression medications (ie Imuran, Trental), and found CellCept not only to be the most helpful (reduced major flares requiring weeks in the hospital from every ~7 months to every ~2 years), but also had the fewest and most tolerable side effects of anything else I've tried.

4	Lupus Low Platelets	I started a low platelet (7) flare 11 months ago and Predniose 80mg & 750 to get count up to 40 then 20mg tired to taper steroids and then platelets drop to back to 40 platlets so back to 130 and trying to taper 2mg every two weeks. I keep asking if the cellcept is causing a new area for flares.	Have noticed an increasein flourscent light(WalMart Boxstores) get wonderful splitting headache. Pamelor helped with migraines and sleep deepth. Any ideas for keep platlet counts up to normal? Could it be the Cellcept? Or just a new chapter in Lupus	F	45	11  months1000 mg 1X D	8/25/2010Email
4	Bullous Pemphigoid	Fatigue	I've only been on Cellcept for 3 weeks today so it could be a bit early for my evaluation.  Nevertheless my Dr. put me on it in an effort to get me off of the Prednisone, which I've been on for 19 months.  I've already been on Dapsone for over 3 months and did not help at all....actually I was getting worse while taking it.  Then we tried Imuran which was working fantastic with my Prednisone taper but was causing some potentially serious side effects.  The Cellcept is helping me with my taper, maybe not quite as good as the Imuran but I am hopeful that this will be the drug that helps me get off the Pred!  In just 3 weeks I've discovered that if you don't follow the directions about 2 hours after or 1 hour before a meal it makes a difference with the drug absorption in your system.  I messed up with that twice in a 2 day period and started having problems....now I am paying close attention to taking it on an empty stomach and am doing well.

5	lupus		I also wanted to comment that I used to get upper respiratory infections (URI) 3 to 4 times a year that took forever to clear up in the five years I suffered before taking Cellcept.  In the five years since I started taking Cellcept, I have had only 3 URIs, only one was really bad that required a trip to the doctor's office.  If you have not responded to other drug therapies, TRY tHIS medication.	F	53	5  years1000 mg 2X D	6/9/2010
5	lupus	nausea nausea nausea	After five years of wishing I wouldn't wake up every morning, I began to take Cellcept (CC).  After three months of taking CC, I had lost 25 lbs. and was eating way more than before taking CC.  I can inhale deeply without pain, I can eat without running to the bathroom five or six times  WITHIN 30 minutes after eating, I can touch rough objects without cringing, I can tolerate direct sunlight and my skin looks/feels better, my fatigue has decreased 90%. i can think clearER,limited fog now, my oral hygiene problems are improved, my visual and hearing disturbances are much improved.  While I still have problems, the quality of my life is tolerable. CC made a tremendous positive difference in my life.  I wish more physicians were knowledgeable about the benefits of this medication.  I would recommend this to anyone who suffers from autoimmune disorders who has not responded to otherdrug therapies.  I seriously just wanted to die.  Now I don't.It is expensive even in its generic form.  What will I do when I am older and don't have the insurance coverage I have now.  I have taken medication vacations, but I always go back on it.  I need it.  CC gave me the ability to enjoy life again.  i laugh now. :-) I was unable to say that five years ago.  tRY IT.

2	SLE	This medication lowers your immune system, so I was exposed to more illnesses. I had bronchitis three times of the first 2 months of being on the medication. Can't sleep at night, tired during the day. On 2000 mg dose.	I'm on the fence. I don't know if the side effects are coming from this medication or a mixture of all my other medications. I hate polypharmacy! ugh!	F	21	8  months	6/21/2009
5	Lupus Nephritis	Aside from being very tired, which could be related to a lupus flare - this medication seems to have been successful.	I was severely leaking protien.  After about 6-8 months on Cellcept I had significantly reduce protien leak and have been off the drug for approx 5 years and have not had another flare.  It seems that Cellcept really helped me.  Well worth being very tired for a few months!	M	43	6  months	2/9/2009
5	Lupus Nephritis - SLE	Nausea, dizziness	After four months of intravenous chemotherapy with cytoxan - I was put on Cellcept, which is considered a milder type of chemotherapy. At the beginning i experienced some nausea and dizziness, but other than that I'd say I had no other side effects. It gave me great results and I'd recommend it to anyone. My lupus was at bay during the duration of my treatment with cellcept, and did not come back until two years after I was taken off of it. I am now trying Imuran, and i am expericing what I think are stronger side effects.. Am thinking of asking my doctor to put me back on cellcept...	F	29	2.5  years	10/27/2008
3	Myasthenia Gravis	I can't pinpoint any side effects.	In my case this has been a very trouble free drug.  Previously I was on prednisone, which controlled my MG much better.  However, cost of this drug is really prohibitive.  I could never afford this drug without good insurance coverage and I certainly won't be able to afford it after retirement.  Then what?	F	59	7  years	3/17/2008Email
4	Lupus (SLE)	Not many. Makes me a little tired, so I take it at night. Recently, I've had increased acne, not sure why.	After trying a number of immunosuppresants and steroids, Cellcept seemed to be the only one that didn't make me nauseous. (Although when my doc tried to increase the dose, I got sick again, so we lowered it back to one pill per day with no problems.) Also seems to be doing a good job keeping my lupus from flaring.	F	28	18  months	10/6/2007Email
3	autoimmune uveitis -pars planitis	skin rash, fatigue.	cellcept was the second immunosuppressant drug i tried after methotrexate. i was happy to have fewer side effects, but i still had regular flair ups.  i still required periodic steroid injections and prednisone.  not the drug for me.  now i must move on to the more toxic substances.	F	32	450  days	8/15/2007
5	Kidney transplant	No side effects   I am a kidney transplant I take 250mg caps  4 in the morning and 4 in the evening  I feel great!	I have no problems or side effects taking this pill.	F	35	9  months	7/25/2007
4	uveitis	On occasion, I will feel a bit tired. I also have small lesions on my hands and feet that come and go.	I take 2 mgs a day for the last five years. It  has  done a good job keeping the imflammation at bay. Avoiding the damage that steriods can cause and keeping my sight.	F	56	5  years	6/20/2007
4	Systemic Lupus	discoloration in fingernails, but no severe effects experienced	This drug was much better than Imuran in controlling my Lupus flares. My illness had gotten so bad to the point that my hands  (perhaps as a result of Raynaud's condition?), arms, and face were covered with deep painful rashes. My fingers also broke easily. Within the first month of taking Cellcept (as it has replaced Imuran) my fingernails started getting back to normal, and the rashes stabilized.	F	24	4  years	2/23/2007
3	Because of severe Lupus	Stomach pain, fatique,nausea.	You have to take a very high dose to help you.	F	33	3  months	10/9/2006Email
3	kidney diease	taking four tablets of 500 mg a dayshortnees of breath, tired and fatigue	also taking cozarr for high blood pressureand Lasix water pills  which can cause fatigue	M	53	3  months	9/12/2006Email
4	Wegener's Granulomatosis	Loose stools.	Seems to be holding the WG in remission. Taking 1g 2x day.	M	47	6  months	4/20/2005Email
4	kidney transplant	I'm also on prograf, so it may be that as well...but I havn't gotten many side effects. I get Urinary tract infections often now, and a general feeling of being more tired than before autoimmune drugs.	Seems to work, havn't gotten any rejection episodes.	F	27	4  years	4/2/2005
4	Myasthenia Gravis	First month: change in bowels, then they went back to normal. One incident of bronchitis.	CellCept kicked in relatively fast (1 month). I feel stronger on it. I still get monthly blood/urine tests, all of which come back fine.	F	21	8  months	1/31/2005
2	Multiple Sclerosis	Increased fatigue (not like we need that), very crabby (probably related).	Too many pills, too frequently.  Taking Imuran now -- seems to be working better.	F	26	6  weeks	9/5/2004
4	Renal Transplant	Real bad loose stools, like water. Other then that, great.		M	35	4  years	12/8/2003
5	autoimmune hepatitis	Possibly increased hypertension but difficult to say because on prednisolone as well.	Cellcept has enabled me to reduce the dose of prednisolone and hence reduced the side effects from that. Blood readings are great and I feel absolutely fine.	F	46	4  months	5/22/2003
5	Lupus Nephritis	Acne, urgent need to pass water.		F	23	1  years	4/3/2003
