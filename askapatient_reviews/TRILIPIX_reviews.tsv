1	for cholesterol and triglycerides	OMG !!!!! This is the WORST medication I have ever taken. First of all you can taste this horrible crap for 3 days after you take it, and it actually made me feel like I was dying. Muscle aches, nausea, headache. I had to go to bed for 2 days after the first pill.	What good does it do you to lower your cholesterol or triglyderides if you feel like you are DYING!!	F	54	2  days30 mg 1X D	12/14/2012Email
5	High Tryglycerides	Minor side effects	Trilipix (try LIP ix) has brought my triglycerides down to normal.  Occasional dizziness but not all the time.  I recommend it.			2  years130 1X D	7/11/2012Email
1	high triglycerides	increased muscles soreness and pain. Great fatigue, great intestinal distress. Had swollen lymph glands near groin. Gas,lack of appetite and mental fatigue, memory affects. I was taking it with Lipitor as my Dr. prescribed.		M	62	30  days135mg 1X D	3/22/2012Email
5	High triglycerides	None	I have hereditary high triglycerides and it works well for me.	M	59	4  years135 mg. 1X D	2/19/2011
5	High Triglycerides	Does the job and I have no side effects at all.		F	57	4  months135mg 1X D	2/2/2011
3	High cholesterol, can't take statin	None	This medicine is a good alternative for people who get muscle cramps with statins.  But it only brought my cholesterol down 50 points to 240.  High cholesterol is in my family, but granny lived to be 96 with a cholerterol level of 360!	F	60	8  months 1X D	12/15/2010
3	High Triglycerides	Tight and sore shoulder, neck, and back muscles.  Dizzyness and headaches as well from the tension in my muscles I am assuming.	I stopped on my own about 3 weeks ago and the muscle tension and soreness has eased quite a bit, but not completely.  I have asked my doctor for something else.	M	41	1  years135 1X D	11/22/2010
3	To lower blood fat	in 6 weeks, my blood fat level went from 1957 to 250.  And yes, that is not a typo!  That was great, but after about 4 weeks I started feeling soreness in my knees, then lower back and eventually in my hands.  I was on it for a total of 10 weeks before I could no longer take the pain in my back and hands.  I hope that the pain goes away.  Been off it for 3 days now and have seen no change!!!

5	High Triglycerides	I haven't noticed any side effects.	This works wonders! My numbers went from almost 573 to 193, still a little high but I need to work on my diet/exercise still.	F	42	5  months135 1X D	3/23/2010Email
1	to lower triglycerides	muscle pain in lower back	This drug causes so much muscle pain in my lower back that I can't stand for longer than 15 min. without being in pain. I used to be active but since taking this drug it's all I can do to walk to the mailbox and back and then I have to lie down. I'm going to ask my Dr. to change me to Lovaza which is natural made from Omega-3.	F	60	6  months	11/16/2009
4	High Triglycerides	Taken it a week along with other cholesterol med. No side effects so far. We'll see.		M	62	6  days	9/30/2009
1	High Triglycerides	I took one pill.  The next morning I woke up with my calf muscles aching like i just ran a marathon and had a general feeling of malaise all day (and wasn't out partying the night before).  I recognized the muscle pain to be the same as when I started taking Lipitor.  I stopped taking Trilipix after one day.  I'll try again in a week to see if the same side effects appear.
