1	NPEP	all sorts of funny symptoms that came and go as they pleased. Constipation. Trouble sleeping, always hungry, general tiredness, lack of concentration.	took together with stocrin. So far i had a negative 4 gen elisa after a month since stopping the medication. i.e 8 weeks after the incident. My doctor says i do need not further testing. The medication abroted the infection or i was never infected in the first place	M	26	28  days 2X D	9/6/2012
3	PEP	constant moderate  nausea day and night over a month, tiredness, feeling weak, feeling sick, and sleeping extra hours every day because of tiredness ...		M	33	4  weeks2x day	8/16/2012
1	PEP/cut in the O.R dirty instrument	I'm a sterile processing tech. and was cut thru my gloves on bloody instruments that had just been used in a lap chole procedure on a patient. It's so early to know just how bad things may get but so far my stomach is in an uproar and my sleep has been extremely disturbed. I believe the sleep thing is a bad case of anxiety but its very disturbing. It's the perils of my line of work unfortunately :'(		F	38	2  days150mg/300m	7/12/2012
3	Condom Broke.	I'am also taking Sustiva 600mg.So virtually two types of pills 3xa day.First off let me say I here rumbling in my stomach as I type and it hasn't stopped in the 4 hrs Is this Gas? okay right!I had exposure to a gentlemen who said the condom broke when I turned around he ejaculate in his hand not in me.So I was affraid and went to the E.R as they prescribed me this medicine.I've only been on it for days I quickly schedule a follow -up with my regular doc.Now first he said if I know the staus of the other indidvual is negative then I dont have to continue,then he changed and said no continue because even if he tested negative it doesn't mean he's neg. I said huh!!!WTF,he began to explain to me that even it's neg they can still carry the virus because the test looks only for antibodoes I took the person to the clinic myself I told him I saw the results non-reactive.He insisted I still cont.I would like to think that I'am a very logical person.Something immediately beagn to stink too me.Th	The doc said its an extra safety net and I understand that but how could you be neg,but probably not really neg. I believe that is a prob? Not sure if I continue Honestly just doesnt make complete sense. God Bless!	F	31	28  days150/300mg 2X D	5/16/2012
3	Pep	Tierdness stomach cramps slight fever general malaise	First few days were intense but seems to have subsided to a moderate feeling of unwell. I dread taking every pill u know your are poisoning your body but that's what you get for being complacent. Good luck (we are lucky to even have an option) ps be kind to your body for  the 30'days	M	38	30  days 2X D	5/5/2012
4	sexual assult	Nausea, tired, headache. Feels like the stomach flu.		F	23	1  months	4/26/2012
3	PEP	tiredness, neauseia,bloated,headheachs. the side effects have not been that serious though most of the time. first test after two weeks showed negative, if it works definitely worth it rather than to have to take it for the rest of you life. at least i know i am doing all i can to ensure that i am negative.	am taking it toghether with efavirenz, which seem to initially have quite serious side effect such as dizzyness and headaches	M	40	24  days150mg 2X D	10/5/2011
3	I was exposed to a used needle	Really Really bad nausea, Dizzyness, sleepiness, I felt like I was having morning sickness. It was bad, Good Luck.....	Well I came out negative, but I was sick the whole 30 days, I couldn't work the whole month.	F	28	30  days 1X D	4/27/2011Email
4	Prophylactic	No side effect noticed so far. I had a cold just when I began my regime, so I am not sure if the sore throat I feel is due to my cold or my medication. I also have a stiff neck, cannot turn my head to the right, but I think it may also be attributed to my cold.  Will see.	I would rather take this medication for 30 days than face the prospect of taking it for the rest of my life.	F	44	3  days30 2X D	3/20/2011Email
4	PEP	Nausea, headaches, fatigue.	For the first three days, I experienced no side effects at all.  Then on the fourth day, I was hit hard with intense nausea. I vomited several times over the course of the day, and felt pretty miserable. The vomiting only lasted that one day, thankfully, but the nausea was bad for another three or four days, slowly improving day by day.  A week after the initial vomiting I was feeling more or less fine.  I'm now three weeks into the medication and my body seems to have adapted.  I have no more nausea or headaches.  Perhaps a bit more fatigue than usual, as I seem to sleep an extra hour or two more than my usual.  In short, it sounds like my experience was unlike most of those described here.  Other than one day of pure misery and a few quite unpleasant days, it's been ok.  I recommend trying to eat small portions of food over the course of the day, so that your stomach is not empty.  Apples, bananas, bread, etc., things that are easy on your stomach.  During my nausea, that appeared to help me.	M	38	28  days150 2X D	1/17/2011
3	HIV PEP	Fatigue, headache, mild nausea, low platelet counts, low white blood cell counts (moderate-severe netropenia).	Went on PEP for moderate risk sexual encounter (insertive anal sex with a partner of unknown status).  My fatigue and headache is moderate (able to work and do some excerise, but feel crappy). I find eating and sleeping alot more than normal makes me feel better.  More disconcerning is the follow up blood tests showed what are likely toxic effects of the the AZT in Combivir.  My doc wants me to consider going off the drugs (or at the very least monitor my decrease in white blood count every other day, and going off if there is any further decline).  Learned my lesson for my poor judgment, feel badly for those that need to take these drugs to survive, hope that between my relatively low chance of exposure and this course of drugs I will remain negative.	M	39	28  days 2X D	1/14/2011
3	Post exposure-needle stick injury	nausea, headache, diarrhea, increased hunger, insomnia, decreased concentration	First 3 days very nauseous, no appetite, diarrhea, and headache. I no longer experience any of these symptoms but am constantly hungry. The worst hunger pains I have ever experienced in my life. I have to eat so much to feel full and I am just as hungry again about 2 hours later. The hunger pains tend to be worse about an hour after taking Combivir. The pain wakes me up in the middle of the night. I'm also not sleeping as well as I used to. I really don't know if I can take another 3 weeks of this. I am really considering maybe only taking them another 2 weeks.	F	22	7  days150 mg/300 2X D	11/5/2010Email
3	post exposure	nausea, dry nose, eyes. What is most surprising I gained 4 kg on weight during 2 weeks but I did not changed my eating habits.		M	30	17  days300 2X D	11/1/2010Email
5	PEP	Almost nothing. I am hoping this will not change!The only side effect I may have felt is slight nausea (a slightly "drunk" feeling) on a few afternoons. I have been a little thirstier perhaps.  Maybe I am just fortunate so far?	I am a little concerned that the comments of others on here (which are no doubt well intended) might discourage persons from seeking PEP treatment for HIV exposure due to the potential side effects.If you have an exposure talk to your doctor ASAP and certainly within 72 hours. In my case the doctor suggested that I at least start combivir and consider stopping if the side effects are bad - because it is not a decision you can put off until later! You are not certain to have bad side effects like some have reported.  I hope this helps.	M	27	15  days1 tablet 2X D	9/21/2010
5	hiv	it will make you feel week, you must get alot of rest	i have been undectable for 7 1/2  years	F	33	9  years300mg 1X D	7/26/2010
3	PEP	GAS, fairly consistent nausea, loss of appetite, sense of motion sickness, anxiety, fatigue, aversion to some previously enjoyable smells, slight worsening of existing depression, restless, fluttery feeling behind sternum, stomach discomfort.	I figured out that the increasing queasiness I feel for the first few hours after each dose is actually hunger - so I'm forcing myself to eat bland food despite constant low-grade nausea.  Apparently there is a 3/1000 chance that I was infected after topping and ejaculating in an HIV-positive man.  I decided to demonstrate self care anyway as contrary action to the lack of self esteem I showed by having unprotected sex in the first place.  Hopefully this will teach me a lesson.  Don't allow a potential sex partner's verbal assurance that he is "clean" to dissuade you from using a condom.  You may find out the following morning that he lied...	M	37	28  days150/300mg 2X D	7/21/2010
3	sexually assaulted	slight bloating and mild appetite gain...nothing really from what I have noticed in the past two weeks besides very mild diarrhea in first two days.	This drug has not made me ill to date and I have been taking it now for 17 days, 13 left to go. I work two jobs and have taken no time off work. Although reading these testimonies I am very concerned for the long term side effects this drug may have on me and whether or not it is worth it as a preventative measure as I am not sure that I was exposed to the virus.	F	21	30  days 2X D	6/24/2010
5	PEP	Fatigue/Tiredness, Constant upset stomach/nausea, sore throat	After having risky sex with someone I found out was positive (no ejaculation), I contacted my doctor immediately and he offered two options (1) check viral load in 48 hours or (2) take combivir for 30 days.  I of course chose to take the medication regardless of any side effects to ensure I caught any possible exposure.  It's worth the peace of mind.  Although, I'm a very physical and athletic person and this drug has depleted my energy.  Many days I end up sleeping most of the day.  I feel nauseous most of the time but I make sure I eat regularly.  I've also noticed that I have kept a sore throat for the past couple of weeks.  I have 3 days left of the 30 days and am counting down to the finish line and am praying that I maintain my negative status.	M	50	30  days30 MG 2X D	6/21/2010
4	PEP	nausea, dizzy, irritable, moody, nervous (doors closing/clapping/etc) and twitchy, dry mouth	It is awful and it's the price to pay to prevent infection. The following helped very much. Eat lots of healthy food. Eat a full breakfast (oats, low GI bread, eggs, fish). Follow with substantial snacks (sandwiches/muffins/fruit) mid morning. Full lunch, full dinner. Drinking ginger tea or rooibos tea (brilliant). Take vitamin supplements and ginseng. Also pray and meditate - it really helps.	M	40	30  days 2X D	5/22/2010
4	post exposure-unsure of status	Thank God nothing so far. I just pray all the time that it will stay like this. A bit more thirsty and helps to eat frequently and small amts. Perhaps abdominal bloating visible	Avoid all alchohol and eat as healthy as possible. Be sensible and rest a lot go to bed early and drink enough fluid.Keep your mind positive and ask God to help you see this through, it helps.	F	52	30  days1tablet 2X D	5/12/2010
1	needle stick exsposure	Just started drug coctail,Then to combivir for 30 days.Am already so sick! Nausea,Vomiting, gas, body aches, musclePain and weakness, nasal stuffiness,Feverish, decreased mental clarity,Want to cry all the time, yougartHelps with nausea, ginger ale willAlso help, lots of sinus drainage,Don't take unless it is a matter, Of life or death! You will be sorry!		F	54	30  days300 2X D	5/9/2010Email
3	PEP	nausea, stomach upset, diarrhea/bloating/constipation, fatigue, insomnia	I am taking Combivir because of a low-but-some risk exposure by a poz person - ejaculate on anal/rectal skin of questionable intactness.  I know I am doing the right thing.  My symptoms sound less severe than some reported here, but it's worrisome that some people feel fatigue months after.  I will be on for 4 weeks.  It's odd that insomnia and fatigue co-occur.  I will take the second dose earlier in the evening.  I am doing yogurt and kefir.  My appetite isn't bad, I just feel queasy at times.  It's important to know that a person who has a low viral load in his blood can still shed HIV into his semen.	M	50	5  days 2X D	4/13/2010Email
3	rape sexual assalt	queasy, dizzy, nauseous, light headed, can't sleep at night and sleepy all day, body confusion, irritable mood swings, loss of appetite	All i want to do throw up, I haven't thrown up yet but i want to so very badly. If there was any other way to go throw this i would but i cant bare the thought of being H.I.V. positive. I just really wish the medicine made me feel better as opposed to this constant sick feeling, I dont know weather i want to eat or drink. Do i want a nap or do i want to be awake. My head wont stop spinning, my stomach is constantly in knots. i just hope this stuff works. I pray everyday that this pain is worth me not being infected, i hope this does me some good	F	20	28  days150mg/ 300 2X D	4/8/2010Email
4	victim of sexual assault	Nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, fatigue coupled with insomnia, mental confusion.	I was sexually assaulted. I am taking a 28 day regimen of combivir & tenofiver as a prophylactic measure should I be found to have been exposed to HIV. I would far rather endure the side effects of the treatment as a prophylactic measure than bury my head in the sand and rely on hope and naivete.	F	40	5  days150/300mg 2X D	3/19/2010
3	PEP	None so far, but I'm only two days into it	I had an exposure at work and I'm on my 5th dose.  I have yet to experience any side effects except maybe extra sleepiness and was wondering when they were likely to start or if I'm going to be very lucky and have little or no problems.	M	51	2  days	10/24/2009
1	Exposure to HIV positive female	Tiredness, sleepiness, muscle soreness, stomach discomfort, headache, feeling sick,  depression, extreme fatigue and full body muscle soreness after even light activities like walking.	I would strongly discourage anyone from taking this medicine unless adsolutely necessary.   I took Combivir for 30 days as a post exposure prophylaxis and felt tired even months after taking the medication.  I am normally super athletic and I feel I am no longer that way(it's been 2 years since already).  You will need to take time off your job if your job is physically demanding.   My blood felt like acid.  The doctors and packaging seriously needed to warn patients of the side effects of this expensive drug.  Use protection(condom).   Just because you had sex with a promiscuous female or male you are unsure of is No reason to take this drug with long term side effects.  Unless you Know you are seriously exposed to HIV virus.  If so start the drug as soon as possible(best within 24 hours, within 3 days still quite good) .	M	35	30  days	9/19/2009Email
3	prevent  possible HIV infection	Headaches, extreme nausea,  ill feeling (malaise) and extreme fatigue, weakness, moody, cold/nasal symptoms, and slightly rapid/slow/irregular heartbeat which only occurred 30min after taking the medication and lasted for about 2 hours after	I'm gay and took PEP because i hooked up with a guy off Gaydar.com.au, and he came in me. After he wouldn't tell me his specific past history with guys and after he refused to get tested, this was my only option. The side effects aren't nice. I needed 2 weeks off of work and study because of it all.  If ur unsure about a guy, just wear a condom seriously, coz it's not worth going through this. Even-though i know it will help, it's best to avoid it. 12 out of 28 days so far, but i might stop them now coz i ended up convincing the guy to get a test and tell me his history from the last 3 months and i wasn't as risky as i thought.	M	24	12  days	7/29/2009
1	PEP	Stomach Pains, Indegestion, Insomnia, Rash and Generalised Swelling	5 months after taking this medicine for PEP, I am still suffering from the side effects that made me stop after 11 days. It appears to have altered my body chemistry. My advice to anyone thinking about taking this for PEP - think very carefully. Probably the worst decision I have ever made with regard to my health.	M	36	11  days	7/8/2009
3	Post Exposure Prophylaxis	nausea, strange feeling in my stomach, extreme tiredness, dizziness, confusion, inability to concentrate on task at hand, funny taste in mouth, mild diarrhea, sweating, increased thirst, mild sore throat, tingling in hands and feet.	Taking this medicine feels like I'm poisoning myself twice a day. I keep thinking how horrible it would have to be take ARVs not just for one month but for the rest of my life. Serious stuff but I pray that it works after a known exposure to HIV. 3 more weeks to go.	F	26	8  days	1/22/2009
4	Prophylaxis	Diarrhoea, dizziness, uneasiness in the stomach.Slight chills/fever that goes as quickly as it comes.Muscle fatigue.	Four weeks of pain and a life of peace. I am taking Combivir along with Viracept to eliminate a very very small chance of exposure. Here is how I did the math.Probability of other person having HIV: 0.01 (i.e., 1%)Probability of transmission: 0.001 (or 0.1%, there was no ejaculation and there were literally two unprotected penetrations)Net probability without Combivir/Viracep: 0.00001 or 0.0001%With Combivir/Viracept: 0%I will take the pain for now. Diarrhoea is the most serious side effect I am experiencing. I am using lots of Pepto Bismol along with yogurt and smoothies. Rest of diet is unchanged.	M	32	5  days	8/4/2008Email
4	Post needle stick	Nausea, I take Gravol with each dose, bad taste in mouth, aversion to previously enjoyed foods, diarrhea, weight gain, my abdomen is noticeable larger which is strange because even when I have gained weight I never gain in the abdominal area, loss of concentration I can go off into my own little world for minutes at a time, very very tired, sleeping a lot. 11 days left!!!		F	30	19  days	7/17/2008
2	Preventative from being exposed	I feel sick; nausea, watery mouth, stomach pains just below the ribs in the middle ~ made me cry, loss of appetite for typical foods, but gain of appetite for other foods in small amounts, headaches, feverish, diarrhea, not sleeping well, strange dreams ~ woke up crying; sore, fatigued, heart raceing and strong pulse, feel jittery/shakey; just not feeling great  :(	I have to take this for 30 days, 18 days to go...  I just feel awful.  I am not a person who gets sick or feels sick often, so this is just kicking my booty.  I have seen the doctor twice so far, in 12 days.  I had my first blood draw the day of the incident and my second is 15 days later.  So we will see if this is working. Hopefully I wasn't exposed to anything at all.	F	29	12  days	6/16/2008
3	prophylactic	weekness, disiness,blury vision, stomach pains, nausea non stop, bad taste in my mouth that only made me even more sick, gas gas gas,	I have been sick ever since I first started taking it. I have to brush my teeth 6 x's a day cuz the nasty taste in my mouth. This medication is no joke n I have 3 more weeks to go. But i know it will help in the long run	F	21	7  days	5/23/2007
5	HIV Infection	Nausea for about an hour after taking it - helps to eat a little something with it.  Dizziness for about the first week.	Wow - it works.  Viral load went to undetectible about 30 days, and CD4 count went from 78 to 350 in about 9 months. (Also taking Sustiva)	M	38	1  years	5/18/2007
2	preventative	increase in abdominal pain and nausau, i had anxiety before, specifically panic attacks however soon after getting on this medication i was having the fear of losing control and feeling depersonalized/dissociated (fearing the most basic funtions like breathing, talking, eating, sleeping) daily not just 10 minutes or so for a normal panic attack.  this feeling went away after i stopped taking the med but only for a short while as i am now still feeling just as fearful and panicky if not worse. not sure if it is the medication as i am not taking it anymore or possibly it may have changed a chemistry for the worse or it could be just enough to have put me over the edge in my anxiety disorder. not sure.	be careful and journal daily as to what things happen to you, your thoughts, dreams, appetite, weight gain etc. as this is a very potent medication and you need to be aware of even the slightest changes.	F	26	30  days	7/8/2006
1	prophylactic	nausea, dizziness, seizures, anxiety, confusion, bloating, loss of appetite, acid, rotten taste in the mouth, shooting abdominal pains, inability to breath/speak full sentences/cough/perform a range of respiratory functions, fatigue, weight gain, joint pain	I ended up with a visit to the Emergency Room due to the effects of combivir.  This medication is totally scary, although I've talked with a number of people who did not experience the extreme effects I experienced.  Please be careful and take care of that liver.  combivir can wreck you.	F	24	21  days	7/19/2005
3	increase  TCell count	extreme nausea, headaches, tiredness, muscle pain and spasms, dry eyes, dizziness, moodiness.	nausea persists but not as bad as first two weeks. Phenigrin helps. I have yet to get new bloodtests so unsure if it's working.	F	37	3.5  weeks	4/12/2005
