1	Sinus Infection & Allergies	MASSIVE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL HIVES.	Took this drug for about 2 weeks and then broke out in massive hives internally and externally in October 2008.  Hospitalized and almost died.  Hives have subsided to some degree, but it destroyed my hormonal balance, so now I breakout every month with hives around my period.  I cannot work and my life is miserable.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.	F	32	2  weeks100 mg 2X D	12/28/2011Email
1	Bronchitis	I took this medication and started breaking out in hives almost immediately and have done so for over a year now.  I asked my doctor about the side effects and how long they would last, he said he did not know.  There is nothing I can do for the hives and there seems to be no cure for them.  I would certainly NOT recommend this drug, my life is miserable now and there is no relief in site.	I have completely discontinued usage.	F	30	1  months	11/16/2009
