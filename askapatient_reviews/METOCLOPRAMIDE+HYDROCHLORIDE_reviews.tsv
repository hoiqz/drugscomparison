1	Milk production	Depression, Anxiety, loss of desire to live, inability to take care of my child. I have been off for 4 days now, fortunately have not experienced the withdrawal symptoms other than intensified depression and anxiety. I am starting Zoloft, hopefully that will get me through until the symptoms wear off.		F	27	3  months	6/6/2013Email
1	Nausea	Extreme restlessness, wanted to run of the hospital.	I was in hospital during lung surgery, and had severe nausea and vomitting, they gave me this drug through iv, and it was just terrible, I have never had such a terrible feeling before, I felt so restless, like I just wanted to jump of a cliff. Truly horrible times, and to this day I have slight feelings of restlessness, which I never had before.	F	15	 30 2X D	5/20/2013Email
1	Nausea	Long term anxiety and feelings of derealization. etc.	Anyone experiencing long term mental and emotional side effects please look to the therapy in the link below. Detoxing is also very helpful to get this drug out of your system completely. Your HPA axis has been set off by this chemical trauma, Reglan crosses your blood-brain barrier. Also supplement with a B complex to get your proper levels of B5 and B6 to help the feelings of akathisia some get. Good luck to all. This is an evil drug. But I am making progress due to a very understanding Holistic doctor who understands what has happened. You will get better.http://curezone.com/forums/fm.asp?i=1865493#i	M		1  daysIV 1X D	5/10/2013Email

1	My husband	My Husband of 17 years change completely when he took this drug all the posts of the suicide depression hear really disturbs me.  A suit was filed over 2 years ago for my husbands suicide while taking the medication. I recently been told by the lawyers that they want to dismiss the case.  They say its a viable case with just cause but to expensive to take to trial. I do not know how this will turn out and he is not hear to defend himself but no matter what happens my story will be told. Anyone wants to chat I would appreciate an email to hear you personal stories.	This drug needs to be off the market and people need to act against the big pharma putting profits before peoples lives.  They knew this all along.	M	46	4.5  months10 4X D	5/3/2013Email
2	Gastroparesis	Burning/stabbing joint pain, restless legs during day that transitioned to all-out thrashing at night, electrical "buzzing" feeling up and down legs/arms/back of head, itchy feet, anxiety, severe insomnia, total loss of motivation to be productive, complete loss of sex drive	Does this medication stimulate my stomach to overcome its paralysis and force food through into my intestinal tract?  Yes.  Am I going to approach my doctors tomorrow and tell them to install a feeding tube because I refuse to take Reglan anymore due to the horrific side effects (and due to Domperidone not working for me)?  Yup.  I've had a lot of serious health problems, but nothing has been as difficult to deal with emotionally and psychologically like the side effects from Reglan.  I'd rather go through cancer treatment again a thousand times over than EVER use this drug again.  My advice: if you take it once and immediately feel like you're going to jump out of your skin (or at least can run laps despite being ill), tell your doctors immediately, drink as much water as possible for the following week to flush it out of your system, and list it as a severe drug allergy with all of your medical providers.  At this point I'm just hoping the damage isn't permanent.	F	30	20  days10 2X D	4/29/2013Email

1	digestive disorder	Suicidal thoughts, akathesia, severe depression, severe anxiety, agorophobia, irritability, memory loss, zero appetite for 3 weeks	This medicine was prescribed to me almost 2 years ago. I have been through hell as everyone else describes, including a trip to the pshyc ward. I have made marked improvement but am forever changed. Before I took this drug, my life was amazing, now i struggle to drag myself out of the house. I have tried benzos, anti depressants, supplements and anyhting else that might have worked, and now I have to go through withdrawal from benzos that I had to take for over a year to be able to function. If you have recently been affected by this terrible nightmare of a drug, please try to take as little medicine as possible to get through it as I ahve learned that the meds that are meant to counteract this will put you through hell when you have to come off of them also.

I had been listless, without inspiration, anxious, feeling desperate. Difficult to function. I never dawned on me that it was the reglan. My GP, GI, Docs --even a couple of shrinks denied it was the reglan. I went through  several antidepressants, benzos, alcohol (bad choice, I know). 3 (?) years later I struggle with alcohol and benzo dependence.

I also lost like 30 pounds in 45 days and tried all meds and nothing worked. Does it ever fix anyone's GP? I've started putting the weight back on now. 850-376-2480. I'll listen to any doctor in here.  This is my personal cell and would like to talk to GP patients. I'm just scared if I don't take it ill die for I was not able to hold anything down for a month.

1	migraine	Hell! I was given Raglan along with Benedril through an IV in the ER because I had such a severe migraine that I kept throwing up my normal medication (Zomig). The moment Reglan started entering my body, it felt like I was being filled with icy air. I thought there was an earthquake - the bed was shaking. Then I felt like my body was not solid anymore and the feeling was so horrible I felt like I was going to die... I wanted to rip the IV out of my arm; I started screaming; I had bad tachycardia and constant tremors. I kept crying: "Please make it stop!" The doctors gave me Ativan and sat by me for half an hour as I continued to writhe on the bed feeling like I wanted to crawl out of my skin or run, run, run... I thought I was going to either end up dead or in a psychiatric hospital. Doctors NEED to warn patients before giving them this nightmare of a drug!!!		F	37	1  days 1X D	12/12/2012Email

1	stomach disorder	Started taking this due to a stomach illness. Was thrown into a suicidal depression. Never experienced any form of depression before. After finally linking it to the medicine I discontinued use. My big toe started twitching uncontrollably for weeks at a time. For longer and longer timespans. I took reglan in 2006.

1	acid indigestion, stomach clearing	Given it twice, different occasions, in hospital without knowing what it was. Immediately a horrible sense of anxiety and "coming out of skin" feeling. Hard to describe. Benadryl given, doctor said some people are 'allergic' to it.  Weeks later still having sense of crawlies and 'fragile' emotions; like I'm on edge of losing it.	Perhaps worst sensation I have ever experienced.  And I've had some doozies.  Will NEVER take again. Wondering why the anxiety and fear are symptoms.

1	acid reflux	I started taking reglan last February at 20 years old because my doctor told me it would be good for my acid reflux.little did I know it was gonna ruin my life. In January I was a perfectly normal girl and by February everything changed.I started feeling extremely anxious and paranoid. Since it said on the bottle call your doctor immediately if worsening feelings of anxiety, depression, confusion, etc. Occur. So I did and he refused to believe it was because of reglan.I thought the symptoms would go away but they just got worse and worse. At the beginning I had daily panic attacks at night and extreme anxiety every day I also suffered a bout of depression. I would shake a lot and my fingers would move by themselves. It was all physical at first but then I started getting vivid thoughts, images, etc.I still have extreme anxiety and the symptoms that come along with it.I've been dealing with this for about 11 months now. It's the worst nightmare anyone can imagine and to think all of this started because I wanted to feel better and listened to my doctor.  Stay as far away from reglan as possible it is an extremely dangerous drug!!!		F	21	6  weeks	11/28/2012
1	Heartburn and acid indigestion	Horrendous and debilitating anxiety attacks combined with deep depression.  My doctor refused to believe these side effects were due to this drug as they only appeared after I had stopped taking it.   I have never felt like this in my life.   I didn't move from my bed, other than to use the toilet, for a full week and it has taken me six weeks to recover.   I have been taking Citalopram and Mirtzapine during this time and feel that these antidepressants have really helped me.   To anyone suffering please believe it will go - during my worst time I thought it never would.	Do NOT take this drug.   It is not worth the risk.	F	66	2  months10 mg 1X D	11/22/2012

1	increase breast milk	Update***I have cut out caffeine, aspartame and other artificial sweeteners.  I was experiencing an improvement until I had a glass of wine day before yesterday, then again yesterday.  I had a panic attack last night.  Complete with suicidal thoughts.  I have no desire to hurt myself, but I could picture it in my mind.  This is no ME AT ALL.  I am still pissed I ever took this drug and that my Dr doesn't believe me when I tell him this is the problem.  Very glad I found this site where I can see in black and white that everything that has been happening for the past 2 months is not because I'm crazy, but because of this DIRTY DRUG that is being prescribed to nursing mothers.  WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU PUT A HORMONAL NEW MOTHER ON THIS HORRIBLE DRUG???  Good luck to everyone who is suffering.	This DRUG IS HORRIBLE.  If you or anyone you love is ever prescribed this medication, immediately slap the shyt out of whoever tries to give it to you.Good luck to everyone living this nightmare.

1	Increase Breastmilk	ANXIETY, PANIC ATTACKS, DEPRESSION, IRRATIONAL/VIVID THOUGHTS AND FEARS, CHEST PAIN	After 8 weeks of being on this med, I began to feel foggy and felt like i was "walking funny" as though I was walking a little to the left and couldn't stop myself, so I stopped taking the pills. 3 days later I was in the ER with a panic attack.  I had unexplained chest pains and within 2 weeks had 2 chext xrays and EKGs done.  I had blood work done to check my thyroid function, all appeared normal.  I began having very irrational fears, and thoughts that were embarrassing in their idiocy.  I was unable to make them stop.  I had panic attacks in the past, but had not had one since I was 5 months pregnant.  These were not normal panic attacks that lasted 20 to 30 minutes and went away, these were long drawn out full day events of being in a constant state of panic.  IT IS HORRIBLE.  I began to seek treatment after the 3rd event of random panic.  Every day as i would leave my house to go to work in the morning, I would have debilitating fearful thoughts that would usually result in a panic attack at my desk.  I began to be afraid to leave the house alone, I was afraid to spend time with or hold my baby.  i was afraid of changing her diaper.  I went to a therapist who referred me to my OB for Postpartum Depression.  OB stated this was NOT NORMAL and referred me to a psychiatrist believing I need to be medicated.  My psychiatrist has never HEARD of Reglan, and therefore does not believe me when I tell him I believe this is what's causing the problem as i was FINE for 3	F	34	8  weeks10 3X D	9/20/2012Email

1	to increase milk supply	Shortly after starting this prescription I started feeling like I had no energy.  I kept calling my dr's office telling them and asking if they could do a test for anemia or something.  Something was just not right.  About a week later I started having horrible insomnia and lots of anxiety.  I soon started being very depressed, anxious, having crazy thoughts, it was AWFUL!!  I became like a zombie.  Then came suidcidal thoughts.  Despite going to doctors and them knowing I was on this, they didn't take me off--said it was postpartum depression. I had never had depression in my life despite going through some pretty awful things. Finally one day my husband had intuition or something and decided to throw them in the trash!  It took a while for me to get over the withdrawl symptoms and a long time to realize exactly what happened.  I thought I was a horrible person.  I would not recommend this medication to anyone!!

1	gastroparesis	depression, anxiety, insomnia	My experience with reglan was two months, but I hope this will be of help to someone going through reglan misery. I started taking reglan for gastoparesis in May of last year. By late July, for the first time in my life, I was experiencing severe anxiety and depression. I didn't connect it to the reglan (drs. were no help) until Sept. 1. Once I made the connection, I was so distressed that I quit the reglan cold turkey on Sept. 1. (I'm not necessarily recommending this - I've heard you're supposed to taper off, but I wanted it out of my system, and I had a good support system around me - people who would constantly remind me it was the drug making me miserable.) Basically, September and October were a sad and anxious blur for me. I started to feel better in early November, and I kept feeling better as time went by. Now it's July again, and I've been 100% recovered for some time. The gastroparesis of course came back, and this may be really idiosyncratic to me, but Veganmax protein shake by Lifetime Fitness gives me gp relief (I also take motilium and HCL), and, unlike with reglan, I'm not looking for a bridge to jump off of. My heart goes out to everyone currently devastated by reglan - my reglan depression was by far the scariest and worst thing that has ever happened to me - but the drug did leave my system, and I made a full recovery. I also decided not to take anti-depressants during my recovery, as I'd never needed them before.

I told drs and they said it would pass. They let me drive home i dunno how i didnt crash my car. I really thought about cutting my skin off bc i felt my insides wouldnt stop moving. The aniexty was getting worse and worse. I finally got home and tried taking a hot bath i couldnt sit still. I got out and was pacing back and forth for 20 mins and had to keep laying down.and curling into a ball and shaking.I thought i was going to die i couldnt take it anymore.

1	Nausea	Side effects experienced with REGLAN: This drug is the devil! No really, it is. I don't even know why this RX was given to me but was by my doc. I was having issues w/ keeping food down but no more than anyone who can keep food down w/ the flu. I took it as soon as I got home from the doc and it knocked me out completely for about 30 min after that all the jumping of the legs sat in, twitching, I even went to stand up twice and put my right leg down only to bust my butt. It was like I couldnt control my leg. I was taking a RX cough syrup and I thought the bad reaction was coming from that. Nope! After a few more days of taking the Reglan I figured out it was the problem. What makes me mad is why would a doc prescribe this mess for someone who does have the medicinal condition that have been menchioned on this thread? I'm hoping to get it out of my system though I haven't been able to find out how long that is? I took it for 2 days then stopped then took it again a wk later which was today realizing moments after I took it the cough syrup wasn't the problem so I only have 1 dose today in my system. But it has been a horrific day. The twitching, ticking, restless legs, you feel like you are coming out of your skin. Do not take this RX. It is really dangerous.		F	30	3  days10	5/23/2012
1	To increase milk supply	Inconsistent bouts of depression after taking medication for about 50 days. Worse than side effects was the WITHDRAWAL I experienced after stopping the medication - debilitating anxiety, depression, depersonalization. I felt like I could not go on, could barely take care of my 3 children, could not feel any joy, felt like my soul had been taken away, I was not myself, and it was the worst feeling I have ever experienced in my life. Took 2-3 months to fully recover from withdrawal. If you believe you are experiencing Reglan withdrawal, please have hope, I DID GET BETTER and you can too, it will take some time and there are medications that can help. Please see my comments for full explanation and contact me by email if you need support, I contacted another patient from this site when I was suffering and it was incredibly helpful!	I was prescribed reglan through a lactation consultant to increase my breast milk supply, my baby was 7 months old, my milk supply returned almost immediately, it was very effective. Was given a refill after 40 days without incident, and then around 50-60 days I began to experience bouts of depression - they were inconsistent, occuring every other day or two straight days followed by two or three normal days. The depression was uncomfortable  - I was fatigued and listless, had trouble getting through the day.  Went from 10mg 3xday to 10mg 2xday to see if the side effects would lessen, they didn't so I decided to discontinue the Reglan - no one had told me you MUST wean off this medication and within 24-48 hours I began to experience the most horrible psychiatric withdrawal symptoms.The withdrawal started about mid-day, I felt racy, anxious, depressed, couldn't figure out what was wrong, by dinner time I was a wreck, I had never felt this way my entire life. Then the withdrawal symptoms mysteriously dissappeared by bedtime.  This pattern continued each day and got worse so I sought medical help but was told there was no such thing as Reglan withdrawal.  I was finally treated with medication, first Xanax, then Klonopin, and Zoloft and I'm here to say that it's taken over 3 months but I have finally recovered from the withdrawal and gotten off all medications. Please feel free to contact me for more details of my experience, I really want to help others going through this.	F	35	60  days10mg 3X D	5/8/2012Email

We cannot say that it helped because today, after her 3rd dose, she began to complain of jaw clenching and spasms in the jaw. By the time I got her home from a friend's, she was nearly in a frenzy. I have given her 50 mg Benadryl per MD order, and she has heat alternating with cold on the jaw. In all her years I have never seen her so miserable. I am a nurse and had no idea that these effects were so common. I had only ever given this med frequently to pt's with a G-tube.  Perhaps their conditions usually made it hard to assess when these occur.	My daughter will never take the med again, nor will anyone in my family. That being said, I trust my Doctor but will still look further into other's complaints when giving her any med that I am not personally very familiar with.	F	19	2  days10 1X AN	3/31/2012Email
1	Vomiting	Depressions, anxiety, panic, restlessness, insomnia (from anxiety)	I was given metaclompromide in the hospital through IV for vomiting and in pill form the following two days. I awoke the next day confused and depressed. I remained extremely depressed, anxious, restless, panicked. I did everything I could to ease the feeling, I went to the gym, I returned to the hospital to speak with the doctor, I spoke with doctor friends. And..I did my own research. I knew that it was the drug that was causing these effects and found out that it blocked dopamine in the brain, and can cause anxiety and depression in certain persons. I considered quitting work, but decided to put one step in front of the other for a while and try to make it through this episode. I found out it takes a few weeks for the brain to go back to normal and resume dopamine production. I want to tell you that it DOES get better. Please believe it, even if you have been taking it for months. The brain resumes making what it needs and it regains its balance. I don't feel ANY of the depression that I felt from that episode, it is like nothing happened. It took me two weeks, but then I was fine. If you took it for longer then you may need some more time but I don't think you would need more than a couple months really. Trust me things will go back to normal, you will be fine!! just manage your life, you will be fine :) if you need to talk my email is plantar84@yahoo.com	F	28	3  days 2X D	3/30/2012Email
1	stomach bile		NEVER, ever take this, unless you want severe panic attacks and severe depression and crazy depersonalization and suicidal thoughts. I quit taking this drug 7 months ago and still dealing with terrible side effects today. I'm afraid it has ruined my life. PLEASE dont take this medicine.	M	29	 10mg 1X D	3/11/2012EmailHistory
2	SIBO recurrence	diarrhea, abdominal pain, breast enlargement and pain	I think that Reglan probably works for its intended purpose (although in my case it was hard to tell), but the side effects are just so prominent that it negates any benefit of the drug imo.I was only on this med for 7 days (and a low dose mind you) and thankfully did not have any serious side effects but the ones I did have reduced my quality of life and made me pretty uncomfortable.

1	Nausea during Chemotheraphy	Was prescribed this drug in June 2008, and immediately started having problems with my teeth being sensitive, involuntary tongue and mouth movement, anxiety and trouble sleeping.  I took the generic form (metoclopramide) of Reglan, not because I requested it, but because unless your physician specifically orders Reglan, the pharmacy gives you generic, which is a cost savings to the insurance company.  Anyway, now it is March 2012, and these symptoms continue.  I only took the drug for three months while taking chemo, but it seems that I will have a lifetime of dealing with the side effects.  I have been diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia, and am on two drugs, Hydrocodone for pain in my mouth (feels like a really bad tooth ache), and Ativan for anxiety (caused by the constant pain).  Also, I use a sleeping aid in order to relieve myself of at least 8 hours without the pain and anxiety.  Needless to say, I highly recommend anyone research this drug before taking it.  It will save you a li	I would not recommend this drug to anyone.  It is especially hard on females who are considered "elderly" (whatever that age may mean).  I was 63 when it was prescribed.  It is a dangerous drug, and is given to all ages.  Just be careful.	F	67	90  days20 MG 4X D	3/3/2012Email
1	low milk supply	I started off taking 1 pill, 2 on day & by the time I got to 3 on Day 3 that was all it took to cause severe exhaustion, disorientation, tongue twitching, headaches, drooling (ER thought I had a stroke) Nope just took this horrible drug which when I stopped it made my supply worst. Get domperidone if you must, BUT DO NOT take Reglan.	I would NEVER recommend taking this drug to any one.	F	36	4  days30mg 3X D	2/29/2012Email

1	Low milk supply	After 4 days of taking the medication I began having severe anxiety attacks, heart racing...I felt in a constant state of panic. This medicine is frequently given to women after childbirth to help with breast feeding. PLEASE DO NOT take this medicine after childbirth! Racing hormones that follow childbirth do NOT mix well with this medication.		F	28	7  days 1X D	2/14/2012
