5	Mild Crohn's Disease	None	This drug has been a miracle (I hate drugs and don't even take aspirin so this was a tough sell).  I had to change my diet (trigger foods mostly elimitated) as well for full relief but I took it for 1.5 years mainly symptom free and decided to go off.  1 month off and my symptoms came back reminding me of the horror I experienced before I was diagnosed.  Went back on Lialda and have not experienced a flare in over 2 yrs.  All bloodwork, testing, etc comes back normal.  Have never felt any side effects but elation and gratitude for giving me my life back.	F	28	3.5  years2.4 GM 1X D	3/3/2011

5	ulcerative colitis	none	I have been on different sulfur type medication for many years (diagnosed nearly 20 years ago). this medication is WONDERFUL! I take two pills once a day and I am done.

4	collagenous colitis	No side effects whatsoever. I love this medication and along with dietary changes all my symptoms were quickly brought under control.	My doctor asked me to try Lialda after a couple of years on Asacol (mesalamine). Both worked very well, but Lialda is REALLY expensive. I've benefited from the drug company's discount card, which reduces my cost from hundreds of dollars a month to about $10.	F	55	3  years2.4 g 1X D	1/5/2011

5	ulcerative colitis/proctitis	None. When first diagnosed I was also prescribed canasa (a rectal suppository) for about a month. I have been on Lialda for 1 year and it's been wonderful. Not one flare up. No blood. No mucus. It's been wonderful.	I take 2.4 mg a dag (2 pills). It is a VERY EXPENSIVE drug so shop around. Costco had the best prices.

4	Inflammatory bowl	Gas....a lot!	Since taking 4 Lialda pills a day, I now only have to use the bathroom 1 to 2 times a day.  Normally, I was going 4-6 times a day!  I work in surgery and this is a BIG problem!  Now, if I can just do something about the gas!	F	37	30  days	8/28/2009
5	UC	None so far.	I'm posting for my 20 1/2 yr old daughter Ash.  She went from Remicade infusions every eight weeks to 4 pills of Lialda in the morning and it's working.  Had to quit the Remicade due to the body developing antibodies to the mouse protein in Remicade. It was a godsend for 3 years.  Good luck to all.	F	20	2  months	8/27/2009Email
