3	Arthritis in hips	Weight loss	(fyi,I've had no unpleasant side effects.) After starting this medicine,I began to lose weight, unawares. I was shocked when at the 3 month check-up, I learned I'd dropped 23 pounds. Now, after taking it 7 months, I have dropped about 50 pounds. Caused me to not feel normal hunger. I would begin a meal, but feel full quickly,to the point that I absolutely wanted NO more. Very unusual. Normally, I'd want seconds!  This will cause your stomach to shrink. 2 mo ago,weight loss began to slow-thought it might be stopping altogether. I determined to help it out a bit.Tried to make sure I never ate 'tween meals, etc. I've continued to lose weight, w/o any real effort,but slower than before-probably a good thing. Only other possible cause for weight loss is use of a hot tub.  About the same time as I started with the Ultram, after reading online about the potential benefits of hot tub use for Arthritis sufferers, we purchased 1; I began to use it-virtually every day for at least an hour or longer. (Husband built "desk" that fits across it. I go out with Bible, computer, etc & make good use of my time.) According to an online study,those in 1 for at least 30 min/day lose an average of 1 lb/week.  Whatever the cause-probably a combination-the weight loss has been significant;that, in itself, helps any overweight arthritis patient. I'd be interested in knowing of similar experiences.

3	I was taking 'regular' Ultram on an	Itchy face, and nausea like codeine, but lasts much longer, good for dental pain, lower lumbar, old man's knee, etc. I always wondered why it made me feel peppy and got me out of the house a few times (I could walk again)and then turned into a depressing hallucination filled crash.  Only recently I discovered it has an SRI effect! And along with any SRI's dreadful side FX,comes that awful medical 'addiction' I couldnt understand why the walls moved up and down and the carpet would ripple like wind on a pond- for over a week-Stopping 90 days of morphine and dilaudid was much easier, and quicker.Even a barbiturate detox was a tea party next to getting off SRI's.The entire class of SRI's is as prevalent and over prescribed, like PFL's in the early '50's- Major doses of major narcotics and barbiturates in the 60's- Drs handing out power packed speedballs for people who 'need a little energy' during the day, and want to skip lunch.What will they say in 20yrs about the time Dr's gave	Ultram manages pain ok, first like a stiff dose of codeine for a week or so, then your natural tolerance kicks in, and makes it pretty useless.It was thankfully free of toxic Ibupro/aceto-But then I find out it also has an SRI action, and that typical SRI withdrawal nightmare.
