4	Bipolar - Mixed	Very slight dry mouth, but barely detectable. My fingers are crossed that this doesn't get worse, as it's a deal breaker for me.  Anyone remember the tricyclics?  I've taken a lot of things to try and improve this hand that I've been dealt, and nothing has really worked very well, except androgens .... yeah they work, but they're expensive.  They say lots of exercise works also, but getting there is difficult when you're mixed bipolar.  It's a roller coaster.	When I started hearing about treating bipolar patients with anticonvulsants, I admit I was intrigued, but I had so many bad prior experiences being a guinea pig, that I stayed away. Still, in the back of my mind, I kept wondering if perhaps bipolar could be a more subtle form of epilepsy.  In other words ... brain damage. So with this idea in mind, and unable to afford androgens, I gave Lamictal a try.  What I like about it, is that it appears to be naturally lifting my mood, without causing mania, and so far it's not changing my personality, which is the whole reason I opted for hormones over SRI's.  As much as I have suffered over the years, I like being me.  Lamictal also has calmed my racing thoughts, allowing me to concentrate MUCH better, but unlike a tranq.  I'm still taking 600 mg Lithium Carb. per day and about 0.5 Xan., but hoping to cut out one or both of these. So far so good.	M	48	9  days25 mg 1X D	8/19/2010Email
3	Free 5 week tiered sample from pdoc	Headaches came on pretty roughly, even just after 2 days. Keeping an eye out for that damnable rash!	Simple to take, tastes pretty good haha. Only downside is that I have to keep the pill in the foil pack because they're incredibly sensitive to even slight moisture, so I can't put them in a pill bottle or in a weekly pill box. It's a 3 because I haven't been taking it long enough yet.	F	21	2  days25mg 1X D	5/21/2010
