1	osteoporosis	Immediately after taking my first dose yesterday I had a headache that lasted all day. Also had queasy feeling in stomach on and off all day, and some stomach discomfort. Was very restless last night and did not sleep well. I will NEVER take another dose. I need to find a natural alternative.		F	63	1  days35mg 1X W	1/10/2013Email
2	Osteoporosis	After the first dose, mild discomfort in back and upper back burned. Symptoms only lasted a few minutes. After the third dose, I felt like I was in labor and the pelvic bones were pulling apart. Walking sounds would confuse some with popping pop corn. Several large lumps above right knee that are itchy and painful, and the worse is burning in the rectum. I am due for my fourth monthly dose in two days. I see my Dr. in a week and will decide at that time if I will continue to take Actonel.	Since I have not taken the drug long enough to be re-tested for bone density, I do not know if it is effective. I take it early, remain up, hold off eating for two hours, and recline rather than lie flat during sleeping hours, and do not sit straight up as to avoid belching. I rated it 2 because of the harsh side-effects.	F	59	3  weeks35mg 4X M	1/8/2013Email
1	Osteopenia	Severe aching muscles and joints, flu like symptoms, temperature 99.8, severe abdominal cramping, diarrhea.  Onset of the symptoms takes 18 hours.  Then all the symptoms are experienced at once.  I felt like I had taken the medication to clean your colon for a colonoscopy plus the flu symptoms.	This medication is poison to your system.  The first time I took it I was convinced by my doctor's staff that I had an intestinal flu.  Let it run it's course.  After 14 hours of diarrhea I began taking Pepto Bismol.  I was home sick for two days.  The second time I took the medication I awoke at 2 am and I knew immediately what I was in for.  I took the package information and called the manufacturer to make a report.  I filed a ADVERSE REACTION report with the FDA. I contacted my pharmacist at 4 am to see what I might take to get some relief.  I don't know what kind of permanent damage I have done to my system.  But I will NEVER EVER take this medication or any other medication in this family.  I am upset with my doctor for prescribing it.  I am mad at myself for taking it a second time.  I had stomach problems the first month I took it and today I am still experiencing abdominal cramping.	F	50	2  times150 mg 1X M	1/4/2013Email
2	osteoporosis/primary hyperthyroid	upset stomach and touble sleeping	I have not taken it long enough to know if it is effective. I will probably need to take it for 2-3 years. The side effects have been moderate but I felt much better before I started taking it.	F	55	4  months 1X M	11/16/2012
1	Low bone density.	Kidney Cancer.  I think it made my bones more brittle and my spine is extremely painfull every step hurts and I can't walk very far without sitting down. In my opinion it made my bones much worse and it should be taken off the market.	I wish I had never taken it.	F	86	5  years 1X W	11/4/2012Email
1	Osteoporsis	1 day after taking it I felt like I had the flu. Was freezing, ached all over, hurt to walk because of the pain in joints, and I had a temperature. 4 days later I suddenly had severe pain in my rib cage along my bra line on both sides of my chest and a horrible headache and sore neck. Also bad cramps in my foot. I have only taken 1 dose but will be telling my doctor that I will not continue taking it. I'm hoping it leaves my system quickly. I wish I had found this site before I took my 1st dose!!		F	51	6  daysMonthly	10/12/2012

1	for tinny bones	I have taken this for years with no problems, but the last three months I have awakened the next day with body shaking chills and then a fever in the afternoon and diarrhea. It lasts about 2 days. I am thinking there was something wrong with the last 90 day supply I got. Maybe it was tainted. I fear the tinniness in my bones, but I am not taking it again.	I first started taking this through a medical study at Northwestern University. After the study, my doctor prescribed it for the tinniness I was feeling in my bones. I do not have osteoporosis. I just feel like my bones are hollow	F	71	10  years150 1X M	10/3/2012Email

1	Osteoporosis	It is early days yet but something is affecting adversly anc Actonel is the only change in my medication regimen. Shortly after going to bed last night I had diarrhea. This morning aching in muscles and joints.  Retrosternal discomfort and discomfort and heaviness in breasts. Very depressed with loss of motivation.	Rather apprehensive now as to what may be in store for me as I am stuck with the once-a-month 150mg dose for the next month with no way to turn it off.	F	78	2  days150mg 1X M	9/1/2012Email
1	Low bone density spine & hips	Dizziness ++. Diarrhoea. Bone pain. Difficulty moving my joints.Lethargy. Loss of earnings through time off work.	Dizzy within 3 hrs of administration. By 10 pm felt I'd been in a time machine & was 85 yrs (I am 62).Strong bone pain. I could 'feel' my sternum,hips,spine & left forearm. I found it hard to move & because of the diarrhoea nearly soiled the bed. It's 1 month to the day now, since I took Actonel. I am gradually feeling better, especially in the last 4 days. I lost 6kgs in 1 week & time off work. My doctor was dismissive & seemed not to believe me as to the cause. He had strongly urged me to have a yearly infusion of Actonel. I am so relieved I tried the monthly dose 1st. It is ironic that the ongoing dizziness predisposed me to falls; thank goodness I did not tumble & break something! I question how this drug got passed the Therapeutic Goods Act.	F	62	1  months150mg 1X M	8/26/2012Email
1	osteopenia	I had been on Boniva for approx. 12 years when my Ins. Co. switched me to Actonel in Nov., 2010. (A Dr. has to sign off for this to happen.) In late Dec., 2010 I was taken to hospital with "global amnesia" and given every imaginable test. My memory of approximately 10 hours never returned. - Frightening! At that time, the Drs. were saying it was stress related.In Nov., 2011, I was having a great deal of difficulty rising from a toilet seat due to extreme pain above my right knee. X-rays didn't show anything. Dr.'s were dismissive. Pain then went to mid-thigh and then into groin. Later, the left leg started with same symptoms. At that point x-rays showed stress fractures of both femurs, with right leg starting to heal. A week later, when getting out of the shower and stepping down onto the left leg, the femur snapped. I heard it; I felt it and I went down.Nine weeks later, I've had surgery, been in a nursing home, spent time in a rehab. center and am now housebound. I am s		F	73	18  months150 1X M	8/14/2012Email

1	Osteopena	First time I took Actonel I had flu symtoms for a week.  Each month I have flu systems for 1 to 1 1/2 days.  I have unexplained weight gain.  I have been on a 1250 cal per day diet and still gain about a pound every three months.	Went to the doctors yesterday with muscle pain complaints and pain in my ribs I have been having these pains for over a month.  An xray shows I have a broken rib.  I have not fallen or been in an accident so how did I get this broken rib?  I am also on Lipitor (have been for over 5 years) and my doctor wants me to stop the Lipitor thinking this is what is causing the muscle pain.  Does not think Actonel has anything to do with my issues.  After reading these comments, I am stopping Actonel immediately	F	58	18  months30mg 1X M	7/11/2012Email
1	Diagnosed with Osteoporosis	Extreme tiredness, very bad cramps, pain in hip and muscles. I have trouble sleeping and sometimes feel very ill after taking a tablet.. My whole body feels out of whack.	I was recently diagnosed as having Fybromyaligia and I think that the symptoms are caused by the Actonel. I cannot lose weight and my stomach feels hard.

I took Actonel for the first time on Sunday 6/9/12 at 6:am I followed my doctor and pharmacist instruction later that afternoon I started feeling severe joint pain and two days later I ended up in the ER because eyes felt like someone ripped my eye balls from the socket, I was diagnosed with Uveitis due to reaction cause by  Actonel.

1	Osteopenia borderline osteoporosis	I had previously been on Boniva. The pharmacy/insurance switched to Actonel. Within 2 months I was having severe thigh/groin pain in right leg. Shortly thereafter, the pain went to the left thigh/groin area. Just diagnosed with femur fractures in both legs. Right leg seems to be healing, although still having some pain. Left leg is not doing as well; I'm using a combination of a cane and a walker. My mobility is severely limited. It was quite by accident that I suggested to  Dr. that Actonel might be the culprit. SHAME on the manufacturers of these drugs!		F	73	7  months150 1X M	5/24/2012Email

1	Osteopena	Took actonel for 6 months. A couple of months into it, I started having severe back pain, exterme night sweats (so bad, I got dehydrated and fainted), sores in mouth, weight gain. I never had back pain before in my life. It's been 21/2 years since I stopped taking Actonel. Other symptoms went away but back pain is still with me and doctors can't do anything about it.	This drug should be taken off the market. I am in my mid 50's. Used to be very athletic, running every day, working out. Doctor gave it to me after a bone density test. Even though I quit over 2 years ago, I have been feeling like an 80 year old. Can't run, sit, bend... This drug should be off the market.	F	56	6  months 1X M	4/5/2012Email

Do you think one suggested the Actonel? NO! until I checked the Internet and it was like my life story from all the comments. I think I read one that said no effects. This drug has taken my life away from me.	This has made me feel like an old lady. I'am 54 and was perfectly fine until this was prescribed to me after a bone density test. I started to believe the fibermyalgia when they say chronic pain commercials but again I think most male Dr.'s look at you like you are crazy.

1	Osteopenia	Within a couple of weeks I experienced bone pain which continued to increase.  I stopped taking the drug and I would advise anyone to NOT take this drug.	Bone and muscle pain continued, I saw many Doctors and had many tests no one could find a problem.  My only symptoms were bone and muscle pain. After 3 years Doctors decided it must be Fibromyalgia, an autoimmune disease caused by a disturbance in my body.  I believe the Actonel caused the disturbance but there is no way to prove this. I am completely healthy except for this condition.	F	68	3  weeks35mg 1X W	1/19/2012Email
1	menopausal osteo in right hip	I haven't had any side effects from the once-a-month pill, but I am very concerned that it may have been the cause of my left hip breaking due to a fall 2 weeks ago that in my opinion should not have been hard enough to cause a fracture, as it was on a carpeted floor. I will not be taking my next dosage, due tomorrow, & will be talking to my doctor when I see her this week to have the surgical staples removed. I am very, very, distrustful of this drug & reading what people have gone through has scared me even more.		F	59	6  months150mg	1/14/2012

3	I had osteoporosis.	I started to get lumps on my finger joints that would ache.  Sometimes the lumps would have a burning sensation.  My vision blurred and my muscle aches do slow me down when I first get up.	I don't have osteoporosis anymore using Actonel, but I think it's time for me to find something else due to the side effects.	F	45	2  years150 mg 1X M	1/3/2012
1	osteoporosis	severe anxiety, GERD, chest pain, shaking, diarrhea, nausea,chills	Have been taking this drug for 1+ years. Did have the usual muscle aches and pains on second day post dosing. Took my dose on Nov 7, immediately started with chest pain arround my esophagus for a week, then I had a severe anxiety attack on Nov 15. Next day had to go to ER for severe nausea of >6 hrs duration. Was worked up for heart attack, all normal, no heart problems. Sent home, not home more than 1 1/2 hrs and it starts again. Went to the psyciatrist due to the anxiety and she says that it has to have a pysiological basis, because someone doesn't suddenly start having severe anxiety like that. Had more labs and CAT scan of my head, all normal. Symptoms persist even though it has been > 8 weeks since dosing. Started looking up side effects of this drug and then looking at half life and took this info to my doctor and she really feels this is what caused it. It has ruined my life, I am afraid to be alone, afraid of the dark and cannot work. I am a nurse and used to a high stress hospital unit and have never had anxiety issues before! but I cannot even think about taking care of patients while I am like this. I wonder if I'll ever be the same again. It will take >6 months to get the drug out of my system based on the halflife, the dose I was taking and the # of doses I have had.

1	mild osteoporosis	Very painful feet, especially toes and cuboid joint area. Attacks lasted approx. 4 days then quickly subsided. After 4 attacks, that progressivley became more severe, I  quit this drug. I must add that during the 3 months I experience approx. 3 weeks of vertigo. Prior to taking Actonel I never experience any foot problems or vertigo in all of my life. After 25 days from my last dose I am back to normal and have started to use 1200 to 1500 units of calcium/mag. supplement daily.	Maybe this drug helps some people but I feel it was slowly crippling me.	M	74	3  months150 mg 1X M	12/23/2011

MY FIRST WAS WHEN I STARTED ON ACTONEL ONCE A MONTH AND HAD SO MANY SIDE EFFECTS; FROM DIARRHEA TO FLU- LIKE SYMPTOMS, STOMACH AND AB CRAMPS AND BODY ACHES ALL OVER.  I WAS ON ACTONEL 35MG FOR 7 YEARS, STOPPED ME FROM ENTERING THE OSTEOPROSIS PHASE BUT WAS STILL OSTEOPENIC. ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO I STARTED HAVING THIGH PAINS TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS BECOMING VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO WALK WITHOUT PAINS IN MY LEGS WHERE I FEEL THAT THEY ARE VERY HEAVY TO LIFT OFF THE FLOOR AND MY KNEES ARE BECOMING VERY WEAK AND ARE GIVING WAY WHEN I WALK. I HAD THREE MAJOR FALLS IN THE PAST MONTH AND NOW I AM AFRAID TO GO OUT BY MYSELF IN FEAR OF FALLING DOWN. I HAD ALL KIND OF TESTS AND SO FAR THEY CANNOT SEE WHAT IS WRONG. AT LAST, I GAVE THIS WEB LINK TO MY DOCTOR IN ORDER FOR HER TO SEE THE PAINS REFLECTED ON ALL OF YOU LADIES WHICH ARE COMMON AND CAUSED BY ACTONEL. I HOPE EVERYONE COULD READ THOSE PAGES BEFORE THEY START ON THIS POISON.	LET US DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. NEXT THING THOSE PHARMACEUTICALS WILL ANNOUNCE THAT WE NEED AN ACTONEL SHOT BECAUSE IT IS BECOMING CONTAGIOUS. WAKE UP PEOPLE THEY WANT OUR MONEY.

Fatigue set in toward the end of the day and that night I had a fainting spell.  I could not stay up from a prone position for  two days. Today is the 3rd day and I am still very tired although the stomach aches and nausea have subsided.

Side effects usually include aching bones all throughout body (including arms, neck, hands, fingers, feet, legs).  Have felt general fatigue and some flu-like symptoms.	I have my one-year follow-up with my Rheumatologist in 3 months.  I think I will have another scan at that time. I will continue with Actonel until that time to determine if the medicine is working as intended.  At my age, I am willing to put up with some side effects if it will reverse my osteoperosis.  My scan was -3.7 at age 34, I don't want it to get significantly worse as I age.	M	35	9  months150 1X M	9/21/2011Email

This is the only drug I take and was reading about side effects and the ringing in my ears that is making me crazy should be from the drug. I just called my family doctor today and told him that I am going to stop taking Actonel to see if I do not have more eye pain and if the ringing in my ears stops. It is not easy to live with a noise in your ears all day long and night long. Hopefully it is because if Actonel and I will be happy again.	F	51	1  years150 mg 1X M	9/7/2011Email

I went to the doctor  & he could find no reason for it.  I thought I was crazy.  Immediately began  terrible pain in my hips & groin.  Pain in my legs at night....haven't been able to sleep without taking pain relievers.  Neck and back pain started after 8 mths and around the same time pain in my jaw .  I also continued to experience bouts of stomach cramping every 2 or 3 months that would last for 5-7 days each time.  It took me all this time to finally make the connection & look up side effects on the internet.	I never knew about the side effects.  My ob/gyn prescribed it for ostepenia.   I've been to 2 gps and a bone specialist with my aches & pains.  All of them knew I was taking Actonel, but none of them mentioned the side effects!  Even the dentist I went to for the jaw pain did not mention a problem with Actonel.I have always been active & run regularly.  I couldn't understand why in the last year  and 1/2  I was having so much pain........I attributed it to the running.  I am so relieved to find an answer to these problems & can't wait to get this drug out of my system!!!	F	56	17  months150 1X M	8/20/2011Email
1	Osteoporosis	I took this drug for 1 year and constantly felt like I was having a flare-up of my osteoarthritis.  I stopped taking it and after a few months felt so much better.  I felt guilty not taking it, and decided to take a pill 2 weeks ago.  I have had severe joint and bone pain, just like before.  In fact, I had to take pain med to sleep, and double up on my arthritis med just to get through the day.  I am extremely tired and feel like I have the flu, all the reasons I stopped taking it before.  I will never, never take this med again.  I am going to treat my osteoporosis with natural vitamins.  I know this drug has a 500hr half life, I hope that means only 1 more week of this awful pain.  Do Not Take It!		F	66	36  months150mg 1X M	8/18/2011Email

1	osteopenia	Horrible joint and muscle pain, general feeling of sickness and exhaustion.	I have not taken Actonel for 14 months now.  I do feel better, but I believe this medication has affected my body in ways that may never go away.  I still have pain in my left wrist, left little finger, my left big toe, neck and shoulders.  All these pains began within 2 weeks of taking the first dose of medicine.  Doctors have told me it is merely arthritis, not associated with the medication.  I think it is odd they all appeared nearly at the same time, within days of taking the medication, and as one doctor did mention it is odd all on the left side, since I am right handed.  I will always believe this medication has caused these problems and has robbed me of the ability to do and enjoy some of my favorite things in life.  I wish I had never taken it and I advise all I see to avoid it.  Please take it off the market, NOW!	F	58	6  months 1X M	7/14/2011Email
1	osteoporosis	Horrible joint and muscle pain.	I am writing to report that I am finally feeling better after 9 months.  I only had 2 doses of Actonel.  Still have pain in thumbs and wrists but the all over joint pain is gone.  Will never take this again.  Hoping that my hands will be pain free soon.	F	56	2  months 1X M	7/10/2011Email
1	osteoporosis & osteopenia	Severe flu-like symptoms began 8 hrs after taking first (and last) pill.  Fever 102-F, migraine level headache & light sensitivity, joint/muscle aches, nausea.  Even my finger & toenails ached. Unable to get out of bed w/o assistance for 3 days.  I was a little frightened to tell the truth.	Am age 65 & have osteoporosis due to menopause beginning at age 42 plus probably lack of sufficient calcium intake for too many years. Was reluctant to take any drugs but literature seemed to say this drug was relatively safe, but after my experience it seems rather dangerous at least to me.  Took that pill a little over 1 week ago, my GI system is still churning but worst is over.  If you want poison, this drug at 150 mg's may be good choice.  Am a little upset with my doc for prescribing.	F	65	1  times150 mg 1X M	7/7/2011
1	Strenghten bones	My physician prescribe Actonel because of a bone density test. I did my research about this drug.I am suppose to take this this pill once a month. This drug will make the bones very hard and brittle until they will break and become weak. I will not take this medicine. I also read the comments from other women taking Actonel, its dangerous. I will use my own remedy of eating the right foods and eating diary products. I will not put this dangerous drug in my body. I refuse to suffer with the many side effects .I am certainly keeping it real, its not for me!!!!!!!	I have read the ingredients in Actonel and all the side effects women are experiencing from taking this "Monthly Pill". I refuse to get my prescription fill for the first time.   No Way!!!!!!! 	F	56	  1X M	7/5/2011Email
1	osteoporosis	severe flu like symptons, chills,  fever, eye pain, headache, stomache pain, diarrhea,pain in my neck and other joints  , heartburn, chest pain	Even though this medication is made to repair my bone mass..I cannot function on a daily basis feeling ill all the time.. I want my life back and will do all I can to get the calcium I need to minimize my bone lost..The pain is unbearable. I will take my chances .This medication should be taken off the market..I've experience nothing like this before in my life..this is suppose to help me..by it feel like I took a poison pill and it has invaded every part of my body.

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!	F	18	7  months7 MG 1X D	3/4/2011Email
4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

1	Bipolar II	EXTREME mania, severe throat swelling starting within 24 hrs of first 2 mg dose, sweating, uncontrollable tremors, twitching, headache, tiredness, blurred vision, nausea, agitation, dizziness. I ended up in the hospital after 4 days on the drug. I was severely dehydrated.	I would NOT take this drug. Even if you are having few side effects now I would say it's extremely dangerous and not worth the risk. Especially do not give this drug to children! There are bound to be long term effects that are irreversible. I will have to see if my muscle aches, tremors and twitching will subside permanently. Not a good experience!	M	25	4  days	10/13/2007Email
5	Bipolar	constipation, incresed energy, suppressed appetite.	i love it! on 5mg for past 2 weeks. I used to sleep 10 hrs a day before meds, and now I'm wide awake after 5 hrs. I have so much energy right now. I had taken Depakote, which was awful, I slept 12+ hrs a day, and still felt drowsy. Lost 5 lbs in past 2 weeks.	F	28	2  weeks	10/12/2007
3	Paranoid schizophrenia	For a short while, I experienced akathesia, but this has now gone.	Abilify has stopped auditory hallucinations, which is a great blessing. Sleep is interrupted, but I find that useful for reading and studying assorted Christian publications and the Bible early in the morning when all is quiet.  My appetite is enormous, so am constantly struggling with the temptation to gluttony and "making a god of the belly". So the challenge is self-control to avoid putting on more weight. I can thoroughly recommend the book "Strength for His People - A Ministry for Families of the Mentally Ill" by Dr Steven Waterhouse, Pastor of Westcliff Bible Church in Amarillo, Texas since 1985, (published by Westcliff Press - www.webtheology.com; e-mail is westcliff@amaonline.com; Ph: (806)359-6362). His brother Mark, suffers from schizophrenia and he wrote the book  in honour of him and to help ordinary people who may also suffer from this awful condition, and as a guide and consolation to families who may be the primary carer.(125 pages; Bibliography has 1	F	53	69  days	10/10/2007Email
1	Depression	RESTLESSNESS RESTLESSNESS RESTLESSNESS, dizziness, tiredness, nausea, anxiety/panic, flu-like symptoms	My psychiatrist prescribed this medication for me to help the Prozac work more effectively, she said. I HATE this medication, and after three days of taking it I WILL NOT take anymore. I could cry- I've never felt in such a way in all my life. It was like the walls were closing in. EVERYTHING was too boring to hold my attention! All I could think of, and I mean ALL DAY, was how GOOD it would feel to just run around my neighborhood screaming at the top of my lungs. It was IMPOSSIBLE to get comfortable, and I felt panicky, as if I were going to suddenly run out of oxygen. It was horrible. I've never experienced such crippling side effects before from any medicine like this.	M	18	3  days	10/8/2007
5	Bipolar Disorder	Fatigue, but it's fine since I take it at night and it helps me sleep.	EXCELLENT! So far, so good! I have more energy and motivation than I have ever had. I also have little to NO obsessive thoughts, practically NO racing thoughts, and my mood has been greatly improved. I can't say enought about how great this medication has been for me. I actually feel normal!!	F	34	9  days	10/3/2007
2	Bipolar II	Jittery, manic frenzy, sleeplessness	If this doesn't make you want to jump out of your skin, I don't know what will. I felt like I could scale the walls.	F	24	7  days	9/21/2007
2	Bipolar I Disorder	Tremors, insomnia, headaches, agitation, increased energy	This seems like a medication that might work for major depression, but I just don't see how it works for Bipolar Disorder.  It's so stimulating I had to take it as early as possible in the morning to avoid sleeplessness at night and it caused me to shake and have WAY too much energy during the day.	M	22	2  months	9/21/2007
4	Anxiety/Depression/Paranoia	Some blurred vision and dizziness when driving.	Everything seems to be working well and I feel Abilify has helped me tremendously!	F	30	1  months	9/19/2007
3	Anger/Rage/Paranoid Thoughts	Extreme tiredness/exhaustion.  Blurred vision and body aches.	It has made me calmer and I feel a little aloof so I'm not worrying about things as much.  I don't know if the side effects are worth it though.  I'll give it another week and see.	F	30	2  weeks	8/23/2007
5	bipolar w/ anxiety, hallucinations	some tummy upset when starting the meds but otherwise none so far.	Abilify was a miracle for my 8 yr old. After 4 years of searching for something that would help with his panic attacks, terror, anxiety, audio and visual hallucinations and frustration/aggression as well as his hyperactivity he was ultimately prescribed abilify 7.25 mg.  This was a miracle drug for us and alone has solved all of his issues. I'm so happy my son feels as he says "calm and happy" and isn't afraid of simple things like rain and leaving the house. He has been on it for 2 months now and the change is so dramatic. I'm one of those who tried so hard not to put my son on medication but he is a different child now, happy and no longer unable to function. As another mother here said, it gave him his life back.

2	rapid cycling bi-polar disorder	have gained 10 lbs in 4months, urinate frequently,no sex drive, blurred vision, makes me intensely hungry after i take it.unusually tired	I'm on lamictal and klonopin and have been on both of those for almost 10yrs, drs have been trying to add something for a boost as the lamictal makes me a little blah feeling. I have tried everything and just started the abilify 4 months ago and i felt like it worked great at first then the longer i take it the worse my side effects have gotten, i thought something new was wrong with me since it worked well in the beginning it seemed but have been so tired its ridiculous. i'm glad i went back and researched my meds just in case and found all my problems are side effects of this med.	F	34	4  months	8/22/2007
5	BPII, BPD	In the beginning I had some "wooziness," but that passed quickly.  Overall, I've had no real side-effects.	It has helped tremendously with my moods and I am able to take it during the day, which is a great thing (I don't tolerate medications well, and most tend to make me very sleepy).	F	26	3  months	8/15/2007Email
5	BIpoalr disorder	The main side effect is not being able to sleep for very long, but I also have more energy and get more things done.	I have taken almost every depression drug out there, and thought that I was just supposed to feel detached or apathetic. Abilify has been a miracle for me. I have a sense of humor again, lots of energy and the negative critical side of me is GONE.	M	35	30  days	8/12/2007Email
2	OCPD, anxiety, mild depression	Listlessness, lethargy, fatigue, reduced libido, ambivalence, lip sore (?), weight gain (?).	I was feeling highly motivated for two weeks before starting on Abilify. I started 5 mg for 5 days, then ramped to 10 mg for another 2+ weeks. All of the side effects started out barely noticeable. Over the last 5 days or so, the side effects have intensified. [Note: Taking 30 units Lantis(insulin)/dy for Type 2 diabetes; My BMI is 38;  I'm also on 40-80mg/dy Prozac for depression/aggression, the last 10 yrs., w/ no side effects.] I suspect Abilify is slowly turning me into the PillsBury Dough Boy. So, I'm not waiting another 2 weeks to get the shrink's opinion. I'm stopping taking this Rx cold turkey-right now. Of course I'll call the shrink to let him know I'm stopping this med.. All side effects w/ no noticeable benefits for me (unless you like feeling like a human marshmallow). Of course, your experience may or maynot be positive, unlike mine.	M	53	3  weeks	8/11/2007
4	Bipolar 2	VIVID DREAMS (things I think about during the day, i dream about at night.  These dreams feel very real)  K.O. component (I fall asleep within an hour of taking abilify)	I take Abilify with LAMICTAL(mood stabilizer) & Remeron.  I have nothing bad to say about abilify except it doesnt give me the desired effect i'm looking for which is the semi-resurrection of my mania so i am able to be an intellect and have a personality.	M	24	2  months	7/21/2007
3	Schizoaffective	I'm on lots of meds, so I'm not sure what side effects are caused by abilify; I haven't noticed any.	Abilify helped things make more sense. It helped a lot with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. I stoped wearing sweatshirts in the summer shortly after the drug was started but didn't realize until later that the abilify was why. I would recommend this drug.	F	19	2  months	7/21/2007Email
1	supposed bipolar disorder	Mental "fog," totally detached from everything, and severe--and continuing, even after 18 months off Abilify--movement problems akin to Restless Leg Syndrome.	Despite 30mg being the maximum dosage, my psychiatrist had me on 45mg, and did not listen when I told him about the side effects.  So, after about a year on Abilify (as well as Seroquel and Lamictal) I took myself off the two neuroleptics.  And yet I still have moment problems, increasing when tired or stressed, all this time later.	F	26	1  years	7/21/2007
2	Aspergers Syndrome, Tourette's	Intense sleepiness for first day, then after second dose, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, intense akathesia. Four days after discontinuing, the akathesia is subsiding, and the insomnia is lessening, but still present. Also: intense feelings of hunger.	This drug was supposed to calm me, help me to focus, control repetitive behaviors and tics. It did the opposite. It made it very difficult for me to sit still and write or type.	M	45	3  days	7/9/2007
1	Bipolar 2	Tremors in arms hands.  Two right fingers don't function normally. Restless legs.	The restless leg thing was bad.  I felt like a hyper 5 year old.  Tremors in arms and hands almost as bad as Katherine Hepburn.  Two fingers on right hand don't function normally.  Since I throw freight as a package handler, I'm useless at work.  Also have the urinating issue, I wait until I HAVE TO GO, otherwise not much happens - unlike normal.  Took 10 mg without Cymbalta, then with it again.  I have stopped takeing Abilify on 6/30.  It is now 7/5 and side effects haven't stopped.  Tremor has actually worsened.	M	36	5  days	7/5/2007Email
2	Bipolar II Disorder	Constant mouth ulcers, toothaches, muscle pain	It helped control my disorder better than most medications, with a minimum of other side effects, but the mouth ulcers are too much when you can't even eat a decent cheeseburger without being in pain.  The toothache was from a still-growing wisdom tooth that only seems to come in when I've taken it.  My mother has reported similar symptoms, so I figure it's just a hereditary thing.	M	28	3  weeks	7/3/2007
1	depression, irritabiity	extreme nausea, I took 1/2 of this pill and vomited all night, dry heaves, you name it.  It was the most horrific experience, I will never,.. ever recommend this med, please beware!  I was also prescribed a 30mg tablet a day, and in doing more research found out that is the highest dose!  I think this nurse practitioner is a quack!		F	49	1  days	7/3/2007
4	Psychosis from PTSD	weight gain (despite claims that it doesn't cause weight gain)	Abilify has helped me think more clearly, rationally and aside from the weight gain, I've had no side effects at all.  I take the Abilify in the morning, as it tends to be a bit stimulating.	M	46	3  years	6/11/2007Email
5	schizophrenia	this drug is going to be similiar to the drug named BIFEPRUNOX(chemical name)coming out soon maybe end of 07 or 1st quarter of 08 it has a good side effect profile NO WEIGHT GAINNO INCREASE IN PROLACTIN LEVELSNO ADVERSE EFFECT ON BLOOD LIPIDS NO ADVERSE AFFECTS ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS NO QTc PROLONGATION	i will be taking my ABILIFY at 15mg until this drug called BIFEPRUNOX becomes availableI hope soon!

5	BP w/psychotic episodes; autism	My son has been on this med for two years and his only side effect has been minimal weight gain (about 20 lbs. in two years).	This medication worked very well for my son - stopped his visual and auditory hallucinations completely, decreased his motor tics, reduced OCD-like behaviors, and greatly reduced his aggression. This medication gave my son his life back; he is now able to function & communicate well and he is excelling academically.	M	12	2  years	5/17/2007
3	schizo/bipolar/depression	This medicince by far is the most effective when treating symptomsit has low impact on weight gain.  i recommend this drug if you have experienced weight gain with other anti physcotics such as seroquel and  zyprexa, i believe those drugs are linked to DIABETES, WEIGHT GAIN, and OVER EATING AND UNCONTROLLABLE HUNGER the dosing is very easy with abilify starting dose 15mg and that is the recommended dose you stay on according to my shrink abilify has not been found affective at higher does due to extreme side effects	this medicine made my eyes roll in back of my head once	M	32	14  years	5/14/2007
4	bipolar 1 disorder/mood instability	extreme tiredness, upset stomach, blurred vision, cold sweats, tremors (uncontrollable shaking) in hands.	I have been on and off this medication for 4 years and today is my first day back on it in 8 months. I feel very ill but I remember from all my past experiences that it takes a few weeks for your body to get used to and to respond(I just want to make that clear to the people that quit taking it after one day). I am taking 15mg but I'm pretty sure I'm going to start cutting my pill in half to lessen the side effects. Abilify has been highly effective in treating my irritability and mood swings, making me a pleasure, rather than a monster, to be around. Personally, I would rather have an upset stomach for a few days and be happy than to be constantly angry for the rest of my life. I took abilify with effexor a few years back and it sent me to the ER because I was shaking so badly I couldn't stand up. I am told it is dangerous to mix abilify with anything. Hopefully the side effects go away soon!	F	19	4  years	5/1/2007Email
5	bipolar/schizo-affectiver	As I went slowly up from 2.5mg to 15mg,- I experienced poor night vision;loud noises startled me at night;muscular aches and pains; always want to eat; tired all day but can't sleep through the night; restless, but tired.  Agitation, anger and anxiety came back if I didn't increase my dosage in about 4days.  I just began 15mg today. DR. said may go all the way to 30mg if we need to in the future.	Now, the good stuff--I'm calmer around people.  My anger is much reduced.  Oversensitivity is reduced. I'm able to cope with daily frustrations.  I'm no longer so irritable and impatient with people.  General anxiety, and nervousness to be around people is gone.  Bipolar mood swings are completely minimized and I recover from any emotional upset faster.  AWESOME drug for me personally!	F	38	1  months	4/25/2007
4	bipolar depression	weight gain (it was lithium's helper) spasming jaw, chattering teeth, tiredness, "wired, but tired"	This drug has kept me from falling any deeper into depressions. Both times it has rescued me from hospitalizations.  However, I do not like having to take two other drugs just so I can continue taking this one without the side effects.  Have to take cogentin and inderal both for the jaws and limb jerks.  Don't like that.	F	50	15  days	4/25/2007
3	Schizophrenia	increased sex drive, some tiredness, restlessness	Aripiprazole has being used to decrease the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and it has being effective at doing so. In my case, the side effects close to outweigh the benefits of this drug.	M	32	2  months	4/23/2007Email
1	Cyclothymia	Intense pain with muscle stiffness.  I might be diagnosed with Lupus now.  I never had these problems before I took Abilify.	I still have to have more blood tests to determine what is going on with the muscle and joint pain that I am experiencing.  I took 2.5 mgs. of Abilify for about a month and then felt like I was coming down with the flu.  It turns out that it was a rare side effect from this medicine, so I stopped taking it.  I am still in pain and it has been over 2 months since my last dose.  I am convinced that whatever my blood work says that I have it came from taking this medicine.	F	44	30  days	4/23/2007Email
5	schizophrenia	vivid dreaming, insomnia for the first four months	I lost 87lds on this drug and it gave my life back to me. No voices, no paranoia, no psychosis!!!	F	47	3  days	4/19/2007
1	bipolar disoder II, depression	I was vomiting the whole night after taking the first pill, the next day I was feeling sick that the only thing that I could do is just lying down in my bed; wasn't able to eat. I was feeling really sick, no drug made me fell that way	I took this medicine just for 1 day, and it was enough for me to decide that I wasn't taking it anymore. I was feeling really sick, just the same as when I was pregnant and having severe toxicosis , no drug made me fell that way. I'm going back to Depakote.	F	21	1  days	4/10/2007
2	schizoaffective, bipolar type	About three weeks after I started taking it, my entire body started gradually swelling up like a balloon, and I had this uncontrollable, horrible burning sensation in my legs and ankles. It got to the point where the swelling was so bad that I could barely move. I couldn't button my shirts anymore, my feet wouldn't fit into my shoes, and I had to go up a whole bra size (band AND cup). I found out, though, that only about two percent of the subjects in the clinical trials had this problem (and it's often an allergic reaction), so I must be special. ;-} Oddly enough, when I went off this, I got onto Risperdal, only to have the exact same reaction.	I was REALLY disappointed that my reaction was so bad, because it otherwise worked very well. I felt better than I could remember feeling in about 20 years. My mood swings went from every several minutes to ... not at ALL. I felt stable for the first time in a VERY long time, like I was finally on solid ground. The really WEIRD thing, though, was that for the first four days, I couldn't feel ANYTHING -- it was like someone had flipped a switch inside me and turned me off. After that, it took about another week to level out completely, but once I did, I felt GREAT.	F	28	5  weeks	4/5/2007Email
4	bi p[olar disorder	Tired. Very tired at first; now I don't even notice unless I stop taking it...then I'm a real c*nt to deal with and I am very irritable and angry.	When I started taking Abilify with Zoloft, I was very tired all day.  I felt like I had a wet blanket wrapped around my head, then they lessened the dose to 5 mg a day, and I'm fine.  It's subtle, I can't tell any effect at all from it unless I stop taking it.  Then it is like an immediate PMS.	F	37	1  years	4/1/2007Email
1	bi polar disorder	Started out on 5mg daily and over a period of 2 months was "upped" to 20mg.  By the middle of the third month, I developed the most horrible feeling, like wanting to jump out of my own skin, could NOT get comfortable, caused restless leg syndrome to go totally bonkers, made me pace and feel horribly panicky ALL THE TIME!  I had never in my life felt such an awful feeling!  Raging insomnia accompanied the whole ordeal, as well as vision trouble, completely unable to write a sentence or write my own name, for that matter due to hand tremors (which I still have sometimes to this day), constant feeling that the "dying to get out of my own skin or run screaming like a madwoman" feeling would NEVER go away.  It finally did, but golly did it ever take time.  That's the only thing that will help with the akathisia (acathesia)...time.  It took the same amount of time that I was on the drug, about 3 and a half months, for the feeling to finally start going away.	In all honesty, through bi polar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, severe panic disorder, visual and auditory psychosis at times, depression, etc., the ONLY time I ever truly even considered suicide was during the akathisia (acathesia) ordeal I went through, all due to the Abilify.  You don't know what utter hell and torment is until you've gone through the nightmare of akathesia, which for me was completely due to taking Abilify!  If it works for you, great, but be warned...try to stay on the smallest dosage that works for you...upping the dosage over a period of time can have this horrible effect on you too and I wouldn't wish the feeling Abilify caused me on my worst enemy!

5	BP 1/possible schizoaffective/PTSD	vertigo,(room tumbling end over end) one episode lasted two days, the other lasted one week, other than that no side effects. cannot be certain this medicine was to blame	abilfy helped me come down out of the sky, gave me very crisp feelings and perceptions of reality.  It dimmed out the white noise in my head, and for the very first time i can remember felt no noise in my head, just peacefulness.  Being numb from years of emotional shutdown, i actually had feelings surface for the first time, and had to start sorting through them and dealing with them.  sometimes it was painful at first because the pain was acute, but Id much rather feel now than be numb.  Ativan in combination helps deal with the tremendous anxiety.  Also take seroquel for sleep, and lamictal for the depression.  Overall, a good mix for me.  I would never want to go back to the worst moments of this illness before Dx and treatment, and for that I am grateful.	F	37	17  months	3/25/2007
5	bipolar1/ schizo	Restlessness   Severe at times.  strangeley, tiredness can acompany this or exist independently of it.  I feel agitated but clear headed.  i will accept the trade-off but feel that I must do something about side-effect.  Benzo helps. I forsee weight gain because I am hungry again.	I am only in the first week, but needed to speak of the progress I have made.  At just 5 mgs. I notice a substantial reduction in the chatter in my brain and I am better able to perceive and respond appropriately to social scenes, leaving me less sacred of people.  Paranoia is under control. i have been on several meds in my 20 year struggle with bipolar 1/schizo. disorder.  i am just coming off a psychotic break that lasted very long on and off.  I am what they call a quick responder when a med works for me.  So far wellbutrin (which i still take) Lamictal (which was like a god-send and then pooped-out, and now Abilify has improved drasticaly the picture in just 5 days.  Last night I could concentrate long enough to put a desk from Ikea together and I even cleaned my room.  Now i still have the memories of some terrible behavior and the knowlege of such negative poop-out tendencies of meds.  But for today I am grateful.  More later.  John. R.B. CA.

1	anti pyschotic, not needed	this drug made me walk like a zombie, slur my speech, I couldn't use my hands and fingers - it was like I had a small stroke, I couldn't lay or sit down - relaxing was very unconfortable, very nervous, loss of concentration.	I din't need anti-psychotics and was prescribed and administered them illegally.  I tried geodon, respirdal, and zyprexa too.  The abilify was by far the worst!  I was only taking 15mg., and I still had horrendous side effects!  This is a terribly dangerous drug.  I see no worth in any anti-psychotic or anti-depressant drugs, these drugs really mess with your mind and body. If you are having psychotic, bi-polar, depression, or whatever, and desire to take something.  Only take small dosages of anything, 10mg. or less.  These drugs can cause more harm than the disease!		41	18  days	3/12/2007
1	bogus court ordered "delusional"	Chattering teeth, leg shaking	I am forced to take the medication	M	42	6  months	2/24/2007
3	social anxiety,  ADD	Mood lift, more energy (too much at 1 mg), got very restless, felt calmer around people, woke up earlier with energy, became to restless and had to stop taking Abilify.	I would recommend this to anyone needing an AP. I just got too restless and would lose my train of thought in mid- sentence.  Not for me!  Abilify may work really well with you.  Try it out; you'll know very soon if its for you or not.	M	32	21  days	2/22/2007
1	bi-polar	very tired, headache, pressure above eyes	taking 200 mg lamictal, took 1 mg abilify for one day, just that small amount had a negative effect.  i'm exhausted.  i was told things would go the other way, but i don't like this drug in description or feeling, so i'm not going to take it tomorrow.	F	40	1  days	2/22/2007
3	Non-Specified Psychotic Disorder	My 17 year old has been taking abilify for 3 months.  The sleepiness disrupts his daily functioning terribly.  He leaves school early every day, sleeps several hours and gets about 8-9 hours of sleep every night.  He never feels well rested, but has no problem falling asleep.  He also experiences some muscular discomfort and dehydration.	We are currently weaning off of it.  He would rather deal with his symptoms then the side effects.  Doc has prescribed Luvox..hard to find info on it.  Not sure what we are going to do.  The abilify decreased his symptoms by about 90% on 10 mg. per day.	M	17	3  months	2/13/2007
5	Bipolar 2	weight gain/sweet cravings	Abilify has done wonders for controlling my aggression and irritability.  I am already taking Topamax and I have noticed  a slow weight gain from craving sweets since on Abilify (1.5 years) and Dostinex (3yrs).  I am going to try to give up sugar and junk to see if the weight comes off.  I am also coming off the Dostinex too to see if it is effecting my weight. I really need the Abilify.  I could tell a tremendous difference in my anxiety level when I went from 10mg - 15mg.  I take 15 mg. of Abilify every morning.	F	41	1.5  years	2/7/2007
2	BP1, SAD	jittery, wanting to crawl out of my skin.  can't sleep at night, can't take it during the day because then i can't work.	i would NEVER try this drug again....ick	F	25	4  weeks	2/5/2007Email
1	schizoaffective and OCD	terrible shaking, teeth chatter, neck pain, inability to stay in my seat, kept falling asleep, waking up in middle of night, lip quivering, lights bothered my eyes really bad, loud sounds bothered me bad.	I wish it had worked.  It really helped a lot with my illness.  But the side effects were impossible to handle.  I couldn't so much as eat dinner or read a book in any normal sense.  I wanted to just crawl out of my skin.  However, I must add that I take Paxil as well.  However, Paxil has never caused me any problems.my friend (same condition) also takes paxil and abilify.  both of us agreed that once we tried Abilify that mania was brought on.  For the record, Paxil has never done that to either of us until we had Abilify.	M	32	2  weeks	2/4/2007
4	Autism and Tourettes Syndrome	I was on Abilify for about 5 years and then had to go off of it.  I lost a great deal of weight when I went off of it, but my behaviors got worse. I could not think clearly. I recently went back on the Abilify and I have gained a great deal of weight in a very short period of time. Not happy about that.  Also, my appetite has increased slightly, and it makes me extremely tired.	This truly gets rid of tics (from Tourette's) and controls alot of the behaviors from Autism, but the side effects are just awful. There really is no drug out there that works as well, and that is a shame. Wish someone would develop a drug that didn't have so many side effects.	F	15	 	12/24/2006
5	Bipolar I Disorder	None whatsoever.	Silenced the voices, no more paranoia,able to think clearly, able to SLEEP, no weight gain here.No drowsiness as experienced with Seroquel.	F	42	4  months	12/23/2006
1	Bipolar I disorder - manic episodes	Severe eye tremors, double vision, hypersomnia, anxiety attacks, muscle weakness, severe depression, cloudy thoughts, hypertension.	Side effects were very severe.  I had to stop Abilify and increase my dosage of Lamictal.  The side effects completely abated after three days except for eye tremors which lasted about a week, hypertension lasted about another two weeks and then just plummet to normal.  Side effects first noticed at 10mg and then instantly severe at 15mg.	M	24	8  weeks	12/18/2006
5	Paranoid schizophrenia	The only side effects I noticed are a weight gain (40 lbs) and a slight case of insomnia (which could be the result of life stresses and not the medication).  The weight gain could be a result of the Risperdal I was taking in combination with the Abilify, not sure,  but stopped the Risperdal to see if I could lose a few pounds and remained stable on just the Ability (Don't tell my doctor). I have stopped gaining weight. I take the maximum dosage too, 30 MG. 	Since I started taking Abilify, I have the impetus to get up and out.  No other medication has had this effect. No delusions, hallucinations, voices or paranoia.  This is a great drug.	F	56	2  years	12/11/2006Email
2	Bipolar 2 hypomania	I cannot bear the side effects this drug has!  I Have no ability to THINK clearly on this med.  I am confused and retarded physically and mentally.  I am on disability, thank God! The only reason I am taking it currently is becasue I have been RX'd large doses of Prednisone )or a physical problem I have)which within 2 days made me totally manic! As fun as feeling hypomanic is, I didn't want to go over the top! So I reluctantly started taking abilify again during the steroidal treatment. I am in the taper down phase now of prednisone and abilify. I am looking forward to being on Trileptal alone again for treating my Bipolar disorder.	Since 1998 I had taken depakote and prozac, but then after gaining 80 lbs, I changed Doctors.  The new P-doc prx'd Abilify. I was unstable and had a lot of mixed states. I became all messed up---retarded, confused, irritable, sleep problems, inability to function in the medical field as a Sr. Veterinary Technician.  I needed meds to make me sleep and needed meds to wake me up...it was TERRIBLE.  My job performance was ridiculous.  The only reason I wasn't fired is that my boss and I had an understanding---and I was very very open about my BP. My Pdoc kept tweaking up the abilify and I got worse and worse. Finally, I decided he was a quack and I slowly tapered off ALL meds.  I became much better!  I was off meds for 18 mos before I cycled again and went back to the pdco to get treatment again.  I was relived he didn't force me to take abilify again until recently while I was taking steroids for another medical problem.  It knocks the heck out of any manic attack!  That is the one thing	F	42	6  months	12/10/2006
1	Bipolar Disorder II	Literally, I could not pee !  This drug was proscribed to "boost" the effects of other antidepressants, but did nothing at all aside from aggravate me.	Never would I take this medication again.....although, I have been told that I am like 1% of the 1% that have been recorded with this particular side effect.	M	38	1  months	11/13/2006
3	bipolar diagnosis after 25 yr lupus	extreme weight gain combination of depekote and ablilify  and trazadone for sleep severe depression and then slight stroke eight years ago. Lupus flair ups causes pain and not able to sleep i do not think i should have to take ablify medication for all these years, but want to decrease to 15 mg instead of 30 mg.  i went off the drug 18 months ago and ended up anxiety and panic striken and had to go to a week of health care around the clock to get back on medecine and then they added depekote because i was dizzy. during that stay at the help center i evened  out but they added a sleeping pill. I have no desire to do anything and if i let my mind get busy i start a lot of projects that make other family member crazy so it is best for me to  take several naps a day and stay calm. I eat compulsivley with out stopping to think about chewing and walk to the kithen to get a bite of food and would go back often if someone did not remind me not too.I do things in a hurry and shower half heart	has any one taken abilify as long as i have? over 2 years maybe three.and has any one mixed depekote that i have never had a seizure but they think this will control my bipolar actions. I think after my stroke and losing smell for 8 years.I visited a chiropractor last year and got my smell back, made my life a little better.  But i also take plaqenell, generic when my lupus flairs up and i have not had to take it the last three months. but someone said that they take celebrex for their lupus and i have always taken plaqeunell for the last 20 years when i have a flair up and i usually take it for three months untill symptoms subside. but i think when i went off the ablify on my own because of weight gain and being tired all the time is when it was really a bad week.  I was not rational at all and very anxious. enough that i wanted to go to institution and not ever come back home.  Said i would never go off the med again unless under a doctor that understood lupus and i was under 24	F	65	3  days	11/8/2006

5	Tourettes Syndrome	Slight increase in hunger, Tired during the day-yet restless leading to a constant uncomfortable feeling. vomiting about 3 times a day. restlessness is pretty bad	Wow. this drug has cleared my Tourettes 99%!! My tics used to be severe and constant, now they are rare and minor.  I can't believe I finally found the drug. It's worth the side effects for me. I can now get back to being social and enjoy college life.Only downside is if you dont have Insurance it cost about 750 bucks per month.	M	21	30  days	10/11/2006Email
4	severe depression	Insomnia, tiredness	I have been on Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal and Lexapro for severe depression for a little over a year. Recently, I went off the Abilify for two weeks in an effort to decrease my medication (under my Psychiatrist's supervision, because I want to get pregnant) and immediately became depressed and suicidal. Now I have been back on the Abilify for a week and I feel 'normal' again. The main problem that I am experiencing is insomnia at night and lack of energy during the day. Overall, it has really helped to balance my severe depression.	F	29	1  years	10/1/2006
