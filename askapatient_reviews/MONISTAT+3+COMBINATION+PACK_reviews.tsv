1	Yeast infection	As soon as I put in the applicator, I got the worst burning and itching sensation ever.  I had an allergic reaction to the product and ended up having to go to the ER... SO not worth it.  Just get a prescription instead.  The side effects were worse than the actual yeast infection	Never never never again.	M	22	1  days200 mg 1X D	3/4/2013

3	Yeast Infection	Burning sensation inside and out - relief from itching but feeling burning heat instead.	I would always recommend natural remedies over chemical anyday - however this is the first yeast infection i have had in ten years - forgot how they really suck! Tried garlic, but hate the way it tastes in my mouth even tho it is used as a suppository!It didn't help this time. Tried yogurt, and probiotics internally and externally /suppository for three days, no respite. As a last resort I went to monistat. So far it seems to be relieving the yeast infection (xtreme itchiness, redness, swelling but no scent or discharge symptoms) but there are side effects of heat and burning sensation for me. I think the more raw and chafed your skin is the more insistant and uncomfortable the application of the medicine / chemicals might be. I would recommend as a last resort if you cannot clear up an infection naturally. Prevention is the best medicine!	F	40	1  days 1X D	12/19/2010
