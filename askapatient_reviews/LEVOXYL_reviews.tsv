				F M	 	 	    
4	Low Thyroid (Hypothyroidism)	I had a slight increase in energy and appetite.	I did try Synthroid, but it irritated my lungs.  This could be due to the dye in the Synthroid, I'm not sure.  I called the Pharmacist and she said that Levoxyl probably had the least side effects of the Thyroid meds.  I tried it and had no problems.  I am still taking it today.  Just drink a lot of water with it, since it can dissolve easily in your mouth.	M	49	1  years50 MCG. 1X D	3/5/2012
2	Hypopituitarism Hypothyroid	Hunger, feel too hot when first take it and then too cold for the next 18 hours, JOINT PAIN, and non-improved hypothyroid symptoms.	I have been on every dose imaginable and sometimes combination with T3.  I still have syptoms of hypothyroid BUT feel even worse when I get frustrated and try to stop taking this.  (Reason for giving it a 2.)  According to blood tests my free T3 and free T4 and all other pituitary hormones are in normal range so not sure why my hypthyroid symptoms persist.

4	hashimoto's/hypothyroidism	none	i started on 25, and now am on 25/50, alternating.  i've seen improvements already, and i was very, very sick for years.  i think most of the people here who have complaints couldn't find the correct dosage, or perhaps when starting this medication hypo symptoms appear/worsen for a short period before they get better?  i'm very happy with levoxyl.  it's gluten- and lactose-free, it's well-regulated, well-tolerated, and seems to work well.

1	Hashimoto thyroidusm	After having taken levoxyl for 8 months my arms started to get numb and I ended up with a terrible pain in the muscle in my upper right arm.  Plus we were always adjusting my dosage - one dosage would work for awhile and then we would have to either increase it or decrease it depending on returning symptoms.  I have since switched to Naturethroid and I feel great.  Arm pain went away, as did the night sweats and general body achiness.		M	55	1  years100 mcg 1X D	1/17/2012Email
4	Hypothyroidism	It sometimes has kept me awake, but also slightly increased my appetite.  No other negative side effects.  Synthroid irritated my lungs (perhaps due to the dye in it) and Levoxyl seemed to have the least inactive ingredients.  So far, it seems to have given me more energy.	No major (negative) side effects.  Synthoid irritated my lungs, but Levoxyl worked fine.  I am pleased with it, but you do have to drink it with plenty of water due to the fact that it dissolves in your mouth quickly.	M	49	1  years50 MG 1X D	10/24/2011
1	Hashmoto--hypothyroid	Horrible experience---not sure is my doctor's bad practice or the medication. when is a good endo? have seen two so far, none of them are good and care about my experience. I was extremely ill after my doctor increased my dose from 25-50mcg. I fainted and went to ER twice and diagnosed with heart arrhythmia---multiple PVCs and PACs after seeing my cardiologist. I got very hungry and dizziness and had to laid down. Need to drink orange juice every 1-2 hours and feeling really sad and crying. I have to be home for months to recover from it. on top of that, my cardiologist wanted me to take beta -blocker, which can make my cardiac symptoms worse for my hypothyroid state. I am so glad I went to herbal for my heart arrthymia and I am fine now, but get symptoms when I am stressed. My health is never the same any more!!!I have been off the medication for 5 month now, but could not get back to 25mcg, it gave me Symptoms of dizziness and hunger right away. I stopped immediately. During the pe	I tried Sythroid before levoxyl---because Sythroid gave me itchiness.	F	46	2  years25-50 mcg 1X D	4/22/2011
5	Hypothyroid after Grave Disease	None	After radioactive iodine treatment for Graves Disease, my thyroid was disabled so I was prescribed Levoxyl. It took a little to get the right dose, but it's working fine now. There are now noticeable side effects.	F	51	1  years112 mcg 1X D	1/22/2011
5	Hashimoto's Thyroiditis	My side effects are only if my dosage is too low or my dosage is too high.  Must have frequent blood tests to make sure that my TSH level remains in the 2's.	According to the American Association for Clinical Endocrinologists, patients should not be taking generic thyroid replacement medications due to differences of bioavailability and other reasons that are too detailed for this discussion.  I am taking generic levothyroxine sodium and I don't even know the name of the company who makes this generic! My insurance company did a little switch-a-roo! I am going to see an endocrinologist and get the skinny on brand vs. generic levothyroxine. It never occurred to me until I started researching, why after 27 years on the same dose (Synthroid) with perfect TSH levels that I would have a problem on the generics.  For any person who is not feeling "right" on their current thyroid meds, I highly recommend that you see an Endocrinologist.  They are the specialists for thyroid concerns. Great web resource is located at: http://thyroid.about.com/	F	50	27  years112 mcg. 1X D	10/9/2010Email
1	Under active thyroid	Tried Synthroid I thought I was going to kill my self.  Tried Unithroid hair fell out in clumps had white pimples on my face  constipation and very moody.  Now on Levoxyl hate it hate all of it. Constipation all the time horrible mood swings weight gain etc..etc.  Take it off the market all of it.  There has to be some alternative medicine out there if so many people are feeling the same.  Drs. don't care to hear how this drug makes you feel.  Ban all this S*%#!

2	Hypothyroid/Thyroidectomy	lethargic	Had emergency thyroidectomy.  Dr put me on Levoxyl 125 then up to 150.  I just never felt good.  Not blaming the medicine at all.  But she noticed that my levels were not maintaining, so she since switched me to synthroid.  Much better.  She said sometimes certain drugs don't work on certain people.  Glad she noticed there was no change, because I feel a lot better on Synthroid 200mcg.	F	35	3  months125mcg 1X D	7/3/2010Email
3	hypothyroid	Tired at times, constipation, some digestive problems, seems to have aggravated other hormones, some breathing difficulties.	It helped me more initially, now I'm looking at additional options.  I do feel it helped my thyroiditis immensely quickly because I started having a reaction to a compounded formula that got dangerous.  With thyroid, it's a learning experience as is life - finding what mix works for your body and mind.	F	39	3  months100 1X D	6/17/2010
1	To perhaps stop nodules from growin	horrible body aches similar to firbromyalgia pain all over could not raise my arms above my head.  As soon as I stopped it it went away.	Am interested in replacing Levoxyl with Armour Thyroid my daughter in law had same reactions as I did to Levoxyl on Armour Thyroid she feels great.	F	66	1.5  years25 mcg 1X D	2/25/2010
4	Hypothyroid	MORE ENERGY, weight loss, some joint pain	Had previously been on Armour Thyroid, but the recent reformulation set me back. At this point in time, it is very hard to obtain natural dessicated thyroid (due to backorders and issues with the FDA) so rather than dealing with all that, I switched over to a Levoxyl Cytomel combination and am pleasantly surprised. The combination seems more consistent than the Armour and I've even dropped a little weight (which I couldn't do while on Armour, despite diet and exercise). Levoxyl and Cytomel are working nicely and I have no plans to change anything.	F	41	2  months	11/2/2009
3	preclinical hypothyroid	fatigue, hair falling out, dry itchy scalp and skin, always sleepy and tired, hair breaking off	has helped me with having more energy. Still sensitive to cold, depressed somewhat. I thought this medicine would bring my hair back but it looks horrible, thin and dry, worse than before I started. Been on it a year and still not at the correct TSH level.	F	70	1  years	10/13/2009
3	hypothyroidism	the texture of my hair has completely changed and I am constantly losing tons of hair. I want my old hair back. Besides that I have dry, itchy skin. I thought this stuff was supposed to get better on the drug.	I have successfully lost and kept off any additional weight that I put on prior to being medicated which is good. I also have more energy. I would still rather switch to a natural thyroid treatment though.	F	29	6  years	10/2/2009
5	Falling asleep while driving	None		M	57	10  years	9/8/2009
5	Hypothyroidism	Dry mouth. When the dose was incorrect I experienced heart palpitations and panic attacks	This drug saved me however, it took about 2 years for me to feel like a normal person again after starting the drug. I have not had any problems with weight gain or loss. I will need to take this for the rest of my life.	F	30	9  years	8/7/2009
1	Hypothyroidism/Hashimotos	Muscle and joint pain, hair fell out, fatigue, terrible weight gain, carpel tunel, tendinitis, arrhythmia, brain fog, etc.	What a horrible drug. I took this drug for 20 years because I was told there wasn't anything else for my hypothyroidism. It never worked and eventually made me very ill. I couldn't even walk up our stairs to go to bed. I had to sleep downstairs on the couch. I know it was the Synthroid that caused me so much misery because I switched to Armour Thyroid two years ago and all my symptoms are gone. All of them!	F	50	20  years	4/4/2009
2	hypothyroid	none	I had no symptoms of hypothyroidism. I went to my dr. because of severe side effects of fosamax even 10 months after stopping medication. I was taking fosamax for ostiopenia. Levothyroxin can also cause thinning of bones so I am leary of taking it especially because I had no symptoms of hypothy.	F		90  days	1/25/2009
3	Post-RAI Hypothyroidism	When I first started taking it (100 mcg), the sodium caused a lot of fluid retention and I felt as if I had consumed a lot of salt. If there was a way to manufacture this synthetic hormone with less sodium content, it would be better.  I suspect that it raises my blood pressure but I try to keep that in check with exercise.	I have to take Levoxyl or another thyroid hormone due to thyroid ablation following a diagnosis of Graves Disease. I feel better on 50 mcg.  I was still having muscle pain, soreness, cramps, twitches, overall weakness and fatigue after being on Levoxyl for over a year.  I was not properly converting the T4 to T3.  My endo added Cytomel and the combination of that plus Levoxyl seems to work well for me.	F	52	1.2  years	7/29/2008Email
5	hypothyroid		Stopped coughing and choking attacks discovered to be caused by enlarging thyroid pressing on trachea.	F	46	5  years	6/18/2008
5	Hashimoto's Thyroiditis	The only thing is it dissolves fast so I make sure to drink plenty of water with it.	I was on Synthroid for years and started having lactose intolerance issues with it. I have none on Levoxyl. Plus I think this medication works faster and better than Synthroid.If you want to lose weight because of weight gain caused by hypothyroidism you need to read about the Harris-Benedict Equation. Plug in your numbers and then you'll find out how many calories you need to eat per day just to sustain life. Many people trying to lose weight don't eat enough calories and starve themselves. As long as I eat enough calories, exercise and do resistance training, I lose weight quite easily.	F	54	1  months	6/3/2008

5	hypothyroid	None.  Had to bump up dose higher than doctor wanted to go, but finally felt relief of hypothyroid symptoms	This drug works, but exercise is key.  As a woman who is not in her 20's, you HAVE TO EXERCISE to the point of pushing yourself.	F	34	10  years	11/9/2007
