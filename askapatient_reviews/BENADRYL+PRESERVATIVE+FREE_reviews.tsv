4	Allergies, allergic reactions	Only side effect I ever have is a bit of drowsiness.	Works good.  After a couple doses the drowsiness is reduced, for me anyway.	M	35	 	9/29/2009
4	Medication Allergy	Worked great. Had a really bad allergy reaction to a medication and after speaking with my doc, he suggested I try benydryl for instant relief.  It started working within the hour.  I totally recommend for intstant allergy relief. However, the only drawback is you do become drowsy and it takes a while to leave your system.  Definetly not something to take afte 9pm as you will wake up extremely groggy.		F	24	3  days	12/26/2007
5	allergies, insomnia, muscle spasms	Drowsy, so I take 50 mg at night.	Wonderful.  Loosens muscle knots, sleep very well, relieves allergies.	F	40	10  years	3/10/2007
2	Poson Ivy	I got dizzy and spaced out and my hands started shaking whenever I drank caffeinated coffee and took the benedryl. It took me a few times to make the connection.		F	59	3  days	5/1/2002Email
