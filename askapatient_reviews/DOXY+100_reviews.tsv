4	Acne	Nausea	I suggest taking this medication with lots of water.  At least a glass and half.  It's best to take it with dinner, although it says to take it on an empty stomach.  PLEASE DON'T!  I tried this med years ago for 3 days and it felt as if I had pill stuck in my throat.  I've read many stories of people developing golf ball size lumps in their throats.  That's why I suggest tons of water and please do not lay down for at least 2-3 hours afterward.  I do notice a difference in my skin and the nausea I felt was gone after 3 days.

2	Sinus Infection	Anxiety, Stomach upset	I found that this medication made me quite anxious.  I would wake up at 4:00 am every morning while taking this medications and then once I stopped, I slept fine.  I also found that if I didn't take this with a large glass of water or if I lay down after taking the medication, I would have an upset stomach.   Although it did clear up my sinus infection, there is no reason to sleep only a few hours each night when there are other antibiotics available with less severe side effects.	M	44	10  days	2/13/2009
