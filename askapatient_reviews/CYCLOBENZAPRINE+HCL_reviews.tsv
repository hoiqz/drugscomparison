4	Used to treat muscle stiffness.	Drowsiness- Its advisable that this medication not be taken if you do not intend to rest the next day. Use care when operating a motor vehicle and/or electronic devices that require mental alertness.	Please be advised that this medication is muscle relaxant, NOT an analgesic, therefore it does not effectively provide pain relief. I use this medication to treat muscle spasms/cramps and stiffness. My usual dose is 10-20 mg qhs PRN.	M	27	3  years10-20 mg 1X D	2/14/2013Email
4	Fibromyalgia	Fatigue, dizziness	Normally this medicine isn't used on a long term basis but my doctor made an exception because it helps fight the fibromyalgia muscle spasms so that I can get a good night's sleep. Because I've been on it so long, I no longer feel tired from it during the day. It has not lost its effectiveness nor have I needed a dosage increase. This drug can easily become addicting so use in moderation is advisable.	F	23	2  years10mg 1X D	1/29/2012

5	arthritus and scoliosis	other than very sleepy after about 4 hours from taking it,it works good. you get a good night sleep and i have also found that when i take it like prescribed (3 times a day)i feel calm,relaxed and so peaceful,and for me this is GOOD because i suffer from ptsd due to childhood issues so the depression and anxiety are a battle,and this helps me with pain and my nerves.

3	Aggresive Pain in Spine	Drowsy	My Spine on the pain scale from 1 to 10 & 10 being the worst possible pain, my average day is right around an eight and with this drug my pain only drops to around a six.	M	29	4  days	12/22/2005
4	Tension Headache at base of skull	Drugged feeling in the morning...but tolerable.  Able to go to work.	Nothing would release my tension headache..which I've had 24hrs per day for 12 weeks.  This did start to release it.  I take 10mg per night and 5mg in the day.  I am also on Paxil and probably the two together make me feel more drugged than other people would.  But it's worth it to get some relief.	F	41	3  days	1/5/2005
