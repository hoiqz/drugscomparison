1	rosacea	none - yet?	according to the package insert metronidazole causes cancer in mice and rats but not hamsters. I'd rather have rosacea than cancer. (I was taking the gel version of this drug.)	F	36	5  days	3/22/2006
5	Rosacea	None!	I am so happy that I finally found a dermatologist smart enough to put me on metrolotion.  I am incredibly fair-skinned and for several years I had been getting very red, very hot cheeks at some point during almost every day and didn't know why...when I started applying metrolotion twice a day my symptoms disappeared almost immediately.  I definitely notice, too, when I skip a dose.	F	26	3  years	7/13/2005
