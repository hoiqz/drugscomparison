1	Mild acne	Leg cramp, heart beat slows down or irregular like you think you're gonna die, loss of muscle tone, breathing issues, saggy skin and floppy muscle on face and body that you never get it back! You might die if your heart stops! Not able to walk and use your arms to open the door or hold a spoon in your hand, partial paralyzed. Dangerous,  aging, Carcinogen. Muscle damage!	I ended up in emergency else I would die! Seriously dangerous. The worst part,  muscle  and nerve damage, kidney failure won't come back & you look like an old lady in your 20's because of saggy body and face, ataxia is an irreversible side effect of this medicine! I read wikipedia, Mayo clinic...  They don't tell you all side effects but I read ataxia but didn't know what it is.	F	23	21  days25 mg 2X D	12/31/2012
5	Acne and mild hypertension	mild heart palpations on occasion. Usually right before falling asleep I could feel my heart rate slow down, and skip a beat, then start again. Weight loss (skinniest I have ever been in my life!), high energy and felt great.	I started taking Spironolactone after talking to a co-worker about adult acne. (She was Canadian) and said that her Doc had perscribed her 100mg/daily of Spiro for her adult acne and she had no side effects. I made an appt with my Doc and she investigated it and finally decided that I could give it a try. It took about 2 months before I started noticing ANY side effects (good/bad). i.e. I did not see any results for 60 days. After 60 days my skin was completely clear of acne (face, chest and back all clear), I was 10 lbs skinnier, I was sleeping good and was in overall good spirits! After a few months (maybe 4-6?) I started experiencing some heart palpations or instances where it felt like my heart would stop....then start again. When I talked to my Doc about it, she was intrigued. We ran tests, but could never come up with anything conclusive. Over the years I have started and stopped this drug due to a pregnancy and trying to alleviate acne with other more natural solutions... but to date, this has been the only drug that ever worked and had positive side effects for me. (previously on Accutane {throughout high school years}, Anti-bacterial Antibiotics {daily rx as a young adult}, Yaz/Yasmine, Ortho tri cyclen/Sprintec, Desogen/Apri {over 15 yrs}, antibacterial soaps for topical treatments in excess to hundreds of topical rx's that never worked). I am now 29yrs, but writing the review from my experiences when I was actively taking the rx, daily, at 23-25 yrs.	F	24	2  years100mg 1X D	12/12/2012Email
4	PCOS/Cystic Acne	No side effects	I have been battling cystic acne for many years.  I have gone through 2 rounds of Accutane among other meds with no success.  I started taking this medication 4 weeks ago and have already seen clearing of my skin and a lot less breakouts.  I also suffer from severe headaches and migraines for have battled them for about 23 years now.  I have had a dramatic decrease in my headaches since taking this medication.  I am so pleased.  The dermatologist could not explain the change in headaches but I spoke with my nuerologist stated that I most likely have been suffering from hormonal headaches and that because this medicine reduce the amount of testosterone levels and therefor may be reducing my headaches.  I am just very happy for the relief.	F	36	4  weeks50mg 2X D	7/18/2012

2	Thinning hair acne unwanted hair	I stop taking the meds. For three days, and started it again because I was drinking a lot . My breast are bigger.  Don't like that. Im also taking antibiotics with it and the sec. Dosage make me sick. Hair loss is the same. Still thinning . Don't know what to do. Take or not. Does anyone drink and take this med? Is it safe to drink while taking it?		F	36	6  months50 1X D	5/18/2012Email
5	Hormonal Adult Acne	Since I increased my dosage to 50 mg I have been experiencing and increase in the acne return.  So I decided to cut my pills in half and go back to 25mg.  I did that about 2 days ago and have not seen any additonal new acne appear.  It seems that with this drug its possibly mg sensitive.  25 seems to be my number, for now anyways, kind of like the sleep number bed, there might be a number with this too that works for each different individual and their body.  Which I guess makes sense b/c it's all about balancing your bodies homormone levels.  Too much seems to give adverse effects.	I will write back in about a month or if I make any new changes.	F	32	44  days25 1X D	4/26/2012EmailHistory
5	acne	Irregular menstrual period (21-32 days). I usually have mood swings (irritable and anxiety) prior to menstrual cycle. Aldactone helps with the mood swings. I also notice increase of urine output on the first 1-2 hours after taking aldactone, but after that urine output is normal. Slight dizziness on the first 2 months of taking aldactone, not a problem anymore. I still have 1-2 acne(s) around menstrual cycle. My face has cleared up a lot. No breast tenderness, no constipation, no palpilation. I'm looking forward to continue this medication.		F	32	6  months50mg 1X D	3/9/2012Email
3	Acne	So far peeing a lot more and dizziness the first couple of days which has decreased slightly. Also helping with my insomnia. So far haven't seen much change in acne. My skin does appear to be drying out slightly but still have acne on my t-zone		F	18	10  days100 MG	3/2/2012
2	irregular periods and excess of hair	there is no loss of hair seen but i guess the hair growth have increased and i guess breast enlargement is also bcz of this medicine,its better not to go 4 such medication		F	20	1  years50mg 1X D	2/11/2012
2	Hiar loss	My fibroids were enlarging and PAINFUL! So where these sharp, stabbing, pains that afflicted my breasts. I found out this med was carcinogenic, promotes cancer! WHAT? HOW COULD THE FDA ALLOW THIS?!!! I'M SO HURT AND DISAPPOINTED THAT THE GOV would do this to us!		F	39	60  days100 1X D	2/4/2012Email
3	Acne (cystic)	Irregular menstrual cycle. Lowered sex drive.I was VERY hesitant to start this drug. After many dermo. appts the Dr. started me on 100mg. Periods came every 2 weeks with no cramping (plus... but very much an inconvenience). Lowered dosage to 50mg. after 2 months. Period didn't come. Decided after irregular cycle it was time to stop. Dr. said stop immediately... no need to wean off. Got period next day after 35 days without. Since discontinuing med. feel more emotional, period came after 2 weeks again (15day cycle), experiencing more cramping. Blah.		F	27	4  months25-100mg.	1/16/2012
1	for adult acne	i felt like death.  the directic effects of the drug made my mouth horribly dry, me feel weak and dizzy, and lightheaded.  i'd taken lasik before for weight loss, and felt just as bad then. directics just don't agree with me.	i specifically went to a dermo and asked for spiro and was very disappointed with the way it made me feel.  i work in sales and a dry, sandy mouth was no good! bad for teeth as well, not to have normal saliva lubrication.  it encourages plaque etc.  i now go to another dermo, have weekly glycolic peels, use neostrata glycolic at night, and also have  started valette oral contraceptve.  this works a treat...sore boobs from pill tho	F	45	21  days30 1X D	12/24/2011Email
5	Hormonal Acne		A miracle drug, as far as I am concerned! I have had acne all of my adult life and have tried every type of acne treatment (except oral accutane) and birth control pill in the past 20 years.  Nothing worked until I tried this. My skin has NEVER been this clear. Made such a difference in my life! Just note- if you are new to aldactone- it  works slowly.  It took about 4 months before I saw any lessening of the breakouts. Stick with it- it does work!	F	40	3  years100 MG 1X D	12/20/2011
5	Acne,facial hair growth,pcos	Frequent urination,slight weight gain with a drastic increase in breast size (up 2 cups!),increased sex drive,slight dizziness in the beginning	I had terrible cystic acne for about 10 years.I was on everything,topicals,antibacterials,you name it.All that was left to try was spiro or accutane.I started of on 25mg of Spiro,and then increased to 100mg.M skin is no loner oily AT ALL,and my face is CRYSTAL CLEAR.I mean it,not even a small pimple ever! Despite the small weight increase (which could have been from another medication)Spiro has worked wonders for me!! It is one of the best things I have ever tried.	F	34	2  years100mg 1X D	11/6/2011Email
2	PCOS, Acne, Hair Loss	My cystic acne signficantly increased after about a week of taking the drug and seems to get worse every day.  New breakouts form and they're large and painful.  I have also gained about 3 to 5 lbs and went up a dress size in the short time I've been on it.  I am hoping that eventually the acne will improve since it is one of the main reasons for starting this RX and that the weight gain is only temporary.	My hair is not falling out as much.	F	27	3  weeks50 1X D	10/19/2011Email
5	PCOS, Hair loss and edema (ankles)	Some dry mouth.  Some light dizziness at times but I relieve that symptom with a tasty dill pickle, I have to drink water more frequently, I don't feel like I pee more frequently, I have less oily scalp, feel more feminine than I ever had in my life, higher lebido, I've lost almost 30 lbs now, the hair on my head is growing very fast adn I can hardly believe my eyes! I experience less joint pain when I do physical activities like walk or ride my bike, increased energy and increased feeling of well being.  It occured to me after walking around a warehouse type store the otehr day that my legs and feet were not killing me and I still have a spring in my step!	I have complete faith that I am on the way to a cure for my condition.  I am pleased that I read about this product after being diagnosed with PCOS.  I am on a low potassium diet to be on the safe side  (especially avoiding things like chocolate, bananas and potatoes). I am walking about 45 minutes a day.  Another side affect of my PCOs is that I have high cholesterol which is going down too because of the increased activity and better eating habits on my part.  I am also not eating the red meat and cutting out Dairy quite a bit going soy, chicken and fish.  I have 90 lbs to go to be down to my goal weight, so I will check back in with you all in December.

5	Decomp cirrhosis (edema) from Hep C	I like this drug.  I started on a higher dose.  It worked to prevent edema and ascites (fluid in the abdomen).  I've been able to reduce the dose and the side effect of breast enlargement.  Libido is reduced	I take fluid, or, better yet, electrolyte replacement (Gatorade) to prevent muscle cramps.

4	acne	Weight gain		F	33	4  years100 1X D	8/18/2011
5	Hair loss	Drinking water a lot as it goes straight through me. Periods are irregular and coming every 2-3 weeks though very light.	Drug is helping hair loss, was told it would take from 6 to 12 months to start to work. Upped the dosage from 25 to 100mg and noticed it working after only a month. Have a lowered libido and was wondering if anyone else is experiencing this. Always had problems with constipation, but this has now rectified itself. Weight gain is not a problem at all any more. I love the drug. No other side effects, however will cut down gradually to see if the libido picks up.	F	45	5  months100 MG 1X D	8/5/2011
5	Acne	None	Love it. After years of acne I am thrilled taking Aldactone.  It is the only thing that keeps my skin clear. It also seems to help keep my blood pressure normal.	F	51	3  years100 MG 1X D	7/24/2011Email
4	acne	stiff muscles caused by low sodium	I've been on aldactone for several months, seen solid improvement in my moderate acne.  It has helped much more than any thing else I have ever taken, birth control, antibiotics, topical gels, etc...  I think it's worth a try if you are plagued with stubborn acne but definitely need periodic blood tests to make sure you are staying healthy.  Caused my sodium levels to fall below normal and now have to drink lots of electrolytes to maintain a normal level.	F	34	 100 1X D	7/2/2011Email
4	Acne	Breast tenderness, weight loss	Has worked great for me. I currently use this with retin-a and duac gel, the combination has given me awesome results for my acne! I have been on every oral medication out there for acne besides Accutane and Aldactone has worked wonders even at the low dose I'm on. My skin tone is even brighter and I have no new break outs.	F	30	2  months50 mg 2X D	6/12/2011
3	heart condition	After two yrs on drug, SEVERE breast enlargement for a male. Getting sent to surgeon to rule out cancer.Also, looking up side effects, finding it causes leg and feet pain which has progressed for me.		M	70	2  years25 mg 1X D	1/26/2011
5	Hair loss, acne, hirsutimsm	Breasts got larger, body shape more feminine, weight very steady	I started this medication mainly for the hair loss. My hair loss was a combination of telogen effluvium and androgenic alopecia from PCOS. The hair loss leveled out and only slightly increased over the years. My skin has improved from cystic acne to people telling me I have some of the best skin they have ever seen.  I never get a pimple. One of the most striking things is what has happened with my body and weight. Prior to starting this medication, I dieted and exercised hard core all the time and my weight would range from 128 (if training) to about 146 and the swing would occur throughout the year. I would have to work hard to keep below 142. When exercising, I would also bulk up in a way that did not look very feminine in the upper body. Spironolactone stopped that. My weight is a constant 130 with or without exercise and I have not dieted since I started this medication. I no longer have a huge appetite and all binging behavior ceased.  I can eat what I want and if I gain even a pound (such as on vacation), it comes right off.  When I get sick, my weight drops to the mid to lower 120s so actually, keeping weight on is more of a problem.	F	35	7.5  years50 mg 2X D	11/28/2010
3	Acne & excessive hair	Periods are lighter. Same period pain. I'm more emotional & I cry more (but happy tears.) I urinate a LOT. I have an INCREASED sex drive. I've noticed some hair on my body is lighter.	My Dr put me on it for excessive hair, & I take it for acne, as it cleared my friends hormonal acne. Weird thing is my hormone tests come back normal. I have a high sex drive, but Aldactones suppose to decrease it, I find it increases mine even more, which is weird. It's testosterone that makes us aroused, oh well. I'm a happy person, but find I'm more emotional on it, I cry more, but happy tears. I'm still breaking out heaps, but the pimples are not as big. I also use proactiv. I've noticed this week my body hair in some places is lighter. I also did laser hair removal on my face 4 wks ago & not 1 hair has grown back. I want to see what happens after being on Aldactone for 6 months in conjunction with laser. I know Aldactone increases fertility & causes birth defects in male fetus' so I'm unsure about it for that reason, I don't take the pill because of it's risks!	F	30	2  months100mg 1X D	8/3/2010
5	acne, hirstuitism, oil production	Having to pee a lot! But that was okay, because it helps with bloating. You definately need to stay hydrated if you are on this medcation, though.Also, I was a little worried at first about drug interactions when I took ibuprofen for period pain (spironolactone and NSAIDs interact with each other) but because I take such a small amount of ibuprofen and only one time each month, I haven't any any problems.	It works! Cleared up my moderately severe acne (after two courses of Accutane) and made my skin and hair much less oily. Yay! Also, it reduced my body hair by about 40% - the hairs grow back slower after I pluck or shave, and they are less thick and dark. I am taking a faily high dosage though (I think the highest doctors will prescribe is around 300 mg) so that may be why it is so effective for me. When I was at 50 mg it did much less (although it still did something). Accutane was good, but Spironolactone is great! And unlike Accutane, you can take Spiro long term. Some doctors may have their patients do blood work once a month since Spiro can raise potassium levels, but because I eat a pretty low-potassium diet, my doctor saw no need. Just watch out for too much salt, NSAIDs, and bananas!	F	20	9  months100 mg 2X D	8/1/2010
5	excess facial hair	Significant weight loss.	I have nothing bad to say about this medicine.  It has worked wonderfully for me.  Facial hair reduced dramatically, it does take some time to be able to tell a difference.  Its definetly worth the wait.  I went off aldactone for about 2 years to try to get pregnant and hair did return.  Started taking again this week.	F	31	5  years100 2X D	6/16/2010
5	PCOS, non insulin related	No side effects if I take it in combination with BC. Without BC, it causes immediate and extreme constipation and airy gut- within  minutes- which is highkly painful. It is mostly bloating that happens, but this is only if I dont take it with BC. Otherwise, NO side effects!	I want to chronical my use of this drug. Previously I had tried it unknowngly WITHOUT a BC pill and had the terrible but reaction described to the left; Now I take YAZ to treat my PCOS and funnily it lends me tolerance to other drugs I previously could never tolerate. Now, I am slowly losing small amounts of weight and I feel a settling or soothing effect physically and chemically from takign this. It feels like whatever has been attacking my body, is now gone and I can finally relax. I also do not have the horrible urinary retention and constant thirst/dry mouth I used to have- even though I drink more and urinate more now than previously. I can finally drink an entire glass like a normal person would, without dreading the weight shwoing up on me the next morning and never comign off of me again. :) I want to up the dose after reading some other reviews; but will be carefult ot take it at night because it can make you a bit drowsy- just a tad. But its way less fatigue than untreated PCOS causes, by far!!!  I am happier, friendlier, and have INCREASED libido rather than less; I finally felt physical pleasure from sex which was unheard of for me. I give it 2 thumbs up!!! I'll be back later to write about it more.	F	26	7  days50 1X D	6/14/2010
3	Acne, Facial hair	My dermatologist prescribed Aldactone for my hormonal acne and facial hair. So here are the pros: the hair on my head stoped falling out, I mean I lose 1 hair a day. Cons: I started breaking out with monster big cysts. This can be due to stopping my BC Yaz. I started to take the pill again in hopes the cysts go away. I also gained about 3 lbs in the past two months. I've been a size 4 for the last 10 yrs with zero weight gain. I gained the weight in my upper body, love handles and upper back (bra buldge) ewww.		F	31	2  months50 1X D	5/23/2010
4	Hormonal acne	No significant side effects, slight increase in breast size with some tenderness, after one week I had one day where I lost a considerable amount of hair but haven't experienced that rate of hair loss since that one day.	So far I am very pleased with aldactone for hormonal acne. I am 52 years old and have been searching for an answer for my hormonal outbreaks for 20+ years and I was getting very discouraged. I have seen numerous dermatologists who would only give me antibiotics or topical treatments which have done nothing for me. I finally found out about aldactone after doing yet another search online and after reading all the input here and elsewhere, decided to give it a try. I am also prone to unwanted chin hairs that I would have to tweeze on a daily basis and during the first week of using aldactone I didn't even have any to tweeze, in 3 1/2 weeks I've only had 6 hairs grow on my chin, BIG difference. Face, back and chest skin is definitely smoother and slowly improving. I rate this drug a 4 because it is still early in my treatment but if this improvement continues I will update my rating to a 5. I am on a low dose of 25mg and understand it takes time to get results. I am so happy to have found this, it was my last best hope but things are going good so far!

5	Hormonal Acne	Dry mouth, increased urination, weight loss	I Love Aldactone!! It completely cleared my acne by 3 months, first time I have ever had clear skin...great!!	F	40	6  months100 MG 1X D	4/7/2010
3	Acne	I get breakouts really bad especially during my time of the month. My acne is so bad that the pimples always leave scars so my doctor recommend Aldactone. My acne is the worse on my forehead and sides of my face. I have been dealing with acne since i was a teenager and for over the last 12+ years nothing has worked.	I like Aldactone. Compared to antibotics aldactone works a lot better. I'm not sick while taking it. I've noticed less breakouts now. I did also notice that my period after the first month came but was very light and didn't last long at all.	F	27	30  days 1X D	4/6/2010
5	Hormonal Acne	Personally, I don't remember any side effects. I did gain weight in the last three years (like 20 lbs) but I attribute that to my eating habits.	I love this medication! No more cystic acne! I only get tiny pimples now, but when I change out my pillow case every few nights it helps. My oil slick skin is so much more normal! It was so embarrassing to have such an oily face. Now its awesome! I have been very happy for the last 7 years. Beware, though, you must taper off this medication and not stop cold turkey. I have since tapered down to 25mg in the last couple of months and find the results still positive.	F	40	7  years100 mg 1X D	3/12/2010
3	adult hormonal acne	Feeling very tired. Hopefully this will improve after a while. Frequent urination as expected, but only for about 6hrs after taking pill. Having a heavy cycle this month, not sure if this is related or not.	No improvement in my skin as of yet, however it has only been a week. My problem with acne is on my neck, chest, and back. Antibiotics did nothing for me. Wanted to give this a try before moving on to Accutane as a last resort.	F	36	10  days100mg 1X D	3/4/2010EmailHistory
5	acne	In the past couple months I gained 15 lbs. Up 3 pants sizes. I'm hoping that with more aggressive exercise I can get back to my normal weight.	Completely cleared up my terrible cystic acne. I no longer get a single pimple. Its really amazing. I take it with birth control, but have been on the birth control for 9 years.	F	25	6  months50 MG 1X D	2/21/2010
5	hormonal /cystic acne	Some weightloss...nothing extreme, i did notice a slight increase in breast size, I feel like it can make me tired...but the positives outweigh any negatives.  I had been on this medicine previously for 2 years with incredible results. Nothing else had ever worked for me. I stopped taking it for about a year and the acne started coming back so I am back on it but had to just step up to 200mg.  I also am on a low dosage b.c. pill.  I would recommend it to anyone with hormonal or cystic acne!!!		F	39	4  months100mg 1X D	2/18/2010

1	acne, hair loss	palpitation (tachycardia), heart ache, heart skipping a beat, fatigue, increased anxiety, migraine headaches	no improvement with hair loss whatsoever. I was on and off this drug for a few years for acne and hair loss Does help with acne (temporarily. as long as you're taking it). However, whenever i took it i had heart problems (never heart problems before this drug) and had to stop it due to that. Now it seems like the heart pain is becoming much worse. Will have to stop it.

2	Adult onset acne	Fever,rash,edema (20lbs in two days), swelling of face.	It is an anti-androgen and is supposed to help women in their peri-menopausal years with acne. It quickly cleared up my cystic acne and break outs too bad I had an unusual allergic reaction!	F	40	14  days	4/29/2009
3	Hormonal Acne	Irregular periods, confusion, lethargy, weight gain	I started Aldactone because of hormonal acne.  I'm on month 5 now and have seen some improvement - my acne is not all gone, but it is less of a problem.  I have actually gained weight, even though it's a diuretic, my body shape is changing. Just started the pill to help in hopes that I don't have to stay on this for too long.  I'm not convinced it's a miracle drug, but it does help, with some side effects.	F	39	5  months	4/16/2009
3	androgen blocker & facial hair	Confusion, fever, sweating, heart palpitations, MOUTH ULCERS!!	At first it made my mood tranquil which made me want to keep taking it almost addictive, then I started getting cloudy and feeling confused, gave my boyfriend a hard time :(  then had awfully painful mouth ulcers so I called the doc and he said stop taking it and going back to see him next week. Once I stopped taking it I actually felt better	F		14  days	3/10/2009Email
4	Excess facial hair, PCOS	Side effects included: more urination, dry eyes, thining of head hair.	I was a 100mg dosage last year for about 6months and lost my excess weight, and excess facial hair. I started Aldactone again 3 months ago on a 50mg, seems much better. No thining head hair, do not have to pluck facial hair everyday, less period pain and lighter periods. I'm also on the pill, so the combination of both seems to work well.  I will stop aldactone before I decide to have children.	F	27	3  months	2/2/2009
4	adult acne	I've been on a low dose,50mg,for 2+years. Miraculous results in clearing up acne but now deal with embarrassing rosacea. A distinct red mask will flush my face in stressful situations or when drinking wine. Since this occurs in mostly social situations it is problematic.  Monthly periods have become irregular(4 days later than expected-regularly), painless and greatly abbreviated.  Breast size has also increased 1 size. I have also noticed general weight gain in my upper body,arms and chest.  Even with adverse affects, acne improvement outweighs side affects for now.		F	39	2  years	1/21/2009
1	excess testosterone, hirsuitism	Irregular periods (didn't have any for months at a time and when i did it would only last a day, where before i started taking aldactone my periods were very regular and lasted 5-7 days)However periods were much lighter and not painful(i used to have pain in the first day or two of my period)I was always thirsty, which caused frequent urination. Headaches due to dehydrationInfrequent dizziness due to lowered blood pressure	I was prescribed this because i have excess hair growth on my face an body. However there has been no noticeable change whatsoever. I was taking two tablets a day or 200miligrams with no good effects, only side effects. Im now taking myself off this drug; gone down to 1 tablet for a few days then i will stop completely. Would not recommend this drug	F	18	3  months	11/29/2008Email
5	acne, very oily skin, facial hair	No side effects have been experienced at 50mg.	This medication is wonderful.   :o)   My skin cleared up completely, and in a very short amount of time.  My skin is no longer as oily as it was.  I've been using the medication for 5 months, and am very happy with the results so far.  I have not really noticed any significant change in the amount of vellus hair, but I'm hoping that with time, that will decrease as well.	F	35	5  months	11/27/2008
5	hormonal acne	No noticeable side effects.	My dermatologist started me on this drug at 150mg over a month ago because of my allergies to most antibiotics. I have noticed a definite decrease in break-outs and excessive oily skin. My skin is so much clearer. It has definitely made a difference.	F	49	5  weeks	10/30/2008
4	acne, rosacea	Fatigue- especially the first few weeks when starting and then again when I increased my dose.Currently on 75 mg with a goal to get on 100mg. Doing it slowly since I am having fatigue.I have had some mild anxiety symptoms since starting- I have a history of anxiety that has always been well controlled on Lexapro- but I feel like the Aldactone has decreased the potency or effectiveness of Lexapro.	My acne is doing so well it is almost worth any anxiety I feel!	F	35	3  months	10/18/2008
3	acne	Initially: light headed, shaky, sweaty in mornings, decreased ability to exercise intensely; better after adding sodium.	My blood pressure runs on the low side to begin with, so this drug hit hard initially. I started drinking water with a quarter teaspoon of table salt added in the mornings before exercising, and that took care of the problem. Also added more salty foods to my diet, as I eat a lot of foods which are high in potassium. This probably wouldn't be wise for anyone taking this as a blood pressure medicine. Jury is still out on whether it helps my skin as I am also taking antibiotics for a few weeks.	F	47	18  days	9/21/2008
2	hursutism associated with PCOS	Dry mouth, dizziness, rosacea increased substantially, hair thinning	Hair on face reduced noticeably. Not worth the side effects. I may try again after a break.	F	42	60  days	9/5/2008

5	acne	no adverse side effects, only positive ones:  weight loss, huge improvement of acne, slightly increased breast size, no pms symptoms, mood elevation,	This is a miracle for me after 35 years of battling acne, this drug makes my skin look fantastic with no side effects.  I was on minocycline for many years and developed horrible joint pain.  Had 4 treatments with accutane and dreaded going through it again, so decided to try this and am so glad I did.

5	PCOS	dizziness, stand up too quickly feel lightheaded, dry mouth	This has been a wonderful medicine for me.  It completely controlled the hormonal acne problems.  Seemed to slow the hair loss and controlled the excessive hair growth on other parts of body.	F	43	8  years	6/9/2008Email
2	Hair Loss	Extreme anxiety, depression, fatigue, possible modest weight gain	Brand is much stronger than the generic version;  but after 4 months have not seen any improvement in hair thinning;  anxiety has become unbearable -- will probably have to discontinue use.	F	30	4  months	5/2/2008
4	hormonal acne	Always feel dehydrated.  Some increased urinary frequency, depends on the day.  Sometimes get headaches.  Sometimes feel dizzy and lightheaded due to lowered blood pressure.	I am on 50 mg, a very small dose.  I think it has helped my acne but I also use several other medications - two topically plus birth control.  So I really don't know how much it is doing.  I am getting tired of taking this drug I think, and hope to get off it soon. I always feel dehydrated and I think I have lower energy than I otherwise would.	F	27	9  months	4/8/2008
4	PCOS and Hypertension	some drowsiness but for the most part I really haven't noticed any side effects.	My blood pressure is down to 128/70 which is Amazing compared to 160/100.  I will check back in a few months to let you know about my excessive hair issues due to high testosterone and PCOS.	F	21	33  days	12/11/2007

3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.

1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant.

Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.

5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011

I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011

1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me.

Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie).

2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.
