1	hypertension	Unsafe Drug For Me	Thank goodness for this website.I thought I was the only person with adverse reactions to this drug.My Doctors tell me it's all in my head.Diovan makes my bp numbers normal.Buy the side effects are horrible.Numbness in toes,sexual problems,constant muscle pain,etc.Other people have success on this drug. Many others don't.I just can't endure these negative effects anymore.And these side effects came on gradually.	M	70	9  years160 1X D	1/26/2013
5	High blood pessure	None	I have had excellent results with Diovan.  No side effects that I can tell, and I've been using it for at least 8 years.  It works great.	F	64	8  years160 mg 1X D	1/22/2013
1	High blood pressure	Extreme light headedness, fatigue	This is a terrible drug!  I went off it 3 days ago because I can't think anymore (too light headed).  STILL dizzy.  Very scared	F	62	3  months80 mg 1X D	1/19/2013
1	Hypertension	The worst drug I've ever taken	Diovan controlled my blood pressure better than any other of the 15 meds I've taken.But the medical side effects are life changing.I had one medical issue when I started Diovan,blood pressure.Now,I have 8 more.Underthyroid,blood sugar,peripheral neuropathy,gout,tendinitis,sinus ,muscle dysfunction,amd impotence.Not a good trade,exchanging one med problem and inheriting 8 more that I never had before Diovan.I truly wish every Novartis company exec/cheminst who invented Diovan were forced to take it for 5 years.

1	HBP	Hair falling out, severe back, joint pain, headaches.Problems standing too long.Severe neck and shoulder pain.High pulse and very fast heart palpitations even made me pass out twice.	When I first started to take Diovan it seemed to pretty good with kepping my BP low then shortly after I had very bad headaces everyday.I then started with the pain in my neck and the longer I was on Diovan the worst my side effects got.My hair was falling out just a little at first,but, the longer I have been on it,the worst it has got.Thank you all for your comments! I just read these post 4 days ago,then stopped taking it right away.My pulse is back to normal,my BP is staying about 130/78.I have also already noticed an improvement in my back,neck and shoulders.

1	Hypertension	Erectile Dysfunction	Started Diovan 160 5 years ago.No problems first year.Then had intermittent erectile dysfunction problems for several weeks.Now after 5 years I'm totally impotent.Stopped Diovan for five days,replaced with Benazepriel 20.No sex problems.Wife was amazed.But Benazepriel 20 didn't control blood pressure like Diovan did.When you read about Diovan and other ARB drugs you're told they improve sex problems.In my case,that's absolute BS.

2	HBP	Stomach upset, gas burping constantlyAnxiety increaseddepressionlethargyinsomniahip and joint painshall I go on?	I have gone on & off this med several xs. before this I was on lisnipril and ended up getting the "cough", so went to diovan. HAve never put together the SE I was experiancng with this med until yesterday. My doc added to the diovan 80mgs 12.5 HCTZ...1st night I woke up with feeling like my skin was on fire and could not sleep. 2nd night same thing. I have been taking prilosec for a week now because my stomach has been bothering me SO bad started that the same day I was changed to diovan with HCTZ. I am convinced that diovan is slowly killing me & btw...never did get my BP down as well as it should (thats why Dr added the HCTZ. When I take L-theanine my pressure drops to 110/70's and no side effects with that. So as of yesterday no more Diovan......Its not for me	F	54	2  years80mg 1X D	12/8/2012Email

1	Hypertension	Numerous side effects but it did control blood pressure	Started Diovan 5 years ago.It controls my blood pressure.But the side effects are horrendous.In the 5 years on Diovan,the following have occurred(some are permanent,others were temporary).Low thyroid,high cholesterol,high triglycerides,high normal blood sugar,gout,sexual dysfunction,tendinitis,sinus problems.With each condition,the involved doctors say it can't be caused by Diovan. Each doctor wanted to prescribe drugs for the problem,but I refused.If I followed their advice,I'd now be on 8 more prescriptions.No thanks.Finally told the cardiologist I threw the Diovan away.Now taking Benazepril 20mg for several weeks.No side effects yet,but I'm skeptical.In my case,Diovan made an energetic,physically active guy into a depressed,moody individual.Novartis makes Diovan.Their sales each year are about $6 billion.Thanks Novartis for ruining my life for 5 stinking years.

1	high blood pressure	dizziness, weight gain, anxiety, depression.	I hate it. I want to just quit cold turkey. The doctors are all full of "well, you will have a stroke if you do quit".

1	To lower BP & protect kidneys	Total insomnia leading to collapse, persistent nausea, abdominal cramping & pain, hip pain, blurred vision, vacant mind, borderline panic/psychotic feelings, whole body tension, feeling of impending doom, depression setting in, BP unaltered or increased, and many more things unable to list mainly because the major side effects so horribly overshadowed the smaller things like hair loss, rise in irritability, etc.	I have autoimmune kidney disease & my competent nephrologist Rxed this because he wanted to reduce my BP a little & reduce the amount of protein I lose in my urine, which over time causes damage to kidneys & raises BP further.  I had been on Lisinopril about six years, and could not tolerate side effects of increasing dosage of that.  So he thought Diovan, being a different class of drug might work.  Beginning @ 160 2x day, side effects rapidly made him cut dose by half after about a week.  But the longer I took it, the worse things got.  After five days of being almost totally unable to sleep, my body crashed into involuntary jerking of muscles with intense nausea & feeling I might die.  When 6 mg of melatonin failed to produce sleep, I knew it was the meds.  My Dr told me to stop them immediately & wants a work up to see if lasting damage has been done.  He switched me to Tekturna, very low dose, which is a direct renin inhibitor (different class).  Has side effects, but nothing like the Diovan.  I'm sleeping well, all symptoms of Diovan leaving my system & it's a whole new life!  It's working better on my BP too.  I hope this new med is worth all the hell I went through on Diovan---I never imagined an evil drug like Diovan existed.  I just pray my brief experience with it doesn't yet prove to shorten my life with lasting harm.	F	53	3  weeks160 mg 2X D	8/8/2012

1	Hypertension	first week was ok, after that became very tired, no energy, hot flashes, stomach pain,reflux.  Then I began to have a sore throat, thought I had a virus, began having achy joints, muscle stiffness, headache and cough.  I waited another week with these symptoms thinking the virus was going to pass. it was not until reading all of your comments here, that I too realized this was all due to the drug.   My BP was controlled  on it, but not worth enduring the side effects. I called my MD and told him . He immediately is switching me to another generic. I had Been on atacand for over 5 years without any problems. It's all the insurance co tying to force generics where they do not work,causing us patients to endure other debilitating  conditions.  last year they forced me to change to cozaar which did not work,  now I am currently prescribed Benicar  to start tomorrow.  The interesting thing is Benicar is not generic, so why is the insurance e co forcing me to change!!!!		F	51	21  days320 1X D	6/14/2012

I can't seem to finish the projects I start.  It has taken a full week to plant 5 plants in a flower box!  Very frustrating.	This medication is very bad for you!

1	Borderline high blood pressure	Mental and physical exhaustion; back and neck pain; leg discomfort.	I'm glad I found this website. I had been taking Diovan for a little over a year, theoretically for high blood pressure, although most of the time my blood pressure is between normal and high normal. However, I have a very bad case of White Coat Syndrome and my b.p. spikes whenever anyone measures it. In fact, I stress out almost to panic mode in a doctor's office worrying that it will be too high, and then of course it is too high. I am otherwise in excellent health.I thought my tiredness and achy muscles were due to some other cause, particularly since my GP assured me that Diovan is like a vitamin for your heart. After reading comments on this website, I discontinued the Diovan. (No, I didn't check with my doctor first, and I didn't cut down gradually; I just quit cold turkey.) Within two (2) days my energy was back and most of the achiness was gone. So were the leg cramps and muscle spasms.This is a BAD drug! It cannot possibly be helping if it's screwing up your body and your life! Fortunately, lifestyle changes can usually control blood pressure, and I have taken steps to do that. (Take a look at Mark's Daily Apple website for a lot of good hints as to diet and exercise.) As for the White Coat Syndrome, I will monitor it myself at home and avoid the doctor's office to the maximum extent possible. Additionally, I'm having second thoughts about the GP that prescribed this junk.	F	68	 320 mg. 2X D	6/1/2012

2	HBP	Abdominal cramps, cramps in my sides when bending, cramps in legs and feet.  After one day of taking this medication I had the worse abdominal cramp. Now I'm experiencing cramps in my legs and feet. I can hardly move without experiencing a cramp		F	43	4  days160mg	5/3/2012Email
1	hypertension	headaches, lack of mental clarity, anxiety, poor outlook on life, muscle and joint aches	I was switched to Diovan by recommendaton of my health insurance coverage due to cost. gradual onset of these symtoms worsened over the timefreme I was on the medication.  I did not realize it was Diovan until I found this websight and decided to take myself off of the medication.  I went about 10 days with no hypertension medication and all of the symtoms I mentioned reversed themselves and disappeared within days with the exception of the muscle and joint aches which are still present but much abated.  My doctor put me on Losartan 50mg once daily and so far, so good.  I am in agreement with the majority of respondants on this board that Diovan is a junk drug that needs to have its FDA approval revoked.	M	43	15  months160mg 1X D	4/20/2012Email
1	HBP	Headaches, progressively worsening muscle cramps, and difficulty with urination	I have been off it 7days now, also was given a course of prednisone for five days, now my doctor tells me to go back on it because as she says "My problems were not because of the Diovan_I will be seeing a new doctor next week	F	65	3  months160/25mg 1X D	4/19/2012Email
1	High Blood Pressure	Severe throat, chest and upper abdominal pain.	Had been taking this drug for about 3 - 6 months prior to the throat, chest and abdominal pain appearing and at the same time was diagnosed with a 12 cm benign kidney cyst.  It was believed by the Urologist that the pain was being caused by the cyst pushing my liver, stomach, etc upwards causing GERD.  Had kidney cyst removed in Sept, 2010 and none of the symptoms disappeared.  Have since had swallowing tests, PH studies, gastroscopies, ultrasounds, etc to try to determine the cause of all this pain since then and all results come back normal.  Have  been on numerous pain medicines to try to control this pain that no Dr. can diagnose.  Pain persists.  Just a couple of days ago I thought perhaps my blood pressure medicine was causing this pain, so I have not taken my meds since Tuesday night and am still not feeling great, but it's only day 3, so will give it some time.  BP was 142/94 this morning, so not ideal.  Will give this a few weeks to see if these symptoms go away, and if they do will visit Dr. to discuss other options.  I pray that this pain disappears as it is very uncomfortable and basically controls my life.	F	51	3  years80 mg 1X D	4/13/2012Email
1	Hypertension	Joint aches/pain,sexual problems,toe numbness	Took this med for 5 years.Lowered my bp somewhat.Began having sexual problems after year 1,Doc said it's not Diovan.At year 3,had numbness in toes.Did extensive neuro workup,diagnosed as neuropathy.Switched to Benazepril 20mg several months ago.Numbness in toes gradually decreasing.Benazepril 20 equals Diovan 80.Maybe I was overmedicated.Also,joint/muscle pains are subsiding.	M	66	5  years160 1X D	4/3/2012
2	HBP	Great at lowering BP to 105/55. Side effects included all day headaches, most of the day tinnitus and lightheadedness. All BP meds have potential side effects. Apparently I don't tolerate them well. I'm going to start amlodipine (Norvasc) and ditch the Diovan.		M	67	3  months160 mg	3/16/2012Email
3	high blood pressure	Diovan brought my blood pressure into a normal range very quickly.  However, after the 5th week I experienced weight gain and swollen ankles.  Once I realized the potential side effects from the Diovan web site, I stopped immediately.  It took one week for my ankles to go back to a normal state.		M	44	6  weeks160 1X D	3/4/2012
2	High Blood Pressure	I experienced back pain, hip pain, leg cramps (charlie horse-especially at night), achy legs, muscle fatigue (especially legs), riging in ears, swilling in ankles (slight), unsteady walk, sensitivive to heat, and stiffness in knees.	I tried for one year to take this medicine.  I adjusted the dosage down and still had these symptoms.  It got to the point that I could no longer stand it so I got off this drug and it took three weeks for all the symptoms to go away.  I now feel like a new man and I will never take this medicine again.  I am taking Toprol and HCT also to control my blood pressure and Diovan was added to try to get my blood pressure a little lower.  With Diovan my blood pressure was about 120/72 and with just my toprol and hct it is now around 136/78. Diovan did a good job of lowering my BP but for me the side effects were too great.	M	70	1  years80 2X D	2/27/2012
3	High Blood Pressure	Blood pressure has been lowered so far to a respectable 130/80 (very happy about those), however; I have been extremely lethargic.  Feel wiped out all the time.  I'm gonna wait it out a couple more days, and see if my body just needs time to adjust.  If I can't shake, I'll have to look for something else.  This is the 3rd thing I tried.  Norvasc (made me dizzy), Accupril (worked at first-about one month, but stopped helping).  I may ask to go back on the accupril. I may have been hasty to call it quits on that one.

Now have terrible persistent neck and back pain together with neck swelling as well as foot pain and left arm pain.  Also have experienced occasional chest discomfort and cold symtoms.

1	Diabetic - used as kidney protector	SEVERE constant joint pain in right shoulder making it impossible to sleep at night, restricted movement of right shoulder, noticed other joint pain in jaw, left knee & slowly the left shoulder begins to ache now.  Noticed hair loss.  Weight gain.	I've had Type 1 Diabetes for 35 years.  Was perscribed Diovan (not because I had high blood pressure) because it is suppose to protect the kidneys of diabetic patients.  I will stop taking Diovan now.  Question:  For those who had joint pain / muscel pain AND stopped taking Diovan, did these adverse side effects stop ?	F	46	19  months80mg 1X D	1/8/2012Email
2	high blood pressure	After starting diovan my bp went down soon after taking the drug at the drs office.  When I got home, I began to bleed.  Soon afterwards, I began having severe stomach cramps.  Will be calling dr again to get a prescription change.  STOPPED TAKING IT		F	32	1  days	12/28/2011

1	High Blood Pressure	Excessive sweating, dizziness, runny nose and anxiety	I started taking these pills 4/2010. Day 5 of being on these pills I started getting dizzy. I went to the doctor and she said "you have vertigo." She gave me pills for that, which I didn't take. Day 9 on the pills I suffered a panic attack. I've never had panic attacks, but that 9th day was the beginning  of many. (my doctor also gave me pills for that which I did not take) Long story short, after many ekg's, chest x-rays, a stress test and many emergency room visits. On my own I figured out what was happening to me. Because the pills gave me anxiety and it took 3 weeks for the pills to come out my system, my body went into what's know as adrenal fatigue. I had to eliminate all sugars, (even natural sugars) caffeine, all preservative and all processed foods from my day diet.  I was taking in a total of less than 2 grams of sugar a day. After 4 months of cleansing my body of these foods, finally the anxiety went away. It was like a ton of bricks was lifted off my shoulders just to feel somewhat normal again. But it took approximately 12 months for my body to get back to normal. That was the most horrific, terrifying and traumatic thing I've ever experienced. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. Please be careful when taking these pills and pay attention to your body and side effects.	F	46	9  days 1X D	12/5/2011Email
3	hypertension	I was prescribed diovan a year ago after my BP readings being in the 140/85-90 range. I have a three year old son and was terrified that I would die of a heart attack and not be here for him so I was prescribed this medication. Within the first few months I noticed a change in my walk and I now walk with a slight limp with heaviness in my legs. This is really scary for me. My left hand is also weaker and I also have memory loss. It takes me forever to formulate a thought and when I do my speech is slightly slurred. I get anxious at time and for someone who loves to exercise and walk, I'm looking for the nearest bus stop because myrhs ate so heavy and I'm so tired. I want to hey off this medication but I'm state because I don't want to have a stroke or heart attack. I had no idea that someone would prescribe such poison to put into your body.

3	To lower my BP	I'm experiencing ringing in my ears and occasionally some dizziness on Diovan. There are times when I feel I'm in a brain fog, finding it difficult to verbalize my ideas. Recently I've had some episodes of low blood pressure, the most recent being tonight with a BP reading of 79/58. It's much lower than the other times so I am concerned. I googled Diovan side effects and low BP is one of them. I plan to see my doctor tomorrow and will take my BP monitor with me. My Dr. placed me on Diovan 4 years ago because my BP was ranging from 140/80 to 152/90. I am on quite few meds for numerous health issues and some are known to elevate BP. I'm no longer on prednisone and amytriptiline so I'm thinking that there might no longer be a need to take Diovan. I'll discuss this with my Dr tomorrow.

I won't live this way and will split the drug to see if it helps with the problem or go off it altogether.  My doctor is overly-aggressive about treating bp when my readings are about right for someone my age (140/80 with Norvasc and Atenolol).  I need to get her under control more than the bp, I guess.

1	HTN	I started Diovan on a lower dose in July 2010 in March 2011 my dose was increased to 320. I have gained 30 lbs since starting this drug, also have muscle pain, & feel tired all ofnthe time. I never connected the 2 until I accidentally took 650mg last night. So I looked up the onset & peak of the med. At 2am, after double my regular dose, my bp was 137/100. Before the double dose my bp was 117/78. I could not believe it. This med peaks at 6 hours & keeps lasting for 24. At 0630 my bp was 126/99. I took my beta blocker & went back to sleep at 10am my pressure was 107/72. After reading the other comments, I am now connecting the dots.	if your doctor wants to give you this drug monitor closely for side effects!	F	45	1  years320 1X D	8/7/2011Email
1	High Blood Pressure	Tired, lethargic, SEVERE back pain, "hot flash feeling", blood pressure headache,	I have been seeing doctors about my back pain since about two weeks after I started taking this pill. I have had x-rays, MRI's, been to physical therapy (for four months), a chiropractor once a week, 3 doctors at my medical center, 3 different emergency rooms, a neurosurgeon and an orthopedic surgeon. None of which can really figure out why I am having so much back pain. So I have been exploring every single option and I stumble upon this website. I have been on short term disability for three months, this is how bad my back pain is....I have had issues with my lower back in the past and I do have some mild degeneration and mild scoliosis but I've lived with that for years. This pain is different, and no one seems to understand. I am calling the doctor tomorrow and getting myself taken off of this pill. All of these stories are terrifying!!!! Why can they even sell these pills??? And I spend almost 30 dollars a month on these, and I'm probably poisoning myself??? WOW, it sounds like a lawsuit is necessary....

2	i have a primary hyperaldesteronism	I feel like I don't want to get up from bed, I'm gaining weight, It makes me feel dizzy, palpitations, and sometimes I don't understand how I feel. It makes me weak.	I am a hypertensive person, I had my high blood pressure since I was 8 years old, and I already had over-all check up but they can't still find the reason of my hypertension.my doctor prescribed me diovan 80 mg, It makes my bp normal but its side effects are not so good. It makes my body weak and lazy.	F	20	5  days80 mg 1X D	8/2/2011Email
1	High BP	Every single side effect that it warns about, it happened. I was addicted to this medicine like a heroin addict and it destroyed me. Stay away from this medication - death is better than what this will do to you.	I wish I had seen this site 4 years ago! In the last 4 years I became a different person. My skin got darker (hands, feet and face primarily), thicker, pain in legs, thicker legs - calves and thighs, i gained over a 80lbs weight in last 4 years, palpitations, head aches, loss of hair, insomnia at night but couldn't keep my eyes open at times. I became diabetic, thyroid was playing up even though i had nothing before, had to go on anti depressants. From a fit and walking living person, I became a zombie. until I gave it up a few weeks ago. I did the most dangerous thing by just throwing all the medicines into the bin as I wanted my life back. i didn't think I would live to see my son turn 18. I went through the cold turkey, I mean bad cold turkey and thought I would die but it was worth going through it to get this demon out of me.  In the last few weeks that i threw the diovan into the bin, I have better skin, less swelling, I can walk, I can breathe much better and I am no longer a zombie. It was not easy and I am only eating lettuce and salads to cleanse my body, but I would do anything to get this out of me. I am taking Potassium supplements, chromium, multi vit, Q10 and I will never go back to any medicine ever again in my life. Death is better than the zombie this medicine will turn you into.

5	HYPERTENSION	If I stop taking the Diovan, then I am exhausted and tired for about two weeks when I restart it.  The exhaustion wears off as my body adjusts.	I was on another hypertension medicine which caused coughing.  When I switched to Diovan, it worked better.	F	50	3  years320 MG 1X D	7/22/2011
2	High blood pressure	Energy being zapped out and dizzy boughts of anger, foggy brain and other sympyoms with not being able to be in the sun.	I was taking Enalril for 6 years when I got growths on my tonsils and bad hemmorids and bad coughing. My pressure was about 141 92 due to weight and I got HB at around 25 years old did not take anything until I was around 29 my weight just would not come down so I had to go on meds. I decided to have my doctor switch my meds about 6 months ago. I went to Diovan and I just don't feel like myself. Although I am not 100% sure of whats going on. I have weakness in my muscles and most of all I always use to take walks for excercise and I can no longer do this when its sunny out but I also have a new health problem, high cohlesterol which I am not sure causes these symptoms so I am not sure but I feel its the diovan. I get heavy feelings in my head and a flushed face when trying to excercise so I now have to stay in and use the treadmill that is if I have the energy, some days I can only sit and stare. I am dizzy and very grouchy with brain fog. I really want to go off this but when I take nothing my pressure goes up to 148- 98 and it was sheer hell doing the switch it took me a month to get my pressure down that now I am scared to switch to another. it does take my down to 132 85 What can I do now??

				F M	 	 	    
1	Temporary psychosis	Extreme restlessness, agitation, aggravation, rage, insomnia, lack of appetite, depression, pacing	I know this helps a lot of people so I won't say it's the "worst drug ever" but it has been the worst one I myself have ever taken. I only was able to sleep because of a sleep med prescribed at night but I'd be up again pacing within a few hours. Could not sit still. I would just sit and scream and cry because I was so agitated and didn't know why. Note that my psychosis that it was treating did not manifest in these ways so it wasn't just my illness. I wonder if taking Cogentin with it would have helped.	F	22	14  days5 mg 1X D	1/9/2012
2	Bipolar 2	Stuffy nose ALL the time. Waking up at 2-4AM. Can't go back to sleep. Was on 5, put myself back to 2.5. Still miserable. Not biting anyone's head off, but restless & cloudy thinking. Yuck.		F	40	2  months2.5	1/6/2012
2	Bipolar II	tired, blurry vision, lack of motivation, depressed	my doc put me on abilify after lithium started to destroy my kidneys.  i liked it a lot at first, but now i am so tired and depressed all of the time.  i have no idea how to handle this.  she has lowered the dose twice, but i am going to have to look into something else.  i can't take living like this anymore.	F	41	5  months15mg 1X D	1/2/2012Email
3	Depression	Major Weight Gain!	The only side effect I received from this Rx was weight gain, 30 pounds in total! However it has helped with delusions that I experienced during my major depression.	F	32	10  months15 mg 1X D	12/30/2011
3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011
4	Bipolar/anxiety/migraines	Dizziness, no appetite	I already feel better, even though it's only been 9 days.  My mind is more clear and I have less racing thoughts.	F	45	9  days5 MG 1X D	10/14/2011Email
1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Major depression	so sleepy, hiccups, anxiety, can't breathe deeply, major hunger, very warm	Hiccups were terrible, especially since I interract with the public. Slowed down so much, my manager told me to kick into gear which had never been a problem before.I am so hungry I want to eat everything I see. I'm also on Prozac but I needed an add on, think I'll ask for Wellbutrin again.	F	62	5  days10 mg 1X D	9/19/2011Email

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..  I can't imagine THAT helping my mood at ANY point!		F	44	3  days10 mg 1X D	7/18/2011Email
5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I have taken Prozac for 7 years to help with OCD and Bipolar II..when prozac lost its effect, I addef on Abilify.

Be warned.	F	21	3  weeks2mg 1X D	6/15/2011
5	Bipolar	None	Absolutely has changed my life. Have been stable for 3 years now. Was very agitated and couldn't get rid of my depression even though I was on medication for depression.

I think the Lexapro is the reason I have gained 10lbs. the doctor changed my meds to Prozac in stead and I feel great. I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy. I hope its not the Abilify that made me gain weight because I will still risk my mental health to avoid getting real big....dont judge	F	49	34  days5ml 1X D	5/25/2011

1	Psychosis	irritation, AKATHESIA, weight gain, suicidal tendencies	Abilify is a horrible drug! considering it has a long effect it took me about a week to stop feeling side effects even after stopping. i made trips to the emergency rooms because it drove me crazy and caused suicide thoughts. Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email

1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.

2	Rapid-cycling Bipolar II	Extreme weight gain (30 lbs on my tiny 120 lb frame), insane carb cravings when I once had very good self-control, eventual suicide ideation. It may have decreased my need for sleep.	It took me two years to get the weight off! I started Wellbutrin XL and the weight disappeared within 3 months. Highly recommended, although it's no longer working for my depression. Bummer :(	F	20	6  months 1X D	1/21/2011Email
1	Add-on for Depression	SEVERE insomnia, haven't slept more than 4 hours on/off since I started taking Abilify.  I wake up in the middle of the night wanting to go for a jog! can't focus, can't remember things, probably due to lack of sleep.  chewed the side of my cheek at night, feels like I'm on cocaine!	This drug was given to me to increase motivation, well if by doing more because I can't get any sleep then it most def. succeeded.  I'm now tapering and can't wait to be off it since I had ZERO positive effects even after switching it to day time, well maybe a tiny bit of weight loss due to all the extra energy.  I'm glad my dose was low cuz I can't imagine what higher doses might feel like.	F	34	5  weeks2 1X D	1/20/2011

2	add-on for depression	blurry vision, increased blood sugar levels, fog-like feeling, slight weight gain, extreme drowsiness at first then insomnia after a couple of weeks	I was satisfied with Abilify concerning the way it helped my depression (or depressive-dominant bipolar, depending on which doc you asked). It did make me feel more "alive" and part of the world than I have in several years. Unfortunately, the side effects were a big issue -- especially the higher blood sugar levels, they went up to a very unsafe amount within less than a week -- and I had to taper off the Abilify. If this medication works for you, it seems to work very well, just be aware of some of the side effects that can harm your health even more. The risks outweighed the benefits for me.

1	add-on for depression, SAD	apathy (stability, I guess), SEVERE suicidal thoughts, exhaustion (calm?), anhedonia, SEVERE inability to concentrate, "not fun to be around" according to a friend's 10-year-old sister	After 20mg Prozac started being less effective in the winter months, my psychiatrist prescribed 10mg Abilify as an add-on. It did help with some symptoms (fast/angry thoughts, crying jags, and irritability), but in general I felt and acted like a zombie. I experimented with many different doses but even with only 2.5mg it seemed like I was constantly in a fog. I didn't have the motivation nor focus to do anything, including reading of any kind. Still, my psychiatrist was convinced that without it (with a clear mind and energy, basically) I would be in danger. I sought a second opinion and weaned off the drug ASAP. My first psychiatrist was somewhat correct, as the depression after taking away Abilify was more evident (it had always been there, I had just been too tired to act on it or show it) and I had to spend some time in a psych ward. There was still a long way to go before I was completely stable and happy, BUT I at least had the energy and drive to get better.It's true a clear head can be dangerous with severe depression, but I believe making suicidal people so unmotivated they can't follow through with their darkest thoughts let alone their daily responsibilities is ineffective and frankly unethical. My time in the psych ward was unpleasant, yes, but a much better solution to a dangerous mind than suppressing it, which is what Abilify did to me.	F	19	2  months2.5-20 1X D	12/30/2010
3	bipolar/depressed	rapid weight gain and insomnia.	In the begining the medicine took the depression away. Then I noticed the weight gain 10 lbs in 3wk, and that after 4 to 5 am I could not sleep anymore and yet NOT tired during the day. This two side effects are now giving me a lot of anxiety and I am feeling depressed about the way I am looking which is not good b/c I have always had body issues. I want off this med.

1	Bi-Polar Disorder	Severe weight gain (95 lbs), long-term fatigue lasting first few months while on the the drug, short-term memory loss, lack of motivation and determination for resposibilites, irritability	I started taking Abilify sometime around March, 2010. Being diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder, I was given a choice of medications to choose from and I decided on Abilify, given that the other two drugs were more likely to cause weight gain. During the first 4 months, I found that the medication took care of my depression and manias, however my grades started dropping since I had no more interest in doing the work. I also noticed weight gain. By July things weren't looking too well. I had gained nearly 50lbs by now and I became quite irritable. This only made me depressed, since prior to the daily consumption of the medication I was very slim (157 lbs @ 6'2") and my GPA (while in 9th grade) for the first two quarters was 3.8. In November of 2010, I went into the hospital for sever depression and attempted suicide, and I finally seized the Abilify. I am currently on Lemictal (50 mg & counting) and I have noticed an improvement with the lack of Abilify. Hopefully all goes well with this new drug, and I can get back on track in life. Good luck to you all, and a note; Abilify is a great drug, but it's not for everyone.	M	15	9  months5 MG 1X D	12/15/2010Email

2	Bipolar 1	Morning vomiting, weight gain (40lbs), muscle tension, lethargy, night sweats, anemia, high blood pressure	I was in love with it at first but as the side effects piled on I could no longer ingest the stuff. I tried just lowering the dose but it didn't stop the side effects. This medicine just did not suit me	F	28	10  months10mg 1X D	12/3/2010
5	depression-bipolar	None	Abilify gave me back my life. I have suffered from depression most of my life. Antidepressents alone did not really help me, living with depression was normal for me-then I finally found a physician that helped me and gave me Abilify. For the first time in my life I am not scared of waking up-I feel that life can be enjoyed, that I DESERVE to be alive and living a life that is not full of darkness and hopelessness.

3	Deppresion / Bi-polar	Tiredness, sleepy and hungry.	Started taking Paxil and 5 mg of Abilify then after a month my doctor increased the dosage to 10 mg per day. It helped after about two months, with my depression.  Then I noticed I was sleepy all the time.  My Doctor cut the dosage to 5 mg per day, then gradually reduced me to 0.5 mg per day.  The low dosage seems to be working with both depression and my bi-polar.  When I was on higher dosages of Abilify I really didnt feel anything.  I was never happy nor sad, just blah.  I am also on 20 mg of Adderall 3 times a day.  This helps with the tiredness and lack of motivation and attention.  I plan to stop the Abilify by June 2011.  But I am going to gradually stop taking it.	M	34	2  years0.5 MG 1X D	11/18/2010
2	Depression worse	I gradually increased my dose each week. 1st 3 days I had great energy... even to the point of insomnia, which was terribly unusual for me ( I can sleep standing... basically). It was nice at 1st. Then after the 3rd  or 4th day I could NOT keep my eyes open. No focus. Dizziness. Could barely drive.	Got off of it after calling Dr. Took a few days but the lethargy left. I took 1 pill again to see if it would help a few months later and it left me completely a zombie. Just had to sleep off the drug and never take it again.	F	42	30  days10 mg 1X D	11/5/2010
1	Psychotic & Manic Depression	Dystonia, arrhythmia.	I wasn't aware of this side effect until many years after being off this drug. I noticed within a few weeks uncontrollable eyebrow movment, but i didn't think anything of it. After a few more days it got worse, then it spread to my legs. I was unable to walk due to my leg muscles contracting and giving. I immedatly stopped taking it for many years. 4 years later i went back on it for depression and developed heart arrhythmia within two weeks. I refuse to take this medication ever again.	F	20	1  months 1X D	10/29/2010
1	Major Depression, PTSD	Weight gain, insomnia, tremors, muscle spasms in legs (tardive dyskinesia/benign muscular fibrillation?)	I originally commented on 12/21/09 (see below) and, at that time, had only recognized insomnia as a negative side effect.  But after 3 months I realized that the fact that I had gained 15 pounds and was ravenously hungry all day was probably another side effect.  Then I began noticing severe tremors in my right hand and muscle spasms in my legs (which still continue, although lessening, 6 months after discontinuing use).  So I stopped taking it, because I have a great fear of type II diabetes.  I did not realize until later that the muscle problems were also probably related to my use of Abilify.  I would recommend that anyone taking Abilify pay very, very close attention to side effects from the first day.  I admit that it lessens depression, but for me, the cost in negative side effects was much too high.	M	65	3  days2.5 mg 1X D	10/26/2010Email

5	major depression/gen. anxiety	None.	I actually take Abilify alone, I do not take an antidepressant. The abilify has made me a much happier person. I notice that when I am off of it I tend to either sleep too much or experience insomnia and each time I've decided to stop taking it I have noticed suicidal ideation and a lack of interest in anything. I took a 5 month break from it thinking that the abilify wasn't doing anything and was just a waste of money but I became severely depressed and so I have recently begun taking it again and my attitude has done a complete 180. I would certainly recommend this drug, although I am sure it is not meant for everyone.	F	24	2  years10 1X D	10/20/2010
3	to improve control of bipolar 2	Gained about 25 pounds, borderline diabetes. Good side effect: treated my restless leg syndrome.	Abilify worked very, very well at improving control of my depressive episodes (bipolar type 2) and it dramatically decreased my restless leg syndrome. It took about six weeks to make the depression go completely away, but life sure is good without depression. For the first time in my life, I feel consistently good. No unstable mood at all. However, I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 yrs I've been on Abilify. Now I'm clinically obese and within one point of being diabetic. I believe the obesity is making it harder for me to find a job. Diabetes is a terrible thing, and acquiring diabetes right when I'm losing my health insurance is not a good thing, so I'm discontinuing the Abilify. I know it's going to be rough, but diabetes, obesity, and unemployment are rough, too.	F	54	2  years2.5 mg 1X D	10/13/2010
1	Major Depression	Unusual amount of weight gain; Drowsiness; Restless Legs at night; Anxiety.	It seemed to help me a little at first. Abilify was added to my Effexor. Then I started to experience the side effects. I am going to see my Dr. in a week and I am going to insist that he take me off of this medication. The weight gain has caused me to be more depressed :(	F	34	5  months2.5mg 1X D	10/8/2010

2	Bipolar, mixed state	This drug was prescribed to me as I was thought to be in a mixed bipolar state.  This was prescribed to bring my hypomania and irritability down.  It didn't touch my irritability, in fact it seemed to do nothing at all except make me very lethargic, my hair began falling out, and I gained about ten pounds as it gave me insatiable hunger.

After a month of a very tough mixed state, I tried Abilify. It quieted my head instantly. I liked Abilify although I didn't like that it increased my appetite. Had it not been for the migraines, I would have continued with it.	F	39	3  weeks2.5 mg 1X D	9/28/2010
1	Horrible depression and psychosis	Horrible akathesia, insomnia, irritability	This med made me unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night, I couldn't stop pacing or moving, and it would make me cry because I was so irritated.

2	OCD	Loss of libido, buzzing sensations in head, short-term memory loss, poor night vision	I have been on and off Abilify for 9 years. At 30mgs, I noticed the buzzing sensations, and all the other side effects listed. At 10 mg and lower, I still felt all the side effects except the buzzing sensations. I was taking abilify with lexapro, and a couple other drugs my dr. switched out for lexapro. The only good thing about this medication was, it did not experience RLS. When I finally weened myself off Abilify, the only side effect I noticed was restless leg syndrome. It is discomforting, but it only lasted about 5 minutes every other day. I am now off abilify, and lexapro. I am in therapy so I have learned a lot of ways to combat my anxiety, however the thoughts are hard to control so I am going to ask my doctor if he can prescribe something or the ocd, possibly anafranil.

5	Bipolar disorder	Akathesia (the inner restlessness and anxiety others are describing), possibly weight gain, drowsiness for the first 2 months	This medication was a godsend for me. If you feel very restless or anxious, you need an add-on medication. I take artane for the akathesia (restlessness and anxiety) and it works fine. You need to give this drug time. I was forced onto it in the hospital and it took about 2 months to get used to it. It has managed my moods incredibly well (after I had used just about every other medication imaginable).

3	BiPolar	This is my first day on Abilify. I took 2 MG last night. Could not fall asleep -- if I did fall asleep, I didn't stay asleep for long. I am exhausted today. Also, when I woke up in the middle of the night I was nauseated. I thought I had food poisoning. When I woke up in the morning my nausea was still there and I had a headache. Now I am just very tired because of the lack of sleep. I also have a pain going from my neck down my back...kind of feels like tendonitis.		F	27	1  days2 MG 1X D	9/2/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Akathisia - Extreme Restlessness... could not sit still!Insomnia	I switched to Abilify from Invega due to weight gain concerns.  The Abilify worked great for the first couple of weeks.  No weight gain issues, even lost the weight I had gained on Invega.  I felt great mentally, I felt energized, I felt good.  Then the restlessness started creeping in and getting worse and worse the longer I took Abilify.  I could not sit still.  The only peace I could get was when I was sleeping...if I could get to sleep.  I finally couldn't take it any longer, so I went back to the Invega.  Weight gain is way better than Akathisia.

5	bipolar disorder	For the first two weeks I had pretty severe akathisia (inner restlessness).  However, then the feeling began to subside plus my doc put me on Cogentin, which solved the akathisia problem.  I also had some anxiety attacks at first, but those went away.	I love this drug!!  If you get through the initial crappy side-effects, it turns out that the drug is awesome.  I'm feeling happy for the first time in years.  I just feel very even, very balanced.  To me it is a really good mood stabilizer.	M	28	30  days15 mg 1X D	8/26/2010Email
3	Psychosis	A week into taking it I had constipation and I just couldn't sit still EVER.  Any way I stood, sat, etc. was uncomfortable.  It was like having restless leg in my whole body.  It somewhat helped with the mental stuff and I stopped taking it a week and a half ago.  I had to take 2.5 mg today because I couldn't take my psychosis anymore.		F	24	40  days5 mg 1X D	8/21/2010
3	Add on therapy for depression	None that I am aware of ...	My doctor prescribed Abilify as an add on therapy for my Generalized Anxiety Disorder / Depression. I currently take Lexapro 25mg once a day and Xanax .5mg four times a day. My doctor added 2mg of Abilify at night to help with the depression. I was leary of taking a new med but I really hopes this works. I know it is a little soon but I wanted to see what others had to say about the medicine. " I hate Panic Attacks " ... :(	F	33	4  days2mg 1X D	8/20/2010Email
1	Bi-Polar Disorder	RAPID weight gain. Ravenous hunger. Not a very great effect.		M	15	2  years15mg 1X D	8/18/2010
4	OCD with psychotic features	increased sex drive, little weight gain, insomnia, muscle stiffness.	yes, the dosage is really 0,1 mg, taken with an insulin syringe and thrown in water. take always smallest dose as possible to avoid akathisia. Abilify could work very well if you don't develop that sense of restlessness.	M	24	7  days0.1 mg 1X D	8/12/2010
5	Major Depression, GAD, PTSD	Side effects: rapid weight gain, severe constipation, extreme hunger	I have been on a lower does (10mg) of abilify for over a year. It helped lower my anxiety and agression. It gave me energy to get out of bed. I tried going off it because of the weight gain (40 pounds). As a result, I became agressive, anxious, more depressed and was unable to get out of bed.I did lose 10 pounds in the three weeks I was off of the drug. However, my mind was just out of control so I went back on 10 mg. A series of events triggered the PTSD and I felt violent, agitated and obsessive in my thoughts. My psychiatrist increased to 20 mg, then 30 mg. I am back to a normal, active person (relatively speaking). My agression is curbed. My energy is back. I can be around people for short periods of time without becomming overly anxious. I've been on so many different drugs...I can honestly say abilify works. I don't like being fat because of the drug but it is better than being crazy.	F	43	45  days30mg 1X D	8/11/2010
1	Mood disorder	Chest pains and couldn't walk due to musle rigidity, ever musle in my body was rigid. Currently seeing cardiologist due to heart damage. The heart is a muscle.	Take it off the market!!!!!	F	51	90  days30 1X D	8/2/2010
3	Bipolar Disorder	I would wake up a couple times a night and be ready to start my day at 4:30 a.m. Abilify also gave me a restless feeling (a jump out of your skin feeling).  I started to get manic probably soon after I started Abilify but I didn't realize it.  I also started having compulsions for certain foods, shopping and books (I have alot of books in my apartment now).  Now that I'm off Abilify I feel somewhat back to normal.  Hope this helps :)		F	42	3  months10 mg 1X D	7/31/2010
3	Bipolar NOS	This drug was prescribed to bring me out of the severe funk I was in, it helped lift the depression in the beginning, wasn't effective in fighting the mania, as its effectiveness declined I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg to 7 mg to 10 mg to 20 mg. There was some cognitive decline since I was hunting for words and my short term memory was affected (this was before lamictal was added). It wasn't until lamictal was added that my mood evened out. I'm on 400 mg of Lamictal, 20 mg of abilify, 30 mg Buspar, and 300 mg of Seroquel XR. You can read my blog where I update my experience with drugs and manic depression...	http://anambivalentlife.blogspot.com/	M	35	8  months20 1X D	7/29/2010
5	Bipolar Disorder	Taking 20mg.  Feeling as if I want to get out of my skin.  Pacing and always having to move around. My doctor prescribed Cogentin and that feeling went away quickly. I no longer had to take it after about 6 months.	I think abilify is a great drug.  It helps my bipolar 1 disorder.  I recently ran out of my abilify due to my hypermania. I was only off it for 2 weeks when I began experiencing full blown mania.  I started back on my medication and the manic mood subsided.  Then the depression set in.  I realize that I can never allow myself to run out of my abilify so I take it every day.	F	48	1  years20mg 1X D	7/28/2010
2	Because my doctor said so	Blurred vision, drowsiness, insomnia, "dead-pan" facial expression,lack of focus, increased distractibilty.	At first i thought it was working to decrease my emotional swings but then the doc increased the dose for 1/2 a tab to a whole on. I was also getting off on Strattera and I got back on it because I felt so weird. Now, who knows?	F	49	30  days5 1X D	7/26/2010
1	major depression-additonal med	blurry vision, dizziness, exacerbated insomnia	When I got up in the morning after the first night I took Abilify, I was staggering around like I was drunk. This went away after the second dose, but I continued to have balance issues.  After 5 days, my vision was so blurry, I had to stop taking it. In addition, it made my insomnia worse, and after stopping the drug, I was up for 42 hours straight. Most disturbing is that a recent eye exam for corrective lenses revealed that I now have diplopia, which may have been caused by Abilify. If it was caused by Abilify, it is permanent damage to my vision. The drug was well out of my system by the time I had the eye exam.	F	55	5  days2mg 1X D	7/23/2010
4	Severe Depression/Psychosis	Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	I started taking Abilify for auditory/visual hallucinations. I started on 10 mg which caused all of the bad side effect listed. The Akathisia was so bad I couldn't sit or sleep. I honestly would've preferred to die it was that bad. I was then put on Ativan/lorazepam 0.5 which took the akathsia away by 80% and Abilify reduced to 5mg which took all of the side effects away apart from the lethargy which was still there. I then started taking ability in the evenings instead of mornings so Im lethargic while I sleep and have more energy during the day. Abilify has been increased slowly over the past 5 months to 20mg in order not to develop and side effects and I haven't. The akathsia reduced over the first few weeks and now is completely gone. The visual hallucinations have gone and the auditory hallucinations are down to 80%. I think the Psychiatrist will increase to 25mg when I see him next week for the voices. Abilify was unbearable in the beginning but has helped me a great deal in the long run. I can think clearly now whereas before my thoughts were all muffled, I still get blank moments where I forget what I was thinking or was going to say but it has improved so much. Abilify is known for causing akathisia, the only thing I can say is start off on the lowest dose in order not to experience it. Akathisia, Irritability, breathing difficulty, urine retention, lethargy	F	24	5  months20mg 1X D	7/17/2010
5	BIPOLAR II/OCD/ANXIETY/GAD	none.  AMAZING MED.	I have suffered from this disorder since I was 18 (now 36).  Absolutely debilitating, suicidal, etc.  Within ONE DAY after starting Abilify I noticed positive effects.  It's a week now and I have noticed the following benefits:  no longer bothered by dirt or cleaning or getting wet (used to just give me a horrible body sensation)....public anxiety is a lot lower now, not obsessing over and over again in my head about what other ppl are thinking/saying about me.  Have energy during the day, do not sleep all the time like I used to.  Still suffer from insomnia but oh well.  In the past week I have done more housecleaning than I have done in the past year combined.  THIS MED WORKS WHEN PRESCRIBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON.  I am so incredibly happy to feel almost normal again after being on almost EVERY SINGLE AD/ANTI-ANXIETY/ANTI-PSYCHOTIC med out there.  I am on a low dose (2 mg).  I feel free.	F	36	7  days2 MG 1X D	7/15/2010Email
2	Bipolar Depression	Irritability, akathisia, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in things.	Stay away.  I was unable to sit still, couldn't focus on doing things I used to enjoy.  It works for depression, but at what cost?  Oh yeah, I gained 30 pounds on it, even while not changing my diet and exercise routine.  Tapering off it now.  Lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks.	F	39	4  months5mg 1X D	7/14/2010
3	Schizoaffective	Decrease in sex drive, A bit of weight gain, agitation but don't know if its the meds since I had it before taking abilify.	Abilify has helped, I would recommend this medicine. Still have psychotic symptoms on abilify but works for the most part.	F	26	7  months15 mg 1X D	7/6/2010Email
4	bipolar depression	Abilify significantly increased me appetite at night but it helped to improve my mood significantly.		F	42	11  months7.5 mg 1X D	6/29/2010
2	bi-polar disorder	No terrible side effects initially,however eventually there were many: weight gain,anxiety,agitation,constipation,inability to focus or sit still for very long,restless leg syndrome,sense of doom and depression.	In the beginning (for the first year or so),abilify was quite effective in alleviating the obsessional thinking that I was experiencing due to a recent traumatic life event. I definitely experienced a degree of relief that was desperately needed. In time,however,the side effects of this drug gradually created more of a problem than the one I had been struggling with to begin with...Insidious weight gain (25lbs) managed to creep up on me for no reason,I began to dread any and most all social engagements,I couldn't focus or concentrate long enough to do anything productive,my depression became even more pronounced and I became frustrated and agitated (grouchy) about almost everything. The last three years I was on abilify were quite difficult to say the least.I would have stopped taking it long ago but I was unaware that this drug was the culprit. At that time, I was also taking prozac,wellbutrin,topomax and lamictal. I can only say that since discontinuing it,(and it hasn't been very long),I feel SO much better...Words and thoughts are easier to formulate and process,my anxiety is much less severe and I generally have an overall more optimistic outlook on life.In my opinion,I think that abilify serves its purpose initially to help a person through crisis but I also think that it should gradually be eliminated once a person reaches an acceptable level of stabilization.

5	GAD & Depression	Uncontrollable appettite with accompanying weight gain.	It helps.	M	42	8  months50 mg 1X D	6/15/2010
4		sleep is a little disrupted, that's about it at 5 mg	i just got off invega, this is so much better. It has really helped at stopping my thoughts, which is a real problem for me.  I'm much more awake on it than I was on Invega (plus I don't have the bad dreams I had on Invega).  Overall, the negative thoughts have stopped for the most part.  So far, so good on this one.  This is the only antipsychotic I haven't taken and the side effects are so much less, and honestly it has helped with my symptoms more than the others so far.  I'm diagnosed schizoaffective.	M	37	14  days5 1X D	6/9/2010
5	PTSD, Depression	Most of the side effects have been benefits.	Abilify really helped me get out of my funk. I was very depressed and the depression was making me very sick. I would throw up every morning from stress, anxiety. My family went through a horrible crisis and I am still trying to recover from that. The abilify is helping speed up the process. I feel totally different today than I felt 10 days ago. I feel like I can function. I'm also eating again. After losing 25 pounds and withering away to nothing I can look at, smell, and eat food. Abilify works great for me added with Prozac (5mg) and Xanax .25 mg 3 x day	F	36	19  days2mg-1mg 1X D	6/3/2010
