				F M	 	 	    
5	Persistent sinus headaches	Sudden increase in appetite, mild weight gain of 1 pound per day.	Weight gain was unrelated to diet - I run 6 miles per day.	F	38	7  days2 squirts 1X D	11/17/2010
1	Allergies	My 3 yr olds became hyper, irritable, aggressive, and very difficult to discipline/redirect.I have been using it as well, no side effects, but no improvement either.		F	32	2  weeks 1X D	8/18/2010
5	Nasal Congestion & Polyps	Nasacort effectively controls my nasal inflammation without adverse side effects. To save $$, I try to use the least possible, but not less than one spray (per nostril) per day. Nasacort is not fast-acting and must be used regularly to be effective.	Before Nasacort, I had two surgeries (10 yrs apart) for nasal polyps. It was so bad that I had no sense of smell for several years. Nasacort (for the last 10+ years) has kept me out of the OR and smelling the roses. And bread! I worked next to a bakery for a few years and never smelled a thing.

4	Allergies	None so far	quickly felt a difference. So far absolutely love it.	F	42	2  weeks2 sprays 1X D	2/20/2010
2	allergies	Worked great the first night, but I caught a cold on second day of use - sneezing, mucus, sore throat - my first cold in years.  Mild headaches for the first week, but then went away.  Bloody noses started after one week, but subsided after a little more than a month.  Feelings of lethargy, lack of concentration and slightly blurry vision continue.	I wouldn't recommend against trying the product - it seems to work for some people, and some of the side effects seem to be temporary.  That said, keep in mind that the side effects may negate the benefits, as I have decided.	M	29	1.5  months	1/27/2010
1	Hay fever	Our 5 year old childs behavior became noticeably more irritable and aggressive - do not use this medicine		M	5	12  days	9/25/2009

1	Allergies	Weight loss, lightheaded, cloudy vision, lack of concentration, sweating, mild chest pains, and mild shortness of breath followed by anxiety and panic attacks.	Research this drug before you use it. Check with you doctor at the first signs of any side effects. After an ER visit thinking I was having a heart attack my doctor told me to immediatly stop using Nasacort AQ. This brought on a whole different set of even more severe  symptoms causing another visit to the ER followed by an overnight stay in the cardio unit in which my heart was found to be in good shape. My doctor does not believe nasacort AQ could cause such symptoms since it is an inhaled steroid. I did not have any of these symptoms prior to using nasacort AQ.	M	43	1  months	6/21/2009Email
5	Nasal Inflammation	NONE!!	After the first two days I could actually sleep thru the night and breath thru my nose! Great stuff!! I just worry about prolong usage??	M	52	4  weeks	5/19/2009Email
3	Sinusitus	Headache, blood in mucous, flu symptoms, extreme stomach discomfort, irritability, nausea, loss of appetite	It did prevent my sinuses from being inflamed, however, i don't feel the side effects are worth it.	M	26	6  days	3/14/2009Email
1	allergies/acute sinusitis	At first no side effects, then my ENT doc increased dosage because of sinusitis and I began experiencing horrible pain behind my eyes, headaches and dizziness.  This went on for 6 months.  I decided to quit taking it and for a few days felt dazed and had the sweats but now feel normal.  I went to 3 different doctors for these symptoms and none of them said it could be from Nasacort AQ!!!!  I put 2 and 2 together and quit on my own.		F	50	5  years	1/6/2009
1	Sinus pain	Severe mood swing, dark moods. Aggressiveness. Anxiety. Nightmares.		F	56	2  days	11/24/2008
4	allergic rhinitis	mild dry sore throat	Worked well on nasal symptoms, worth the mild side effect during worst of allergy season.  I suspect I caught cold easier using it, but I'm not totally sure.	F	43	120  days	11/17/2008
1	sinus issues	Horrible anxiety attacks and almost stroke level blood pressure. Horrible Horrible...		M	35	30  days	10/11/2008Email
1	allergies	I have taken this product (or similar) for several years.  I have recently had orbital eye pain and puffy eyes, especially the left one.  Further, I have been dizzy as well.  Could this be the cause?  My docs don't know what is wrong.  The pressure is so great around my eye, it feels like a sinus infection, but a CAT scan revealed nothing.  I read other's side effects from steriod nose sprays, so I am stopping it.		F	57	5  years	3/21/2008
4	post nasal drip/excess mucous	none	it works pretty good with no side effects...	F	38	3  weeks	1/25/2008
3	Sinus	No side effects.	Medicine did not work as well as its competitor Astelin.	M	46	30  days	1/13/2008
5	ChronicRhinitis	None	I have terrible sinus problems and I take 1 puff each nostril twice a day. If I do them at the same time, once a day, my nose will plug up.	F	36	4  months	7/13/2007
2	severe seasonal allergies	Spaced out, lethargic, and short of breath.  Definitely can't drive or operate machinery while on this. Good thing I tried this on a Saturday.	Took for first time today.  Will not take again.  Side effects aren't worth marginal benefits.  Also on Clarinex (desloratadine) and Advair 250/50. Think that the combination of Nasacort and Advair is too high a dose of steroids for my body.	F	44	1  days	6/9/2007
1	Seasonal allergy, nasel congestion	I experienced nosebleed after using just once or twice.  I didn't fully appreciate the connection and continued to use this product several more times and the nosebleeds rapidly progressed to the point I couldn't stop the bleeding.  I wound up in the emergency room and then spent 5 nights in the hospital with a nasal tampon inserted into one side of my nose.  This was the only way to stop the bleeding and I ultimately had to have surgery to correct the damage this product did to my sinuses.  This product was a nighmare for me and I would warn others to STOP USING AT THE FIRST SIGN OF BLEEDING!	Apparently it works for some, but the nosebleed issue is very real and you must take this warning seriously!	M	52	3  days	3/10/2007

5	Allergies/congestion	None	I was on others sprays for a long time and I just found out about Nasacort AQ last year. This stuff has been great! It cleared my congestion almost immediately and it doesn't stink or burn like the other ones did. It also doesn't seem to run down the back of my throat as much. I only wish my doctor would have told me about Nasacort AQ before.	M	32	1  years	8/3/2006
5	Allergies	None		M	40	180  days	7/13/2006
1	allergies/rhinitis	in my 5 year old: irritable, easily agitated, some aggression,significant behavior changes.	later learned that it is not recommended for children under 6 years. Not only was the effect of the medication poor it changed my daughters behavior (recognized by me and her teachers). needless to say, I will be discontinuing it and hopefully get my daughter back to herself.	F	5	2  weeks	2/21/2006
3	allergies	I get a slight nosebleed after I use it	So far it seems to be working pretty well, but I have yet to use it during hay-fever season	F	22	1  months	2/20/2006
1	Allergies	Severe mood swings, severe sweating, lower back pain, insomnia	Good if you can tolerate the side effects that I experienced.	M	43	3  days	10/14/2005
5	Season rhinitis.  Allergies	No side effects!  Awesome!	I have been taking every kind of allergy pill and resisted switching to nasal sprays because I hate them.  But Nasacort made a believer out of me!	M	49	2  months	7/17/2005Email
3	nasal polyps	It makes me hyper, I think. I'm wondering if anyone else has such an experience?		M	59	40  days	2/12/2005
3	sinus problems due to allergies	None, unless you count the fact that it is not too effective.	It doesn't really do the job for me, it is better than nothing, but Nasonex is the first nasal steroid that has really worked for me. I have taken Nasacort off & on for the past few years	M	52	 	11/9/2004Email
3	Get off OTC nose spray			F	43	 	10/23/2004
4	allergic rhinitis/congestion	none	works great, does not taste funny or smell funny. better than flonase.	F	30	6  months	7/22/2004
