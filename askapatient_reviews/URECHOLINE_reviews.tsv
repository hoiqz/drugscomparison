3	neurogenic bladder condition	Extreme thirst at times, fatigue, very frequent urination (maybe a symptom of the nerve injury), sometimes it doesn't seem to work as well as others -- seems to depend on how irritated the damaged spinal nerve involved is and/or maybe how much pressure there is on the nerve and or bladder. Symptoms generally get worse around my menses.	I get this medication from the local Costco Pharmacy, which serves a huge number of people, and was amazed to learn that I'm the only customer taking it regularly. I take 10 mg 4x a day. I would love not to need this medication, but without it apparently my bladder does not empty completely. I started taking it after having hardware from a failed lumbar fusion removed. That's when I developed the symptoms, which are very uncomfortable.	F	47	2  days	8/29/2008Email
