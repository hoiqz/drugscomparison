DEPO-TESTOSTERONE	RATING	 REASON	SIDE EFFECTS FOR DEPO-TESTOSTERO	COMMENTS	SEX	AGE	DURATION/DOSAGE	DATE ADDED 
				F M	 	 	    
4	low testosterone	Headache, ringing in the ears.	I take 1.5ml every three weeks.  The first day I normally get a headache.  After this I feel great for about two weeks, then I start to get depressed and irritable.	M	48	1  years	3/20/2009
5	Hypogonadism	None really.  Once in a blue moon I inject into a nerve?  And the leg is a bit sore.  I use ice to numb the area before injections which seems to help.	I do weekly injections and it improves my mood, energy, sex drive and clears away the mental fog I had.	M	49	1  years	8/19/2008Email
5	FTM	High cholesterol (but I also had a genetic predisposition for it). Sweat more. I'm using a patch now and have more energy, now that hormone levels are consistent. On the shots, the levels drop before the next shot.	Increased muscle mass w/o working out, lower voice, fat redistribution, hair, more energy.	M	20	3  years	12/5/2006
1	Hypogonadism	Depression, anxiety, panic attacks, paranoia, persistent erotic fantasies. Mild occasional preapism, increases in blood pressure and cholesterol. Heart arrhythmias. Sensations of excess body heat. Fluid retention. Impaired feeling of overall wellbeing.	I had bilateral testicular damage in late teenagehood. While the patch produces increase in physical strenght, stamina and muscle mass, as well as some loss in bodyweight - the side effects of testosterone, especially on mental health and body fluid, are simply not worth it. I am staying off this stuff for good, and prefer the (far more mild) effects of hypogonadism instead. I wish I never have taken the drug.	M	24	2  months	4/18/2006
1	increase height growth	depression, loss of concentration, attention, and focus, lowering of voice, slight aggression, decrease in fine motor skills (in particular, handwriting became sloppier).	I was prescribed Depo-Testosterone at 15 years of age to increase height growth due to short stature.  Initially, I did not connect my symptoms with the introduction of taking the Depo-Testosterone, but once I suspected a possible connection, I mentioned it to my endocrinologist, who, after a while, switched me to Depo-Estradiol.  Once I discontinued the Depo-Testosterone, I noticed an overall (though not complete) improvement in my symptoms.	F	34	1  years	4/10/2005
5	Sex Change	none unpleasant	Voice drop, libido increase, hair growth, and fat redistribution occurred.	M	21	44  days	2/20/2005
5	To increase libido.	None.	I take it to counter the sexual side effects of antidepressants. It helps me recover from an orgasm. By the next day I'm interested in sex again. Without it, after orgasm it would be 4 day's before my sex drive returned to normal. Does not help with erection problems. It is very cheap if you get the injectable type. After injection you may feel a little better, but more often than not, the feeling better part slowly builds over a two week period (you cannot give yourself a shot and immediately expect sex).
