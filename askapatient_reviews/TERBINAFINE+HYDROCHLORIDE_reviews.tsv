4	Toenail fungus (5 toenails)	Taste disturbance (lasted a few hours then went away). Rash for a few days then went away. Loss of appetite. Body Aches every now and then. Vivid dreams (which I appreciate). Extreme Fatigue most days.	Will continue treatment despite all the negative side effects since the fungus was spreading to all of my toenails and I have a swimming pool so I want to be able exposed my feet without feeling embarrassed. If I get cured then it will all be totally worth it! (45 days into treatment and clean clear nails are growing!)	F	26	45  days250mg 1X D	8/13/2012
4	Toenail fungus	Slight loss of taste.Slight hair loss.	Started taking 3 months ago. Toenail fungus of 16 years improving dramatically for 1st time. (Tried all alternatives without success)Went on sugar free/ gluten free diet, no alcohol. I believe this minimised impact on liver, and thus side effects.Terbinafine is toxic, but so is a fungus, often found systemically if on toenails. Lifestyle change stops re-occurrance, but needed terbinafine initially.	M	49	3  months250 1X D	8/22/2010
