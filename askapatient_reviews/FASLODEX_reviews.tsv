1	Metastatic Breast Cancer	EXTREME SWELLING from the waist down.  Can hardly walk, very, very painful with rash and itching.  Feel as though skin will bust.  Also vomiting and violent diarrhea.  Feel no desire to go on.  If this is what the rest of my life will be.....what's the point?	It should be given as torture at GITMO.  The doctor said that none of my complaints from the FIRST injection were from the drug.  At the LAST visit, he said it was all because of the cancer.  He's a QUACK!!	F	84	1.5  months2 shots 2X M	3/12/2013Email
