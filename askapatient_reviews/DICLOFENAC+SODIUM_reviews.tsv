1	ARTHRITIS	HEADACHE, BUT MOSTLY SWELLING OF THE LEGS AND FEET. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. BLADDER INFECTION .	I STOPPED TAKING ONCE I REALIZED THE SWELLING I WAS HAVING WAS DUE TO THIS MED. HAD A VERY BAD BLADDER INFECTION AND FOUND OUT IT CAN CAUSE THE BLADDER NOT TO EMPTY AS IT SHOULD.  IT DID NOT HELP WITH MY PAIN AS WELL AS ALEVE DOES. I WISH I HAD READ THE SIDE EFFECTS OF IT BEFORE TAKING IT. SOME OF THEM REALLY SCARED ME ONCE I DID READ THEM.	F	66	30  days75 MG 2X D	4/29/2011Email
2	plantar faciitis; aches & pains	Very drowsy and tired and no pain relief at all.	Unlike previously taking just one tablet of Aleve, which immediately took away my pain symptoms, this drug had absolutely no effect at all. My doctor prescribed this drug (instead of Aleve), to be taken twice daily, but after reading the side effects, I am concerned about that frequency. I'll not bother with it anymore and will occasionally take Aleve instead. Fortunately my pharmacy made an error in only giving me 6 tablets instead of 60. I'm glad it happened; it saved me an unnecessary expense.	F	65	1  days75 mg 2X D	7/11/2010
3	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Slight stomach upset became worse and resulted in a perforated ulcer which nearly killed me! I will never be perfectly well again! My gastrc surgeon put the blame firmly on this drug. I was fit, 48 and ate an excellent diet.	It did help my arthritis, but in my opinion the possibility of side effects was not taken very seriously.It can kill you: post operatively I suffered bleeding, peritonitis, septicaemia,renal and respiratory failure. I was sent home wearing 2 stoma bags and 3 wound dressings, weighing four stone!(56 lbs)	F	50	7  years	2/6/2009Email
4	Fibromyalgia	No side effects so far, but have only been on it for a month.	Has taken away 20% of my chronic pain and trigger point pain on a good day and about 5 to 10% on a bad day. No drowsiness, grogginess or memory loss like I had with Neurontin.	F	41	30  days	11/6/2007
5	nerve inflamation in feet	no stomach pains - no excessive drowsiness but slept well- I took medicine during dinner on a full stomach	My left foot was hurting badly enough that I couldn't walk without hobbling. Several hours after taking medicine most of the pain disappeared, and I am back to normal. Great success, I'd say!	M	65	1  days	8/28/2007
1	frozen shoulder	I have vaginal bleeding and my vaginal skin burns a lot, my cycle was back (I'm menopausal ), breast painOther symptoms I have: erithema, my skin is so dry I have little cuts on my hands, I 'm sweating a lot (usually I don't), pruritus ani etc.	I took it 3 times: the first for 3 days, then I stopped because it didn't make  great improvements and I had diarrhea. My doctor told me the symptoms had to go away after taking few moreSecond time: I took other 3 pills in 3 days. little improvement with the pain. I had the first vaginal bleeding, a lot of pruritus and my skin was all red but I didn't know it was arthrotec. My doctor prescribed me a topical cream , did some vaginal testto exclude infections. I had my cycleThe last one for 4 days. More problems and this time I had the idea to go on Internet and I discovered I had a lot of the side effects by taking Arthrotec	F	50	10  days	2/3/2006
5	knee/hip/wrist arthritis	90% effective- Hard on my stomach even when I take it with food.	It surpasses any other new drug on the market. I give excellent marks for the original VOLTAREN.	M	68	1  days	11/13/2004
