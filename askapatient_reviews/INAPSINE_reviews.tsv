1	pancreatitis	Received inapsine, benadryl and zophran thru an IV. Within minutes began to get very hot and panicked. Could not catch my breath. Thought I was dying. Extreme urge to leave the hospital. Hooked up to the bed with no call light started yelling for a nurse. She brought in 2 shots of ativan. At that point my legs were twitching so bad I couldn't sit still and scared out of my mind. Had my sister sign me out AMA. I don't remember that. I have no memory of anything after that until my husband woke me up 13 hours later. The absolute scariest thing that I've ever been through.		F	34	1  days	3/24/2013Email
1	Had steroid injection in spine	Same feelings as above patient. Went to er that night got Ativan and better after that.		F		1  days	2/10/2013
1	Dizziness	They administered the Inapsine through my IV and within a couple minutes I started to feel like I was going crazy. My body started to tremor, my heart was racing and I just wanted to escape from the hospital....and I did!!! I removed the IV and left without being discharged. On the bus home, I felt uncomfortable and claustrophobic, like I just want to run around and flail my arms or jump off the bus. Got home, had to give my son to a family member and locked myself in a dark room. Tried and tried to goto sleep, not happening, my legs wouldn't stop moving and I was having crazy thoughts. I woke up the next day and my legs were still moving, still anxious and scared...so I called 911. They brought me back to the ER and gave me Benadryl and Ativan which made me feel a little better but I still feel crazy. Definitely not myself anymore. This is day 3, I still don't feel myself, my legs are still moving and I can't seem to express myself much. Why do they prescribe this medicine to people if there's a chance of it running someone's life?? Am I just stuck like this forever? People at the ER didn't even take it seriously. It was a joke to them.Contact me if you're going through something similar: nwsmith1984@gmail.com		M	28	1  days	11/29/2012Email
1	Spinal headache	Initially, extreme paranoia and pacing.  Almost ran out of the hospital.  Had unrelenting pacing and tachycardia for days.  I must have walked a total of 30 miles in 24 hours just pacing around the house.  My legs were exhausted and about to give out, but could still not stop walking due to this hellish medication.  After a week of Benadryl and another hospital visit, I returned mostly to normal.		M	24	1  daysunk, IM 1X D	11/23/2012Email
1	Nausea	Was administered this drug after giving birth to my daughter. Within 10 min began shaking all over. Extreme irritability. Felt like I wise literally trying to crawl out of my own   skin.  Experienced these symptoms for quite some time - was given Benadryl  to counteract but was unable to hold my newborn baby for the first several hours of being born due to these side effects.

1	Nausea and pain	Akathisia, severe anxiety, Dystonia (like my face, jaw and neck and back were turning in different diffections by force on its own, I felt like I was goin crazy. 5 min after receiving the medication I got a sudden urge to escape and kept thinking of ways to rip out my IV. I thought I was going crazy. I urged them to release me from the hospital and I was very anxious. They didn't notice I was having an adverse reaction so I went home in pain from my body twisting up. Two days later I went back they gave me ativan and IV Benadryl and the symptoms went away.		F	24	1  days	10/15/2012Email
1	Migraine	The ER doc gave me Inapsine for my migraine and within 5 minutes I suddenly felt Panic. I just wanted to run out of the ER despite my #8 Migraine and became extremely anxious. I asked the ER nurse if this is a side effect as this feeling was very alarming and frightening to me. She said that she was not aware of it as a side-effect. 24-hours later and I am still crawling out of my skin. I feel extremely tired physically but I can't lay down for more than 5 or 10 minutes at a time and I just have to get up and pace. Will this go away?? I'm starting to worry I will never be normal again!		F	40	1  days2.5 IM 1X D	10/15/2012Email
1	For relief of nausea & dizz	The worst drug I have ever had, The really bad effects lasted 36 hours, could not set still, felt like I had to keep moving, had really bad tremors, suicide thoughts,  felt like I was a crazy person, never again will I receive this drug		M	27	1  days	3/9/2012
1	For relief of nausea & dizziness	Sudden onset EXTREME agitation, anxiety. Claustrophobia combined with sedation. Uncontrollable total body jerks, felt like running out of ER. Thought of killing myself (and this is NOT the kind of thing I would have thought before). The absolute most horrid thing I have ever experienced. Still having trauma flashbacks from the experience! Closest thing I have ever experienced to what it must be like to be trapped in an irritable, psychotic manic state. Do not let anyone you love get this medication without carefully considering this as a possible side effect.		F	36	1  daysUnknown	12/8/2011
4	migraine			F	41	 2.5mg 1X D	7/24/2010History
1	migraine	I felt like I wanted to jump ot of my skin. I was very drowsy and so uncomfortable, but I couldnt do anything about it. I had twitches every other second because I could'nt control or stand what I was feeling.		F	25	 	9/11/2008
4	Sedation	I was very drowsy after using it and slept most of the day.	I discussed my experience with my doctor thinking that perhaps she would adjust the dose the following time, but she apologized and stopped using it on me.	M	32	1  times	10/2/2007Email
1	nausea	Psychosis. Extreme unbearable panic.Intensity would remain constant until hospital staff gave medication to quickly induce sleep. Would wake with normal mind, but fear horrific experience could happen again. (Never thinking could be drug side effect, questioned whether was fear of IVs. Eventually developed panic disorder associated with IVs.) Not until ER nurse educated me on strong link between Inapsine and anxiety, did I understand. Also, experienced physical "claustrophobic-like" sense as though bound. Strong desire to move. Threatened to rip out my IV. If no relief,could possibly have resorted to suicide.	Was given Inapsine and other anti nausea medications (including Phenergan) a few times over a period of about ten years for morning sickness and flu. Initially, I had no such side effect. My sensitivity changed to the point that I had an immediate anxiety experience after taking a suppository. Doctors never volunteered info about side effects, and last doctor said ER nurse who told me of side effect, didn't know what she was talking about. Have friend who responded so dramatically to Inapsine given in hospital for morning sickness, she literally ripped out hair from her head.	F	42	 	9/19/2007
1		Had a kidney stone and compazine was not working so they switched me to droperidol	I was sedated, I could here people around me but I could not respond or speak for 6 hours	F	37	1  times	7/30/2007Email
1	migraine	extreme agitation, dysphoria, felt like I was going to jump out of my skin, extreme panic	I was given this in IV form for my pain level 10 migraine.  It is an awful medication.  It makes you feel depressed for days afterwards.  Doctors in the ER like to give it to pain patients so they don't have to "risk" treating them with pain killing medication.  I find the side effects of Inapsine to be much worse than any painkiller I've been given for my migraines.  I will never accept this med again.	F	24	1  days	6/2/2007
1	nausea	Psychosis.  It hurt to think.  I wanted to rip my skin off and RUN.  I was in the hospital with a kidney stone and was in a bed with an IV.  I came very close to ripping the iv out and running through the halls.  The doctors and nurses didn't think anything was wrong, so I had to wait for the drug to leave my system.  One of the scariest experiences of my life.		F	26	1  days	4/9/2007
1	HOSPITAL GAVE IT FOR ANXIETY	coma like effect, scary		F	29	1  days	11/5/2006
1	nausea	Psychosis. The worst thing I've ever experienced in my life. Very antsy and brain not functioning well. Just the functioning of my brain was painful. It felt like the worst kind of mental illness imaginable- like being in hell.	Should be banned.	F	35	1  times	3/19/2006
1	nausea	I had the same reaction to compazine. akathesia is what I think the reaction's called.it was like adernaline kept rushing through my veins. couldn't sit still felt like a panic attack. As I was trying to crawl out of my skin. Very scarey but the nurse reconized the reaction and gave me benadryl and before it could get really bad it was over.	I am now reading that there is also heart complications people have suffered from while takin inapsine.	F	25	1  times	2/21/2006Email
