5	hypothyroidism	I was in severe hypothyroidism. Finally diagnosed with hypothyroidism with TSH @ 88 and trace elements of T3 & T4.  Had all symptoms and very severe they were - weight gain, extreme fatigue, no libido, yellow skin, puffy face and eyes, allergies, no sweating, low pulse, extremely low heart rate, carpal tunnel syndrome (tingling in extremities), brain fog, confusion, couldn't concentrate and losing my mind.  I can't imagine how I could have continued to live that way.  I cried on average 3 hours everyday and all sensory abilities (vision, hearing, taste and smell) gone	Finally found a dr. who did a simple blood test for determination of thyroidism.  I was in such bad condition that first week on meds I called emergency twice - extreme fever and heat, panick attacks, etc.  Was because my body "started its engines".  On day 2 I had immediate mental relief.  Depression completely vanished.  On meds - 100 mg for approx. 5 weeks and I am a new girl!  Lost 22 pounds and sweat at the gym like I was 20 again and all the tingling gone!  This dr. saved my life.  I was close to myexdema coma.  My face looks normal.  Hair has stopped falling out and I pray every woman gets a thyroid test performed every year.  No person should live like those suffering from hypothyroidism.  It was beyond a nightmare for me.  I too told my children they have their mother back.  I can't say enough good about this drug!  It is the brand form otherwise known as eltroxin and my energy levels are beyond what I ever imagined.  A good diet, workouts most days of the week and t	F	47	35  days	5/2/2008

4	Counter Side Effect of Lithium Carb	None	While taking Lithium Carbonate I experienced the side effect of EXTREME thinning of my eyebrows. It took two years of using the Levothyroxine but my eyebrows finally look like before.	F	42	3  years	10/6/2007

4	hashimotos thyroiditis/hypothyroid	none that I can recall, some hair thinning as with most thyroid replacements but it has been tolerable so far	I was taking Synthroid and still having a few problems with fatigue, etc. My Doctor recommended I  try Unithroid though I am not sure of the difference in the 2 drugs.  Fatigue seemed to resolve once I got to a higher dose.	F	49	5  years	5/26/2005
3	Underactive thyroid	Diarrhea, insomnia, headaches	I seem to have a little more energy, that's all I really notice.  I could not handle the cold before, and it has helped that, but the side effects aren't good.  I think I will try a natural supplement.	F	44	30  days	11/12/2004Email
2	Hashimoto's Thyroiditis		No side effects, but it doesn't seem to be very helpful. I still have all my symptoms: cold, hair loss, difficulty losing weight. But my T levels are normal according to the Dr.	F	39	3  years	11/6/2002
