4	Atrial fibrilation	Raynaud's on hands in the colder months, low metabolism requiring reduced caloric intake to maintain weight.  I attribute other common symptoms, like hair thinning, to menopause.	I was switched to a generic  two years ago for several months by my insurance company and it was awful.  My doctor was outraged and switched me back to the brand name.  A generic is not "identical" and the government allows a large percentage deviation from a brand name, so beware.  My father was diagnosed with a-fib at age 53 as well, he was able to go off all meds once he hit his late 70's.  He's 87 now.	F	59	6  years100 mg 1X D	7/7/2013Email
2	HTN	Dizziness, tinnitis, anxiety, blurred vision, headache	Things started out ok on this, but after 3 weeks I had to go off this medication from the side effects, which mostly cleared up within 24 hours.  Also, it only decreased my BP slightly.	F	47	3  weeks25 MG 1X D	5/10/2013

1	hypertension	lightheadedness, fatigue, diminished sex drive, blurred visison, depression and anxiety	It took one month for the side effects to show and I thought it was hay fever. When I finally figured out that my issues were caused by Metoprolol it was five months later. It took 10 days for the symptoms to begin to subside and then headaches began. Symptoms got worse before they got better. It took 3 weeks to feel 90 percent better. It stays in your liver so it takes time to be purged. Stay with it. It gets incrementally better each day. Note: Even a little alcohol made me feel worse during recovery.	M	63	5  months50 1X D	10/13/2012Email
4	heart mumur	I'm tired all the time. Can't sleep. mood swings. slight depression. weight gain. cold all the time. my heart still flutters sometimes.	I was born with a heart murmur. I had cardiomyopathy in my last trimester of pregnancy. My doctors put me on the Toprol xl because of the rapid heartbeat. I am always fatigued. I can never feel rested. I just wished I was not on this medication. I had rather have the procedure done that would take care of the fast heartbeat than take the toprol, but the doctor seems to think the medication is best. Can't exercise cause I'm too tired to. So what are you to do.	F	50	9  years200 mg 1X D	9/8/2012Email
4	SVT	Had mild side effects when I started the Med such as vivid dreams and weight gain but its been 3 years now and I've been able to lose 60lbs so far with a healthy diet. This Med has benefited me after numerous trips to the emergency room for a heart rate exceeding over 200bpm that would result in blackouts. My heart rate and BP has remained in the normal range since starting this drug.		F	35	3  years200mg	8/4/2012
5	Dilated Cardiomyopathy	Impotence	Using both Toprol XL and Liprinosil , my heart recovered from an ejection fraction of 30 % to 48% in just a couple of years. I have almost no physical limitations and go hiking with friends in steep terain sometimes in summer.  I also go to the gym with no limitations from my doctor.	M	58	10  years150mg 2X D	4/14/2012
2	Anxiety, menopause, elevated bp	weight gain, feeling slow & tired all the time, dizzy, mixed up & confused, depression, strange dreams, fluttery heart, anxiety worsened, anxiety attacks	after initial dr visit & BP monitoring at home for several months found out I have white coat hypertension. Doc wanted to keep me on Toprol 25 MG anyway even after I insisted I didn't want to take it due to side effects. I cannot lose weight on this drug. I am STARVING myself.  I eat less than 1000 calories a day, I jog for 40 minutes, use an eliptical for 45-60 mins, bike for 60 minutes, and even lift weights and I still stress myself out becasue I know weight loss will help with the elevated blood pressure but I CANNOT lose weight on this medication no matter what I do. I am going to cycle off and keep checking my BP with my own cuff. It has been calibrated by my physician, but he just won't budge on the meds. I think there are other ways for me to achieve my goal than with this awful medication.	F	50	1  years25 MG 1X D	4/5/2012

5	A-Fib	Reduced, normalized heart rate (very good), some weight gain (10lbs), some decrease in sex drive, alot less anxiety. I have suffered with panic disorder and chronic anxiety, took Xanax for many years, with Metoprolol I was able to completely withdraw from Xanax (awesome result..)...	Went to the ER last March for A-fib, horrible experience. A-fib stopped when I took 25mg Xanax that I happened to have with me - my heart doctor was quite surprised, as Xanax is not the normal prescription for A-fib...thereafter I took 12.5mg Metoprolol XL once at night, that I reduced to 10mg. Discontinued Xanax completely. Generally, I hate taking any drugs, but Metoprolol really helped me. Very glad I needed only a very low dose, took 50mg pill and split it four ways, then shaved the pieces to 10mg dose. After 10 months, I am now trying to taper off, took 5mg last 2 nights and was getting palpitations, may be a sign that I still need the drug, as the palpitations stopped when I added another 5mg. Point is - this absolutely worked for normalizing my heart rate and stopping any reoccurence of A-Fib. I can handle the withdrawal symptoms - but not another bout of A-fib!		55	10  months10MG 1X D	1/25/2012Email

4	Mitral Valve Prolapse	dizziness, lower than normal BP, fatigue, vivid dreams	I had minimal side effects, but I forgot to take it for 2 days, and had horrible palpatations, chest pressure, chest pain, and got very shaky to the point that I was dropping everything I picked up.  As long as I take my medicaiton on time, the side effects are minimal, but I still get the shakes in my hands sometimes.	F	27	60  days50 2X D	9/1/2011Email
2	High Blood Pressure	Severe Anxiety, Heart Palpitations, and Stomach problems were the main three.  It started ok for the first 2 months, then hit like a ton of bricks.  Took about 3 weeks to get off and am now starting to feel normal.   This is supposed to help with Heart Palps but for me, it did the opposite.	Ok for a while then the side effects got too much to handle.  Would rather die earlier than live the way I felt on this.	M	42	3  months25 1X D	8/8/2011Email
3	PosturalOrthostaticTachycardiaSynd	Started out as the typical fatigue and weakness from being on a beta blocker but as I kept stepping up the dosage I noticed a decline in cognitive function, much like being in a fog. It also got worse when transitioning to a new manufacture of the generic form. Anyway as of late, the following symptoms have been shown: Brain fog, constant fatigue and low energy level, still get chest pain/PVCs, shortness of breath, not sleeping well, weird vivid dreams that take a while after waking to realize no longer in a dream, pressure headaches, vision problems, body just "crashes" after eating meals, ice cold feet, numbness/tingling in extremities, hard time finding words/speaking clearly, irritability and some anxiety especially when exhausted(kinda funny when constantly fatigued), dizziness, still have heart rate/BP problems but more controlled and the thick brain fog is almost constant.	Mind you the reason i have continued taking this drug is because the doctors said that it is a "safe" "normal" drug with almost no side effects so i chalked up the left over symptoms to a severe brain injury i sustained years ago. The symptoms have been getting a little worse as of late so i decided to do some research online regarding the drug and came across this website and a slew of data showing the ill effects of this drug. I plan on visiting with my new GP next week and start getting off this drug. It does help mediate some things but when you help solve one problem and create a few dozen more, its not worth it. If you are having some or all of the side effects listed from all the people here, talk to your doc about possibly getting off. And if they argue, remember that you pay them to service you and are open to discuss options. I wish you all well and best of luck. Feel free to contact me if you have questions.

1	High Blood Pressure	night sweats, lethargy and difficulty working out due to decreased heart rate, decreased libido	I was on the lowest possible dose, and discontinued this drug because I was concerned about possible permanent effects on my heart and adrenaline response. BP went down on its own because I stopped taking Tylenol, not because of the toprol. Didn't like the lack of energy and felt it was doing more harm than good.	F	52	6  weeks12.5 mg 1X D	7/5/2011Email
3	Mitral Valvle Prolapse	This medicine worked fine for years, but eventually cause me to be lethargic, have no interest in sex, and I lost motivation for work, play, family, etc...

2	Anxiety - chest pains	I have been taking this drug for 3 years. I started out with the NAME BRAND Toprol XL - no problems at FIRST. However, my pharmacist eventually insisted on the generic Toprol XL Metoprolol Succinate. Over time worsening symptoms developed. Depression, lack of motivation, easily stressed/depressed/overly emotional, dizziness, fatigue, etc. I suffered from Panic Attacks before taking this med., but it seemed to cause SO many adverse reactions with other medications, including SSRI anti-depressants. I became not wanting to do anything and I am constantly in a fog. If I miss a dose or change the time of day I take my dose I start experiencing my chest pains/anxiety all over again... which is what I am going through right now. This is just not worth it TBO... I may just stick with my lorazepam and ask my doc to taper me off this shtiz. Did wonderful at the beginning but I think prolongued use is screwing me up...		F	27	3  years50 MG 1X D	6/14/2011Email

1	High Blood Pressure	I am taking a Generic Toprol XL.  First I was taking 100 mg twice a day when a doc told me to stop it.  Ended up in the hospital with palpitations, speeding heart rate, very high blood pressure and anxiety.  Doc says, oh I wouldn't have told you to stop it if I knew you had a heart problem.  Hmm, well, I don't have a heart problem, I told him it's the drug.  Had to look it up on the internet to find out what was wrong with me and had to go back on it to stop the withdrawal symptoms.  I am now on 100 mg. 1 time a day.  Not one doc will get me off this drug.  I have been to three asking for help.  Right after I started taking it I got dizzy all the time and was sent to a neurologist who said I was having migraines without the pain, quack.  He put me on another drug.  Watch out docs will put on more drugs because of the side effects of the BP med. Then it just gets worse.  You can't convince them that it's the drug that's causing all your symptoms.

1	High Blood Pressure/Heart Disease	I recently had 3 stents put in 12/2010.  I had been on Toprol in varying amounts for 10 years.  My BP was perfect or low and my heart rate was about 50 bpm.  I have always had a lower than normal heart rate.  Although I have had heart stents before, I was not feeling well after this procedure.  Real dizzy especially in the afternoon.  About 3 weeks after the surgery, I went to the emergency room and my heart rate was 41 and BP was 90/45.  The Dr. weined me off Toprol (25MG)over about a 2 week period.  First cut back to 12.5 MG for a week then half of that for about a week.  Dizziness is still present, not as persistent as before.  Heart rate is close to 60 and BP is either at or below normal (120/80) most of the time.  Not sure what changed with the stents, but BP seems to have stablized. Still taking Altace however.

1	blood pressure	When I started Toprol at 25 mg I lost my life as I knew it.  Over the years it has been increased to 200 per day and I have gained close to 75 lbs.  Because I gained weight they increased my Synthroid, declared me type 2 diabetic and gave me more drugs.  Every joint aches and I no longer can walk any long distances.  Try convincing your doctor that it's the drugs!	I now have palpitations, my memory is shot and I am depressed.  I am going to be going to a new physician and hopefully I can get my life back as I once knew it.  The worst is not being able to feel those adrenalin highs anymore.  Like when your grand children visit, or your birthday.	F	65	9  years100 MG 2X D	2/15/2011

1	high blood pressure	foggy thinking with lack of ability to focus and organize, depression, heart palpitations, poor balance, intestinal problems, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some symptoms.	I'm SO glad I found this site! I was diagnosed with hypo-thyroid about the same time a doctor prescribed Toprol for high blood pressure. I took it for maybe 5 years. When I read the comments at this site, I realized that people taking Toprol had all the same symptoms I was blaming on the hypo-thyroid. I went to my NEW doctor, not the one who prescribed the Toprol, and asked her to wean me off Toprol. We did, and as fast as just a few days after I stopped taking it, I started noticing changes. I looked around, and everything was suddenly more organized. I could think straight again. Heart palipitations went away... my balance came back... and the best of all, I was a whole lot happier. AND, it wasn't hard to stop. My doctor gave me a combination of Losartan-HCTZ and a different beta blocker. After I ran out of the beta blocker, I continued just with the Losartan-HCTZ, with no big withdrawal problems. May have to play with the dosage, but did get off the Toprol without many problems.If you're taking Toprol - STOP! I'm 100% sure it's been responsible for ruining my life these last 5 years.

4	high blood pressure	Extreme tiredness, major hair loss, heart flutters,	This medication is very good at controlling my blood pressure and lowering my heart rate. I've experienced heart flutters off and on but do not know for sure if that is from the Toprol. But I am so tired I fall asleep sitting up all the time, sometimes even standing! I was on 50mg twice a day for years and then went to 100mg extended release (XL) once a day. That is when my hair started falling out (about 2 months after starting it). Within 8 months my hair was half gone, even the hair on my legs fell out and left them smooth and bald. I don't mind not having to shave my legs but I draw the line when it comes to losing the hair on my head.	F	50	5  years100 mg 1X D	1/13/2011

2	HB	heart palpitations	I took this for 5 months. i started at 50mg. i felt tired the first two days only. my libido when out the window. then i went up to 100 mg. same, i was very tired like i did not want to get off couch for two days. then i got heart palpitations very badly every day. i started to panic from these which made them worse. i got a cardio monitor for 24 hours. the specialist said i have too much adrenaline cause my heart to beat preliminary to when i was supposed to. he said it was no big deal and if it became troublesome he can perscribe a beta blocker. is said i was on one and he said to up the dose. as soon as i started to ween myself off these pills the palpitations completely ceased. our bodys tolerate medication differently.

3	To reduce / control PVCs	I was doing fine for 7 or so months taking 1/2 of a 25 mg Toprol-XL tablet.  I was living in Australia, and I received the name brand version by AstraZeneca.  Then, once I moved back to the United States, my doctor continued my prescription, but I got the generic version.  After being on the generic version for a few weeks, I would get terrible anxiety attacks and a rapid heartbeat.  I think there is possibly a quality issue with the generic form.  Wondering if anyone else gets these "attacks" where you feel like you're going crazy, want to jump out of your skin, and your heart beats VERY fast.  This goes on for 1 to 2 hours.

4	tachycardia and elevated bp	None	I was wondering if I should hold a dose if my pulse is 55. My doctor told me as long as my systolic was over 100, I can take it. He never said anything about pulse. Anyone else has the issue of standing blood pressure shooting up to 90's to 100's?  At the dr office they always take it sitting.

1	High Blood Pressure	Extreme fatigued, difficulty breathing, heart palpitations, weight  gain	This pill was horrible for me. My doctor prescribed it for high blood pressure. I took his advice and took the pill once a day. I began experiencing bad side effects right away, but thought the doctor knew best and continued with the medication. During the second week I was having such difficulty breathing. I was tired all of the time and would fall asleep in the middle of the afternoon for hours at length and would wake up with cold sweats. (I'm not a napper.)  I gained 5 pounds which I've been the same weight for ten years and eat healthy. The scariest part was the day that I YAWNED over 100 times uncontrollablly -- as if it was my bodies only way to get oxygen in my lungs. I have been off it now for two days and the side effects are slowly going away.  I'd NEVER take this pill again.  Horrible, horrible side effects.	F	41	3  weeks50 mg 1X D	10/15/2010

I have been to nutritionists spend thousands on trainers . could not lose a pound. all types of test were done and no dr at anytime mentioned that the toprol may be a problem .

Since I was on 100 mg initially, I upped dosage to 100 mg and hoped for the best on the shortness of breath.  After about 3 to 4 months on the 100 mg, shortness of breath is now just a minor annoyance, either my body has adjusted to the medication or I'm not noticing it as much as initially.

5	PSVT and High Blood Pressure	minor fatigue.	Also take Lisinopril 5 mg.  Toprol works very well for my PSVT.	F	36	1  years100 mg 1X D	4/9/2010
5	High Blood Pressure	Amazingly, I have no discernible side effects. My uncontrolled BP peaked at 300/200 (seriously). The doctors said they had never seen such numbers. Typical numbers for me were in the neighborhood of 240/160 and that was a good day. I could routinely hear my blood circulating. They did every test in the book but finally decided it was "essential" hypertension with no pathological cause. I got lots of headaches then but I haven't had a headache in 16 years! I also take an ACE inhibitor. My BP on meds is 120/80.	I see people reporting lots of unpleasant side effects from this drug, but I haven't experienced any of them. Perhaps I'm just lucky, even with the massive dose I take (I think it's the max dose the PDR allows to be prescribed). I used to take the branded XL version, but it's so expensive I switched to a generic and have had no problem with it.	M	63	16  years200 mg 2X D	3/27/2010Email
3	palpitations	Weight gain despite diet and exercise, fatique, crazy nightmares, general feelings of heaviness.	FAT!  My biggest side effect was weight gain.  Boy did I gain weight.  I spent most of my 20s as a size 2, then a size 4 in my 30s.  I eat a good diet and am fairly active.  I've always been thin.  I gained almost 8 pounds in the first 2 months on this drug, and just kept on gaining until I was about 15 pounds heavier than usual.  After adhering to a ridiculously low calorie diet and exercising compulsively, I was able to take the weight back off over a period of 9 months, losing very slowly.  Then, I had surgery and was unable to exercise a lot, but maintained a reasonable diet.  I gained all the weight back and then some, in about 6 months time, while eating responsibly.I read so much other feedback about others with this issue that I just have to blame the drug - I'd be willing to admit mistakes I made, but the weight gain was so sudden, and so out of the norm for my body, and so hard to fix, that I think the pill must share some of the responsibility.It did, however, really help the irregular heartbeats.

1	High blood pressure	I experienced dizziness, brain fog and sensitivity to motion which caused me to stop driving.  I decided I wanted off this medicine so the doctor had me take a pill every other day for 5 days, and then stop completely.	The fun began on the first day I didn't take a pill. Racing heart rate, serious dizziness, blood pressure bouncing all over the place, loud ringing in my ears, insomnia, no appetite, horrible nervous energy and anxiety. It lasted over the weaning period and the first 4 days of being off the drug. Today is the 5th day of being off the drug and I feel better than I have in months. My bp looks good and I've decided to use stress management techniques, diet and exercise to keep my bp in check.	F	53	5  months25 Mg 1X D	3/5/2010
3	Mitral Valve Prolapse	For 12 years I did not experience any side affect while on this medication.	About 13 years ago i was experiencing shortness of breath, palpitations, fluttering and pain in my chest and arm. My cardiologist diagnosed me with Mitral Valve Prolapse so i've been on Toprol XL ever since.  I was taking 50 mg and then it was reduced to 25 mg about 2 years ago because of my weight lose. For about 3 weeks now i have been experiencing anxiety, shortness of breath and panic attacks. I stopped the Toprol for about 4 days and i seemed better but began taking it once again for fear of withdrawal symptoms. Now i'm back on it regularly and i'm extremely anxious and i just want to run and scream. I feel like i'm going to lose my mind and i believe it's due to the toprol xl. I will make an appointment to see my cardiologist and have him wean me off the toprol asap. I would prefer to deal with the symptoms of the mitral valve prolapse then deal with this terrible anxiety. Wish me luck and good luck to all that are experiencing awful symptoms.	F	40	12  years25 MG 1X D	2/18/2010
1	Blood Pressure	Started taking @ early 20th, gradually stopped recognizing my own self. Razor sharp clarity was replaced with a dull vail that is seemeingly harder and harder to pierce. Iritability, lethargy, nightmares and nimb limbs became a comon occurance. Nearly complete hair loss by the age of 33. In the moment of clarity realized that WTF!! this is not me: found this website -found more peope like me and got f' off this damn drug. NO MORE BETA BLOCKERS.		M	35	8  years50 1X D	2/15/2010Email
1		foggy brain, feeling completely "out of it", no motivation at all.	I've only been on this drug a few weeks and I'm going to stop.  I wish I had found this site BEFORE I started taking this drug.  I had been feeling good for a year or so (after medication problems for hypothyroidism) and wham, here I am feeling tired and lethargic again!  I'm going to really try to control my boderline high BP with diet and exerciswe.	F	45	14  days	2/3/2010Email

3	Depression	Weight gain and constant appetite, anxiety, inability to concentrate	Worked well for the depression, but the constant appetite and associated weight gain, along with anxiety at higher doses, was not worth it overall	F	39	2.5  months	12/22/2009

1	anxiety and mood swings	increased heart rate that made my daughter pass out only after the 2nd day.	after first night of taking my daughter missed school the next day feeling nauseated and stomach cramps. That night she experienced indigestion/heartburn. She vomited. Sleepy but couldn't sleep. Feeling scared for no reason. Next day she passed out after being awake for 15 min. I got her up and she passed out a 2nd time. White as a ghost and cold. She doesn't remember any of it. Took her to e.r. and her heart rate was spiking when she stood up from a sitting/standing position. Blood work, bp, ct scan all came back good. Drs recommended to take her of the drug. I got home and looked up the side effects and all of these were listed.  I can only say that we are glad we found out so quickly about this drug.	F	12	2  days	12/19/2009
2	OCD, racing thoughts.	drowsiness, leg pains, akathisia...	it is a great drug to calm down mind... seems to be on a "holy peace"... but side effects are too strong, just for me.	M	23	14  days	12/18/2009
3	bipolar	stopped after 14 months due to heart pulpitations, memory loss, trouble sleeping, slur speach due to excess syliva, after 12 months these things started. At the end he mentioned sores in mouth but I did not see them.	When my son started this drug I thought a miracle happened. It was amazing the self controll, focus, attention to details beyond what I had expected. There was an immediate reaction that was good. All the time I thought my son was intentionally behaving bad until he started this drug. With in 1 wk my son was displaying all of the good things I had been trying to teach him all along. This was very encouraging for him to act out good things and obey without a struggle. This really gave me hope until he was putting his shoe on one day and had it in his hand then asked me what was he doing? Then I noticed more his grades declining and could not repeat anything the moment before. His memory retention was -0-.So we have made changes to a different med. that is not giving any quick positive reaction yet. We will Keep trying. I am very uncomfortable giving a child this age any drug that is diagnosised by trial and error.	M	8	14  months	12/17/2009
2	unipolar depression	nasal stuffiness, dyslexia, word finding problems, increased appetitite, change (worsening) of vision, weight gain and wanting to graze constantly, watering eyes, feel like gravity is heavier (I have to sit down to brush my teeth), very restless around people, visual hallucinations (things disappear then reappear right where I saw them last), trouble focusisng while driving  --- weird.	I am taking 50 mg of lamictal concurrently with 7.5 mg abilify.  Affect is flatter, less mood swings, but more non-reactive than anything.  I'm not sure this is where I want to be. I have been able to get projects done that I had difficulty starting.  Some days I have energy, some days I don't.  I a fasting blood draw yesterday and haven't heard the results yet.  Continuing to take abilify is a quandary -- do I feel worse or better if I factor in all the weird side effects?  I will probably cut down on the dose since I really will be suicidal if I gain any more weight.	F	51	30  days	12/17/2009
3	Bipolar	Some weight gain, some restlessness	My 14 yr old son has been on 2.5 mg of Abilify for 3 months now.  He has gained 8lbs. so we are going to be watching this closely.  It has helped him be able to concentrate, and definitely better in school, and social groups.  Smoothed out the ups and downs.  Previously was on trileptal and zoloft.	M	14	90  days	12/14/2009Email
1	Post-opiate addiction depression	Cannot sit still, terrible anxiety after about 2 weeks, weight gain	This drug should be taken off the market.  After about the 3rd day you will not be able to sit still, ever.  It feels like there is something inside of you trying to get out.  After about 2 weeks I started having severe anxiety attacks almost constantly and came very close to having to be committed/hospitalized.  Smack your doctor if he recommends this.	M	26	 	12/13/2009
5	Depression, bi polar, etc.	NONE, ...perhaps a little sleepy. I only take 5 mg per day.	I know I am lucky for this but I really haven't noticed any side effects. Abilify has been great in that for me it creates a kind of peace of mind by eliminating the aberrant thoughts and whatnot.  I stop talking to myself so much, it helps me get out of my head so to speak...   Based on my positive experience I would tell others to start with no more than 5 mg for the first month...  	M	42	3  years	12/3/2009

3	bipolar	insatiable appetite. Gained 7 pounds in 4 weeks.	Worked well on stabilizing my mood. But already being overweight, my Doc said the rapid weight gain was unacceptable and switched me to lamictal. Geodon had been working well for me, but the side effect of clenching my left side...mainly leg and toes, leaving my toes red and swollen, led me to stop taking it. Depakote made me a zombie.	M	56	28  days	11/30/2009
5	major depression	Vivid dreams otherwise a good addition to lexapro	greatly improved my mood and made me more active and interested in life.	M	55	6  months	11/26/2009
4	autism spectrum disorder/ bipolar	Weight gain - up to 30lb	My daughter has had tremendous improvement in energy, concentration, and mood. Before taking Abilify she was on Geodon and had terrible akathisia. It also interfered with her ability to learn, and she had to withdraw from college courses to avoid failing. (She wound up finishing college with a B average, so you can see she's normally able to learn. ) Once she got off the Geodon, the irritability and stupidness went away but she became suicidal and self-injured. Since starting the Abilify she hasn't tried suicide even once. (Before that it was 14 times in six years.) I am grateful to the Abilify, but I wish she wasn't so hungry all the time.

4	recurrent major depression	Within the first 4 days I had experienced a great sense of relief of the depression. I had a burst of energy that is still there, my old self. I did experience about 3 days of severe headaches , migraines , but I weathered the storm and  the headaches went away. I take Cymbalta 60.mg and now 2 mg  abilify.I would stick with it since it works within 2 weeks.I sleep better, and  am more focused. I do eat more but I think it's the winter and I needed to feel better from the headaches. Diet tomorrow!		F	49	6  days	11/23/2009
5	Autism/ADHD/Bipolar	Muscle pain and sleepiness	My son started taking 10 MG about a year ago.  He has made drastic improvements in his schoolwork and social skills.  He is now making friends and getting good grades.  Besides the leg pain and sleepiness at night it has been great.	M	9	1.5  years	11/19/2009Email
1	bi polar	Weight gain within weeks. I felt bad enough w/o the extra pound a week.Went From 110 114 IN 3 Weeks. Very restless as well. I stopped taking my 10 abilify and continue with ambien and clonazepam	made me feel worse. I would rather deal on my own	F	39	1  months	11/15/2009
1	depression & anxiety	I took this and right away I had more energy. Even joined a Gym for the first time in my life. But than within a week my blood sugar sky rocket, I mean I was in the hospital with sugar over 600, my meter couldn't even read it, and the hospital had trouble bringing it down with fast acting insulin. Then my legs started shaking couldn't keep still. I had to go off it cold turkey because of my dangerously high sugar. It might work for some people but be careful of the side affects.		M	26	1  months	11/9/2009
4	major depression and anxiety	the first night i felt like i was coming down from meth. i adjusted the times i took my meds, because i take asprin, reglan, nexium, and effexor 75's.  i took the asprin, nexium, and reglan with dinner, and the effexor and abilify, plus a half of a klonopin at bedtime, and i sleep through the stomach upset.	the second day i felt much better.  i was able to clean a room, take care of bills, and just never thought of negative things more than twice.  this is my third day, and i was able to joke around with my husband at the store, and though i still haven't showered, i may do that tonight, after i clean the bathroom.  i have great hopes for this med, and hopefully, i won't have to take it very long.	F	47	3  days	11/8/2009Email
5	Bipolar depression	Some weight gain and insomnia.	This drug saved me from the darkest, deepest depression I have ever had to endure.  For over two years, I lost my will to see people, clean house, get dressed, etc.  After just three days on Abilify, I was able to get up, shower, go visit friends in New England (I live in South Florida), clean up my messy house and talk on the phone again.  I have gained a great deal of weight over the years from all different types of medication.  I accept the fact that medication makes me heavy and I am grateful to be heavier and sane than thin and crazy.	F	54	30  days	11/2/2009
5	Depression/Anxiety	Occasional headache.  Woke up in the middle of the night a few times but that got better.  Still sleeping well.	Doctor added 2 mg Abilify to my 10 mg Lexapro because I was still having suicidal thoughts despite the Lexapro.  Its worked great so far and has been a real boost in energy and mood.	M	17	5  weeks	11/2/2009
4	anxiety, paranoia and major depress	restlessness at 20 mg, eye tic at l5 mg, now down to 2 mg daily.  No weight gain at all on any of the doses.	Because of side effects including diabetes risk tried to go cold turkey at l0 mg.  Okay for about 2 weeks then experienced major nervousness, disorientation, jaw clenching, etc.  Now taking 2 mg. daily and feeling much better.  Still worried about side effects.  Not taking any other drug along with it.  Still experiencing anxiety but it is manageable.  You must wean yourself off this drug and not try to quit at once.	F	62	3  months	11/2/2009
3	ADHD	uncontrollable muscle movements, especially when in the car.	My son has been on Abilify (1 mg) for over a year.  We started on .5 mg because of his weight.  I did not want to medicate my child but I had no choice.  He was diagnosed at 2 with ADHD, but I didn't believe the psychologists because it's hard to diagnose something like that at age 2.  He is also ODD.  Last summer he was almost kicked out of daycare because of impulsivity, aggression, and inablility to sit still.  The Abilify worked for him then and continues to work.  I would love, however, if he didn't need it but now he's in kindergarten and has to take it to get through the day.  I was also able to get him a 504 plan with the school since I got another diagnosis at age 4 which was ADHD.	M	5	1.5  years	11/2/2009Email
2	add on for depression	none except rapid and major weight gain	I was very hopeful at first. I felt improvement after the 3rd day when this was added to my Wellbutrin. But in 5 months time, I gained 40 lbs on a petite, 100 lb frame!! I'm really struggling to lose it, and am currently discontinuing because of it. People that I bump into at stores and such ask when I'm due!!Really too bad, I had no other side effects. but now I'm left with this big mess with my weight to clean up.	F	34	5  months	10/29/2009
1	GAD/Depression	weight gain, extreme fatigue, depression worse	I was taking 2 mg of Abilify last Spring after Paxil didn't seem to be working as much any more. I felt ok then I felt bad again. Dr put me on 5 mg of Abilify. I feel terrible!  Extremely tired- so much so that I can barely move. I am going to ween my self off immediately.	F	47	6  months	10/28/2009
3	Mood stabilizer along with Zoloft	I took 1 mg daily and it helped but caused too many side effects. I'm very med-sensitive. I've stopped Zoloft at this point.	I was on Zoloft and Abilify but stopped both due to weight gain. After a lot of research I'm adding Abilify back at 1 mg every three days. I'm very med-sensitive and tend to respond at lower doses than other people do. Will be back to post how this goes. Something has to help. I'm a wack-job right now. Can't control my thoughts and I dwell on bad stuff too much. Can't get sad events out of my mind etc. I have to give Abilify another chance at a reduced dose.	F	62	 	10/27/2009
4	Oneiric states	jittery at low doses, sleepy at high	It has helped me stop feeling like I'm in a dream all the time                                   but my mood is only a little better so far	F	59	3  weeks	10/25/2009
2	Depression	Insomnia, chest pain, blurry vision	Only on 0.5 mg. for three days.  Horrible insomnia no matter what time of day I take med.  Makes me drowsy during the day, hard to tell if my mood is improving due to the side effects.	F	35	3  days	10/24/2009
5	major depressive episode	Energy and hope restored.  Insomnia, head ache, speedy, shaky,visual disturbance,constipation.	Hopefully the side effects subside as my body gets used to the med.  I'm not willing to stop taking the med as I feel so much better with just 2mg of Abilify as an adjunct to Lexapro.  I have hope again.  I got my butt out of bed by day 3 (went shopping) then cleaned the house on day 5.  What a change from the depths of deep epression to my old self in less than a week...WOW!	F	46	10  days	10/23/2009
3	bipolar II	agitation, shakiness, acne, loss of libido, weight gain, inability to urinate	This med helped stabilize my mood a bit, but I could not get the full benefit because I could not increase the dose.  Every time I would go up on the dose, I would be hit by an avalanche of side-effects.  Had to get off eventually.	F	26	5  months	10/23/2009
3	To help my mood	Strange itching in my nose. I made myself bleed by trying to scratch it but couldn't help myself. It tasted good so I'm okay with it.	I've had depression of one kind or another most of my life.  I wanted to feel normal.  But, I ran out of samples after a week.  It wasn't long enough to find out if it would help.	M	56	7  days	10/22/2009
3	Mood Disorder	My son is 9 years old. He started in June on a mood stabilizer.  Abilify 5 mg, worked on mood, however he has gained 25 pounds. He can not stop eating.  He even sneaks food!! I don't know what the doctor is thinking.  We are taking him off.		M	9	4  months	10/19/2009
5	Bipolar Disorder	Very hungry, but able to manage it. Some difficulty sleeping, usually for an hour in the middle of the night. Spending money a little more than usual. Initially had a few days of headaches, not major.	This drug immediately snapped me out of low-grade depression that was steadily worsening. I started taking 2 mg of Abilify each morning and all of my depression symptoms lifted. I only realized how bad my concentration had been because it was so improved on this drug. Like others have said, I lost my hyper-sensitivity to people and situations and replaced that with a high tolerance for life's challenges -- big & small. The side-effects are very minimal at this point, but I'll be paying attention to see if this continues. Lastly, the fact that it works so quickly is a powerful asset if it works for you.	F	39	2  weeks	10/17/2009
1	depression/schizoaffective	can't stop pacing, feel like someone is inside me trying to get out of my skin, insomniac, no sex drive, having to put car into park at stoplights to keep from ramming into someone in front of me; insane.	i stopped taking this today and hope to G-d it doesn't last long in my bloodstream.	F	29	2  weeks	10/16/2009
2	possible bipolar	feel like a crack addict, hard to even sit here and type, hitting wrong keys, clenching jaw, restless beyond belief	on 10 mg...gained about 5-7 pounds, doc swears I need it, am bipolar but w out mania, just very low lows.......need to get off this but afraid of geodon...feel like a speed freak.  sleep is my only relief.............	F	38	6  weeks	10/7/2009
1	Mood stabalizer	makes me gain weight, tired, not sure if it is what causes memory loss, fatigue, moodiness, irratability.		F	35	2  years	10/7/2009
5	Anxiety, depression, mild mania.	Jitters, sleepiness, stomach distress.	This drug is very strong and very good.  I am taking 2 mg in conjunction with 7.5 mg of Lexapro.  It has reduced my severe PMS and helped me with my previous need to sleep 11 hours a day.  Note that I am on one tenth of the recomended starting dosage for someone who is bi-polar; I can only imagine the side effects, however for my purpose it has been a god send.	F	29	1  months	10/3/2009
1	Bi-polar	pacing, high blood sugar, foamy urine, severe thirst, fatigue, pancreatitis, kidney damage	Please stop taking the Abilify immediately.  My husband was prescribed Abilify and it almost killed him. He was hospitalized with severe pancreatitis for 10 days and then on home care hooked up to ivs for another 2 weeks. He is now diabetic and needs to take insulin shots 4 times a day. He is on a very strict low-fat no-sugar diet and may never have even a sip of alcohol ever again. His pancreas is permanently damaged. We are very lucky he is alive. Abilify is evil. Please do not take it. It will kill you.	M	30	 	9/30/2009Email
5	depression, OCD	more alert, motivated, racing thoughts greatly diminished, some nausea, no weight gain!	I was leery about taking this, others make it sound like a nightmare drug. I have no doubt that it affects some people badly, but for me, it made a huge difference. I do wonder if this will wear off after a few months, but so far 5 mg have allowed me to think clearly, get off the couch and accomplish things. No weight gain but dr has me on Metformin to regulate blood sugar and cravings, so that might be the trick there. Important for everyone to monitor their own reactions carefully, or ask family members to help, because every drug works differently for every person. YOU know best what helps YOU.	F	45	2  months	9/19/2009
3	depression/ bipolar	flattening/apathy, word-finding problems, short-term memory loss, trouble concentrating, not able to articulate thoughts and feelings, muscle weakness. To be fair, it made me manic for the first month I took it, which was wonderful, and I say I'm not depressed now, but is apathy really that different from depression?	When trying to stop taking 5mg, severe akathasia that literally kept me from sleeping at all. I'm tapering, now on 2.5mg, but still fearful that I will have the same symptoms when I discontinue again. Feeling a little trapped.	M	35	7  months	9/17/2009
3	Childhood Bipolar, ODD	WEIGHT GAIN, MUSCLE PAIN/STIFFNESS	My son has shown improvement in mood, decreased mood swings, more even temperament, however, he constantly complains about pain in his feet and legs. He describes as burning, stinging pain, mostly in his feet. We have observed more nasal stuffiness. He appears short of breath, at times, however, we are linking this to his weight gain (approx 12 lbs) and history of asthma. We are still observing and waiting to gauge any affect in cognitive abilities (school grades). Time will tell if the side effects are actually worth taking the medication.	M	11	3  months	9/16/2009
1	Bipolar 2-PTSD	Eating abnormal amounts - lethargy - no libido - no personality - sweating	This shit, and yes I say this profanely because that's what it is. It made me more depressed than ever. Yes the headaches and voices went away. But it made me socially anxious , paranoid , ripped me of my self esteem and made me gain weight because all I did and wanted to do was eat. I am an athlete, model, and full time mom. I kissed my life goodbye when taking this shit. Desparate, I stopped taking it. Which made life even more worse. I wanted to kill myself so badly because I wanted the pain to go away. It's all in my head. Mind over matter. I'll be the moodswingin crazy gal I am than risk my life. Also causes muscle weakness. Lucky to be able to carry anything up a damn flight of stairs. All in all, just stay away!!! Spent the whole summer in bed sleeeeping getting fat and suicidal. Whack!!!	F	25	2  months	9/14/2009
1	GAD/BPII/PTSD/OCD	Severe depression/out of touch	I was on Abilify for three weeks.  I started with the 10 mg for two weeks and up to 25 the third week.  On the 10 mg I started feeling "funny" and experiencing some side effects.  By the third week I was self mutlilating (something I have not done in 15 yrs.  I was so depressed I could not function at any level, very irritable and people just were too much to deal with.  All I wanted to do was sleep and just disappear.  My Therapist said it was like I did a 180 in two weeks and was so concerned she called my Psych.  After seeing my Psych, she immediately took me off it and put me on Geodon...not sure if that is a possitive change or not.	F	37	3  weeks	9/14/2009
3	Bi Polar 2	Akathesia, insomnia, anxiety, weight gain, head aches	The Akathesia was awful.  I would lie in bed thinking I was weak or flu-ish, but once in bed I could not get comfortable.  My workouts decreased as I felt weak, dizzy, short of breath, lost balance while stretching. My face would sweat way more than normal.  I could tell I was starting to gain weight and would pack on the pounds rapidly if I did not stop taking this. Since exercise is therpeutic for me, the abilify took that away from me.  BUT it did help control my mood swings (by making me feel like an emotionless zombie) and the need to act out my irritability. However, inside I felt increasing anxiety and irritability.  The side effects just aren't worth it.	F	30	2  months	9/8/2009
3	Depression/Anxiety	I have gained 20 pounds and am not eating any more than normal.  The medicine definitely lifted my depression, but the weight gain now has me looking like a pig.  And, it seemed to increase my libido.	Started off with 5 mg; now am down to 2.5... but, because of the weight gain, I am asking to get off of this medication.	F	40	4  months	9/5/2009
1	anxiety	Akithesia	Do not take this med. I had severe akithesia whereby I had a constant feeling of having to 'move' It was exhausting and I thought it would never leave which made me feel even more panicked. It was the most scared I'd ever felt on a medicine. Before this I truly never paid attention to side effects on labels, now I do.	F	38	 	8/29/2009
4	Bi-Polar	Akathisia, increased libido, insomnia	Loved it the first week until the Akathisia kicked in.  Then I wanted to jump out the car while it was moving... Halfed my dosage, no help.  Halfed the dosage again, no help.  Now I am on 1/8 of the pill.  Akathisia is gone, but increased libido went away.  Still have insomnia taken care of by Ambien.	F	46	1  years	8/28/2009Email
5	for incentive, to mk decisions	none except lots of hope, energy, lack of fear,loss of procrastination, able to make decisions, ability to focus just an all around zest for life with unlimited happiness	If your anti depressant or anti anxiety meds work but you still have no energy, ask your Dr to add Abilify. I had never heard of it but now instead of thinking of everything I need and want to do I am optimistic and bubbling with enthusiasm and energy. Now instead of reading all day long I am cleaning and doing hobbies, kyaking, running, dancing and marching with my grandchildren Whats next a sea plane ride and travel. Was just weeks ago I was close to Agoraphobia. If your meds only get you to the bottom of the mountain looking up and wishing you would, try Abilify, you will climb that mountain, maybe even run up it and then dance on the top!!!	F	62	3  weeks	8/23/2009
2	bi polar 2	weight gain, sugar cravings, excessive sleepiness, inability to exercise (no stamina, gasping for breath)	It helped with irritability (because nothing seemed to matter) but left me unable to live normally and my friends all asked if something was wrong because I was so quiet and getting more quiet with each passing day.  Because the side effects were so crippling, I have stopped taking Abilify and switched to Geodon.	F	60	4  months	8/18/2009
1	Bipolar I	Akathisia, loss of interest in life, Always sleepy, high anxiety, catatonia	Got really bad Akathisia after only 3 days on 10mg. Was taken during a bad manic/pschotic state so was forced to stay on it. Initially was bumped to 20mg which made me catatonic. Back to 10mg kept hallucinating. Added Cogentin, made Akathisia go away but severe anxiety came in it's palce along with lack of motivation and no interest in anything. Severe confusion followed. This sucked my will to live. The Akathisia was so severe I was suicidal.	M	32	7  months	8/17/2009
3	depression; withdrawal aid	VERY rapid weight gain (10 lbs in a month!), constipation, swollen legs and feet, back pain	GOOD NEWS: This drug helped me in the horrible phase of discontinuing Cymbalta.  I was no longer moody and nasty-tempered.  BAD NEWS: the fact that my face is so puffy I now look like a fatter, older version of myself and I now have GOBS of fat in places I never gained weight before (back of arms, waist) proves this stuff is POISON.  It may inhibit thyroid function, because I am not eating more than I usually do (in fact my appetite is less than normal--wierd!) yet I am piling on weight. The constipation, nausea and fatigue aren't fun either.  And I look like CRAP: bloated, haggard, pale, and unhealthy. Phasing off this med asap!	F	31	2  months	8/14/2009Email
5	depression	I have experience swelling of the calves. This may not be related to the Abilify, as I have had a kidney transplant.	My family has a history of serious depression to the point of being institutionalize. For many years now my brother and I have tried one drug after another. Nothing helped us 'open the curtains'. Two mg of Abilify each morning, after just a couple of days, has given us our lives back. This is a miracle drug for both my brother and my self. I must include, we have only been on this medicine for two or three weeks.	M	60	18  days	8/8/2009Email
5	wellbutrin	somewhat more tired, some difficulty urinating..	A Great help.. relieved pain in my shoulders and elbows.. and has rid me of most of my suicidal or weird thoughts and voices.	M	57	25  days	8/5/2009
4	bi-polar 1 disorder	nausea, vomiting, insomnia	I am 5mg, for just about a week, first 2 days I was very hostile, last 4 days restless with insomnia and cant eat much.However I have energy, I get things done, I am back to being social which I was not for over a year and half. No fears of public and can focus to read, play games etc.  My patience level is much better.  Just would like to know when the insomnia and nausea will pass.	M	41	1  weeks	8/5/2009Email
2	Possbile Bipolar 2	Extreme sweating, extreme nausea, weird chest movement, insomnia	Been on Celexa for 10 years now, up and down in dose as lifes stresses went up and down... 40mg now for past 2 years. Doctor added abilify for possible Bipolar 2. I took at 7pm and within 2 hours I was sweating profusely and kept doing so for the next 24 hours, then it started to go away. I wasn't hot, I even cranked up the air conditioner, didn't help at all. I soaked my clothes and sheets. This caused some dehydration which didn't help the nausea. That was also extreme. I never actually vomited but still laid on the bathroom floor just in case. The first few bouts of it I could barely move. I was flushed and weak and trembling it was so bad.I also couldn't sleep, which I'd already been fighting insomnia the past few months. But this made it worse as I couldn't sleep more then 10-30 mins at a time. The constant sweating didn't help when trying to sleep.I'm not saying don't take this med. I dealt with bad nausea for weeks when I first started it, and also when I went without for over a week. Just wanted to share what happened to me	F	32	1  days	8/2/2009
5	major depression/Bipolar	None really..Some initial insomnia but got better with time. Sexual sides are minimal and never a problem	A great medicine.It worked the 1st day I took it (5 mg)..I felt so much better..NOTHING has worked for me except Abilify and Parnate. People love to rant and rave when something is not working for them. Fine. But please don't tell other people to stay away from the drug because it doesn't work for you. If your having a hard time finding something that works, try this med. It works quickly so you'll know if it's for you without having to wait 2-4 weeks.	M	49	60  days	7/31/2009
1	Bipolar Disorder	Weight Gain	I was taking this medicine for about half a year and was recommended to not go off of it. In this six month period I gained 67 pounds. It also made it very hard to lose the weight afterward. Here I am almost two years later, and I am five pounds away from getting rid of the 67 I initially gained. Although the weight is gone, the stretch marks remain and still will. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE.	F	22	6  months	7/27/2009
5	schizo personality disorder	I LOVE ABILIFY!!  It is my favorite antipsychotic.  Side effects range from mild tiredness and hunger spells to insomnia at bed time.  But that helps with Ambien CR which my doc loves to prescribe like candy to me!  Abilify helps tremendously with voices and does not give me the akathisia movement disorder like the "dones" risperidone and ziprasidone antipsychotic do 100% of the time.	This medicine is a mild antipsychotic when it comes to side effects when compared to other antipsychotics.  I would recommend ABILIFY (aripiprazole) over the other atypical antipsychotics any day.	M	29	6  years	7/23/2009
1	Schizophrenia	Couldn't stop moving, couldn't sleep.  Paranoid, anxious.	This is hell.	M	18	4  weeks	7/22/2009
1	major life long depression	I had a STROKE after 9 days on this awful medicine. I've been on wellbutrin for years and started to feel a deeper depression than normal. My psychiatrist put me on Abilify as a boost. Within 3 days I became very confused and very tired. It was the weekend, on Monday I called the doctor. He said it was the side effects and would clear up, that I had only been on it 6 days. On Thursday, I called and told him that I was stopping it. In addition to the confusion, I was having a hard time talking. He said the side effects would probably be gone by my appointment. They got worse! I couldn't remember how to use my utensils, my toothbrush etc. I couldn't spell or write, was mixing up the phone number even if I was looking at it. Monday, he still felt that it was side effects but at my insistence he sent me right to a neurologist, who ran me through a number of tests. He agreed that it was side effects. If I wasn't better in 3 weeks, he'd do a CAT scan. After 1 week insisted on the scan and lo	I was 62 years old and do not have dementia. My doctor did not consider me elderly. At what age does the drug company consider elderly? My doctor said that this shouldn't have happened. I am better but not back to the way I was before Abilify and the stroke. After 13 months I don't feel that I am getting any better and I honestly feel the problems I am still having are permanent. But it could have been worse, I wasn't paralyzed! Even with the computer, this write up has taken me 2 1/2 hours to compose.	F	63	9  days	7/15/2009Email

1	depression	I had bad nausea and vomiting. Very bad acne. Super drowsy.	It didn't even help with my condition. I have been trying it out for about 4-5 weeks and the side effects are horrible. I was still the same person I was before takin Abilify if not worse.	F	21	5  weeks	7/10/2009

1	Bipolar	Explosive headaches, sexual dysfunction, blurry vision, muscle stiffness, indigestion, nausea, loss of concentration and memory impairment	I am a heart patient and have also experienced sky high BP. I have no idea why this drug would even have been prescribed to me. I agree it is a poison.	M	51	1  months	7/5/2009
4	Pediatric BP rapid cycling	tired, sleepy,	9 yr old boy, started on 10 mg then increased to 15 mg. Takes 900mg lithium and 15 mg Abilify. Takes all at night due to sleepiness. Is a bit far away during the day on the 15 mg. Hardly any mania or outbursts. No complaints of inner restlessness. No weight gain. Appetite is normal.	M	9	1  months	7/3/2009Email
1	Bipolar	Miserable, horrible drug: extreme fatigue, bloated face, mental sluggishness and confusion.	NO theraputic effects whatsoever for me. Useless. I took it for about 6 months in 2003 and was taken off it by my psych. at my sister's urging. She came to see me at Christmas and was shocked at what she found. I was not even aware of how bad it was until I was taken off it.	F	41	6  months	7/3/2009
1	BiPolar II	Severe headache, tooth pain, muscle aches, depression, lethargy, trouble sleeping, jaw pain.	Called doctor and she said I had an allergic reaction to Abilify and to discontinue use immediately.  If you have any of the symptoms listed above, contact your doctor ASAP.	F	35	1  days	7/1/2009
5	Schizoaffective Disorder	I initially experienced Akathesia, Nystagmus and sleepiness. Then my dosage was recently upped from 20 mgs to 25 mgs due to break through depression, after that I did feel some nausea. Other than those few side effects I've felt fine on Abilify. I would recommend Abilify to others who are being carefully monitored by their Psychiatrist. I just happen to have an excellent Dr., which does make a difference.	I take Abilify along with Divalproex Sodium ER 1250 mgs for migraines, Clonazepam, Cogentin 1 mg for Akathesia, 2 grs of Armour Thyroid for Hypothyroidism.	F	47	5  years	6/28/2009
1	deppresion and anxiaty	facial tics, my daughter eyes are moving without control. Her tongue is heavy like if she is drunk, she gained 30 pounds. This medication is a poison I will not give it to my daughter anymore.		F	16	2  years	6/23/2009Email
3	anxiety/pmdd/depression	I have tried all the SSRI's and am currently taking Cymbalta 60 mg daily.  I was told that abilify helps so many people in my situation but so far the side effects have been miserable.  Yes, I am more mellow and not as irritable, but I have a constant headache/eye pain (like a migraine), I cannot sleep and I'm nauseous.  I'm reading all these other comments and I'm terrified of gaining weight, so I think I'm going to stop.		F	39	3  days	6/21/2009
1	misdiagnosed	SEVERE AKETHISIA- I had to walk out of the class room daily and skip class because I COULD NOT SIT STILL TO SAVE MY LIFE i felt like something was inside me trying to come out...my mind could NOT control my body, SEVERE WEIGHT GAIN ..and I used to always be thin) made me OBSESSED with food...I would do anything to get to food and i would eat and eat and eat uncontrolably. Never have I been suicidal, but I wanted to die just to get rid of the akethisia it was LIVING HELL. I have permanent side effects... i'm way slower in the head...memory loss...stuttering... I would lie down and not be able to get out of bed I was SO tired at times.	POISON! google AKETHISIA and read the hell it could bring you and your loved ones.DO NOT TAKE ANTI-PSYCHOTICS ... they WILL make you CRAZY so they can keep giving you more pills when you complain about the side effects they will more than likely tell you it's symptoms of something else and just put you on more medication that will permanently damage your brain and life. I can't believe they give this to people knowing what harm it can do.	F	19	6  weeks	6/18/2009
2	Major Depression	weight gain, fatigue/tiredness/drowsiness, loss of concentation	I have ADD and even though I am on Adderall the abilify counteracted it and I had a lot of trouble focusing in school. I am tired all the time getting 12 hours of sleep a night and still taking a 3-4 hour nap in the afternoon. It did help with my depression but recently I have been having suicidal thoughts. I also gained 15 pounds in just a few weeks.	F	20	2  months	6/15/2009
4	Schizophrenia	Problems with my legs. Sometimes they are restless, other times I can't feel them. I go to the gym a lot and have found I cannot perform as well with my legs. There are no problems with my other body parts.Blurry visionRandom changes to my tone of voiceFeeling sick (this went after a couple of days)	Works well so far. My symptoms are not as bad, I just hope the side effects stop	M	26	2  weeks	6/8/2009

2	Anxiety	Hallucinations, seeing spots (colored), toothaches (the whole right side of my mouth) I know this because when I stopped taking, it was way improved. Headaches, angry outbursts, very very tired 24/7.	Did help the anxiety. However, I couldn't tolerate the side effects I listed. It seemed each day was worse than the day before.	F	35	1  months	6/7/2009
1	Depression	Insanity. I know that sounds wierd, crazy or whatever, but that is the closest word I know to describe it. For three days I went into a world where I couldn't understand what was going on aroung me. I would start to speak, the words were clear in my head, but gibberish would come out. I was terrified for much of the time, curled in a ball, feeling I was about to die at any second.	This drug is now advertised as an add on supplement to anti-depressants. This is crazy! It's an anti-psychotic! It has a side affect profile that if fully revealed to patients would sent them running for the nearest exit.	M	28	4  days	6/7/2009
1	wrongly diagnosed	So, I am posting this message mainly to help others with their emotional/psychological struggles.  I would like to give people who have been put on anti-psychotics some pointers and guidance that might help.  I was on abilify for six years and regret it completely.	Honestly, Abilify works wonders for some people and for many others I can make matters worse.  I have a strong desire to help others so they hopefully don't have to go through what I went through to get to a state of well being.  Everything is anonymous!!

4	Bipolar II	Love this medication.  I finally feel like me again and can handle things.  However, I am EXTREMELY hungry.  Does this go away?  Also experiencing severe muscle aching.  I don't want to go off the Abilify, but can't take the hunger pain.		F	43	4  days	5/30/2009Email
4	Major depression w/ psychosis	Something similar to restless leg syndrome, fidgeting	I've now been diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features along with some other things.  Abilify was prescribed to me because my initial diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder. The two disorders are somewhat similar.  Abilify has more or less completely eliminated my psychotic symptoms and I do well on this medication.  I have not experienced any negative side effects in the past 2 years.  For the first 6 months I had restless legs and some fidgeting problems where it was hard to sit still.  Those symptoms passed and I feel pretty much fine at this point.  I also take Effexor XR, Lamictal and Librium.	F	31	2.5  years	5/29/2009
4	Depression & Paranoia	I've been taking 2 mg Abilify for 2 weeks now, along with my usual 40 mg Prozac and 900 mg Lithium. I feel like I'm on speed or something with abilify! I have no appetite (a good thing-could lose a few lbs), I feel restless, but I feel like I see things differently now. I also have a "full" sensation in my head and a little shakiness. I'm scared, because I keep reading all these bad things about Abilify, but I feel soooo much more alert & interactive now. If only the restlessness would go away, this is a miracle med for me. How long until these side effects taper off?		F	28	14  days	5/28/2009
3	Bipolar Disorder (rapid cycling)	Weight gain (about 20-30 pounds in a six months...without changing eating habits), extreme tiredness, lethargy, shaking/tremors, increased levels of insulin (blood sugar).	It helped my manic episodes and leveled out my mood. However, I don't feel it was worth the weight gain and increased blood sugar levels, which contributed to reoccurring, prolonged (and quite painful) yeast infections.	F	20	6  months	5/23/2009
1	bi polar	This was the worst medicine ever. I tried it for 6 weeks, starting at 2mg, and by the end of the time taking 15mg. My body would not stop moving. I couldnt read a book or watch TV. I found myself taking too many sleeping pills (and i never take sleeping pills) to counteract the movement so that i could fall asleep. This medicine should be used as a torture technique!!. The the doctor gave me sleep meds, and blood pressure medication to help with the Abilify side effects.(the blood pressure meds were supposed to make me stop moving...) So she had me on three medications! (NOt to mention this medicine is extremely overpriced!) You couldn'tpay me to take this medicine again. I am on Lamictal 25mg (a very low dose) and its a miracle. I bet this medicine will be pulled soon. It was just like a poison! Be very careful trying this medication.		M	39	6  weeks	5/19/2009
2	depression and ptsd	inner restlessness and desire to drink or eat	i took this for about two monts along with wellbutrin and at first had a hard time staying awake during the day.  after that passed i began wanting to drink so badly it was driving me nuts.  i began to drink to control the restlessness i felt because i was climbing the walls in my house just trying to get away from myself.  i quit taking it a week again and with just the wellbutrin i feel much better.	F	29	7  weeks	5/18/2009
5	Depression	Feeling a little "speedy" mentally, waking up early (4am), weight gain (about 10-15lbs) in 2mos.  Sometimes I feel overtired and not able to sleep enough to catch up.	I was depressed and Cymbalta was not helping---I could not motivate myself to do anything, even just taking a shower was hard.  Went back to Effexor XR (150mg) which had helped before with 5mg of Abilify and I could almost immediately feel the difference.  Wish I felt a little more energy physically, but I do feel a lot better.	F	48	2  months	5/16/2009
3	psychosis/spirit possession	weight gain, perhaps constipation, perhaps insomnia	I've been taking Abilify for 3 years and liked it the most of all the anti-psychotics I tried. Resperidol made me gain a lot of weight quickly. And Haldol was abominabal - I ate constanly and got ridid muscles, but that was also from all the anti-psychotics I tried. The key for me was finding the right DOSAGE, which was much lower than my doctor put me on originally. 5mg Abilify was just right, but I've been gaining more and more weight over the years and want to go off it due to this serious problem. It did however, protect me from the spirit invasion or what others call "voices" or "hallucinations". The risk of psychosis is one problem by going off of it, but so is diabetes and obesity, as well as other side effects from staying on it. I have weighed the consequences and made my choice. I will add that I'm perturbed with my doctor for not monitoring my weight while I've been on this drug. I think he doesn't want to see that it causes obesity.	F	46	3  years	5/13/2009Email
5	Bipolar Disorder	None that I know of	It has saved my life.	F	42	2  years	5/12/2009
4	Schizofrenia/Severe Anxiety Mix	Extreme dizziness & Muscle Tremors.	It works well, don't get me wrong. I switched from Invega. I'm on only 10mg and will probably switch to 25mg by next fill up. Totally helps with the anxiety and works well as an antidepressant. I've been able to focus more, but i'm also on Vyvanse for ADHD. I've had no suicidal thoughts what-so-ever. 10mg is a bit low, in my opinion anyway. Also, if you take any anti-psychotics, through my experience, for a month straight, the side effects generally seem to wear a bit off.	M	15	1  weeks	5/8/2009
1	Depresstion	Facial tics - blinking, tongue thrusts to the point where I had sores in my mouth, muscle stiffness, joint pain.  Uncontrollable muscle movements, twitching, jerking. Fatigue.	This medication was the worst thing that I ever took.  I had "parkinson syndrome" from it.  The facial tics & tongue thrusts lasted over a year.  I had to take Vitamin E for the past 18 months to get rid of them.  I still have blinking tics.  My daughter's doctor wanted her to try it(in small doses) but I refused. This was a horrible experience for me.	F	44	6  months	5/8/2009Email
4	bi-polar depression	Week 1: very slight weight gain -- about 2 lbs. that seems to have leveled off; a few days of extreme fatigue. Overall: slightly irritated stomach (I believe this makes me eat more, and is responsible for the weight gain), lighter sleeping, more sleep disturbances. I used to sleep like a log. Now I sleep like a cat. I miss my old sleep.	I was on abilify once before. The doc took me off due to my "speedy" response. But I have ADD, and I really liked the abilify. New doc is a-ok with my response, so long as it works for me. I'm also on Adderall and Welbutrin. Since starting this drug, I actually feel like doing things rather than just thinking about doing them and then thinking that I'll never finish and then getting depressed and hating myself. I'm more social. Self esteem is better too. Disruptive and ruminative thoughts are way down. Overall, I like.	F	33	16  days	5/7/2009
5	Bipolar 2	Initially stiffness and emotionless face, subsided within weeks.	This drug is a God-send to my 9 year old without it he would likely be in the hospital.  Almost totally normal with it.	M		15  months	5/6/2009
1	depression	facial tics where my left side of my face moved with my inability to stop it, my legs felt like they were filled with lead and I didnt want to work out anymore, my feet tingled and my toes hurt this was the creepiest drug I have ever taken	I felt happy but the side effects were so horrible it wasnt worth being happy (and that says a lot) I'm on wellbutrin and pristiq and this medication was a nightmare. My psych really pushed for me to take it and I had to really stand up for myself to say no. Dont let the commercial fool you and keep trying other drugs cuz abilify is poison	F		2  months	5/6/2009
3	anxiety, bi polar, chest pain	i can barely do anything...i just want to sleep until it hurts.  while sleeping i feel as if i am on a trampoline, i just toss and turn and bounce.  today(day 4) i feel jittery.	i was put on abilify because i was having panic attacks and feeling as if i was having heart attacks.  tight chest and trouble breathing, er visits.  doc thinks its in my mind and that im bipolar.  i cant believe that chest pain so severs is mental.  i havent had a bad attack yet but i feel as if i will collapse, i hope this tired dead-battery feeling goes away or i cant take it, i have a 2 month old.

4	Bipolar Disorder	weight gain, inner restlessness.	I've been on lamictal, seroquel, and geodon since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder two months ago.  Each of those medicines gave me horrible side effects.  Abilify is the only medicine that has helped.  I am calmer, do not have my angry and irritable outbursts.  I'm also a self-injurer and haven't done anything since a couple days being on this medicine.  The downfall, I've been on this medicine for 2 weeks and I've gained 12lbs.	F	23	2  weeks	5/3/2009
2	Bipolar 2	Insomnia, wide awake every hour or two; impulsivity, shopping, eating, speaking; 15lb weight gain in 1 month; became nearly inarticulate, could not convey my thoughts or feelings very well at all; hypomania	I took Ability for a month as an adjunct Zoloft 100mg, which has stopped working.  In term of relief from the depression, the Ability worked wonderfully.  Because of the side effects, I dropped from my initial dose of 5mg to 2mg, and the depressive symptoms/suicidality returned nearly immediately.  After bumping back up to 4-4.5mg, the side effects returned.  This med may be tolerable for others but the side effects were intolerable for me.	F	36	1  months	5/2/2009
5	Bi Polar Disorder, Psychosis	Weight Gain (15 lbs in 6 months)	My daughter is doing EXTREMELY well on Abilify. Her rapid cycling is nearly zero. Her psychosis is also tremendously better. The change is almost as if she is a different kid. She went from extreme  mania episodes that cycled at times within minutes. To near stable in her moods in just days after beginning this medication. Her doctor wants to change her to Geodon due to the weight gain. Weight was never an issue for her until she started taking Abilify. But I think with the improvement in her mental stability a little weight gain is not that significant. I love this medication. She was on 5mg per day up to 7.5 per day after 2 months. It's effectiveness wore off at about 2 months in. No problems since upped to 7.5mg a day. She has no trouble sleeping. I didnt realize how her mania was affecting her sleep until starting this medicine and she is actually tired when it's time for bed. No complaints from me.	F	7	6  months	4/26/2009Email
2	Bipolar	Severe akathesia!  The restlessness drove me up a wall.  I also experienced word loss, short-term memory loss, stiff muscles and joints, tremors in my left hand (I'm left-handed), raised body temperature, weight gain (15 pounds in 4 months), no sex drive, increased breast size with milk coming out of them, fatigue during the day and sleeplessness at night. I took Abilify before I want to bed.  I have tried almost every dose: 30mg, 20mg, 10mg, 5mg and 2mg.  At 5mg and above I experienced euphoria that made me feel like I could probably jump off of a building for fun and be o.k.  At doses below 5mg I still experienced all of the side effects (except for the euphoria)and became extremely irritable and hostile, but otherwise I had no emotions.	To be fair, my paranoia went away. This was the only medication I was taking.	F	45	4  years	4/23/2009
2	Bipolar Disorder	Brain fog, Stiff muscles, inability to ever sit still or relax,	Abilify caused me to not be able to relax my muscles and I was always uncomfortable.  I had a hard time sleeping at night.  Wasn't what I expected. I had to go off of it becuase my grades in school started to drop.	F	23	2  weeks	4/17/2009
5	Mixed bipolar		I have been on Abilify for 2 years with no side effects. It has stabalized my mood along with Tegretal and Pristiq. While my antidepressant often stops working or has to be adjusted in the dose, the Abilify 10 mg has worked for me. I take all my meds at bedtime and sleep well, have no appetite increase or weight gain(terrible wt. gain on Depakote that I have since  lost), no nausea, dizziness, or vivid dreams. For me it's a life saver and I'm able to continue to work at a high functioning capacity.	F	60	2  years	4/16/2009
4	Suicidal thoughts	My mouth is dry and i've noticed i'm not hungry but my muscles ached terribly for the first two weeks.	I'm glad I didn't listen to the scary potential side effects. On abilify I feel even but I still feel emotions only I dont think about how much I hate myself anymore. I'm surprised at how this has worked so far.	F	35	2  months	4/16/2009
3	depression, over fatigue & stress	at first my husband take zyprexa but his doctor changed it to abilify due to gaining his weight. after a week i notice that my husband became restless and move or walk like a robot, though he can sleep he always tell me that he tired very easy as well his muscles. his craving more than before so his cholesterol became higher. so i decided to stop taking abilify and i noticed that my husband movement became normal.

3	aggression & phycotic eppisodes	Tiredness, sleeplessness, extreme fluid retention. pain in the left side of neck	My son has DownSyndrome and a level of Autism, he has also been diagonised as having Psyschotic eppisodes, He gets very aggressive He has been on Risperdal(disasterous). Zyprexa(worked on the outbursts, but huge weight gain,and the threat of him developing Diabetes) He's been on Abilify now fo thirteen days but I'm getting very concerned about side effects, So I'm now considering stopping the drug, It has helped keep him calm, but at what risk to his health,We are running out of options for him	M	18	13  days	4/15/2009Email
3	bi polar /anxiety	jittery restlesness cant sleep	i am also taking lamectal and added abilify to help with continued depression the depression has subsided but the jitteryness and lack of sleep are annoying and i am not sure i can deal with it makes working hard when i keep feeling these "twitches" inside my body  am going to speak to my DR about changing to another med  i am not impressed with abilify	F	29	7  days	4/14/2009

3	Resistant Depression/Anxiety	15 lbs weight gain.  Restlessness.  Chronic insomnia.  Night binging (and subsequent purging to curb weight gain).	Ironically, this drug (5 mg to 2 mg with 150 mg of Wellbutrin XR and 20 mg of Adderral XR) helped my self-confidence in social situations by minimizing my anxiety and shutting off my self-critic -- despite shattering my self-image (as a result of relentless weight gain).  At my best, I didn't care.  I shopped nonstop -- because I was constantly gaining weight (in reality) and my clothes no longer fit me.  In my case, my doctor did not listen to my threshold for weight gain.  In two years, I gained 20 lbs with various antidepressants.  Desperate to gain some resemblance of myself back, I began purging.  In the eight months that I have been (on/off) the Abilify, I have vacillated from hypomanic (on) to hopelessly depressed (off).  In fact, the spiraling phase upon quitting the drug (without compliance) has translated to increased anxiety (and dependence on Xanax) and debilitating depression. I do not recommend this drug to young women whose self-image is inextricably related to their appearance in anyway.	F	33	8  months	4/1/2009
3	Depression	Speedy manic feeling, shakiness, feeling like I couldn't sit still, a little nausea in the beginning, craving for sweets at night, WEIGHT GAIN.	I was already taking Prozac for depression but still having depression symptoms, so the Dr. prescribed Abilify to supplement the Prozac. In the beginning, this medicine really helped to pull me out of the funk that I was in.  I felt energized, productive, and like my overall attitude was very much improved.  After a couple or 3 weeks, however, I noticed that I was gaining weight at an alarming rate.  In the 2 months that I took this drug, (at a low dose of 1mg/day) I gained over 15 lbs!  I also felt strangely like shopping and spending money all of the time, almost like I was having a manic episode. All in all, I felt much less depressed, but stopped taking for fear of becoming REALLY overweight. Note: after I stopped this drug, I felt more depressed than ever and almost suicidal.  If you stop, you should probably taper off gradually!	F	45	2  months	3/29/2009Email
5	pediatric anxiety/possible bipolar	nausea & headache for the first few days. Also, tired during the day for 1st week. otherwise, none.	This medication has worked wonderfully for my daughter. She has been on it 3 weeks and for the first time in her life I heard she had a "wonderful" week at school. The side effects are most definately tolerable and my daughter says this medication changed her life. Parents-don't be afraid to try it. I know everything on this site sounds bad, but it has been a Godsend to my family.	F	8	3  weeks	3/20/2009
3	Post Tramatic Syndrome & OCD	I wake up several times in the night and am not able to go back to sleep usually for an hour or so.  I have never had this problem in the past.  I have also been very restless and am not able to stay focused on one task for two long.  I have to be doing something that is keeping me very busy.  I have also noticed increased anxiety with this medication.		M	36	1  months	3/15/2009
2	adjunct to depression therapy	I am incredibly sleepy. I can not function in this state.		F	23	2  days	3/12/2009
4	psychotic episode	filling a little dizzy the first day	after 2 years from  my first episode I had to change from solian to abilify due to sides effects(waight gain ).So far it helps me	F	40	6  days	3/5/2009
5	manic/psychotic episode	restlessness at first, waking up several times in night	Switched to it from risperidone, 4 months after a manic/psychotic episode. I was depressed on the risperidone but depression lifted on aripiprazole (an antidepressant was also added). Didn't have the demotivation and lethargy I experienced on risperidone.	M	24	9  months	2/24/2009
3	autism  bipolar	painful erection of penis	My 6 year old son never had a problem with erections until taking Abilify.  Then it happened all the time and was very painful.  The doctors would not believe me that this was happening - even though it is rare side effect.  His behaviour settled down on the abilify; but we have not seen an increase in bad behaviour since taking him off the med.	M	6	3  months	2/21/2009
1	Bi-Polar	Could not sit still.  Felt confused.  When I say I couldn't sit still I mean it.  This drug had me jittery, and it was the worst feeling I have ever had in my life.  Sit down to watch TV, standing up thirty seconds later.  To come off the drug was worse then the side effects of the drug while taking it.	Be very careful of this drug, it is very powerful, and it takes a good month to get it out of your system.	M	38	4  months	2/21/2009
1	Depression	I went from being moderately depressed, to feeling suicidalwithin 2 weeks. Acute anxiety and paranoia followed.	This is a very dangerous drug.	F	41	16  days	2/20/2009
4	Depression	Insomnia	I started taking this b/c my regular depression just wasn't doing the job. Now I take 2mg of abilify and 150mg of Effexor XR and I haven't felt this good in months. Absolutely no side effects from the abilify except difficulty staying asleep during the night. That's why I gave it a 4. It did exactly what it was supposed to do! Thank goodness!!!!	F	31	20  days	2/13/2009
4	Bipolar and Schizophrenia	None that I can directly attribute to Abilify	I have been taking Abilify for over 2 years now. As a result, I can no longer remember what it felt like to not be on it or what it actually does for me when I take it. It is just another drug that I pop twice a day. 15mg twice a day for a total of 30mg. I do know that my hallucinations are very minimal from what they used to be. But I still hear voices and see things on occasion that are very disturbing.	M	36	2  years	2/5/2009
1	depression	weight gain	I gained 35lbs in 6 months... it helped with my mood swings but when my psych told me it was why I was gaining weight, I went off it.... i hate it =( Now I'm left almost 40lbs overweight	F	22	6  months	2/5/2009
3	depression	weight gain = 60 lbs in 1 yr, craving sweets, developed pre-diabetic condition, BANKRUPTED ME AS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE	I've suffered with intractable depression for decades and have been on just about every medication ever made.  After years of working with an extremely competent, caring psychiatrist, he placed me on a 2 drug combination of 60mg/daily of Cymbalta and 15 mg/every other day of Abilify and, for the first time in a very long time, I do not experience the terrible lows which with I previously struggled.  Now, if I could just lose the weight I gained.....I'd feel much, much better.  Please do not construe this medication combination as a CURE.  I AM better; BUT, I still struggle with depression...just not as often.

1	Aspergers, depression, anxiety	My 10-year old son was put on abilify to quell his anxiety and depression.  He has gained over 40# in 3-months, he beats his head, calls himself stupid and begs to go to God where the pain will be gone.  We are in the process of weening him off this drug for good.	Scary...We were told it did not promote weight gain in children..yet our son gained 40#.  Did nothing about his depression and anxiety and actually made him more manic and out of sorts...Did not work for our child.	M	10	4  months	1/30/2009Email

1	Bipolar	After two days on this stuff, I've got a terrible headache that won't quit and I feel like I need to vomit.	I'll give it a few more days until I see my doctor next week, but I'm not sure if this is worth it.  Hopefully the side effects wear off.	F	39	2  days	1/26/2009
1	Bipolar II, insomnia	This is one of the worst medications I have ever taken.  I took 1 2.5 mg tab and started experiencing extreme anxiety and insomnia.  This developed into a hypomanic state and I have been lucky to get 3 hours of sleep a day.  I had to start taking Seroquel (which I also hate because it leaves me hung over) and I was able to sleep 6 hours.  Now, I have to take Seroquel to get any sort of sleep.  Also, benzos did not counteract any of my anxiety.		F	34	2  days	1/21/2009
4	head banging	slight weight gain (now taking 1 mg per day with 25 mg Zoloft)When on 10 mg (in error)had severe muscle stiffness and zombie effect.	This has helped enormously-feel less anxiety, more cheerful and outgoing, can speak more slowly and clearly-and head banging only once mildly in 9 months (full moon). I have developmental disabilities and, probably, autism.	F	63	9  months	1/18/2009
3	Severe Depression	Last year, I was started on 2mg and was very irritable...my doctor increased me to 4mg a day and the irritable feelings went away.  However I have gained 50 lbs in one year.	Abilify in conjunction with fluexotine has helped my depression.  However the weight gain is very discouraging...I am trying to lose the weight but it is very hard to on this medicine.	F	23	1  years	1/18/2009
1	halucinations, anxiety	My 10 year old daughter has been on abillify for a year and she had gained weight.  Also, her inner cheeks were sore as if she had began to bite them (unknowingly).  She complains of stomach aches sometimes.  Lately her cheeks, chin, and lips have swollen as a result, I am weening her off.  I am looking for a natural alternative with minimum side effects because my daughter asked me why must she keep suffering.		F	10	370  days	1/16/2009Email
4	Depression	Restlessness, can't sleep very well	I'm taking Cymbalta and Wellbutrin and still was in a fog or in low gear all the time.  My psy thought Abilify would be a good catalyst for the two and it has worked great.  No more fog, I want to do more and wake up getting going.  The only issue is waking up too early; sometimes 3 and 4 am.	M	50	30  days	1/15/2009
1	bipolar 2 -- hypomania	For the first 5 days I was incredibly organized and productive but this soon flipped (like taking amphetamines, really) into panic and confusion. By three days into the second week (with dosage doubled) I felt like I was crawling out of my own skin, could no longer think clearly, and was very confused and full of anger and frustration towards others, even though rationally I was aware that it was me, and not them, with the problem. I believe one has to take medication for a month or so for one's body to adjust and for side effects to fade, but after ten days I had to stop because I was so agitated and confused. I soon returned to my old self. A horrible experience, really.	Like taking amphetamines, with quick flip from productivity to confusion and anxiety.	F	54	10  days	1/14/2009
4	Bipolar	First two days I was very irritated and quite edgy.  However, I am starting to get used to it and it seems to be working great.  Tried lithiam, depakote which worked great except for the terrible hair loss, so hoping this will stop the loss		F	44	7  days	1/11/2009
1		this is for those who have experienced the horrifying effects of abilify. abilify ruined my life for quite sometime. the worst of my symptoms came on after a month of taking it (extreme anxiety, racing thoughts, nervousness, obsessing)  and then when i came off of it the withdrawals were horrifying (suicidal and homicidal ideations, profound thoughts of suicide, pacing, nervousness, almost psychosis). drug management has never had any negative side effects for me. infact medications had been quite a sense of relief for my diagnosis.  abilify worked oppositely as it is supposed to for me.  i warn all of you to always be of understanding about the side effects medications you are taking. if i would have educated my self on the side effects i might not have been in the horrifying mess that i was in.....and i am still dealing with the grief of the aftermath.	read,read, read and understand the side effects of being on and coming off this medicine.	F	35	31  days	1/8/2009
4	Minor depression, anxiety, and ADHD	Minor akathisia the first day. This subsided with clonazepam. Main side-effects are drowsiness, nausea, mild muscle weakness. Basically flu-like symptoms. For nausea, TRY GINGER PILLS!! Works perfect!	Feel less of a mental fog. Less depressed. A tiny bit more anxious, but wasn't expecting it to do much for anxiety. I have clonazepam for that. ADHD improved in only 3 days for sure. I realize 4 days is not enough time to gauge effects. I'll try to update later when I've been on it for longer.	M	34	4  days	1/5/2009Email
1	Bipolar	Nervousness, legs have to move all the time like RLS, glasses feel weird on my face take on and off and bother my nose never did before, agiatated, sleeplessness and tired and sleepy all day.	I stopped taking Abilify after a month as I would rather be sane and feel normal than live like this.  Wife noticed anger and agitation were heightened and sleep interupted every hour to hour and a half. Woke up at 3-4 AM every day and could not fall back asleep. Need to try something different as can't take these side affects as worse than the symptoms for me.	M	47	1  days	1/4/2009

1	Bi-Polar I w/psychosis	Feeling of unease, legs had to move constantly,could not sleep. sick to my stomach. Just felt horrible, drained all day. Also woke up in unusual places.	I tried this "NEW" medicine for my Bi-Polar w/psychosis. Just horrible.	F	41	3  weeks	12/30/2008Email
4	bipolar	35 pounds of wieght gain, some sleepiness	I like being on abilify.  It helps me a lot with my rapid mood swings.  THey are almost non existent now with the exception of slight depression from time to time.  WHen I try to go off it, I either swing high or really really low.  With out abilify, my depressions are debilitating and i cry at the drop of a hat. It really helps me maintain a normal functional life.  Its when I don't take my meds that I have a problem.

4	Schizoaffective, BPD	Tardive Dyskinesia - severe twitching of both eyes, weight gain	It has really helped me function, giving me the ability to hold a job.  Unfortunately, I've only had a job 7 months at longest, but at least I can work.  Bad part is, the severe eye twitching.  I stopped taking it for 2 months and I relapsed.  I did accupuncture to treat the twitching and it went away, but I had to go back on Abilify to treat my mental illness.  I'll just have to live with the twitching.  God help me.	F	34	1.5  years	12/27/2008
1	depression	Stomach ache, extreme nausea, exhaustion, dizzy, irritable	I don't like this drug. Added it to limictal. Limictal gave me stomach ache this drug added the nausea etc... Taking 10mg. Been on it 3 days.  I'm too sick to care about being depressed.  Getting off it now!	F	44	3  days	12/25/2008
2	depression	There was exteme restlessness for a while.  The drug did nothing to decrease my depression.  Then, I kept getting super stiff, very uncomfortable muscles.  I kept telling my doctor, but he kept telling me that stiff or rigid muscles were not a possible side effect of the drug.  I quit taking it and have sinse read that stiff muscles may be a side effect and may be part of a potentially life threatening condition.  I stopped taking it two years ago and it may be that the medical community was not aware of the stiff muscle side effect then.	If you have any bad side effects from this drug and your doctor tells you the side effect is not on the list of side effects associated with this drug, it may be that the medical community is not yet aware of the side effect.  Find a doctor who will listen to you.  It seems that drugs like Abilify get prescribed before anyone really knows how well or poorly they will affect humans.  I am worried about the long term problems I may be vulnerable to after having taken this drug.	F	36	180  days	12/22/2008

5	bipolar management/anxiety	slight weight gain, active dream cycle	This is a great pill. I am calm, think more clearly, and any "hot temper" I had is gone. I gained a few pounds, but will adjust my diet, no biggie.	F	33	3  months	12/8/2008
4	PTSD (complex)	Exercise regularly? Be careful. I thought I was just tired but muscle weakness was the issue and I hurt myself trying to do my usual routine. Also, extreme drowsiness at first but it went away (reduced bendaryl as well). First few days were difficult but to my suprise it got a lot better. First few days: no "zest for life", drowsy, salivation (lots).	Really helped me function. My concentration at work was poor, and I was constantly being triggered. Also, many compulsions toward self-harm. All these disappeared or became manageable. I hope this will be short term but it's good to know I can use this med if necessary.	F	47	7  days	12/8/2008

2	GAD	extreme tiredness during the day, sleeplessness at night  5 mg at night.	I think it helped with anxiety, however, it made me so tired.  I didn't want to go to work each day because I was so tired.  The day dragged by and would wake up each day at 5 am.  Seemed like the tiredness took away the anxiety	M	31	2  weeks	12/5/2008
1	Anxiety	Extreme akathisia, severe restlessness. I became extremely restless and couldn't sit still, sleep, lay done or stop moving. It was scary. I kept moving and couldn't sit still and I felt all jittery. The akathisia was scary and it lasted the entire time. I got off this drug after a couple days of akathisia and even when I went off it, the akathisia stayed for weeks and it eventually died down. I was only in high school when I experienced the akathisia and had to miss a lot of school.	Akathisia, severe itnernal restlessness on this drug is very severe and it's a scary, terrifying feeling.	F		 	11/27/2008
5	panic, anxiety and rage attacks	I went on a course of Zyprexa before but it made me gain 10 kg. I switched to Abilify and it keeps me balanced without having my mood all over the place. no more panic attacks. the downside is that I cannot miss one dose or else I go on harsh cold turkey and have rampant anxiety.

2	Bipolar, rapid cycling, mixed state	Loss of fine motor control due to shaking, especially hands, also some hair loss	I am very sensitive to medication, especially anti-psychotics, and can only tolerate small amounts; but I need them to level out my mood swings and break escalating episodes. Abilify did not work for me. The side effects have NOT gone away in the 6 months since I have stopped taking it. As an artist it's a real problem to be unable to draw a line that isn't wibbly.

2	bipolar depression	inner restless, urge to move, couldn't sit still even to read	I think this med could have helped had I not been so restless.  It also made me want to eat and smoke ALL the time to quell the restlessness.	F	35	5  days	10/27/2008Email
4	psychosis/ocd	inner restlessness, tremors	This medicine did wonders for my voices and delusions but the side effects (tremors, inner restlessness) were too much to handle and I stopped taking this med and now I'm taking seroquel.	M	19	2  months	10/21/2008
3	Bi-polar and anxiety	Tiredness, food cravings, WEIGHT GAIN whenever the dose is increased.	I started on 5mg now I am on 30mg due to this medication not having an positive effect on my bi-polar and anxiety levels.	F	16	4  years	10/21/2008
1	Depression/anxiety	Significant restlessness (akathasia). It is a horrible feeling. So I stopped taking it.		M	32	8  days	10/18/2008
1	Bipolar II/ Mood disorder	Extreme Akathisia! it was horrible! jittery all the time, I couldnt sit still, I had to move constantly, shaking all over and I couldnt sleep at all. It is the worst thing I have ever experienced! Plus I gained 5lbs in 1 week! Crying all the time, I bawled like a baby watching the Price is Right yesterday, bc a man won a car! Crazy!! This stuff is awful!	Its been 2 days since I quit taking it, and I am still shaky and unable to sleep. Yesterday I had to take 2 valiums, 1 and a half restoril, and 100mg of benadyl(recommend by my doc.) to try to calm me down and I was still in high gear. And after all those meds. to calm me down I was still hypomanic/ very hyper. I felt like I could have ran a marathon! I would def. not recommed trying Abilify, unless you want to feel like your going crazy....	F	22	6  days	10/18/2008Email
5	Bipolar disorder	Heightened libido, and that's all. I'm on 5mg qd.	Abilify has a half life of 3 days and so tends to build up in the system, and so pdocs inadvertently rx it at too high a dose. At too high a dose, it causes agitation, extreme restlessness, anxiety, etc. This has led to a lot of people begging off of it w/o giving it a fair trail. This is the best bipolar med I've ever been on, and I've been at this now for 6 years. It's looking more and more like I'm cured. I take 5mg coupled w/ 3mg of Invega and 100mg of Desipramine. I am happy, productive and participate fully in life.	M	70	3  months	10/16/2008Email
2	Bipolar	Great at first, little sleepy, had some headaches but got used to it. Was only taking 2mg, moved up to 5mg and came down with a rash all over my arms and legs. Friends said my face looked puffy. Stopped taking it, rash went away within a week, started it up on 2mg again and my eye's swelled shut. I also retained water on this med, gained 7 pounds over a month	Loved how this drug made me feel at 2mg but the rash and puffiness just wasn't worth the trouble	F	30	30  days	10/15/2008Email
3	depression	No side effects for the first 10 weeks. Around the 10th week I experienced two side effects that appeared almost simultaneously. The first side effect involved swelling of my parotid gland. This is a salivary gland that is located just in front of your ear and near the upper jaw. The day after I noticed this side effect, I began to experience acne-like clusters on my forehead and scalp. I'm usually pimple free, so the abilify seemed to be the likely cause.	Due to the side effects mentioned, I discontinued use. This was disappointing because the medication did seem to lessen my depression and it helped me increase energy and concentration.	F	47	10  weeks	10/14/2008
2	Compulsive Skin Picking	Severe facial acne, clumsiness, muscle weakness, severe fatigue	Due to this medication for the first time in 10 years I was able to stop my skin picking.  Then two months into the regime severe acne broke out on my face.  7 months later and I'm still dealing with it.  The side affects aside I did have some unexpected results that I really liked.  Although I wasn't taking the medication for my ADHD I found while on the medication I was extremely punctual and capable of tearing myself away from something I was focusing intensly on.  I've been off the medication for several months now and have gone back to being chronically late and having periods of hyperfocus where I can't do anything else but the task in front of me.  I wouldn't take it again, but some of the results were very impressive.	F	24	3  months	10/11/2008
3	Bipolar Type I	Loss of appetite, weight loss, dizziness, tiredness, difficulty with some motor and cognitive skills.	I do love this drug because I've lost a ton of weight really quickly.  I don't know if it will stay this way, but I can only eat small portions, if I can eat at all.  Mind you, I'm not taking this medication in conjunction with anything else that would make me gain weight.  I realize I've had some bizarre side effects, but the loss of motor control and dizziness have started to go away.	F	25	45  days	10/7/2008
2	bipolar/schitzophrenia	restless, no appetite or sex drive, unable to focus or concentrate on anything, diarrhea.	Hate it and when I called doc about side effects she INCREASED dosage. Hope it wears off soon. My son says I look "zoned out." If this is supposed to help my manic episodes, I'd rather be manic. Up to 20 mg in 4 weeks. Ugh.	F	45	4  weeks	10/4/2008
2	Bipolar 1	My 72 year old mother was diagnosed with Bipolar 1...taking Abilify she is losing her ability to walk and sleep..she is currently on 5 mg...I want to ween her off..I don't like how combative she has become...		F	72	5  weeks	9/30/2008Email
5	bipolar	None that I am aware of.	This drug (and I am only on 5mg now) gave me my life.  I was completely unstable, foggy, rocking, in the black, sleeping depressive fragile anxious way, and then this drug came along and made everything all right.  With therapy, I have resumed a normal life, work full time, and am basically doing well.  Taking Abilify was the turning point.	F	33	6  years	9/27/2008
3	Bipolar I	Loss of appetite (the very thought of most foods made me sick), sleepy, kind of depressed, a little weepy.	I don't think I've been on it long enough.  I'm only on 5 mg, but I'm also on Klonopin and Lamictal, so it may be a mixture of the three that's causing this.  I was really surprised with the loss of appetite.  Normally, I get up in the morning and can't wait to eat breakfast.  Lately, I wake up and just want coffee before I realize that I'm bored and have nothing I want to do at all.	F	24	14  days	9/24/2008
3	Bipolar	extremem restlessness, nervousness, I couldn't sleep, would toss and turn. WHen I did sleep I woke up hour on the hour. I felt  blah about everything. Increased appetite.I gained 10 pounds in one money. Trembling and shaking hands.	I started out on 5mg and upped to 10 mg. in two weeks. I started feeling better but then the side effects became too much. I literally couldn't stay still, no position was comfortable whether it be standing, sitting or laying down. Even after taking an Ambien I still couldn't sleep. I finally did after taking a clonazepam and Ambien together.	F	30	5  weeks	9/24/2008
5	Schizophrenia, poor cognition	Really bad anxiety, homicidal thoughts. Some tics.	Really excellent medication, main reason I had to switch from Risperidone was my thinking was really messed up. But having switched to this my thinking is clear as, no problems on the schizophrenic side either.Fantastic medication.	M		6  months	9/13/2008
1	OCD	Extreme restlessness. I couldn't rest or sit still. My arms and legs were shaking constantly, my feet and toes kept shaking, it was terrifying and painful. I had to be out of school for a week because I was unable to sit still, I kept moving and my feet and arms and legs felt like they had to keep moving. I was so scared, I thought the pain wouldn't ever end. It took weeks after getting off it before the restlessness stopped. It was scary.	The most frightening pill ever. I could not stop moving or sit still or lay down or rest. Abilify made my arms and legs feel like they had to constantly be moving and it felt so uncomfortable sitting still or laying down, I felt constantly restless. It was extremely terrifying and I was young and hadn't known the side effects the pill would give me. I was so scared the restlessness and pain was going to last forever. I could not lay down or sit still, I had to be moving every second and I couldn't rest. It was awful. Scary stuff.			 	9/13/2008
3	Bi-Polar	Akathisia.  The worse feeling I have ever felt.  Just the definition alone will make you understand, but if not it felt as there were people inside of me, trying to push out of me.  All around my entire inside, all pushing with the same resistance at the same time.  I would of rather taken a bullet to the head than deal with that feeling ever again.	It was difficult to tell whether it helped with my mood since I cycle so frequently.  I was in a good mood while I was taking it.  The side effects didn't start till I was upped from 5/mg to 10.  After that I was on 10 for approx 3 days when it started.  Quit taking it and the side effects went away immediately.	M	30	3  weeks	9/4/2008
3	Stuttering	I have been taking Abilify 5mg for 4 weeks now and I am feeling fatigue and disconnected from life all day. Very little emotions and no sex drive. Sleeping ok but still just tired all day.	I was prescribed the dung as an experiment to treat stuttering or speech disorder I have. I have had a reduction is my stuttering but I am not sure if it worth the side effects. The feeling tired all the time is the hardest side effect for me. I might be put on Geodon instead.	M	27	4  weeks	9/3/2008Email
2	paranoia, depression, anxiety	went on 10mg after risperidone, made me gain weight and my prolactin rose to drastic levels. have been on for 3 months and feel horrible, paranoia worse, didnt have it on respiridone, twitchy, edgy, sleeping all the time, feel ill, vomiting, stomach problems, strange light headed feeling	am fed up with it and disappointed, initially switched as it is the only drug over here without supposed weight gain(u.k)am seeing doctor tomorrow with view of stopping.

5	Bipolar	Extreme restlessness but take cogentin, now no problems.	I take 20mg and experienced extreme restlessness, however, my pdoc prescribed cogentin and I've not had any problems with restlessness since.  Abilify really helps my bipolar mania/depression.	F	46	6  months	8/25/2008
4	Depression	Interrupted sleep, weight gain at higher doses (which isn't coming off by lowering the dose), more energy, decreased sexual desire and ability	This drug has been great for me. I'm only on 5 mg to augment Effexor 225mg, but it gives me more energy and really helps elevate my mood. It's been a lifesaver. I had some weight gain and irritability at 7 and 10 mg, but none at 5. I just wish the weight would come off just by going down in dosage, but it's not. My only big complaint is the cost. Even with my (not so great) insurance its very very expensive, but I'm working with my Dr. to make it more affordable	F	22	4  months	8/22/2008
4	bi-polar	Nothing serious. A little light headed and "floaty" maybe, slightly nauseous. (after 2 weeks of 5mg dose)	Definitely agitated, not hyper, but a noticeable "high" feeling.	M	34	14  days	8/18/2008
1	Bipolar	I took ONE 2mg tablet- Pdoc assured me that I would have no side effects on such a miniscule dosage.NOT- I was so nauseous I had to seek anti-nausea meds from my primary doctor. My head pounded for 12 hours and tylenol nor advil would stop the pain.	Mood wise- I could feel a difference. I was very Calm. However the nausea and headache were enough to not ever take this again.	F	38	1  days	8/17/2008
2	Bipolar,ptsd,bordline psnality d/o	So dizzy! Feel like passing out whether sitting, standing, or walking. Also hearing things now and vision not right either. Yuck. However, i'm not crying anymore. Hmmm...	Also on Topamax, Wellbutrin, Lamictal(450mg), Ativan as PRN, and just tapered off Effexor 37.5 when I started the Abilify. Don't know what s/effect is from what anymore!! Hungry, tired, sore, anxious, poor judgement. Used to be on 10mg Abilify and couldn't sit still or concentrate on anything. Drank and smoked way too much! Once off of it, all negative behaviors stopped. 2 years later we decided to try a smaller dose (2mg) and things are different, but not good.	F	37	10  days	8/10/2008Email
5	Depression	Day 1 - Very sleepy, felt drugged. No serious side effects since the first day. A little bit of night-time waking, but not really insomnia. Sometimes I struggle a little bit in conversation. It seems that I occasionally take a little longer to find the right word when speaking.	My doctor suggested that we augment my Wellbutrin with a low dose of Abilify (2mg). After the first day I felt less sleepy & each day began to feel like a had more energy and desire to get up and do things. I'm taking the abilify in the morning now and not feeling drugged at all. Day 6 - 14, I've continued to feel less depressed and my energy seems to be returning.I've been on Wellbutrin 300mg for over 12 months with some stabilization of my mood, but my depression never really went away with just the Wellbutrin. The Abilify seems to be doing the trick.	F	47	14  days	8/8/2008
1	bipolar NOS	severe akathisia - extreme restlessness to the point of interfering with my life and sleep - this only on 10-15 mg. Went off the 10 mg cold turkey.  Will not take again.	It's hard to tell if it stabilized my mood or not.  I was told I have rapid cycling mixed episodes.  I won't take it anymore though because the akathisia (look it up on wikipedia) was like TORTURE.	F	34	20  days	8/8/2008
4	Depression AND Anxiety disorder	No Side effercts	Found it brilliant was on another type before this and it made me put up 3 stone. No side effects experienced from this and im in great humour.	F	24	1  years	8/7/2008
2	bipolar disorder? / schizophrenia?	EXHAUSTION - extreme hunger- dry patches on skin- unexplained bruising- thinning hair	I have been on this med for over 4 years, and have hated every minute of it. I can't move when i finally wake up after sleeping 12+ hours a night and have gained over 50 lbs.	F	21	4  years	8/7/2008Email
3	depression, ocd, panic disorder	Feel "blah", disconnected. Unable able to get restful sleep, like i am aware of everything around me.  I toss and turn all night long.  Slight dizziness, extreme hunger and thirst.	Within an hour of taking the first pill i felt like someone had shut of a switch in my brain and my thoughts just stopped racing, which was great!!  I am just so tired, I have always had vivid dreams and have had no trouble falling asleep, anywhere.  I'm not sure i like the way i feel. Maybe i'm just used to being on high alert all the time, but i feel so "just here".  My husband keeps telling me this will pass.  I had been on 40mg of prozac for 11yrs and was taken of cold turkey 2 weeks ago, that went very bad.  So now i am on 20 prozac and the abilify.  Just don't know if i can hang in there!!!

1	Dad (82)was taking it for dementia	This drug killed him! He threw up all night and next day,was unable to swallow,his dementia got much worse, and over a month long period he lost 40 pounds! The stupid doctor said he was psychotic but we found out later dementia can have a paranoid component. Dad was never bipolar! He went downhill and quit eating, etc., and finally died--night and day difference for the worse after the pill. We found out later this drug should not be used for people with dementia. Parade magazine has been ads sayi\ng don't use in the elderly and esp. those with dementia! Don't take this if you're older or have dementia.		M	82	1  days	7/21/2008Email
1	BiPolar - Mixed	Debilitating -- Exhaustion -- Fatigue -- NOT able to get out of bed.	This is the WORST drug I've ever been on -- and I've been on a lot.	F	58	1  weeks	7/21/2008
1	Depression	Just after thirty minutes of taking the drug (I took it in the morning), I literally fainted on my living room floor, and slept for six hours before waking up again. It made me feel like a zombie, dizzy, and it certainly didn't help me at all. The next day I took it, I saw spots all over, and I felt as if I was going blind. It scared me so much.	Never will I take this drug again.	F	15	2  days	7/18/2008
2	Depression	Restlessness, leg aches, foot pain, inability to "get comfortable," unable to concentrate on one task long enough to finish it, always hungry, skin breakouts, confusion (driving has become scary), light bothers my eyes, and my vision is blurry -- like there's a layer of gel on my eyes that I can't get off.  I keep moving things closer and closer to me so that I can see them.	I took 2 mg for two weeks and 5 mg for 1 week. I'm also taking Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, and Topamax -- all because I'm so depressed that I see no point in any aspect of living. Add in the Abilify side effects, especially the muscle pain, confusion, and vision problems, and I'd rather not live than continue taking that drug. Think I'll inquire w/ my doctor about Cytomel or Ritalin to augment the antidepressants.	F	37	3  weeks	7/15/2008

5	Bipolar II	Acne, occasional fatigue and leg cramps in the first couple of weeks, has since gone away - still have occasional pimples.	Love this medicine. It's the only Bipolar med that has helped me along with Topamax. I have tried almost every med out there and everything had so many side effects or just made me loopy or made me pass out all day. This combo has kept me stable with little to no side effects. I'm so thankful for Abilify.	F	29	1  years	7/6/2008Email
1	Yes	Tardive dyskinesis, weight gain, terrible mental health ( mental fog, slow thinking, poor coordination, excessive sleep)  not able to function to my full potential...just a walking zombie....like being in a vegetative state.	Presribed by doctor and forced to take by the doctor for her diagnosis for schizophrenia....the new doctor i saw after her expressed concerns about the previous docs diagnosis....for i never exhibited any of the symptoms except for depression...

2	major depression and gen. anxiety	the first night i had a bit of nausea and kept waking up in the middle of the night, and then second night i also had nausea and i ended up passing out in the hallway.  it felt like there wasn't enough blood in my head, and then i collapsed and hit my head, and a few minutes later i threw up.	i can't say anything about its psychological benefits because i only took 2 small doses (2.5mg), and i stopped taking it due to the bad side effects.  mostly i'm terrified of taking new meds now, as i already had an intense fear of getting sick and was weary of side effects from anything.	F	17	2  days	6/21/2008
5	schizoaffective or biploar	none	This drug made many improvements in my day to day life.  I was constantly suicidal, hearing voices, and overall extremly depressed, etc... prior to starting this medication.  Now if I can find someone willing to hire a schizo, I'd be all set.	M	36	2  years	6/16/2008Email

2	Bipolar - rapid cycling	jittery and sleepy all of the time.  Extremely irritable	I began taking this drug to help with my rapid cyclng.  Abilify only made my life more difficult due to the unability to sit still for more than 15 seconds.	F	35	3  years	6/6/2008
3	bipolar	Initially I was VERY restless and had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Eventually that wore off. Weight gain.	I'm on the fence as to I feel about it. The weight gain bothers me the most. It served its purpose at the time it was needed but now we are going to discontinue it.	F	37	1  years	5/27/2008Email
2	Depression	My Dr. added this Rx to my Effexor (150mg) and Wellbutrin (300mg) because I was still having problems with my depression.  I'm gaining weight (which I definitely don't need since I already have a weight problem), my knees are killing me, I feel very fatigued, I'm not sleeping all that great, and I can't seem to feel "good" anymore--not even for a day. I'm going to ask to be taken off of this drug.  I have never done this before and I've dealt with depression off and on for the past 10 years.  The side effects are just not worth it to me.		F	48	3  weeks	5/27/2008
2	PTSD - Anger Management Issues	Extreme Restlessness, Unable to concentrate/focus (this is a big problem for me as a go to school), Night Sweats, Weight Gain, Blurred Vision.	Abilify is supposedly the better substitute to Geodon according to my Doctor. However, I never felt anything different other than than my nausea went away. I always have this feeling of restlessness and the need to move every minute. It has also become difficult for me to study for school because I cannot focus my attention to my readings! My dreams have also become vivid and I wake up all sweaty. Since I started taking Abilify, I couldn't stop eating! I already gained 10lbs in the last 3 days. Definitely not worth it!

3	depression-CFS	constipation, I've gained 20 pounds.. but I took a vacation and I have been able to gain wieght easily in the past.	It seems to really numb me out. I take 15mg abilify-120mg cymbalta-90mg adderall + slepping pills. I think the abilify take the highs and lows out of the adderall. Bummer on the highs but good on the lows. I would rate it higher if I had more exerience with this drug	M	37	30  days	4/19/2008
5	PTSD; depression; rapid cycling	Some blurred vision; muscle stiffness and fatigue	I am extremely medication resistant and after trying virtually ever psych drug on the market with no success, Abilify has been a life saver.  It works for me on a low dose (4mg) and has improved and stabilized my moods and quality of sleep. A great drug if it works for you.  Try lowering dosage or starting on a really low dose if side effects are too much.	M	45	4  weeks	4/16/2008
3	OCD	extreme restlessness	this medciation is REALLY helping my ocd, but the restlessness is almost unbearable, especially since i have a desk job. i'm going to talk to my psych about maybe taking something to combat the side effect.	M	24	1  months	4/12/2008
4	Bipolar: depression, phycosis	night sweats, weight gain, bloating, restlessness, insomnia, hypo manic and a little grouchy	i have been on 10mg for about three weeks. at five mg the first week i felt great. i had been having psychotic thoughts and depression. now i am hypo manic which is much better than being depressed. i can't sleep well or sit still but i get my housework done. I have started having night sweats and insomnia on week 3. the psychotic thoughts have not totally been taken care of but i do not want to increase my dosage yet. it's hard to be around other people when i have these thoughts.

4	Bipolar, antisocial disorder	Not able to eat much, bowel movements inconsistant, weird taste in mouth	Mu Daughter has been taking this med. in the morning, along with Pamilor at night(I assume to counter effect some of the nasties that can go along with Abilify) So far, her mood and behavor are MUCH better, relationships with friends and family are more stable. She is on 5mg right now with an expected increase next week to 7.5mg. I think that will do it. She seems to be aware of other human beings now and the distruction of the house (mostly unintentional) has improved soooo much.	F	13	1  weeks	4/3/2008Email

3	Childhood Onset Bipolar Disorder	Parkinsonian symptoms including elbow flexion, mask face, dysfunctional posture, some stiffness in arms, initially somnolence, but this eventually passed	My 7 year old son was started on Abilify as soon as he was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder.  He improved remarkably after the first dose, and within 6-7 days his symptoms were improved by 80-90%.  However, he also immediately developed what is called in medical lingo akinesia, which is abnormal movement and posture, delayed spontanuity in gesture, and abnormal posture.  Most of these side effects made him look like a Parkinson's patient.  The pych was against giving a drug to counter these side-effects becuase he felt it was not a "clean solution."  Later however, we did put him on Congentin which immediately took care of these side effects.  In a nut shell, we tried various other drugs and none worked as well as Abilify so we are now going back to it hoping the side-effects don't re-emerge.  He has been on numerous anti-pychotics since, and the side-effects are slowly diminishing with each new one.	M	7	6  weeks	3/25/2008
3	bipolar II - Depression - anorxia	killer headache - pain in my jaw - nausea - dizziness	Can't really say yet if I like this medicine.  I've only been on it for four days - 5mg.  Seems as though a lot of people have gained weight. Hopefully that won't happen to me - right now I am nauseous so I don't want to eat; which is good sort of - I've had an eating disorder for many, many years.  Now I am worried about gaining weight.  If I do - I am off this drug. Thanks for the heads up - because my Doc prescribed this med as opposed to seroquel.  I am hoping that these side effects go away.	F	50	4  days	3/25/2008

5	Complex PTSD	thinking becomes dull, thick.  Dizziness, a little tardive dyskinesia.	Used this drug for a year or so, then was able to ween off of it. Now it works well when  I cannot slow my brain down in any other way.  Sometimes I only need it for 3 days, sometimes for a month. I can always ween off of it again and have months that I am ok.  Many times, it has kept me from having to go back to the hospital.  I am grateful to have it.	M	51	3  years	3/16/2008
5	BIPOLAR II - PTSD	mania, jaw clenching, consitpation, increased appetite for sweets, jittery, sleepy after taking, anxiety,	it has IMPROVED my mood 100%. Very LOW dose 2.5mg. Started at 10mg, then 5mg every other day, then 2.5 mgs. That works best. Perhaps these folks on higher doses need to lessen dose until it is manageable. I am on EFFEXOR+Abilify 2.5-was suicidal b4 for 2 years.  Now in less than a week I was up, productive, working, getting things done I hadn't in months. Will monitor for weight gain--I already gained weight on Effexor! No need for more weight.	F	46	14  days	3/11/2008
5	Schizophernia and Bipolar	Stiffness in muscles and joints and skipped heart beats, my doctor prescribed me 40 mg and the max is 30mg.	Learned that this medicine effects different people differently	F	34	2.5  years	3/7/2008
4	Bipolar w/psychotic features	always hungry; some weight gain (would be more if I ate when I was hungry); not sure how to describe this, but the blahs; physical restlessness	My doctor is thinking about switching me to geodon because of my constant hunger, but is concerned about the extrapyramidal effects with that medication; I'm not sure how well this works for depression either.	F	47	2  months	2/29/2008
1	Disasociative Identity Disorder	fatigue, headache, numbness, nausea, irritability, sleep disturbance, loss of vision, rash	I may be diagnosed with lupus or some other complication at this point. I had to stop taking the drug because of the side effects.	F	23	4  months	2/25/2008
1	Bipolar	Fatigue, depression	I was taking 15mgs and could never stay awake. I would sleep for almost 12 hours and still fall asleep at work and in class. I had to drink 4-5 energy drinks a day just to make it and I STILL had difficulty staying awake.	F	22	1  months	2/23/2008

1	Bipolar II	So far, the side effects of this medication are some of the worst I've ever felt. I have had non-stop nausea, vomiting and a horrific headache since the medicine got into my system. I've only taken one dose and am reluctant to take another before first speaking to my doctor about my exteme side-effects.	Skin "crawling" and cannot get comfortable.	F	30	1  days	2/12/2008
5	bi polar	sleepy	you doctor may not tell you this but if you are over weight or insulin resistant this medicine may cause you to become diabetic I am insulin resistant and for that reason I had to wean myself off of this the benefits were not worth having a future of diabetes	F	28	9  months	2/11/2008

4	Bipolar	none	Abilify has been a great help for me. I've been on it for two years now and I haven't had another bad episode since. I am beginning to become depressed again but we are going to take my dosage up.I definently recommend this medication.	M	18	2  years	1/31/2008

1	Was switched from Rispiradol.	Our 16 year old son had gained a tremendous amount of weight taking Rispiradol and the Dr. switched him to Abilify.  "Will do the same as Rispirasol for your son without the weight gain", the Doctor told us. Well, he STILL continued to gain weight (always hungry) (has gained 70 pounds in 9 months, and he was always small framed until beginning the Rispiradol). He became extremely restless and he would pace and not be able to sit still for more than 8 minutes at a time. His lying and disrespect intensified.  It was as if we no longer knew our son.Now, two weeks after stopping the Abilify, our old son is re-emerging.  It is a welcomed sight.	We will never allow him to be put on abilify again.	M	16	2  months	1/22/2008
2	Anxiety & Depression	Strange restlessness; especially in arms and legs. No chair felt right. First few weeks: couldn't sit still !! Increase in anxiety & depression. Slight increase in weight which subsided after 5 weeks.	Quicker orgasms!	F	40	6  weeks	1/17/2008Email
3	depression	20lb. weight gain,sleep disrupted, fatique.	New info about weight gain caused by increased appetite will be published soon. My therapist knows someone who works for the co. and he said my psychopharmacologist didn't have the info because it hasn't been published yet. I was waking up several hours earlier than normal and went back to my regular schedule as soon as I stopped.	F	50	4  months	1/11/2008
1	supposed bipolar	my son was 17 yrs old.He was on abilify for9 months with some progress with social issues.he gained 50 lbs.he went to bed at 10.30 and passed away in his sleep.this was the only med he was on.autopsy report could not determin a definate cause.we believe it had to be from the med.		M	17	9  months	1/9/2008Email
4	Bi-Polar, ADHD	My seven year old son has been on this med for two weeks. He complains about a little pain, I am thinking muscle pain, he has had a sore inside his cheek that we treated with clove oil and hydrogen peroxide (went away), he has been a little sad on this med, a little whiny, but considering all he has been through, it seems like he is finally able to feel emotions whereas before he seemed very out of touch with reality and non-emotional (his dad abandoned him and we are in the middle of divorce, and my son has hardly registered emotionally, which might have been a blessing in disguise all this time, and I think part of his whininess is just his ability to finally feel the things he had not been able to feel before).	Now the good stuff, we tried this med first (physician sample), then Risperdal (actual prescription). The Risperdal had no effect on him, he was still racing around like a lunatic, and after seeing him on this drug, we decided this drug was far better. He can focus at school, listens to the teacher, was able to be included in his school Christmas pageant, the violence against others (classmates, his dad, myself) has stopped, and he is able to sit still for long periods, complete class work and homework, no longer destroys the house like he did before, the school is considering allowing him to rejoin his classmates in social activities (recess and PE, which he was held out of for most of the school year because of fighting and violence), and this saved him from being suspended for the second time. My son likes the drug, wants to take it, and gets a lot of satisfaction from being able to complete tasks and follow directions. He was in so much trouble before, and meds were a last resort f	M	7	2  weeks	1/7/2008Email
3	depression,  adhd, anxiety	2mg every 2-4 days, per shrink.  I have noticed that I have been happier the first day after taking it, each time, but then I get more moody or anxious as the pill wears off so I take another one which is about 2-3 days later.  I sleep fine but not as hard anymore as I used to and I find myself more bored.  I am more friendly to people though - most of the time.	I am still on the fence on this drug.  I am not sure if it is because I am "thinking" it is working in a good way - or if it really is.  This is one drug I am still waiting to see miracles happen but, honestly, I doubt it'll ever happen.  I will continue to take the samples I received from the shrink and go from there.....	F	38	30  days	1/3/2008
2	BI POLAR I	Tired, less energy, lathargic, mouth is dry, jittery, cold sweats, etc.	If i take it in the day I feel tired all day, I take it at night around 8 eiother was around lunch I am so tired and sleep 3 hours and around 8-10 at night, when I take it at night I am almost on the verge of passing out and it gives me quite a rush and keeps me up. I was very energetic before, now I feel like not even moving. LOL if you can tell I had just tookin my meds or I would not even be typing this. Also I am ever so restless legs, getting comfortable etc.	M	34	4  weeks	12/26/2007Email
3		Massive increase in hunger and weight gain.  No other side effects	Abilify worked great to stop mood swings and sense of "What's the point?" and fearful thoughts.  The doctor said the medication would make me lose weight but it didn't so I decided to stop it	F		2  months	12/25/2007
1	Bilpolar	RESTLESS!! Doctor said technical term is "akastasia" pardon spelling. Wasnt even comfortable to drive. I have driven cross country etc. before this experience. Couldnt sit still, stand or ANYTHING for 5 mins. Thought I would crawl out of my skin. Was making me feel almost suicidal! TOOK TWO full weeks or more off my 15mg dose to feel "normal" again.	I was on this med for occasional manic episodes and rapid speech.....it made me feel completely whacked out. Have never felt so uncontrollably "odd" like that before. Was honestly a terrifying experience!	F	30	4  weeks	12/19/2007
3	Bipolar	Extreme nausea like I've never had, unusually tired, constipation, and restlessness	Helps keep my mind clear though...good for that, but the nausea makes me too sick to move much	F	30	24  days	12/15/2007

1	Bi Polar disorder	Even more depressed, irritated, can't concentrate, bladder problems, shaky legs and hands, swollen extremities, can't laugh (I love laughing- now seems like I have to retrain myself how to do it), painful joints/stiffness>(doesn't subside at all!), severely panicky, crying a lot, very sad, can't stop thinking about how horrible I feel mentally and physically. I'm even more paranoid/worried about what other's think about me than I was before taking Abilify. 	Not for me. I'm glad to see that it works for some people. I was open minded and looking for help and whatever medicine works/worked, would be willing to try for sure..but not this one!	F	46	2  days	12/14/2007
5	complex PTSD	Thinking is thick and slow	I take abilify when my brain starts to go out of control and won't stop.  It is step 4 in a 5 step management process.  (Step 5 is back to the hospital.)  I've tried most other atypical anti-psychotics and for me abilify is the gentlest and sturdiest way to get my brain to stop.  Usually stay on it for a month after an episode and then go off of it and am ok for a few months.	F	51	3  years	12/11/2007
3	bipolar and OCD	motor impairment, slight weight gain, EXTREME fatigue, EXTEREME thirst, akathisia (need to move; I can't sit still anymore), and I believe I am experiencing Tardive dyskinesia	This medication was okay at first, or at least better than risperdal (which overall made me gain well over 100 pounds, but abilify was not that drastic). It had greatly reduced my obsessive and intrusive thoughts but now it's just an annoyance. Most of my meds, including this one, have slowed down my entire body (thinking, reaction time, speech, etc.) which is the reason I have a learning disability. I'm SO tired! I do have sleep apnea but abilify just makes it worse. Tardive dyskinesia is a problem, too (involuntary movements such as: grimacing, tongue protrusion, rapid eye blinking, finger movements as if playing a guitar or piano, etc.) Tardive dyskinesia happens with antipsychotics like abilify and I do every single thing I listed there. It's also potentially irreversable. I'm just not the same as I once was.	M	20	2  years	12/11/2007
4	stress disorder	restlessness tremors BOREDOM pacing vivid/scary dreams	i had to cut my dosage in half (15 mg to 7.5 mg) and the side effects lessoned..... it works but side effects are annoying	F	14	1  months	12/8/2007
5	Schizoaffective- Bipolar Type	Was tired when I first started taking it but that subsided.  Now after being on it for 4 years I'm starting to have Extra Pyramidal Symptoms in my Eyes (unusual eye movements).  So I've had to lower my dose.	This drug saved my life.  I was literally at rock bottom when I found abilify four years ago and it brought me out of the deepest darkness imaginable.  It stopped my hallucinations, controlled my bipolar symptoms, and allowed me to get to the point of being able to go back to school.  I'm terrified that I'll have to stop taking it because of the EPS.	F	22	4  years	11/27/2007
3	Bipolar/Hypomania	Hypomania, insomnia, blurred vision, nervousness, paraniod thoughts after 3 weeks of usage, unable to relax, confusion (could have been from lack of sleep).	The first week was great, very motivated on 10 MG.  Week 2 began feeling confused, blurred vision, light sensitivity, nerviousness, yet still unable to stop moving.  Third week 15mg, had to start taking Temazepam to get to sleep, still only 2-3 hrs of sleep a night.  Still unable to stop moving.  Finally called doc and weaned off in 3 days.  Wonderful motivator, but unable to focus and sleep.  The sleep deprivation and vision issues made this drug debilitating.  Seemed to make my hypomania worse.  Weaning off had delusional thoughts for a day or so.  Defintely do not cold turkey off this med.	F	34	3  weeks	11/27/2007Email

4	Major depression	Vivid dreams, waking up in the middle of the night, blurred vision (but I'm on a cocktail of meds so I don't know if this is all due to the Abilify or the others)	I've had chronic depression my entire life.  I was recently (last month) suicidal, and a few days after my psychiatrist prescribed 2.5mg a day, I was out of the suicidal haze and began to feel better.  After adding Lamictal (in addition to the Lexapro I was already on), I feel a LOT better.	F	21	1.5  months	11/8/2007
1	Clearness of thoughts, focusing	Severe restlessness at 15mg, some at 10mg.	It may have helped in some ways, but the increased restlessness is nuts.  I can't stay still and can't relax.  Also take Effexor twice a day.	M	53	6  months	11/5/2007Email

1	Bipolar II	EXTREME mania, severe throat swelling starting within 24 hrs of first 2 mg dose, sweating, uncontrollable tremors, twitching, headache, tiredness, blurred vision, nausea, agitation, dizziness. I ended up in the hospital after 4 days on the drug. I was severely dehydrated.	I would NOT take this drug. Even if you are having few side effects now I would say it's extremely dangerous and not worth the risk. Especially do not give this drug to children! There are bound to be long term effects that are irreversible. I will have to see if my muscle aches, tremors and twitching will subside permanently. Not a good experience!	M	25	4  days	10/13/2007Email
5	Bipolar	constipation, incresed energy, suppressed appetite.	i love it! on 5mg for past 2 weeks. I used to sleep 10 hrs a day before meds, and now I'm wide awake after 5 hrs. I have so much energy right now. I had taken Depakote, which was awful, I slept 12+ hrs a day, and still felt drowsy. Lost 5 lbs in past 2 weeks.	F	28	2  weeks	10/12/2007
3	Paranoid schizophrenia	For a short while, I experienced akathesia, but this has now gone.	Abilify has stopped auditory hallucinations, which is a great blessing. Sleep is interrupted, but I find that useful for reading and studying assorted Christian publications and the Bible early in the morning when all is quiet.  My appetite is enormous, so am constantly struggling with the temptation to gluttony and "making a god of the belly". So the challenge is self-control to avoid putting on more weight. I can thoroughly recommend the book "Strength for His People - A Ministry for Families of the Mentally Ill" by Dr Steven Waterhouse, Pastor of Westcliff Bible Church in Amarillo, Texas since 1985, (published by Westcliff Press - www.webtheology.com; e-mail is westcliff@amaonline.com; Ph: (806)359-6362). His brother Mark, suffers from schizophrenia and he wrote the book  in honour of him and to help ordinary people who may also suffer from this awful condition, and as a guide and consolation to families who may be the primary carer.(125 pages; Bibliography has 1	F	53	69  days	10/10/2007Email
1	Depression	RESTLESSNESS RESTLESSNESS RESTLESSNESS, dizziness, tiredness, nausea, anxiety/panic, flu-like symptoms	My psychiatrist prescribed this medication for me to help the Prozac work more effectively, she said. I HATE this medication, and after three days of taking it I WILL NOT take anymore. I could cry- I've never felt in such a way in all my life. It was like the walls were closing in. EVERYTHING was too boring to hold my attention! All I could think of, and I mean ALL DAY, was how GOOD it would feel to just run around my neighborhood screaming at the top of my lungs. It was IMPOSSIBLE to get comfortable, and I felt panicky, as if I were going to suddenly run out of oxygen. It was horrible. I've never experienced such crippling side effects before from any medicine like this.	M	18	3  days	10/8/2007
5	Bipolar Disorder	Fatigue, but it's fine since I take it at night and it helps me sleep.	EXCELLENT! So far, so good! I have more energy and motivation than I have ever had. I also have little to NO obsessive thoughts, practically NO racing thoughts, and my mood has been greatly improved. I can't say enought about how great this medication has been for me. I actually feel normal!!	F	34	9  days	10/3/2007
2	Bipolar II	Jittery, manic frenzy, sleeplessness	If this doesn't make you want to jump out of your skin, I don't know what will. I felt like I could scale the walls.	F	24	7  days	9/21/2007
2	Bipolar I Disorder	Tremors, insomnia, headaches, agitation, increased energy	This seems like a medication that might work for major depression, but I just don't see how it works for Bipolar Disorder.  It's so stimulating I had to take it as early as possible in the morning to avoid sleeplessness at night and it caused me to shake and have WAY too much energy during the day.	M	22	2  months	9/21/2007
4	Anxiety/Depression/Paranoia	Some blurred vision and dizziness when driving.	Everything seems to be working well and I feel Abilify has helped me tremendously!	F	30	1  months	9/19/2007
3	Anger/Rage/Paranoid Thoughts	Extreme tiredness/exhaustion.  Blurred vision and body aches.	It has made me calmer and I feel a little aloof so I'm not worrying about things as much.  I don't know if the side effects are worth it though.  I'll give it another week and see.	F	30	2  weeks	8/23/2007
5	bipolar w/ anxiety, hallucinations	some tummy upset when starting the meds but otherwise none so far.	Abilify was a miracle for my 8 yr old. After 4 years of searching for something that would help with his panic attacks, terror, anxiety, audio and visual hallucinations and frustration/aggression as well as his hyperactivity he was ultimately prescribed abilify 7.25 mg.  This was a miracle drug for us and alone has solved all of his issues. I'm so happy my son feels as he says "calm and happy" and isn't afraid of simple things like rain and leaving the house. He has been on it for 2 months now and the change is so dramatic. I'm one of those who tried so hard not to put my son on medication but he is a different child now, happy and no longer unable to function. As another mother here said, it gave him his life back.

2	rapid cycling bi-polar disorder	have gained 10 lbs in 4months, urinate frequently,no sex drive, blurred vision, makes me intensely hungry after i take it.unusually tired	I'm on lamictal and klonopin and have been on both of those for almost 10yrs, drs have been trying to add something for a boost as the lamictal makes me a little blah feeling. I have tried everything and just started the abilify 4 months ago and i felt like it worked great at first then the longer i take it the worse my side effects have gotten, i thought something new was wrong with me since it worked well in the beginning it seemed but have been so tired its ridiculous. i'm glad i went back and researched my meds just in case and found all my problems are side effects of this med.	F	34	4  months	8/22/2007
5	BPII, BPD	In the beginning I had some "wooziness," but that passed quickly.  Overall, I've had no real side-effects.	It has helped tremendously with my moods and I am able to take it during the day, which is a great thing (I don't tolerate medications well, and most tend to make me very sleepy).	F	26	3  months	8/15/2007Email
5	BIpoalr disorder	The main side effect is not being able to sleep for very long, but I also have more energy and get more things done.	I have taken almost every depression drug out there, and thought that I was just supposed to feel detached or apathetic. Abilify has been a miracle for me. I have a sense of humor again, lots of energy and the negative critical side of me is GONE.	M	35	30  days	8/12/2007Email
2	OCPD, anxiety, mild depression	Listlessness, lethargy, fatigue, reduced libido, ambivalence, lip sore (?), weight gain (?).	I was feeling highly motivated for two weeks before starting on Abilify. I started 5 mg for 5 days, then ramped to 10 mg for another 2+ weeks. All of the side effects started out barely noticeable. Over the last 5 days or so, the side effects have intensified. [Note: Taking 30 units Lantis(insulin)/dy for Type 2 diabetes; My BMI is 38;  I'm also on 40-80mg/dy Prozac for depression/aggression, the last 10 yrs., w/ no side effects.] I suspect Abilify is slowly turning me into the PillsBury Dough Boy. So, I'm not waiting another 2 weeks to get the shrink's opinion. I'm stopping taking this Rx cold turkey-right now. Of course I'll call the shrink to let him know I'm stopping this med.. All side effects w/ no noticeable benefits for me (unless you like feeling like a human marshmallow). Of course, your experience may or maynot be positive, unlike mine.	M	53	3  weeks	8/11/2007
4	Bipolar 2	VIVID DREAMS (things I think about during the day, i dream about at night.  These dreams feel very real)  K.O. component (I fall asleep within an hour of taking abilify)	I take Abilify with LAMICTAL(mood stabilizer) & Remeron.  I have nothing bad to say about abilify except it doesnt give me the desired effect i'm looking for which is the semi-resurrection of my mania so i am able to be an intellect and have a personality.	M	24	2  months	7/21/2007
3	Schizoaffective	I'm on lots of meds, so I'm not sure what side effects are caused by abilify; I haven't noticed any.	Abilify helped things make more sense. It helped a lot with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. I stoped wearing sweatshirts in the summer shortly after the drug was started but didn't realize until later that the abilify was why. I would recommend this drug.	F	19	2  months	7/21/2007Email
1	supposed bipolar disorder	Mental "fog," totally detached from everything, and severe--and continuing, even after 18 months off Abilify--movement problems akin to Restless Leg Syndrome.	Despite 30mg being the maximum dosage, my psychiatrist had me on 45mg, and did not listen when I told him about the side effects.  So, after about a year on Abilify (as well as Seroquel and Lamictal) I took myself off the two neuroleptics.  And yet I still have moment problems, increasing when tired or stressed, all this time later.	F	26	1  years	7/21/2007
2	Aspergers Syndrome, Tourette's	Intense sleepiness for first day, then after second dose, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, intense akathesia. Four days after discontinuing, the akathesia is subsiding, and the insomnia is lessening, but still present. Also: intense feelings of hunger.	This drug was supposed to calm me, help me to focus, control repetitive behaviors and tics. It did the opposite. It made it very difficult for me to sit still and write or type.	M	45	3  days	7/9/2007
1	Bipolar 2	Tremors in arms hands.  Two right fingers don't function normally. Restless legs.	The restless leg thing was bad.  I felt like a hyper 5 year old.  Tremors in arms and hands almost as bad as Katherine Hepburn.  Two fingers on right hand don't function normally.  Since I throw freight as a package handler, I'm useless at work.  Also have the urinating issue, I wait until I HAVE TO GO, otherwise not much happens - unlike normal.  Took 10 mg without Cymbalta, then with it again.  I have stopped takeing Abilify on 6/30.  It is now 7/5 and side effects haven't stopped.  Tremor has actually worsened.	M	36	5  days	7/5/2007Email
2	Bipolar II Disorder	Constant mouth ulcers, toothaches, muscle pain	It helped control my disorder better than most medications, with a minimum of other side effects, but the mouth ulcers are too much when you can't even eat a decent cheeseburger without being in pain.  The toothache was from a still-growing wisdom tooth that only seems to come in when I've taken it.  My mother has reported similar symptoms, so I figure it's just a hereditary thing.	M	28	3  weeks	7/3/2007
1	depression, irritabiity	extreme nausea, I took 1/2 of this pill and vomited all night, dry heaves, you name it.  It was the most horrific experience, I will never,.. ever recommend this med, please beware!  I was also prescribed a 30mg tablet a day, and in doing more research found out that is the highest dose!  I think this nurse practitioner is a quack!		F	49	1  days	7/3/2007
4	Psychosis from PTSD	weight gain (despite claims that it doesn't cause weight gain)	Abilify has helped me think more clearly, rationally and aside from the weight gain, I've had no side effects at all.  I take the Abilify in the morning, as it tends to be a bit stimulating.	M	46	3  years	6/11/2007Email

5	BP w/psychotic episodes; autism	My son has been on this med for two years and his only side effect has been minimal weight gain (about 20 lbs. in two years).	This medication worked very well for my son - stopped his visual and auditory hallucinations completely, decreased his motor tics, reduced OCD-like behaviors, and greatly reduced his aggression. This medication gave my son his life back; he is now able to function & communicate well and he is excelling academically.	M	12	2  years	5/17/2007
3	schizo/bipolar/depression	This medicince by far is the most effective when treating symptomsit has low impact on weight gain.  i recommend this drug if you have experienced weight gain with other anti physcotics such as seroquel and  zyprexa, i believe those drugs are linked to DIABETES, WEIGHT GAIN, and OVER EATING AND UNCONTROLLABLE HUNGER the dosing is very easy with abilify starting dose 15mg and that is the recommended dose you stay on according to my shrink abilify has not been found affective at higher does due to extreme side effects	this medicine made my eyes roll in back of my head once	M	32	14  years	5/14/2007
4	bipolar 1 disorder/mood instability	extreme tiredness, upset stomach, blurred vision, cold sweats, tremors (uncontrollable shaking) in hands.	I have been on and off this medication for 4 years and today is my first day back on it in 8 months. I feel very ill but I remember from all my past experiences that it takes a few weeks for your body to get used to and to respond(I just want to make that clear to the people that quit taking it after one day). I am taking 15mg but I'm pretty sure I'm going to start cutting my pill in half to lessen the side effects. Abilify has been highly effective in treating my irritability and mood swings, making me a pleasure, rather than a monster, to be around. Personally, I would rather have an upset stomach for a few days and be happy than to be constantly angry for the rest of my life. I took abilify with effexor a few years back and it sent me to the ER because I was shaking so badly I couldn't stand up. I am told it is dangerous to mix abilify with anything. Hopefully the side effects go away soon!	F	19	4  years	5/1/2007Email
5	bipolar/schizo-affectiver	As I went slowly up from 2.5mg to 15mg,- I experienced poor night vision;loud noises startled me at night;muscular aches and pains; always want to eat; tired all day but can't sleep through the night; restless, but tired.  Agitation, anger and anxiety came back if I didn't increase my dosage in about 4days.  I just began 15mg today. DR. said may go all the way to 30mg if we need to in the future.	Now, the good stuff--I'm calmer around people.  My anger is much reduced.  Oversensitivity is reduced. I'm able to cope with daily frustrations.  I'm no longer so irritable and impatient with people.  General anxiety, and nervousness to be around people is gone.  Bipolar mood swings are completely minimized and I recover from any emotional upset faster.  AWESOME drug for me personally!	F	38	1  months	4/25/2007
4	bipolar depression	weight gain (it was lithium's helper) spasming jaw, chattering teeth, tiredness, "wired, but tired"	This drug has kept me from falling any deeper into depressions. Both times it has rescued me from hospitalizations.  However, I do not like having to take two other drugs just so I can continue taking this one without the side effects.  Have to take cogentin and inderal both for the jaws and limb jerks.  Don't like that.	F	50	15  days	4/25/2007
3	Schizophrenia	increased sex drive, some tiredness, restlessness	Aripiprazole has being used to decrease the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and it has being effective at doing so. In my case, the side effects close to outweigh the benefits of this drug.	M	32	2  months	4/23/2007Email
1	Cyclothymia	Intense pain with muscle stiffness.  I might be diagnosed with Lupus now.  I never had these problems before I took Abilify.	I still have to have more blood tests to determine what is going on with the muscle and joint pain that I am experiencing.  I took 2.5 mgs. of Abilify for about a month and then felt like I was coming down with the flu.  It turns out that it was a rare side effect from this medicine, so I stopped taking it.  I am still in pain and it has been over 2 months since my last dose.  I am convinced that whatever my blood work says that I have it came from taking this medicine.	F	44	30  days	4/23/2007Email
5	schizophrenia	vivid dreaming, insomnia for the first four months	I lost 87lds on this drug and it gave my life back to me. No voices, no paranoia, no psychosis!!!	F	47	3  days	4/19/2007
1	bipolar disoder II, depression	I was vomiting the whole night after taking the first pill, the next day I was feeling sick that the only thing that I could do is just lying down in my bed; wasn't able to eat. I was feeling really sick, no drug made me fell that way	I took this medicine just for 1 day, and it was enough for me to decide that I wasn't taking it anymore. I was feeling really sick, just the same as when I was pregnant and having severe toxicosis , no drug made me fell that way. I'm going back to Depakote.	F	21	1  days	4/10/2007
2	schizoaffective, bipolar type	About three weeks after I started taking it, my entire body started gradually swelling up like a balloon, and I had this uncontrollable, horrible burning sensation in my legs and ankles. It got to the point where the swelling was so bad that I could barely move. I couldn't button my shirts anymore, my feet wouldn't fit into my shoes, and I had to go up a whole bra size (band AND cup). I found out, though, that only about two percent of the subjects in the clinical trials had this problem (and it's often an allergic reaction), so I must be special. ;-} Oddly enough, when I went off this, I got onto Risperdal, only to have the exact same reaction.	I was REALLY disappointed that my reaction was so bad, because it otherwise worked very well. I felt better than I could remember feeling in about 20 years. My mood swings went from every several minutes to ... not at ALL. I felt stable for the first time in a VERY long time, like I was finally on solid ground. The really WEIRD thing, though, was that for the first four days, I couldn't feel ANYTHING -- it was like someone had flipped a switch inside me and turned me off. After that, it took about another week to level out completely, but once I did, I felt GREAT.	F	28	5  weeks	4/5/2007Email
4	bi p[olar disorder	Tired. Very tired at first; now I don't even notice unless I stop taking it...then I'm a real c*nt to deal with and I am very irritable and angry.	When I started taking Abilify with Zoloft, I was very tired all day.  I felt like I had a wet blanket wrapped around my head, then they lessened the dose to 5 mg a day, and I'm fine.  It's subtle, I can't tell any effect at all from it unless I stop taking it.  Then it is like an immediate PMS.	F	37	1  years	4/1/2007Email
1	bi polar disorder	Started out on 5mg daily and over a period of 2 months was "upped" to 20mg.  By the middle of the third month, I developed the most horrible feeling, like wanting to jump out of my own skin, could NOT get comfortable, caused restless leg syndrome to go totally bonkers, made me pace and feel horribly panicky ALL THE TIME!  I had never in my life felt such an awful feeling!  Raging insomnia accompanied the whole ordeal, as well as vision trouble, completely unable to write a sentence or write my own name, for that matter due to hand tremors (which I still have sometimes to this day), constant feeling that the "dying to get out of my own skin or run screaming like a madwoman" feeling would NEVER go away.  It finally did, but golly did it ever take time.  That's the only thing that will help with the akathisia (acathesia)...time.  It took the same amount of time that I was on the drug, about 3 and a half months, for the feeling to finally start going away.	In all honesty, through bi polar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, severe panic disorder, visual and auditory psychosis at times, depression, etc., the ONLY time I ever truly even considered suicide was during the akathisia (acathesia) ordeal I went through, all due to the Abilify.  You don't know what utter hell and torment is until you've gone through the nightmare of akathesia, which for me was completely due to taking Abilify!  If it works for you, great, but be warned...try to stay on the smallest dosage that works for you...upping the dosage over a period of time can have this horrible effect on you too and I wouldn't wish the feeling Abilify caused me on my worst enemy!

2	psychosis, appearantly.	so restless i couldn't stop moving but exhausted at the same time, dizzyness, headaches.	i only lasted a week.  it did nothing to help me.	F	17	1  weeks	3/26/2007
5	BP 1/possible schizoaffective/PTSD	vertigo,(room tumbling end over end) one episode lasted two days, the other lasted one week, other than that no side effects. cannot be certain this medicine was to blame	abilfy helped me come down out of the sky, gave me very crisp feelings and perceptions of reality.  It dimmed out the white noise in my head, and for the very first time i can remember felt no noise in my head, just peacefulness.  Being numb from years of emotional shutdown, i actually had feelings surface for the first time, and had to start sorting through them and dealing with them.  sometimes it was painful at first because the pain was acute, but Id much rather feel now than be numb.  Ativan in combination helps deal with the tremendous anxiety.  Also take seroquel for sleep, and lamictal for the depression.  Overall, a good mix for me.  I would never want to go back to the worst moments of this illness before Dx and treatment, and for that I am grateful.	F	37	17  months	3/25/2007
5	bipolar1/ schizo	Restlessness   Severe at times.  strangeley, tiredness can acompany this or exist independently of it.  I feel agitated but clear headed.  i will accept the trade-off but feel that I must do something about side-effect.  Benzo helps. I forsee weight gain because I am hungry again.	I am only in the first week, but needed to speak of the progress I have made.  At just 5 mgs. I notice a substantial reduction in the chatter in my brain and I am better able to perceive and respond appropriately to social scenes, leaving me less sacred of people.  Paranoia is under control. i have been on several meds in my 20 year struggle with bipolar 1/schizo. disorder.  i am just coming off a psychotic break that lasted very long on and off.  I am what they call a quick responder when a med works for me.  So far wellbutrin (which i still take) Lamictal (which was like a god-send and then pooped-out, and now Abilify has improved drasticaly the picture in just 5 days.  Last night I could concentrate long enough to put a desk from Ikea together and I even cleaned my room.  Now i still have the memories of some terrible behavior and the knowlege of such negative poop-out tendencies of meds.  But for today I am grateful.  More later.  John. R.B. CA.

1	anti pyschotic, not needed	this drug made me walk like a zombie, slur my speech, I couldn't use my hands and fingers - it was like I had a small stroke, I couldn't lay or sit down - relaxing was very unconfortable, very nervous, loss of concentration.	I din't need anti-psychotics and was prescribed and administered them illegally.  I tried geodon, respirdal, and zyprexa too.  The abilify was by far the worst!  I was only taking 15mg., and I still had horrendous side effects!  This is a terribly dangerous drug.  I see no worth in any anti-psychotic or anti-depressant drugs, these drugs really mess with your mind and body. If you are having psychotic, bi-polar, depression, or whatever, and desire to take something.  Only take small dosages of anything, 10mg. or less.  These drugs can cause more harm than the disease!		41	18  days	3/12/2007

3	social anxiety,  ADD	Mood lift, more energy (too much at 1 mg), got very restless, felt calmer around people, woke up earlier with energy, became to restless and had to stop taking Abilify.	I would recommend this to anyone needing an AP. I just got too restless and would lose my train of thought in mid- sentence.  Not for me!  Abilify may work really well with you.  Try it out; you'll know very soon if its for you or not.	M	32	21  days	2/22/2007
1	bi-polar	very tired, headache, pressure above eyes	taking 200 mg lamictal, took 1 mg abilify for one day, just that small amount had a negative effect.  i'm exhausted.  i was told things would go the other way, but i don't like this drug in description or feeling, so i'm not going to take it tomorrow.	F	40	1  days	2/22/2007
3	Non-Specified Psychotic Disorder	My 17 year old has been taking abilify for 3 months.  The sleepiness disrupts his daily functioning terribly.  He leaves school early every day, sleeps several hours and gets about 8-9 hours of sleep every night.  He never feels well rested, but has no problem falling asleep.  He also experiences some muscular discomfort and dehydration.	We are currently weaning off of it.  He would rather deal with his symptoms then the side effects.  Doc has prescribed Luvox..hard to find info on it.  Not sure what we are going to do.  The abilify decreased his symptoms by about 90% on 10 mg. per day.	M	17	3  months	2/13/2007
5	Bipolar 2	weight gain/sweet cravings	Abilify has done wonders for controlling my aggression and irritability.  I am already taking Topamax and I have noticed  a slow weight gain from craving sweets since on Abilify (1.5 years) and Dostinex (3yrs).  I am going to try to give up sugar and junk to see if the weight comes off.  I am also coming off the Dostinex too to see if it is effecting my weight. I really need the Abilify.  I could tell a tremendous difference in my anxiety level when I went from 10mg - 15mg.  I take 15 mg. of Abilify every morning.	F	41	1.5  years	2/7/2007

1	schizoaffective and OCD	terrible shaking, teeth chatter, neck pain, inability to stay in my seat, kept falling asleep, waking up in middle of night, lip quivering, lights bothered my eyes really bad, loud sounds bothered me bad.	I wish it had worked.  It really helped a lot with my illness.  But the side effects were impossible to handle.  I couldn't so much as eat dinner or read a book in any normal sense.  I wanted to just crawl out of my skin.  However, I must add that I take Paxil as well.  However, Paxil has never caused me any problems.my friend (same condition) also takes paxil and abilify.  both of us agreed that once we tried Abilify that mania was brought on.  For the record, Paxil has never done that to either of us until we had Abilify.	M	32	2  weeks	2/4/2007
4	Autism and Tourettes Syndrome	I was on Abilify for about 5 years and then had to go off of it.  I lost a great deal of weight when I went off of it, but my behaviors got worse. I could not think clearly. I recently went back on the Abilify and I have gained a great deal of weight in a very short period of time. Not happy about that.  Also, my appetite has increased slightly, and it makes me extremely tired.	This truly gets rid of tics (from Tourette's) and controls alot of the behaviors from Autism, but the side effects are just awful. There really is no drug out there that works as well, and that is a shame. Wish someone would develop a drug that didn't have so many side effects.	F	15	 	12/24/2006

1	Bipolar I disorder - manic episodes	Severe eye tremors, double vision, hypersomnia, anxiety attacks, muscle weakness, severe depression, cloudy thoughts, hypertension.	Side effects were very severe.  I had to stop Abilify and increase my dosage of Lamictal.  The side effects completely abated after three days except for eye tremors which lasted about a week, hypertension lasted about another two weeks and then just plummet to normal.  Side effects first noticed at 10mg and then instantly severe at 15mg.	M	24	8  weeks	12/18/2006
5	Paranoid schizophrenia	The only side effects I noticed are a weight gain (40 lbs) and a slight case of insomnia (which could be the result of life stresses and not the medication).  The weight gain could be a result of the Risperdal I was taking in combination with the Abilify, not sure,  but stopped the Risperdal to see if I could lose a few pounds and remained stable on just the Ability (Don't tell my doctor). I have stopped gaining weight. I take the maximum dosage too, 30 MG. 	Since I started taking Abilify, I have the impetus to get up and out.  No other medication has had this effect. No delusions, hallucinations, voices or paranoia.  This is a great drug.	F	56	2  years	12/11/2006Email
2	Bipolar 2 hypomania	I cannot bear the side effects this drug has!  I Have no ability to THINK clearly on this med.  I am confused and retarded physically and mentally.  I am on disability, thank God! The only reason I am taking it currently is becasue I have been RX'd large doses of Prednisone )or a physical problem I have)which within 2 days made me totally manic! As fun as feeling hypomanic is, I didn't want to go over the top! So I reluctantly started taking abilify again during the steroidal treatment. I am in the taper down phase now of prednisone and abilify. I am looking forward to being on Trileptal alone again for treating my Bipolar disorder.	Since 1998 I had taken depakote and prozac, but then after gaining 80 lbs, I changed Doctors.  The new P-doc prx'd Abilify. I was unstable and had a lot of mixed states. I became all messed up---retarded, confused, irritable, sleep problems, inability to function in the medical field as a Sr. Veterinary Technician.  I needed meds to make me sleep and needed meds to wake me up...it was TERRIBLE.  My job performance was ridiculous.  The only reason I wasn't fired is that my boss and I had an understanding---and I was very very open about my BP. My Pdoc kept tweaking up the abilify and I got worse and worse. Finally, I decided he was a quack and I slowly tapered off ALL meds.  I became much better!  I was off meds for 18 mos before I cycled again and went back to the pdco to get treatment again.  I was relived he didn't force me to take abilify again until recently while I was taking steroids for another medical problem.  It knocks the heck out of any manic attack!

3	bipolar diagnosis after 25 yr lupus	extreme weight gain combination of depekote and ablilify  and trazadone for sleep severe depression and then slight stroke eight years ago. Lupus flair ups causes pain and not able to sleep i do not think i should have to take ablify medication for all these years, but want to decrease to 15 mg instead of 30 mg.  i went off the drug 18 months ago and ended up anxiety and panic striken and had to go to a week of health care around the clock to get back on medecine and then they added depekote because i was dizzy. during that stay at the help center i evened  out but they added a sleeping pill. I have no desire to do anything and if i let my mind get busy i start a lot of projects that make other family member crazy so it is best for me to  take several naps a day and stay calm. I eat compulsivley with out stopping to think about chewing and walk to the kithen to get a bite of food and would go back often if someone did not remind me not too.I do things in a hurry and shower half heart	has any one taken abilify as long as i have? over 2 years maybe three.and has any one mixed depekote that i have never had a seizure but they think this will control my bipolar actions. I think after my stroke and losing smell for 8 years.I visited a chiropractor last year and got my smell back, made my life a little better.  But i also take plaqenell, generic when my lupus flairs up and i have not had to take it the last three months. but someone said that they take celebrex for their lupus and i have always taken plaqeunell for the last 20 years when i have a flair up and i usually take it for three months untill symptoms subside. but i think when i went off the ablify on my own because of weight gain and being tired all the time is when it was really a bad week.  I was not rational at all and very anxious. enough that i wanted to go to institution and not ever come back home.  Said i would never go off the med again unless under a doctor that understood lupus and i was under 24	F	65	3  days	11/8/2006

Now I have been back on the Abilify for a week and I feel 'normal' again. The main problem that I am experiencing is insomnia at night and lack of energy during the day. Overall, it has really helped to balance my severe depression.	F	29	1  years	10/1/2006

I eat compulsivley with out stopping to think about chewing and walk to the kithen to get a bite of food and would go back often if someone did not remind me not too.I do things in a hurry and shower half heart	has any one taken abilify as long as i have? over 2 years maybe three.and has any one mixed depekote that i have never had a seizure but they think this will control my bipolar actions. I think after my stroke and losing smell for 8 years.I visited a chiropractor last year and got my smell back, made my life a little better.  But i also take plaqenell, generic when my lupus flairs up and i have not had to take it the last three months. but someone said that they take celebrex for their lupus and i have always taken plaqeunell for the last 20 years when i have a flair up and i usually take it for three months untill symptoms subside. but i think when i went off the ablify on my own because of weight gain and being tired all the time is when it was really a bad week.  I was not rational at all and very anxious. enough that i wanted to go to institution and not ever come back home.  Said i would never go off the med again unless under a doctor that understood lupus and i was under 24	F	65	3  days	11/8/2006

5	Tourettes Syndrome	Slight increase in hunger, Tired during the day-yet restless leading to a constant uncomfortable feeling. vomiting about 3 times a day. restlessness is pretty bad	Wow. this drug has cleared my Tourettes 99%!! My tics used to be severe and constant, now they are rare and minor.  I can't believe I finally found the drug. It's worth the side effects for me. I can now get back to being social and enjoy college life.Only downside is if you dont have Insurance it cost about 750 bucks per month.	M	21	30  days	10/11/2006Email
4	severe depression	Insomnia, tiredness	I have been on Abilify in conjunction with Lamictal and Lexapro for severe depression for a little over a year. Recently, I went off the Abilify for two weeks in an effort to decrease my medication (under my Psychiatrist's supervision, because I want to get pregnant) and immediately became depressed and suicidal. Now I have been back on the Abilify for a week and I feel 'normal' again. The main problem that I am experiencing is insomnia at night and lack of energy during the day. Overall, it has really helped to balance my severe depression.	F	29	1  years	10/1/2006

5	Paranoid Schizophrenia	None what so ever.	A great medication for me, reduced the visual halusinations by 100% and less voices too. Recommended!	M		6  months	9/11/2006
1	Bipolar II (very mild)	Made me agitated while taking it. But worse was that anxiety became overwhelming when I got off of it. I stayed off for a month, but anxiety never got better. I really hate this drug.		M	41	90  days	8/29/2006

				F M	 	 	    
1	schizoaffective and OCD	terrible shaking, teeth chatter, neck pain, inability to stay in my seat, kept falling asleep, waking up in middle of night, lip quivering, lights bothered my eyes really bad, loud sounds bothered me bad.	I wish it had worked.  It really helped a lot with my illness.  But the side effects were impossible to handle.  I couldn't so much as eat dinner or read a book in any normal sense.  I wanted to just crawl out of my skin.  However, I must add that I take Paxil as well.  However, Paxil has never caused me any problems.my friend (same condition) also takes paxil and abilify.  both of us agreed that once we tried Abilify that mania was brought on.  For the record, Paxil has never done that to either of us until we had Abilify.	M	32	2  weeks	2/4/2007
4	Autism and Tourettes Syndrome	I was on Abilify for about 5 years and then had to go off of it.  I lost a great deal of weight when I went off of it, but my behaviors got worse. I could not think clearly. I recently went back on the Abilify and I have gained a great deal of weight in a very short period of time. Not happy about that.  Also, my appetite has increased slightly, and it makes me extremely tired.	This truly gets rid of tics (from Tourette's) and controls alot of the behaviors from Autism, but the side effects are just awful. There really is no drug out there that works as well, and that is a shame. Wish someone would develop a drug that didn't have so many side effects.	F	15	 	12/24/2006
5	Bipolar I Disorder	None whatsoever.	Silenced the voices, no more paranoia,able to think clearly, able to SLEEP, no weight gain here.No drowsiness as experienced with Seroquel.	F	42	4  months	12/23/2006
1	Bipolar I disorder - manic episodes	Severe eye tremors, double vision, hypersomnia, anxiety attacks, muscle weakness, severe depression, cloudy thoughts, hypertension.	Side effects were very severe.  I had to stop Abilify and increase my dosage of Lamictal.  The side effects completely abated after three days except for eye tremors which lasted about a week, hypertension lasted about another two weeks and then just plummet to normal.  Side effects first noticed at 10mg and then instantly severe at 15mg.	M	24	8  weeks	12/18/2006
5	Paranoid schizophrenia	The only side effects I noticed are a weight gain (40 lbs) and a slight case of insomnia (which could be the result of life stresses and not the medication).  The weight gain could be a result of the Risperdal I was taking in combination with the Abilify, not sure,  but stopped the Risperdal to see if I could lose a few pounds and remained stable on just the Ability (Don't tell my doctor). I have stopped gaining weight. I take the maximum dosage too, 30 MG. 	Since I started taking Abilify, I have the impetus to get up and out.  No other medication has had this effect. No delusions, hallucinations, voices or paranoia.  This is a great drug.	F	56	2  years	12/11/2006Email
2	Bipolar 2 hypomania	I cannot bear the side effects this drug has!  I Have no ability to THINK clearly on this med.  I am confused and retarded physically and mentally.  I am on disability, thank God! The only reason I am taking it currently is becasue I have been RX'd large doses of Prednisone )or a physical problem I have)which within 2 days made me totally manic! As fun as feeling hypomanic is, I didn't want to go over the top! So I reluctantly started taking abilify again during the steroidal treatment. I am in the taper down phase now of prednisone and abilify. I am looking forward to being on Trileptal alone again for treating my Bipolar disorder.	Since 1998 I had taken depakote and prozac, but then after gaining 80 lbs, I changed Doctors.  The new P-doc prx'd Abilify. I was unstable and had a lot of mixed states. I became all messed up---retarded, confused, irritable, sleep problems, inability to function in the medical field as a Sr. Veterinary Technician.  I needed meds to make me sleep and needed meds to wake me up...it was TERRIBLE.  My job performance was ridiculous.  The only reason I wasn't fired is that my boss and I had an understanding---and I was very very open about my BP. My Pdoc kept tweaking up the abilify and I got worse and worse. Finally, I decided he was a quack and I slowly tapered off ALL meds.  I became much better!  I was off meds for 18 mos before I cycled again and went back to the pdco to get treatment again.  I was relived he didn't force me to take abilify again until recently while I was taking steroids for another medical problem.  It knocks the heck out of any manic attack!  That is the one thing	F	42	6  months	12/10/2006
1	Bipolar Disorder II	Literally, I could not pee !  This drug was proscribed to "boost" the effects of other antidepressants, but did nothing at all aside from aggravate me.	Never would I take this medication again.....although, I have been told that I am like 1% of the 1% that have been recorded with this particular side effect.	M	38	1  months	11/13/2006
