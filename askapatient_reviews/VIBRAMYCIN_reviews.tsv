1	STI-Urethritis	For the particular condition that I was prescribed,(Urethritis), the antibiotic was totally exacerbating. I took it three times for the condition until I finally realized what it was doing as the third time the rash that was a result of the Doxycyline was bodily(Erythema Multiforme-Minor). The rash is caustic and excruciating(unbearable) and massive amounts of Intensive Therapy Cream were mollifying.	I understand now that the rash occurred as the doxycycline is supposed to be used in conjunction with another antibiotic. I found out I was supposed to be using it with the metronidazole for the Urethritis. Three years later I'm still trying to find a doctor to prescribe me a course to eradicate the bacteria which now completely diseases me. I have Balanitis, Uveitis, Generalized Erythema that is Edematous, and a Subluxated T10 or T11. I also almost ruptured a tendon a few years ago. My teeth are pretty well eaten away at the gum line. I persist on cran-max, vitamins/supplements, and have to use joint support.	M	38	7  days100mg 2X D	1/27/2013Email

1	STREP INFECTION	Horrible Psychosis and Nyrological effects that maifested back and forth from pain to pyschotic esposidoes that lasted for hours that then would subside, and give way to massive headaches and stomach pains.  Also expeineced hallucinations and Detoxifacation "Hex" Reaction was like a hell trip worst substance that I ever put in my body!  Even Days After AntiBiotics was Gone Vibramycin would return at same time of the day that I had been taking it; even though I hadn't taken it, like it had memory recall on my psychosis, and it would take control of me like the Matrik SCARRY STUFF!!

4	acne	awful nausea, vomiting	Has somewhat cleared up my skin in combination with three topical lotions i am using...however, if i don't take it as it was prescribed, i will get the breakouts. as far as the nausea and vomiting, they were awful. doctor told me to take it with food, although the directions from the meds itself said not to take it with food...but since taking it with food, i don't feel the nausea.

1	eye sty	felt like someone shot me in the belly with a 357 - very excruciating stomach pain	I will never take it again - doctor warned me but I thought I would try it. I would rather cut the sty out than take this medicine.	M	70	20  days100 mg 1X D	1/3/2011
3	lyme disease	nausea, dizziness, headaches	I was switched from Biaxin to Doxcycline, as the Biaxin caused me to have terrible insomnia for two months.  Doxcycline helped me to sleep, but made me extremely dizzy, especially in the morning.	F	29	2  weeks100mg 2X D	11/11/2010
2	UTI	Euphoria, 'swelling of the head' (head felt swollen), weakness/fatigue	I took Doxycycline for a suspected UTI. I will not take it again. I did not experience nausea or sunlight sensitivity, but I did experience psychiatric effects (mostly euphoria) which was a bit strange, and my head constantly felt swollen / my blood felt like molasses. I also had a general feeling of being 'sick' that didn't wear off until I the medication was stopped.	M	27	14  days? 1X D	7/12/2010
2	UTI	EXTREME SUN SENSITIVITY!!!  I went to the beach for the 4th of July while on this medicine---BIG MISTAKE. I hardly ever burn, but used lots of sunblock just to make sure my holiday wasn't ruined. The medicine made me so sun-sensitive that I got severely sunburned, even though I used sunblock and kept reapplying. The sunburn was exaggerated so much that even areas that were not visibly pink burned as if they were blistered whenever they came in contact with warm water, other skin, or anything else warm. I was also nauseous and even though the label says not to take the medicine with food, I had to. I had to keep snacking while on this medicine and could not take it before lying down because it severly irritated my stomach and throat.  I hope I never have to take this medicine again.

1	celulitis	Terrible heachache and fatigue, and dizziness,within a little while of taking it,couldnt wait to stop.	It is very powerful and effective antibiotic, but I would look into something else first.	F	62	8  days100 1X D	6/22/2010
2	outer ear infection	vertigo, vomiting	On the second day, at midday, I started to feel sick and dizzy. Luckily it was Saturday and I was at home. I lay down and it got worse. Every time I opened my eyes or moved my head the room started to spin wildly around. Then I felt very sick and I had to rush to the toilet. I kept vomiting for several hours until nothing but acid would come out but the need to vomit and the horrible vertigo would not go away, I was nearly unconscious because of the violent vomiting reflex going on and on. Only at midnight I started to feel better. I had never before prescribed tetracyclines and after this I shall never give them a second chance.	F	46	2  days	9/19/2009
5	lyme disease	migraines, light and sound sensitivity, fatigue, brain fog	I gave it a 5 - it wasn't the drug causing that, it was a herxheimer reaction caused by the drug killing the lyme.  The doctor never told me that could happen, I had to find it out on my own.  This is a great drug for lyme disease.	F	40	14  days	8/10/2009
5	Uknown Superbug	fatigue, muscle weakness, drenching sweats, nausea.	I have a bug that cant seem to be cured and vibramyacin is the only antibiotic that will send it to a dormant state briefly. I take 100mg daily 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off. While taking the antibiotic I suffer extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, drenching sweats and can be debilitating at times. My stomach bacteria was being killed off by vibramycin and would result in horrific internal pains, nausea  and bleeding. This now is now fixed by taking vibramycin in mornings and with a good bacteria capsule ( Inner Health Plus ) in the evening and now no more pains, bleeding or nausea.	M	48	14  months	3/4/2009
2	Rosacea	Difficulty swallowing, fatigue, headache, lack of appetite, strange taste in mouth, general sense of feeling unwell.		M	57	30  days	1/25/2009
5	most recently for Lyme Disease	Nausea and a tendency to sunburn easily	I have used Doxy many times over the years, most often for sinus infections. It works really well, and I have occasionally stopped the prescription early because I was completely cured in a few days. I did use it full-term for the Lyme Disease. I have minimized nausea by eating a few crackers before taking the medicine. The tendency to become sunburned easily is prevented by wearing long sleeves and a hat.	M	66	28  days	10/9/2008
2	pelvic inflammatory disease	I have been taking it and it hasnt done anything with my pelvic pain but give me more pain in my abdomen in which i wasnt having problems with before taking this medication!	SUCKS!	F	24	10  days	9/30/2008
1	urinary tract infection	Muscle weakness and muscle cramps	After a couple of days of medication, I experienced extreme muscle cramps and extreme muscle weakness while exercising.  The muscle cramps occurred at night and also if I tried to exercise at a high rate.  While exercising I would get extremely tired after a short amount of time and I exercise a lot each week so I am used to it.  But, I have never felt that bad while exercising and I will never take the drug again.	F	51	8  days	7/19/2008Email
4	maxillary sinuses	Bad indigestion, incomplete or gassy movements,slight headacheoccasionally, fatigue and heavy legs especially after anyexurtion.	This is a good, but powerful antibiotic. it knocks out infections pretty quick but it's side effects can be severeon many people. This caused gastritis in me last time but Imon medicine to keep that and reflux in check. I would avoidany more than normal daily activities, this drug will fatigueyou quickly. I was whipped after just some light moving formy girl and I am in ideal shape for my age...Keep hydrated andalso stay out of the sun.	M	31	10  days	3/24/2008
2	Sinus Infection	Severe rash resembling fingernail scratches which appeared and disappeared all over my body.  Intense itching. Really bad indigestion.		F	37	7  days	3/5/2008
2	Eye Infection	Muscle pain, gastroesophageal reflux, lethargy, bloating, increased urination, cramping, nausea, metallic taste in mouth.	Doxy cleared up a nagging eye infection.  However, the side effects are disturbing and quite uncomfortable.  I stopped taking the med several days ago, and the side effects continue to linger.  It's back to Bactrim for me!	M	48	7  days	1/11/2008
1	UTI	Extreme Nausea.	Immediately after taking it (w/in 10-20 mins.) I would feel SO nauseous, I had to eat something, even though it said not to eat 2 hours after taking it. My doctor prescribed this for a recurrent UTI (it was my 2nd antibiotic) and it did not completely clear it and then I got a different type of pain. I would not recommend this for a UTI. It probably works much better for other illnesses.	F	21	7  days	1/11/2008
4	UTI	Very bad nausea.	It says to take on an empty stomach, but I wouldn't- you'll probably throw up if you do.	F	21	7  days	12/26/2007
4	Cellulitis	some muscle stiffness		F	57	8  days	9/22/2007
4	chronic eye infections	It made my skin feel like it was sprinkling rain almost all of the time. I got a terrible sunburn, too. It felt like my hands were too close to a fire. It upset my stomach most of the time, too.		F	42	2  weeks	9/2/2007
1	Treatment of possible Lyme disease	Horrible nausea, itchy/senstive skin, pain while swallowing, now have a rash on my chest.	I will never take this medicine again.  The nausea was almost unbearable, had to eat on an almost regular basis to keep the nausea tolerable.  My skin felt like I was sunburned.  It irritated my esophagus so much it was painful to eat.	F	29	2  weeks	8/21/2007
1	epididymitis	absolute chronic stomach cramps!!	worst antibiotic ive ever had! within 2 days of taking it i had severe stomach cramps so bad i couldnt even move. had to get different drugs to stop the cramping and change antibiotic.	M	20	3  days	5/6/2007
4	Malaria Prevention	Upset stomach and moderate nausea.  Eating usually helped this and it went away after a couple of weeks.	This stuff gets rid of all kinds of bacteria.  During the five months that I took it it got rid of an infected tattoo, my acne breakouts, and I didn't contract malaria which was the main reason I was taking it.  Don't drink milk when you take it though.  It makes the nausea worse.	M	20	5  months	11/4/2006
1	epididymitis	cataracts, rash	wear sunglasses when taking this	M	55	30  days	1/19/2006
2	Ocular rosacea	Nausea !  Then strong hunger pangs.     For the first couple days, I had no side effects at all, whether I took it just with water or with food.  Then the nausea began slowly, and by the 4th day I had to stop taking this.   If I got through the nausea, this caused my stomach to "awaken" and feel empty and hungry.	Hated to stop in the middle of treatment, but even with food this caused a near-vomiting episode, and that was enough !!  This was prescribed for rosacea, and for chronic, asymptomatic eye-redness that has persisted for several months.	F	28	4  days	11/19/2005
4	malaria prophylaxis	mild nausea	A well tolerated prophylactic malaria medication.	M	29	6  weeks	9/5/2005
1	testicular infection	caused severe build up of uric acid in body legs swelled severely chesty cough trouble breathing this was after i finished 10 day course of 100mg twice a day	i would consider carefully before taking these as i have never had any reaction to anti biotics previously but after these i have never felt as ill in my life and i am normally fit.	M	35	10  days	4/9/2005
1	skin infection	Major reaction - heart racing, couldn't breathe, blood pressure dropped, dizziness, feelings of anxiety - after only 2 pills taken	Would be cautious if taking this med - I would NEVER take any cycline again due to this scary reaction	F	27	1  days	3/31/2005
1	lump on my neck	severe headaches,weakness,nausea,stinging tongue and dizzy.	Not sure which is worse. The infection or the drug.	F	47	9  days	8/12/2004
