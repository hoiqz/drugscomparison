5	Cipro 500 tabs	Not any at all	I even take dilantin to and this cipro never caused me any problems at all.... I had a swelling genitle area and it seemed to work fine!!!!! Never bothered my epilepsy at all i only had one small one i can say i have had all the time i was on cipro... I know i only had one seizure and it was a very small one i know when i have them by how i feel afterwards.... Id take it again anytime anyday of the week....	M	38	10  days 2X D	4/28/2012Email
3	UTI/Bladder infection	extreme fatigue, joint pain especially in shoulder, nausea, constipation, light headed, dizziness, popping in lower back, back pain, feeling of hopelessness, depression, and extreme weight gain, cloudy thoughts, I was on cipro and I gained 10 lbs in about a 2 week period of time.	If you are able to deal with the side effects, then I would recommend this drug. I guess the benefits out weigh the side effects and risks.	F	48	10  days 2X D	4/16/2012Email
5	UTI but it also helped another prob	None.	Orginally put on for 3 days.  UTI symptoms improved but infection did not clear.  5 days, 250mg, 2x per day, cleared the UTI AND coicidentally helped a skin rash, elsewhere, that hadn't responded to multiple medications.	F	45	5  days250mg 2X D	3/18/2012
3	Diverticulitis	this is a very scary drug to take, I have had vivid nightmares, aching pains in my joints, extream tiredness, flu like symptoms, madding thoughts of hurting others,acid reflux so bad I could feel it in my sinuses,burning behind the eyes,I hear poping sounds in my color bones,my chest,elbows, back and spine area ect. I am a 39 year old male taking this with Flangyl to fight Diverticulits.	Most of all of this started after comming home from the hospital, I didn't know it was these meds alone that was causeing my proablems because while I was in the hospital I was given these drugs through IV, wasn't allowed to eat or drink by mouth and was given injections of Morphine for the pain. So of corse I was blamming the combo of drugs on what I was dealing with in the Hospital, but once I came home and started the pill form of these drugs I started to feel the full side effects and was thinking I was going to die by day 3. I have fought through the madness because I want to be healed of the pain and have yet to be seen by my regular doctor. I must have drove the on call nurse through my insurance crazy with "am I alright" questions. I am still bothered bby what this drug does to the human mind and body. If you are on this medacation I suggest talking with a Shrink to help pull you through because your doctor will say your just crazy as long as your not running a feaver of 101.5 and not bleeding in your stool. If you are a sufferer and would like to have someone to talk to feel free to e-mail me.	M	39	6  days500 2X D	3/5/2012Email
5	UTI	Absolutely none, except a bit of nausea the first time I took it, which vanished pretty quick.	Not entirely done with my first prescription of Cipro (5 days), but on day 2 I've already noticed much less burning with my UTI. Avoid bactrim and that other one if possible, Cipro is apparently much more effective. Also, disregard the horror stories here unless you have bad medical history. I have a horrible immune system and I feel sick often, and I had NO side-effects aside from the first bit of nausea (I did scarf a meal directly after though, that probably caused it). This antibiotic gets two thumbs up from me, especially since it only cost me $4 without insurance :]I recommend this, highly.	F	18	5  days500mg 2X D	12/28/2011
4	UTI Bladder and kidney infection	unable to sleep at night during the first 3 or 4 days, slight aches in body during first few days, strange headache pain behind one eye experienced during mid week which went away after two painkillers (perheps too much lighting around me that day?) but apart from that this medicine worked for me and overall worth it. I have just finished the whole course of antibiotics and I feel a lot better. A little weary that I may still have a slight kidney infection or maybe a kidney stone. I will give it a couple of days. No problem with urine, drinking at least 3 litres of water for the past 2 weeks, before that upto or at least 2 litres of water a day. Urine is somewhat cloudy. I can tell there are white blood cells because of this. I will wait a few days to see how I feel and pay very close attention to what my body is telling me.	Overall this medicine is very good. This is the second time I have used this antibiotic. First time was when I first got a UTI with all the classic symptoms of a lower UTI/ bladder infection which was 2 years ago. This time I didnt have problem urinating buy my pain was more in the kidney area. I had flank pain. My flank pain is pretty much gone but I only feel 90 percent better. My urine is somewhat cloudy although Im drinking at least 3 litres of water a day and keeping fairly active also a little ache on my left side but almost gone/ on and off. I'm giving it two more days, I should feel 100 percent by them if not Im making a trip to the doctor because even if my uti has completely cleared and its not a kidney stone it would be something else. But I do feel so much better	F	26	7  days500mg 2X D	1/28/2011
4	cUTI (Complicated UTI)	Lethargy, Joint Pains, Palpitations, Constipation, Blurry Vision	Regardless of all its side effects, Cipro has indeed served well in treating UTI. It seems too strong for a medication, or I may just have a very weak immune system to begin  with.	F	21	10  days500 mg 2X D	1/16/2011
5	UTI/INNER EAR INFECTION	STIFF NECK.  A VERY SHORT PERIOD LIKE CRAMPS FOR A FEW MINUTES ON AND OFF	I have taken this more than 3 times, I get UTI often since my daughter was born 16 month ago. And it does work. My ear is 95% feeling better. Yes side effects are scary for all of us, so is driving a car. Get over it. It helps..and have you noticed that the older the woman the worse off they are with this medication..bc i saw a 23 yr old who said she loved it..no problems..im in my mid20s and NEVER had an issue!	F	25	12  days500 2X D	11/29/2010Email
1	UTI	Unusual weight gain and extreme fatigue.  My weight always stays close to 110 lbs, in 1 week I weigh 118.  I was horribly hungry and gained between 5 and 8 lbs.  I had to drop the dosage half way through the week to 1/2 because it was too strong, and then I stopped taking it before the 10 days because my clothes are so tight..this is UNREAL!!!	I HATE THIS MEDICATION =/	F	46	7  days500 mg 2X D	11/28/2010
4	Strep Throat	Tendon pain, nausea, loose bowels, insomnia	Side effects diminished with a week of being on Cipro, began to have significant improvement over the past 2 days in particular. This is the third time I've been on Cipro for an illness. It's the only antibiotic I can take without life threatening side effects and works very well.	F	39	11  days 2X D	10/29/2010Email
4	Food Poisoning	None. Read my comment to the right.	I was very sick for 6 days. Within 2 hours of taking this medication I was no longer sick or in pain and this pill healed me. My goodness everyone wrote horror stories on here. The ONLY side effect I had was I became sleepy. For the overly concerned that does not mean fainting or power sleeping. I mean I felt a bit sleepy for about 20 minutes then it stopped. I felt relaxed and not alarmed at all. It is easy on the stomach. I have a sensitive stomach. I took it with food and drank full bottle of water. I am going on day 3. Dear overly concerned notice your heart is beating faster before even taking the medication. This is because your brain controls your body, just as if someone jumped out and scared you your heart rate rises, which indicates the body and brain relationship. Stop driving yourself insane. I did. BAD. And look. I ended up being sleepy lol. Email me if you need any help. It is to the right of this box.	M	28	5  days500 2X D	9/19/2010Email
1	Possible Strep Throat	Cannot drive car,had to pull over, too much anxiety,Panic.  Feeling profound sadness, suicidal thinking. My normal blood pressure is sky high now. Feet and hands hurt and tingle. Lower back pain, very irritable, jumpy at the slightest noise. A "hangover" feeling and spacy.	Went to doc about it, he told me to stop it immediately. labs show I didn't have Strep throat after all,(took it for nothing)But it may be the reason for the strange lab result showing my hypothyroidism (low) which was always within normal level with the thyroid med, lab test now shows it is Hyperthyroid, which is VERY STRANGE and now there is protein in my urine which means kidney is being damaged, this is puzzling my G.P.and I. And I'm sure it's aggravating the symptoms I'm having, but how long will this go on?? They've reduced my thyroid meds now hoping that will go back to normal, I've been off the Ciprofloxacin 500mg for 7 days. Still it feels as though I'm getting worse, not better. It's a shame this med can cause this since it can really help knock out an infection. But, this is the end for me using this med from now on. I also use the ear drops for chronic ear problems, but have now gone back to the old fashioned one. My suggestion to anyone that is prescribed this, start out with a very small dosage for a few days and see how it works for you. You may be glad you did that, you wouldn't want to be feeling what me and others I've read on here are or have gone through with this med.	F	52	5  days250mg 2X D	2/11/2010
1	UTI	Numb from hips down to toes in both legs.  Muscle spasms, naseau and dry heaves.	Writing this in regards to my mother.  She was just prescribed this for a UTI.  She's taken 7 pills and is not able to walk.  Have contacted local emergency rooms and they are referring us to speak with our local pharmacist.  She is stopping this immdediately.  I'm praying to God that her side effects will stop.  She is currently being treated for Colorectal cancer and doesn't need anything else to worry about.  Please do not take this medicine.  I wish I would have known about this before she went on it!	F	60	4  days	1/9/2010Email
5	Kidney and UTI infection	None	Was having quite a bit of pain in my kidney area lower back, about 12 hours after the first dose, I started feeling so much better. The kidney pain was gone and the burning in my pelvic area reduced. I was feeling really ill before the first dose with fatigue, chills, head fogginess, no appetite and all of those symptoms resolved withing the first 24 hours. It's a wonderful miracle drug for me!	F	37	7  days	11/17/2009
3	UTI	Had very rapid heartbeat on 500 mg.   Prescription was changed to 250 mg.  Worked quickly to reduce symptoms of the UTI but was very anxious and exhausted most of the time.  Also have had joint pain in hands, neck and legs.  Did help with the UTI however.		F	65	 	11/2/2009
5	UTI	None	This stuff is sooooooo much better than bactrim. I can't believe they prescribed me that crap. Thank you, cipro. You aren't a monster drug like the sulfa drug that sent me to the ER. I had an allergic reaction to it, switched to this and feel so much better :)	F	19	2  days	9/20/2009
1	UTI	I also want to add I started having anxiety while driving. I came home instead. This drug is way too powerful.		F	50	3  days	8/25/2009
4	UTI	On Day 3 of 5-day cycle and only side effect has been noticeable fatigue.  Fatigue hasn't been so bad that I can't safely operate a vehicle, but I do nap/sleep with ease and don't have a lot of energy.  But feeling tired is certainly better than the UTI symptoms, which have improved significantly.		F	45	3  days	8/11/2009
5	bladder infection/uti	Made me very sleepy which was ok because I was exhausted from the infection, got the best sleep at night I have had in a long time!		F	49	7  days	8/10/2009
3	Bladder Infection	Dopey Daze AND would not recommend driving a car.Knocks me out.Makes me depressed no appitite.Really affects the stomach andconstipates me  I can't tell you how it blocks you up inside.	Though I would walk on hot rocks instead of having the bladderinfection.So for me its a catch 22.This all start after 40 and rarely am I sexually because of my issues with my friggen bladder.	F	50	10  days	7/16/2009Email
1	klabsiella	off balance, developed vertigo,  feel my head hollow.. im am due for an mri and a neurologist in one week	500mg table  for 24 dys.  i have never been the same,  be carefull with this antibiotic. Im even concern about my side effects	F	35	24  days	6/30/2009
5	otiis externa	None, but I did have more lucid dreams.	Most of the comments here are from people who did not take this preparation (they are confusing it with Cipro tablets) so should be discounted (though their experiences with the systemic use of Cipro tablets may be valid). This is a topical eardrop preparation of ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone for external ear infections and is a godsend for divers and surfers.	M	56	5  days	3/19/2009
3	UTI and Kidney infection	CRAZINESS! I lost my mind, I thoght about mass murder, killing people, my head was gone! I took a total of 34 pills . 2 pills a day for 16.5 days.  I WILL NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE EVER again. IT DID help with the infection but damn , the side effects are insane. If your infected you will feel relief in a day or 2, atleast I did.. but the tiredness and absolutely NO energy level is still with me. My Main side effects were thisVERY tired (and I have a hyper thyroid)somewhat nausiated, never vomited from it though. Very decreased appetite and increased indigestion. Very mentaly disturbed and hopeless feeling about 3 days into the run. If you start to feel crazy, literaly, its probly just the cipro. The madness in my mind has gone away but my stomach still hurts.	Knowing what I know now, after researching this some what, I am not a doctor at all..... I wouldnt take this again and I would askfor somthing that "seems" safer from what I have read but like I said I am not a doc or a pharmacist...Id ask for keflex. Never cipro. The US military has stock piles of cypro because it kills ANTHRAX. now that is some strong stuff. I just had a UTI and kidney infection....not anthrax. They also use this to help fight the HIV virus. Im greatful that I feel better but am worried of these side effects after the fact. I read where, if you take it for 3-4 days, youll neeed a day or 2 of rest afterword. if you take it for a week, thats 2 days of rest 2 weeks is 3 days 3 weeks is 4 days and so on. I learned this from a body building site where these idiots were using steroids, injecting them and then using cipro to fight the injection site infection WHILE WORKING OUT. can we say STOOOOOPID?	M	35	17  days	3/13/2009
2	UTI	extreme tiredness after 3 doses; couldn't get out of bed to do anything for entire day. stopped taking and fine the next day	Symptoms of UTI abated quickly, but lethargy made it impossible to funciton. After researching I saw "black box" designation.  There was nothing about this with my script.  Called doctor and they wanted me to restart but I said no.  Switched me to Macrobid.  We'll see.	F	50	1.5  days	2/6/2009
5	Severe UTI	No side effects, just lots of relief!	I am so happy to finally be relieved of such severe pain.  Have suffered from bladder infections off and on for over 20 years.  This is a miracle drug for me!  I'm allergic to other medicines, but this one seems to really do the trick, works extremely fast, and gives me no side effects whatsoever.	F	56	10  days	7/11/2008
1	UTI, Prostatitis	Severe nausea with very slow digestion, fatigue, dizziness, foggy thinking, stomach pain.	Back in 1990, I was diagnosed with gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying with nausea and vomiting of undigested food) after taking Cipro for weeks for Prostatitis. I have suffered with these symptoms with some improvement along with food allergies and severe spinal degradation since I first took Cipro. I never made the connection until recently when I again took Cipro for two weeks for a UTI. The same gastrointestinal symptoms returned and I immediately stopped taking the medication. I will warn anyone who reads this that these gastrointestinal symptoms from Cipro can be permanent as they are in my case. I also believe that Cipro may permanently effect the production of stomach acid. Acid blocking drugs(Nexium)also cause my digestive symptoms to get worse. I use probiotics, betaine HCL and licorice to control my digestive symptoms. Weak solutions of vinegar or lemon juice sipped at mealtime also can help. If a weak solution of vinegar (2 tsp/4 oz.) eliminates your "heartburn"	M	50	2  weeks	6/11/2008Email
5	UTI, vaginal infection	None.	I have taken Cipro twice: Once it was for a UTI.  Another time it was for a bacterial vaginal infection (I had excessive discharge).  In both cases, it worked FAST.  I felt relief from the Cipro in almost 24 hours.  The Cipro was prescribed for me when Macrobid did not work.  I thought it was a great drug.  Sorry I don't remember the dosages, since it was about 3 years ago.	F	46	1  weeks	5/24/2008
1	UTI	Anxiety, burning of the lining of the digestive tract, stifness and joint pain, loss of ability to think clearly, spaciness, and food allergies, insomnia, depression	Really nasty stuff - do not take if possible. I took Cipro 12 years ago for an UTI. It cleared up the UTI within 10 days. However, I immediately lost the ability to digest food properly because this drug dilapidated my digestive tract: leaky gut syndrome, allergies to nearly all foods and having to live in constant pain and severe digestive distress are a few permanent side effect of this drug. Cipro caused such an imbalance in my system that I ended up having a hysterectomy, malfunctioning thyroid, joint pain, and severe weight gain right after I took this drug. Before I took Cipro I was very healthy and thin. Naturopathic care has helped with the joint pain and thyroid issues but the digestive issues are permanent. I am blown away there are posts on this site that claim to have had no side effects from this drug.	F	48	10  days	4/13/2008
5	UTI	I didn't experience any side affects, just relief.	Worked very well for me.	F	23	3  months	3/17/2008
1	uti	suxs suxs suxs suxs	and it suxs	F	37	3  days	1/24/2008
1	ear infection-swollen canals	was given cipro drops along with ambicillian. Put the cipro drops in  my ear canals  once and experienced a searing burning sensation. Ears were very sore, so assumed the pain was from the ears. Took the drops once more and realized the pain was from the drops- felt like my ear canals were on fire.Still extremely painful- will not use these drops again.		F	52	2  days	12/17/2007
5	UTI	None.	Worked very well for me. Effective, immediate.	F	21	3  days	11/15/2007
5	UTI	Euphoria	Worked great. Felt releif from UTI within 24 hours	F	39	1  weeks	10/18/2007
5	UTI	No side effects	I have had recurrent bladder infections my entire life.  Cipro has cleared the problems without side effects each time, and I have found it to be the best antibiotic for me.  I had a horrible reaction to Bactrim, another commonly prescribed UTI antibiotic, and I would recommend this drug first for UTIs.	F	33	9  times	8/23/2007
5	Cronic UTI's from Fibroid	The side effects were that I felt a bit weird and nervous.  The feelings end 24hrs after taking the medication.	This stuff really works on UTI's immediately.  Do not take it with Dairy.  For me, this is one of the few anti-biotics that don't make me feel like pulling an "OJ Simpson" on everyone.	F	38	7  days	7/29/2007Email
1	antibiotic	way too strong - even after 1/2 doses - it burned my stomach lining -  feels like an ulcer - have been suffering for 3 months.	don't take it	F	60	9  days	7/8/2007
4	UTI	I have taken this drug before and I become tired, lethargic, foggy-headed (at first) but nothing as severe as what other people report.	This is the only antibiotic that has helped cure UTIs when I get them - I ended up in the hospital about 8 months ago when another antibiotic I was given failed to work. I was then given Cipro and that eventually cleared it all up.	F	27	2  days	7/3/2007Email
1	bite from a cat	Terrible for me, took 2 cipros & 1 Levaquin and have been sick for 2 weeks. Nausea,cramps, burning stomache, lite headed, dizzy, heartburn, dehydrated. now have muscle pains and twitchingbeen to ER and 3 DR.s, no help. How long will this last? Haven't worked in 2 weeks. Don't know how much more I can take.		F	44	2  days	5/21/2007Email
4	UTI	Exhausted, not functioning.  Neck, shoulder and leg pain. I recently had had a fall so did not relate the aches until reading this page. I'm thankful to those who have written.  Loss of appetite, chilled, very tired, lethargic, sad.	Gee, I hope it cures my UTI....have had quick relief.	F	44	2  days	9/28/2006
1	diverticulitis	During the summer of 2005, I developed a severe case of diverculitis and was rushed to the ER.  Due to the severity of the pain, I was given cipro and have had permanent pain in my joints since that time.  My hands are so painful and stiff most of the time that I can barely use them. I am really sorry to discover that the joint pain may be a side effect of the drug that was intended to help me.	The nature of my job is such that I need the use of my hands.  I am in pain most of the time and have great difficulty performing my job, household chores, and very basic tasks using my hands.	F	48	1  days	2/20/2006Email
