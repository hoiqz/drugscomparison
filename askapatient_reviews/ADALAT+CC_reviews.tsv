1	High blood pressure	Immediate flushing, rapid  heart rate, anxiety and excruciating headache. They gave me one does in the hospital and side affects appeared within minutes.		F	25	1  days	1/12/2013
2	Renovascular Hypertension	Daily headache, flushing, fatigue, rapid heartbeat 100-130	It lowers my blood pressure but the side effects are almost unbearable. I work 12 hrs shifts and I can barely make it home when I am done.	F	24	3  days30MG 1X D	8/10/2012
2	high blood pressure	It worked well for reducing my blood pressure.I started with 90 mg per day, went to 60, then later to 30, the lowest dose available. You can't cut it in half because it is slow-release. My blood pressure gradually went very low even with that.When I skipped it one day, I found I felt 100% better in energy. I felt like I had just stopped walking underwater. The doctor was ambivalent about it, so I took it off and on for a while. Finally I got a flushing reaction so I quit it altogether.After that my blood pressure stayed in a normal low range so I haven't needed any medicine for a few years. Why? I have no idea.	Don't cut a slow-release pill or you will get a large dose all at once.	M	76	8  years30 mg 1X D	2/19/2011Email

5	Rynauds disease	Light headedness, tiredness, low blood pressure, warmth all aroundAfter taking the medication for approx. a week or 2 the light headeness and the fatique does go away.	I was taking Adalat and Adalat XL to help control my Rhynaud Disease, I found that the XL dosage worked alot more evenly compared to the 5mg dose of Adalat that the symptoms came on quite quickly.  I do have both meds. on hand though:  The XL for daily use and if I am having a severe attack then the 5mg dose.The XL doseage just came on the market a few years back so I was taking the regualar Adalat since I was 11 years	F	39	28  years	7/9/2007Email
