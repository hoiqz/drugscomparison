1	schizophrenia	Extreme edema in my extremities, lethargy AND insomnia, akathisia in my legs, fidgeting	I'm still taking it, but I don't like it much.  It's the fifth anti-psychotic the dr. has tried me on, and none of them have been very tolerable.  (The akathisia does me in) I hate the side effects so much I stop taking it constantly, start to get ill, start taking it again, etc.	F	38	45  days16mg 1X D	8/29/2011
