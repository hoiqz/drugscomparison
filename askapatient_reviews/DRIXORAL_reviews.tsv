5	prescribed for allergies in 1970's	sleepiness when first starting to take med	It was the only medicine I have taken for my allergies which was effective for all of my symptoms:runny nose,sneezing,itching eyes and nose,sinus headache=miserable.It was a RX, then over the counter, then generic and cheap for a while, then ..ask pharmacy for it behind the counter. Now off the market.  I am still looking for something else that will work :(  Allergies are back and I'm miserable again. An eyedrop called Patenol which is a Prescription works well for the itchy eyes.	F	59	30  years	8/24/2009
