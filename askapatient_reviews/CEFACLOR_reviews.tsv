5	severe bronchitis	None.  No diarrhoea.  Well tolerated.	Severe chest infection that didn't respond to amoxicillin, erythromycin or zithromax (z-pak), given in that order.  Infection lasted several weeks.  Finally doc gave me cefaclor, after 6-7 days huge improvement, which carried on improving for a few days after I finished the course.  Completely cleared the infection.  Very effective drug.  Doc told me they prefer to keep it in reserve for difficult infections to avoid bugs developing resistance, if I get another infection they will want to try amoxicillin first before using this again.

3	Staph infection	Serum Sickness	The first time I took a week of this med it worked great, with no side effects. But a few months later I took a second script of it and broke out in a violent rash of itching, maddening hives. I had to get injections of antihistamines to stop me from scratching my skin off!

3	Sinus Infection	Tiredness, felt less energy. Hard to perform cardiovascular activities because muscles lacked strength while on Cefaclor.	Sinus infection returned and am now starting on it again for a longer period.	M	45	12  days	1/1/2005
