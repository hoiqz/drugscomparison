1	Stroke	In hospital severe headaches, which went away.  Now severe tinnitus.  I would rather die than have this rushing in my head.  I can't take it anymore.  I have gone to an audiologist, neurologist, accupuncturist.  No one can stop it and it never started until I started this medication.		F	74	200  days 2X D	6/14/2012Email
2	Post stroke	The headaches for me were horrible. I was not supposed to take Excedrin any more with it, but I actually sent my son out from the hospital to buy me some. I felt like my head was going to explode. Maybe it goes away after several days, but I could not live with it. Went back on full dose of Plavix( that I was on for a MI 2 years ago) Works fine for me and the results of studies I looked at showed fewer hemmorhagic strokes with Plavix.	My neuro tried to tell me that this was a better drug than Plavix for stroke patients. I think he must have been reading what the drug reps gave him, because my search on the internet showed the opposite along with a higher rate of hemmorhagic stroke with Aggrenox. Great, no clots, but my brain explodes. Thanks but no thanks.	F	60	3  days150 2X D	10/14/2011Email
5	TIA	None	I haven't had anymore TIAs - I guess that's good	M	55	2  years 2X D	3/29/2010
2	Aggrenox	Dizziness,tintinnitus,effected vision ,hearing,taste, confusion, other use of different drugs, extreme coldness on side of hemi-paresis, nausea briefly, tiredness	Am going to stop using this drug but don't know how. The sudden discontinuance can cause seisure and death.  I have taken it along with Bacolfen. Metformin, and Lipitor over the past year and had another stroke and various hosiptalizations- not good.  As soon as I know how, I am going to stop this medication.	F	61	1  years	1/2/2010Email
1	Vertebral artery dissection/strokes	Rash upper chest and back, intense itching, especially at night.Two separate biopsies confirmed hive like rash due to drug reaction	Also had taken Lipitor.  Discontinued Lipitor but rash continued.  It is still possible the rash could be due to LipitorI'm posting now in case others get this rash.  Apparently it is not rare!  Would be interested in email if anyone has gotten rash.	M	83	3  years	12/18/2009Email
