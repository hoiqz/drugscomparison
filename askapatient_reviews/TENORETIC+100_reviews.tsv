1	High Blood Pressure	I give this a qualified "1", because others may not have the same reaction as I did, as an asthmatic. Rendered Albuterol inhaler useless.	I immediately went into distress from the very first dose. I was sucking on my inhaler every 15 minutes. Did a Google search on Atenolol and there it was in bold letters: Do Not Use This Medication If You Are Using Albuterol!?!?!? (paraphrased). Stopped taking Atenolol and the problem went away. Go figure...	M	58	1  days	4/18/2008
