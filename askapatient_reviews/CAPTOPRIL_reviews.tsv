5	Orthostatic Hypertension	Im hypersensitive to all meds and let me tell u, this one is great.......First days, slight dizziness, minor upset stomach, fast heart rate, headache, all minor compared to all the other meds......taste like rotten boiled eggs..	I take 12.5 mg every 4 to 6 hrs to control secondary hypertension, I take it with clonidine, 2 to 3 mg a day, and  3mg of ativan. First numbers use to always be in the 170 to 220 range, this knocked it right out, bottom number from 130+ down to 110 to 60's, only drug that has worked and with little to no side effects, no weight gain, actually starting to loose weight	M	38	60  days	6/13/2008Email
1	High blood pressure, kidneys	Had a severe allergic reaction, itching rash that moved from my chest to my entire front side of my body. This went on for two weeks and the Dr's. said it will go away. Do you think they could stand two weeks of this? The itching was like being bitten my misquotes from my neck to my feet. A back ache that felt like I had been beaten by a mugger, that started at my mid back and radiated to the left and cramped my muscle up so bad that it hurt to just breath. Sweating, wheezing, coughing, wee.	This drug was to promote longer life to kidneys for diabetics.The side effects are not worth the longevity of kidneys that you don't know if they will even fail. Nothing is worth this misery. Dont take this drug it is pure poison.	F	47	15  days	2/19/2007
