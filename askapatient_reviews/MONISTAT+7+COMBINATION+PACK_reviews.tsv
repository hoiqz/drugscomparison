2	yeast infection	I'm very sensitive in this area. Anyway, I got a yeast infection and tried both the 3 day and 7 day Monistat...Horrible burning and itching for HOURS! I finally went to the doctor after I started to swell so badly down there and my doctor said I was probably alergic and to call her for now on so I can take the Diflucan pill. The Diflucan pill works like magic, gone in one day and NO PAIN! I LOVE IT! HATE MONISTAT!!!!!!!	The Diflucan pill works like magic, gone in one day and NO PAIN! I LOVE IT! HATE MONISTAT!!!!!!!
