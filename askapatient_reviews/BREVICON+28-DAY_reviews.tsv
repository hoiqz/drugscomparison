3	birth control	Swelling of breasts and tenderness, weight gain, blurry vision, spotting in the third week	Have only been on it for two months and just started third month.  Vision problems are making me consider getting off of it.  Outside of these side effects, this pill is okay for me compared to others.	F	24	2  months	6/27/2008
5	Birth Control & Hormones	Intially had nausea from it.  Had to take the pill at night so as to sleep through the nausea.  Weight gain.	Had severe periods, anemia and PMS.  My family (and I) were happy that I went on it.  Felt like a new person with lighter periods and hence more energy.  Helped with the mood swings.  Still on it as a mild estrogen therapy.
