5	OCD	Dry Mouth		F	41	 275 1X D	1/8/2013EmailHistory
1	OCD-DEPRESSION-PANIC ATTACKS	Hallucinations ( visual-auditory and tactile ), insomnia, extreme hot flashes and sweating,very dry mouth, weight gain.	After taking Anafranil for only 4 days, I immediately noticed that my depression was getting better, but my OCD got a lot worse and Icouldn't sleep. I would see shadows running on the floor like rats, seeing people that had twisted bodies, dogs etc...hearing people talking about me saying that I had to slap people and if I didn't do it, they would bite me or scratch me. I basically developed all the symptoms of schizophrenia. I didn't do anything right away because I just thought it was real and accepted it. Then people at work noticed and told me that I was staring at things and talking alone. I called my psychiatrist and he immidiately discontinued the treatment, even if it helped my depression. I am now taking Effexor XR 75 mg/day and it is working great !	M	32	2  months75 MG 1X D	9/20/2012Email
3	ocd	constipation , bloating,muscle pains,breast enlargment,diffuculy urination,fatigueand in high doses dry mouth and excessive sweating	to me it doesnt work in high doses and made ocd symptoms more severe be careful with the dose very low doses may benifit you and higher make ocd severe.talk with your doctor.i used to take it in 150 mg but after many years i take fluoxetine and low doses of anafranil.	M	30	10  years18,75 mg 1X D	7/20/2012Email
4	OCD/Anxiety	Dry Mouth, Difficulty Urinating,Body pain (went away after the first couple months) However exhaustion increased over time along with chest pain/pressure and blood pressure problems.	The most effective drug I've ever taken. My OCD felt under control for the first time in 10 years; I felt stable and happy. The side effects were unpleasant but I was willing to undergo anything. However by month 6 I was so exhausted and my heart was so stressed I had to discontinue the meds. Very strong chemical. By day 3 off Anafranil I am back to my old mental state, no control.	F	21	6  months50MG 1X D	7/3/2012
2	Trichotillomania/OCD	dry mouth, spasmodic motions of neck head and hands, orgasmic yawning, extreme weight loss (16 pounds)	Anafranil has not worked for me at all. I still pull everyday. As far as side effects, I'm also taking several other medications for ADD/ADHD, so they might not all be valid. However, the spasmodic movements were definitely a result of anafranil; and the movements are SO annoying. I highly recommend not taking it, however everybodys body chemistry is different	F	15	6  weeks50 mg 1X D	5/16/2012
5	OCD, Depression	Dry mouth, constipation		F	60	10  years100mg ?	3/6/2012
2	OCD	I was started on 50MG and was supposed to titrate up to 150MG by week 3. I am still on the 50MG because these side effects wont go away. 	Reduced mental focus 	Confusion	Zoned out or auto pilot feeling	Lack of visual focus especially in far sighted vision	Dizziness	Increased forgetfulness	Reduced limb sensibility especially in hands	Reduced sex drive	Inability to get or maintain erection	Unable to ejaculate	Although I did get the results listed below I would not recommend this drug.	Reduced Irritability	Slight ability to control obsessive or fearful thoughts during compulsive behavior.	Slight ability to control minor compulsive behaviors.	M	26	17  days50MG 1X D	2/21/2012Email
5	Severe Depression and Anxiety	Dry mouth, constipation, nightmares, sweating, muscle pain, yawing, fatigue, hypersomnolence	A miracle drug for depression and anxiety when 8 other antidepressants failed.	F	42	9  months100mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
4	Depression, anxiety	Acid reflux, hard to orgasm, severe sweating (head only), tiredness	Clomipramine (as it's called here in the UK) has really helped me. It has made me the person I want to be and really helped me face life again. I found I was suffering more acid reflux after taking them so I started to take them at lunchtime with food. The sweating is a problem but not a 'deal breaker' and I take much, much longer to orgasm and when I do it feels somehow different (not bad, just different) so I see why these are prescribed for premature ejaculation.The side effects are OK and I would strongly recommend this medication	M	39	8  months100mg 1X D	9/26/2011Email
4	OCD	Lethargic, Nauseous	I'm already feeling a great effect, even though it hasn't even reached full strength in my body yet. The only bad thing is that I'm very drowsy, and I can't aim a ball as well as I could before.	M	14	17  days25mg 1X D	7/5/2011
5	OCD	Dry mouth, weight gain, excessive sweating (head), harder to orgasm	I was diagnosed with OCD at 13 - hand washing, checking, intrusive thoughts. This drug made my OCD completely disappear. Yes the side effects are not great, but they are not the end of the world. When I had OCD I could not function normally at all, all my time was taken up with my obsessions, I can function normally with these side effects. I have tried coming off the drug many times in the last 13 years but when I do, I get very emotional and depressed and my intrusive thoughts come back. I would recommend this drug to anyone with OCD, the dull headaches and tiredness do go with time, just keep taking it regularly and they will disappear. The side effects I have sited above, however do not seem to disappear.	F	26	13  years75mg 1X D	6/25/2011
2	Anxiety	Awful. It reduced to a degree my anxiety, but also reduced any motivation I had. Had very painful abdominal reflux ( pain 9/10), which pain killers reduced to 7/10, hot burning stomach acid, burping and trapped wind. Belly felt solid like SEVERE colic. Due to long half life, endured this for two days!	I would not try this drug again. If I had to I would only take 10mg and stock up with lots of pain relief and antacids.	F	50	1  days25mg 1X O	4/24/2011Email
3	OCD	it has helped but I have noticed an increase in low back pain and pain in the joints of my hands.  The pain is worse in the mornings and as the day progresses improves.  Other than that its good.		F	53	1  years25 1X D	2/3/2011
4	OCD, Anxiety & Aggression	Constantly having dry mouth, confusion, increased urination, feeling tired most of the time, loss of apetiate sometimes would be light headed, headaches	it did help me in the OCD matter, I would say about 60% its gone. regarding agression I would say I still have it and currently taking Xanx for such problems..This drug is good and bad at the same time, for higher doses I won't suggest it because I was on 150 MG per day and made my life a living hell for 10 days had severe constipation, sweeting, excesive urination, feeling tired all the time and of course lower sex drive!! is it worth it to go for high doses ..NO.	M	27	4  months50 MG 1X D	1/27/2011
5	pure O, anxiety, intrusive thoughts	at first tired! then just one day i woke up feeling great.sweating!!! id wash dishes and be pouring in sweat! but that side effect is gone away.	anafranil literally saved my life!!i had sever derealization after smoking weed one time!! lasted for 2 and a half years before i finally decided to get help.i am so glad i did!! i never thought my life would be "normal" again but after 2 months on anafranil it is!!im happy again, im going places, i am not afraid of panic attacks or anxiety when i go into wal mart!!im taking my kids to the park again!! as my oldest says, mommy your better!!	F	32	3  months150mgs 1X D	1/17/2011
1	ocd	dry mouth,constipation,priapism,weight gain,sleeping too much,mania,heart attack,agitation	horrible drug. do not take this chemical.	M	30	2  years150 mg 1X D	10/22/2010
3	Severe depression, anxiety	Rapid weight gain, doped up feeling, insomnia at night, sleepiness during the day (even when taken at night), no sex drive, etc.	It seemed to lift my depression, but am considering getting off of it due to the weight gain. :(	F	30	2  weeks150mg 1X D	10/3/2010
3	OCD, depression	Frequent urination, sleepiness, headaches, thirst, strange euphoria, increased hunger.	I REALLY wanted to like this drug and to stay on it. I mean, it made me so happy and carefree. But I had the worst headache on it, my mouth was bone dry, and even if I wasn't drinking water, I had to pee every 20 minutes for some reason. I also gained 10 pounds because it made me ravenous! It did help with OCD a lot, but it just wasn't worth it.	F	21	21  days50 mg 1X D	9/27/2010
2	Anxiety and Depression	Dry mouth, severe constipation (successfully treated with 20mg lactulose daily) and extreme difficulty reaching orgasm (even through masturbation; and if I managed, I would experience a strong headache for hours afterwards).	I've tried SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclics, Aurorix, Avanza, etc. Efexor is the only one that's worked (though only temporarily). I had high hopes after reading the positive experiences of others here. Sadly, I observed no benefit after being on 75mg for four weeks and I was not prepared to go higher due to the side effects. I'm weening myself off clomipramine and have just commenced Valdoxan.	M	34	4  weeks75mg 1X D	9/19/2010
5	OCD, depression, fibromyalgia	At first many such as anorgasmia and weight gain and sweating profusely but these have to be lived with sometimes for weeks because it is such an old medication.  The good news is that with time these subside and adding 30 min of cardio 4 times per week can really help with the weight as well as the depression.	Old medicines sometimes work better than newer ones	M	37	5  years225 mg 1X D	9/6/2010
5	anxiety panic	bad constipation, sleepiness, hungry feeling, dry mouth, dizziness upon standing.  Shut down the panic.  But side effects and using Phillips all the time made me change.	Took six weeks to finally tolerate the side effects to a limited degree	M	52	3  years75 1X D	8/18/2010
5	depression/anxity	after the first week no side effects remain	worked like magic was very happy with it.	M	32	4  months50mg 1X D	7/18/2010
1	OCD	Anxiety, dry mouth, constipation, zombie-like, emotionally numb, personality changes, suicidal, cutting	I was introduced to anafranil in 1990 by Dr. Jenike at the OCD Clinic at Mass General Hospital. I had a history of panic disorder from the time I was 10 and it manifested into OCD when I was 25. Approximately 5 hours after taking my very first dose which was probably 50 MG, I went into one of the worst anxiety attacks of my life and had to be taken to the hospital.  Anyone with pre-existing anxiety disorder should be aware that anti-depressants can trigger extreme panic attacks!  Be sure to take your xanax or klonpin when taking anafranil.  After 4 years (not consecutive as I became pregnant and stopped all meds during that 9 months), I couldn't bear not having the desire to play my musical instruments or do art any more.  I felt like a zombie most of the time.  Looking back, there is so much that I cannot remember from 1990 - 1995.  I do recall cutting myself (the scars are still there on the back of my arm) and threatening suicide in front of my parents.  Anafranil may have stopped me from doing a lot of the obsessive rituals, but it also ruined my kids' and my life.  I was introduced to zoloft in 1995 and that actually worked amazingly well for the OCD without all the horrible side effects of anafranil.  I've been med-free and I'd say about 95% OCD-free since 2004.	F	45	5  years100 MG 1X D	6/26/2010Email
3	ocd,anxiety,depression	sweating,sleepiness,insomnia,dry mouth,		M	38	9  weeks100mg 1X D	5/28/2010
4	racing thoughts and anxiety	So far I have had dizziness and very sleepy during the day	After taking the 1st dose, my racing thoughts had disappeared. I haven't had to take my antianxiety medicine for a week now!!!! I can't wait for the beginning side effects to  go away, I feel better than I have in 4 years!!!!	F	34	7  days.25mg 1X D	4/24/2010
5	OCD	None-minor constipation		M	45	 25 1X D	3/18/2010
4	OCD,PSTD,DEPRESSION,ANXIETY	constipation, dry mouth, sleepy, extreme thirst, heart burn, acid reflux	rampant thoughts have left, ocd still there when i get extremely agitated, but the racing obsessive thoughts are tamed, i can't believe how quiet my head is. Depression and suicidal thoughts, still lurk in the shadows.	F	34	3  months	1/31/2010
5	OCD	Side-effects as to be expected from a TCA: dry mouth, little sedation (got less after weeks), obstipation and ... no orgasm anymore	Life-safer. First time I visited a psychiatrist I was diagnose as bipolar disordered because I decribed my thoughts as "racing" and got a terrible acathisia on SSRI's which he thought to be hypomaniac symptoms. Took me 8 years to get rid of that diagnosis. I'll save you that story. Anafranil made the violent, sexual thoughts, the continuous doubt and need to position things "right" and the need to "confess" so much less. Adding a little risperdal (0.5 mg) made things even better! Symptoms are 60% less and I can have a professional life again! Damn that anorgasmia though ... but it is worth it. I actually don't really understand why TCA have this bad reputation; I personally find them even to be better tolerated than the SSRI's, that for sure.	M	32	6  months	1/6/2010Email
5	Depression/OCD/Social Anxiety	Constipation and slight dry mouth. Higher sex drive which is not usual in anti depressants.	Works GREAT for OCD and Depression. Also helps a bit with anxiety! I went on this drug about 18 months months ago and my life completley turned around. I felt like I needed a break from it a few months ago so came off it. I was feeling fine for about 6 weeks then all of my symptoms came back, especially severe depression. I have gone back on it now and realised I need this medication at this point in my life. I have to put up with the side effects because this is the only drug I have had that has been effective.	F	22	18  months	1/5/2010
5	depression	weight gain, sleepiness	It changed my life, now Im a happy person again. It is the best medicine by far.	M	31	5  years	1/4/2010
5	FOR ANXIETY WITH OBSESSIVE THOUGHS	DRY MOUTH,CONSTIPATION,HEART BURN	I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHER ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND HAVE NOT HAD  SUCCESS WITH THEM LIKE ANAFRANIL.I AM ABLE TO WORK AND HAVE A NORMAL LIFE. I HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THIS DISEASE ON AND OFF SINCE I WAS TWENTY ONE.	F	43	10  years	12/19/2009
5	OCD/depression	constipation, weird dreams, difficulty losing weight	I rather be overweight and happy than thin and miserable. Really helped with both depression and obsessive thoughts,	F	56	2  years	9/24/2009
1	OCD phobias and panic disorder	I wanted to revise my previous comments.I took this for almost 3 months and got worse on it,manic,racing thoughts,shaking,worsening of my OCD and anxiety.This durg worked for me for 6 years,but doesnt anymore.I pray I never have to take another antidepressant of any kind,they have all be horrible.I will stick to my Ativan and my therapy,but most of all will stop this madness on my own.Hope you all have better results than I did this time around.		F	44	90  days	8/22/2009
2	Anxiety,  OCD, Panic Attacks	Terrible nausea, zero energy, and extremely sleepy, Zombie-Like state, very dry mouth.	I have tried to go on this drug twice without success due to the bad side effects. I was only on it twice for 2 days each but could not handle the horrible feelings. May work for some but not for me. I even had to special order this drug since it is not readily available at most pharmacies.	M	63	4  days	8/6/2009
4	Social Anxiety  & Paranoia	Sweating  more (head),dry mouth,sudden movements of hands when sleeping,lower sex drive & Weight Gain	Has helped me quite a bit through anxiety	M	44	2  years	8/5/2009
5	OCD Anxiety Disorder	I took this drug over 10 years ago for 6 years.It saved my life.I have had horrible phobias since I was 5.It took all of that away.I stopped due to the incredible weight gain and profuse sweating.Now I find myself in really bad shape from phobias again and have gone back on it.The side effects I have now are in the morning, dry mouth,slight dizziness,shaking/tremors,hot flushes all over my body.Im on 25 mgs now and am going to bump up to 50 soon.It has already helped some and I've only been on it 2 weeks.If you can get past the side effects,it is the most effective drug for OCD.	Does anyone else have excessive thirst or bad taste in their mouth from this?	F	44	2  weeks	7/24/2009Email
5	BPD; depression; ocd	spontaneous, tic like, random movement of my muscles (extremities); "busy mind" when I sleep - wake up feeling refreshed but not enough sleep (like I will wake after just a couple hrs of sleep); agitation in the manner of nervousness/restlessness, not anger like agitation.	Of all the meds I have ever taken for depression this one seems to help me the most, but now after 1 1/2 months I am starting to get side effects	F	46	7  weeks	6/21/2009Email
1	Depression, Anxiety ,Panic attacks	Paranoia, Dizziness, Did not sleep Head ache, Lack of hunger, Heart feels like its beating wrong, Jittery, equilibrium is off Horrible feeling		F	23	2  days	6/19/2009Email
5	Depression/Anxiety	Sweating, weight gain (about 20 lbs) other than that none really.	I have tried all SSRI's and this so far is the best. I take 100-150 mg per day. I was surprised because alot of the pharmacies don't even carry it anymore.  Helped my anxiety, obsessive thoughts, which in turn eased my depression.  I would highly recommend it.	F	55	7  months	6/10/2009
5	Depression/Anxiety/Depersonalizatio	None as yet	I have tried Aropax/Zoloft/Luvox/Clonoazepam/Xanax and more recently Cymbalta - most of these with valium, as needed to varying degrees. The side effects of these drugs as well as there inefficacy has led me to try Anafranil - Having only been on this drug for about a week i have felt much better! Less distracted and able to concentrate on uni, and the people i care about.	M		6  days	5/13/2009
5	OCD/disturbing reoccurring thoughts	Constipation, Sleep ALOT, no orgasm, black out when stand up too fast	LOVE it. I've been having awful thoughts for many years and I had no idea that anything could stop them. Anafranil has saved my life. I no longer go to sleep fearful, so far, so good.	F	21	1  months	3/16/2009
4	Trichotillomania	I don't remember any minor side effects, but I had a real problem with mental confusion, to the point that I stopped this medicine even though it was working.  It was like functioning on 3 hours sleep - my short term memory was shot and I had trouble recalling passwords and facts.	This drug is amazing for OCD and trichotillomania.  I took a pill and within minutes had zero desire to pull.  I stopped taking it because I couldn't tolerate the mental confusion but I'm not sure if it it is a brief side effect that gets better over time or not.  I plan on trying it again soon because I need the help.	F	31	2  weeks	3/15/2009
5	suicidal depression, anxiety, OCD	25 years experience. Works very well but side effects keep me trying other meds. Yet always a relief to get back to clomipramine (anafranil). Anticholinergic effects include acid reflux leading to scarring of esophagus and inability to swallow  many foods without simultaneously drinking lots of warm/hot water, necessitating so far 2 outpatient operations to stretch esophagus. No sexual dysfunction for first 12 years but now severe (depending on dosage, as is libido loss) as I age. Reflux plus dry mouth anticholinergic effect have caused bad tooth decay. Bloating and weight gain. Mental confusion and difficulty urinating on higher doses, i.e., over 100 mg daily sometimes, but at other times fine on 165mg. Constipation, sweating, trembling, imbalance were mainly issues in the earlier years during which I often experienced some borderline serotonin syndrome.	Saved my life for sure. I was hospitalized, so they could go straight to 150 mg, and by the 4th day I felt great. Maintains a real sense of well-being. Still have intrusive obsessional thoughts at times, but now I'm almost detached from them and they pass quickly. I keep trying to lower the dose because of side effects, and success depends upon changing life circumstances, seasons and how much anti-anxiety meds I am prescribed. Tricky, but I've done this often enough I don't have to wait to feel suicidal anymore to know I need to increase my dose. I've been on as little as 40 mg daily for 2 months and as much as 200 mg daily when things aren't going well, soon tapering to 150 due to borderline serotonin syndrome. A dose increase like this after falling into depression is like being plucked out of hell into a state of grace, no exaggeration. My average daily dose is 75-90 mg. Also really helps against anxiety and insomnia. Higher doses are the best painkiller ever for my bad back. My generic is APO. Once I filled my Rx at a different pharmacy and sunk into a severe depression. I hadn't noticed the generic was GEN. My shrink said that generic had that reputation. Why don't these dummies tell you these things beforehand? I've also never had a doc tell me about tooth decay from dry-mouth-causing drugs. Drinking water, etc. isn't enough. Dental hygienist says you need a salivary enzyme replacement toothpaste and/or mouthwash, e.g., Biotene.	M	62	25  years	3/13/2009
3	OCD and depression	Dry mouth, Dizziness when standing up, nausea, diarhoea, constipation, drowsiness, twitching muscles and hands, indigestion- this drug is quite acidic, edgy feelings after being on it a while, increases anxiety and skipped heartbeats, fatigue for first few weeks- wears off.Upon forgetting to take it I had nasty side effects, i sweated profusely, shortness of breath, frequent toileting, alerted feeling, a little panicky at times from the high temperature. I find this particularly nasty, the physical addiction our body goes into.	I think Anafranil is good for anyone with acute anxiety condition or panick disorder like me. Panic disorders can be hard to treat, but not impossible, it can be gotten rid of for long periods thank God. But its a strong drug even at 225mg a day, forgetting to take it for 3 days i thught i had a stomach bug and flu. I was throwing up and toileteing frequently. I feel these drugs are good for as long as you need to take them and no longer. I feel that with prolonged use side effects would increase. I really dont like the edgy feelings ive been getting with cramps in my gut. I certainly hope toc hange it and recieve therapy from a HSE in crises.	F	30	9  months	3/2/2009Email

4	OCD,panic,GAD,Mjr depresion,moods	dry mouth, spaced out, decreased sex drive. Feeling sleepy and zombified. Fatigued, numb, frequent UTIs, constipation, tremors, feeling of not being myself.	Have tried just about every other medication and nothing helped. This actually works. Sometimes i find the side effects are a bit too much to deal with but would rather have them than my original problems. Don't know what i would have done without anafranil. It saved my life.	F	30	10  years	2/3/2009
5	OCD, anxiety, depression	difficulty urinating, constipation, dry mouth, decreased libido, difficulty ejaculating, sleepiness	Highly effective drug but with many bothersome side effects and a really nasty withdrawal. I would certainly reccomend it to anyone whose symptoms are severe and wants to be relieved no matter the price.	M	29	8  months	1/27/2009
2	social anxiety	shakeiness all over,esp in hands and neck,blurred vision,headaches,increased anxiety,difficult to sleep.not on it long enough to experience no ejaculation,but its common.	not the drug for social anxiety!we spend our lives trying to hide anxiety from others and this maks it tenfold.i think my shrink was going through his med book 1 by 1-have exhausted all the ssris,tried moclomebide,and duloxetine,neither worked.im trying to get him to put me on nardil,the "gold" standard for sa...we shall see....feel free to contact me	M	43	7  days	1/4/2009Email

5	OCD	Surprisingly few. A little dry mouth, but only for short periods of time	I have tried all SSRIs other than Celexa. They just didn't cut it. Prozac worked well until poop out after 17 yrs. Anafranil was different (better). With my first dose I could tell the difference. Calming. Now up to 150 mgs and loving it. Don't hesitate if you have stubborn OCD.	M	58	5  weeks	11/26/2008Email
4	OCD, anxiety depression	low sex drive; dry mouth, occasional dizziness upon abruptly standing up, occasional facial flushing.  Of these side effects, the dry mouth, dizziness, and facial flushing diminished as time went on, and in sum these 3 problems have been quite minor.  The low sex drive, however, has been problematic, and must be addressed.	Struggled with OCD/anxiety symptoms, along with mild depression, from about age 20 onward (though intermittent symptoms appeared earlier).  These problems gradually worsened as my 20s progressed.  At around age 30, due to some adverse experiences, I developed a couple of new obsessions that caused my condition to worsen rapidly and substantially.  Over a period of 4 years, I tried, in various doses and combinations, Luvox (fluvoxamine, I believe), Celexa (citalopram), Wellbutrin, and Effexor (the most effective of this group), and received only minimal benefit.  As a "last ditch" attempt to resolve my problem, believing it was something I just had to learn to live with, I tried Anafranil (clomipramine) and within three days began to feel some improvement:  the intense tightening I would feel in my chest whenever an upsetting thought entered my mind was diminished--the first real relief I'd felt in 4 years.  As the weeks passed, my symptoms improved further, and now the upsett	M	37	3.5  years	11/3/2008
5	ocd, anxiety, depression	none	I'm mainly trying to take this for anxiety and ocd, so far the drug has cleared my head a lot, everything is so much clearer at 50mg.  It has done a little for my anxiety so far, I know doses from 100mg to 250mg are used for ocd, best drug taken I've also taken ssri's, cymbalta,klonopin,herbal remedies,abilfy, nardil and wellbutrin none compare.	M	21	7  days	10/22/2008
3	Gen.Depression Phobias OCD	Libido loss, dizziness, unoriented, too many questions unanswered (Imagining I'm in the right place to start answering them). Felt at my best as never before in my whole life and started rediscovering myself and my abilities. Then hallucinations(like seeing halos around people's faces).After the 1 month on this, then went in the manic phase and then totally totally out of control and tried to cut my wrist. I was lucky the damage on my wrist was minimal.	Well I had to be inserted in a psychiatric ward and doctors started experimenting doses of various drugs.	M	26	1  months	8/6/2008
5	Depression, BDD	Dry mouth, dizziness(1st weeks) loss of sex drive and orgasm (1st months), weight gain, drowsiness, constipation, vivid nightmares (when i forget to take it)	I felt better almost immediately after taking this drug. I have tried a number of SSRIs and other drugs without relief. This drug has completely turned my life around. Suicidal thoughts, days spent hiding in bed, frequent bouts of crying, are all bad memories. I have so much more energy and have developed a lust for life that I haven't had since I was young. Within months of starting this drug my life turned around - I got the job I'd dreamed of, I moved out of my parent's home, weekends started filling up again. Now I have a career, a full social life and am living independently. On the down side I have put on 10kg in 6 months. I went through a period of not being able to achieve orgasm but that has passed. And if I forget to take it at night I get bad nightmares. I also feel drowsy in the mornings and it takes me a while to wake up.All in all the positive effects far outweigh the side effects though.	F	26	6  months	4/19/2008
5	OCD	Dry mouth, constipation for a couple weeks, lower libido	Anafranil has worked the best of all the SRI's I have tried for OCD. I have tried Zoloft, Cymbalta, Lexapro and none made much of a difference, Anafranil is in its own league, it was night and day better than any other med I have tried. The dry mouth is the only real side effect that still bugs me along with occasional night sweats especially on my legs which is funky. Libido is lower and orgasm is more difficult but that isn't all bad!	M	27	4  months	4/12/2008
2	Anxiety and Depersonalization	Increased Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Sleeplesness, Ear Ringing, Pins and Needles in Body, Sore Throat, lengthened the time to reach orgasm.	I took Anafranil for Depersonalization and General Anxiety Disorder. For the first 7 days I felt absolutely Nothing. It's as if I was swallowing candy. But then on day 8 I started to feel very anxious a few hours after I took it. Also couldn't sleep very well. This medication usually makes people tired. But it had the opposite effect on me. It didn't make me any more tired than usual. It actually made it harder to get to sleep. Then on Day 9 I had a full blown panic attack after I took it. I thought I was going to have to call 911. My anxiety went through the roof and I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I was scared!!! The next day my left ear started ringing and I felt as if I was getting a sore throat. This stuff started doing some weird things to me, so I decided to stop taking it before the side effects got even worse. Medication can effect everyone differently. This just isn't the right one for me. Use at your own risk!	M	39	9  days	4/3/2008
5	Depression, Anxiety, Obsessions	Dry Mouth, Sweatiness, Longer time till orgasm	Within a week this medicine has near completely erased my depression, panic, anxiety and mild OCD.  Each day gets better and I havent even made it up to 50 mg's yet.  So much better than SSRI's and with fewer side effects - plus it doesnt numb you into hapiness, just amplifies everything good about life!		22	2  weeks	1/29/2008Email
5	Depression, Anxiety, OCD, Paranoia	Dry mouth, Lowered libido, Increased sweating during excersize	Before Anafranil, my life seemed so chaotic. I was constantly fighting with my parents, struggling to meet demands at school, having friendship troubles due to reluctance to participate in large social groups and crowded events. Also, I would constantly obsess over the way I looked and had an overly cynical outlook/sense of humor, all while feeling guilty for no good reason, and believing that strangers were either critisizing my appearance or annoyed by my prescence. My old life seemed meaningless and it got to the point where all I cared about were a couple friends, any kind of illegal 'upper', and obsessing over my looks and my health. An insane asylum seemed appropriate, as I convinced myself that I was schizophrenic. I would skip class if I was late due to my phobia of being stared at when entering the classroom.  I would tense up and begin a negatibe loop of thoughts concerning and obsess for days over what other students were saying about me behind my back (how arrogant of me);	M	19	8  days	1/29/2008Email
5	depression, anxiety, obsessions	Dry mouth, slight fatigue, some sexual problems	I have only been on this medicine for a week and it has been a GODSEND!! After only four days I started feeling better and each day is an improvement on the last. I recomend taking this with huperzine A to counter the anticholinergic effects.  This medicine puts zoloft/Prozac/lexapro to shame.  The SSRIs have more side effects (don't believe the anti tricyclic marketing) and can barely come close to the fast depression relief anafranil has offered-much less the anxiety and obsession relief.  This drug has cured my mind of all doubts, worries, obsessions and paranoia and has left me with clarity to concentrate and happiness to show compassion once again! If your afraid of the side effects, done be, just give it a try and your life as well as those of your loved ones will benefit !	M		7  days	1/28/2008Email

3	Bipolar1 Disorder	Extreme Weight Gain, High Cholesterol, Extremely High Sugar Levels	I recommend this medicine for people not concerned with weight gain. For Bipolar it is a great medication. Mind wise I was fantastic, but my physical conditions are horrible. Now pre-diabetic. Switched to Seroquil XR 50MG. Working great!	F	39	2  years150 1X D	12/14/2011Email
5	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Abilify brought me back to life. I was so sick and within a week i was feeling worlds better. I can not even describe how much it had helped me. No side effects.		F	30	2  years2 mg	12/13/2011Email
3	Bipolar 2	I have woken up consecutively around 4 or 5 am since being on the drug and have not fallen back to sleep, causing me to be extremely tired.	I take it in addition to lithium. I find it has helped stabilize me but being overly tired causes me to be a wreck and worse off then before. I am going to try decreasing my dosage and see if I can sleep then.	F	18	9  days2 2X D	12/10/2011
1	Depression	Twitchy, jumpy, leg cramps. Serious decrease in attention span, continues long after discontinuation of drug - may have ruined my attention ability forever.	After discontinuing the drug about 5 years ago, some serious side effects remain. Lost my attention span. Cannot read a full book, only articles about the size of those in a magazine, also cannot concentrate on a movie or tv show past about one hour. RECOMMEND YOU TO AVOID THIS DRUG AT ALL COSTS. DOWNSIDE IS NOT WORTH IT. OF COURSE, YMMV.	F	51	30  days 1X D	12/5/2011
1	depression	Tremors, insomnia, nausea, extreme weight gain, anxiety.	My son was put on ability after suffering from depression and hallucinations. His anxiety level increased and he would go through periods of severe vomiting and nausea. He also developed insomnia. His weight started out at a thin 150 pounds within one year he was 245. We changed psychiatrists and she added zoloft and took him off the abilify. He has been off for over a year and still has extreme Carb cravings and is struggling to lose weight despite the fact he still has bouts of extreme nausea and vomiting.  I feel very strongly that abilify has caused lasting permanent side effects. Please do not let someone you love start this medicine.	M	20	1  years5mg 1X D	12/3/2011

1	bipolar 2	feeling of "drunk driving", blurred vision.. insomnia, but then extremely tired all day.. restless.. complete loss of concentration. eye twitching. my mood improved.. but side effects were too bad.	I finally stopped when I was too scared to drive and had a few total breakdowns at work and literally couldn't work or do my school work.. i lost ALL concentration and then went to see another pdoc for ADD/ADHD.. i stopped taking abilify but the eye twitching never stopped.. in fact, ive had random muscle spasms/contractions that have spread all over my body and become more constant as time goes on.. i have been off abilify for almost 2 months.... i feel my nerves sparking under the tip of my nose like theyve gone haywire.. the muscles in my legs, knees, feet, neck, EVERYWHERE... spasm ALL day long.. making it horribly hard for me to sleep now and some days more than others make it hard to focus.. going back to my doctor again later this month to see if theres possibly ANYTHING that can be done to help..

3	possible borderline personality?	slurred speech, unsteady, acting like drunk	I took it in the morning but it made me tired. I'm only on 1/2 a pill because I'm so sensitive to these type of meds. Then I tried it before bed but thought it kept me up.I go go go all day doing things until I'm wiped out and in pain.I forget to take it at night so took it this morning and felt like I was drunk being obnoxious and crying easily.

5	schizophrenia	restlessness, insomnia	switched from clozaril to abilify because i had gained a significant amount of weight on the clozaril and was literally obese, drooling, and stupid. when i switched 9 months ago for a little over a week got less than 2hrs of sleep a night. went through many sleep medications (regular ambien 10mg, trazadone, lorazepam 2mg) all of which helped somewhat, adding an hour or two until I was prescribed ambien cr 12.5mg. getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep, lost over 50 lbs and feel much more like myself. This drug worked wonders for me after the side effects were treated.	M	29	9  months20 1X D	11/1/2011
4	depression	The biggest side effects I have had are weight gain, and insomnia, and sleepiness.	This drug has given me my life back. It took getting to 5mg for the depression tolift and stay lifted. I started at 2 mg ,and the depression lifted in three days, but didn't stay lifted, so we slowly kept increasing . I am so glad my doctor suggested this med. There are side effects, but I will tolerate them because the depression was horrible. The other side effect I have is gettign up early , around 7 am ,which I like .  Give it a try, and start the dose low if your sensitive to medication.	F	49	4  months5 1X D	10/27/2011
1	bipolar	rapid heart rate. tremors in my hands similar to that of alcohol withdraw. fatigue. feeling washed out emotionally and disconnected from life. highly increased sexual desire. nausea, often awakening to feelings like morning sickness. decreased reflexes/reaction time. increased anxiety. increased paranoia.	This is an awful, awful drug as are most antipyschotics. For 2 years we played with the abilify dose ranging from 5-15mg. We tried adding other drugs and removing other drugs all to make one drug work and combat the unpleasant side effects. Finally settled for abilify 10 mg plus clonazapam.In the end, doctors push these drugs and won't even toy with the idea that maybe with proper therapy in mild cases of mental disorders, one can thrive without meds. I finally pulled myself off and continue to keep it secret from pro-drug persons. Little if any withdraw. I still go to therapy, I am thriving much better in therapy without meds. I suggest trying this if at all possible instead of meds. You can always go back to meds if this isn't working.	F	32	2  years10 mg 1X D	10/18/2011

1	Psychosis	2 days on 10 mg, then 5 days on 5 mg.  Accentuation of existing feelings of being drained, even on 5 mg.  I couldn't even sit on a park bench - reclined - a lady was very concerned - asked if I was OK, if there was anything she could do.  Lack of life force - near lack of ability to even look after myself.	I wondered about starting off on 2.5 mg to give my system the chance to get used to the side effects, but the psychiatrist said this was "no dose".  Thought I would try anyway, and double the dose after a couple of weeks, but after reading these other comments, I don't think I'll bother.	F	50	7  days5 mg 1X D	10/14/2011
3	Rages	Daughter had severe muscle and leg pains. D/C after 5 days. "First cause no Harm" is what I follow for my child. The ABILIFY user sheet that came with the drug, the sheet said to report immediately to the doctor about the side effects. I did.		F	8	5  days5 mg 1X D	10/12/2011Email
2	depression	restlessness despite being very tired	This medication was not for me.  The first day was fine and made me feel better with more energy, but in the following days, I became unable to sit still.  I would be so tired, but I had to move.  I still take Abilify occasionally when I feel very low, but only for one day.	F	50	1  weeks2.5 1X D	10/6/2011
2	Bipolar Disorder	My daughter has experienced bouts of depression whilst taking these meds, tiredness very sleepy all the time, has no energy anymore, lost all motivation always mopey now and moaning, whingeing, very irritable, extreme hunger that is beyond ridiculous, not happy with any part of what this medication has done to my daughter except her violence and anger has almost completly gone. but fear that the pro'c do not outweigh the cons here, my daughter just isnt happy ever anymore very sad for me as her mother to watch am considering weaning her off these meds as soon as i have discussed with her pysciatrist.	Tried Risperdone first (short term 3 months) did absolute wonders = apart from extreme weight gain. cannot go back to this apparently as have been told it is a short term drug only.

1	autism	We complained with the psychiatrist about the medication risperdal, because even after two years we didn't see much improvement with it and my son was always much more nervous with than without risperdal.  The psychiatrist recommended to change to abilify and that was much worse.  My son didn't want to sleep anymore and was very disturbed and cried a lot.  The psychiatrist insisted to continue and recommended to combine abilify with seroquel.  Seroquel should in theory bring his sleep back.  Not so in practice.	Life was hell for father and son during abilify medication time.  I am very pleased I took my son off it.  As a father of an autist, I would like to take the drug to try and understand what it does, however as I permanently need to take care of my son, I can't afford the risk.  It is a scary drug.  I can't recommend it.	M	7	2  months10 mg 1X D	9/27/2011Email
3	Bipolar Disorder	At higher doses, heart palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, tooth decay, muscle tics, restlessness.	I am sticking with the lowest dose (2.5mg) which has made big changes for me (less depression, more even moods and energy). I've tried higher doses and the difference was negligible but the side effects were much more of a problem.	F	49	3  years2.5-7.5 1X D	9/23/2011
1	schizophrenia	tiredness,  weight gain.  The side effects have gottwen so bad that I was forced to quit the medication against dr.'s advice,  out of fear of death due to weight gain.	I will admit that I am somewhat biased:  I am absolute opposed, moral grounds, on the use of any mind-altering drugs for any purpose. Also,  due to my years of negative experiences with psychiatry,  my viewpoints tend somewhat toward the antipsychiatry side.  I am in no way connected with the Church of Scientology.

1	Depression	Tremor, anxiety, chest heaviness & pain, severe fatique, dizziness, loss of motivation, loss of libido, stroke-like episodes, weight gain, blurred vision, rapidly changing body temperature	This drug turns you into a mindless numb zombie while effectively attacking your nervous system creating serious life-threatening side-effects. The pill pusher that prescribed this poison to me refused to answer my phone calls while I was having a stroke which resulted in a frightening trip to the emergency room. The ER doctors had no idea how to treat me so I was essentially ejected from the premises. This drug will KILL you. I had no choice but to go completely off this drug cold turkey because my doctor totally abandoned me and still refuses to talk to me. I've been off Abilify for a week and I'm still feeling its harmful effects. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This POISON will ruin your life.	M	28	2  months5 mg 1X D	9/10/2011
4	bipolar depression	I had akathisia (restless movement) from Abilify. My psychiatrist added propranolol and it completely stopped.	It started working within a week or two, lifting me out of depression since it was paired with an antidepressant. I still have depressive episodes but they usually aren't as bad as they were in the past.	F	56	2  years10 mg 1X D	9/9/2011Email

5	HALF BIPOLAR/HALF Schizophrenia	Abilify is a wondeful pill.  Its the only med that helps with (voices) and mania.  Compared to other atypical antipsychotics the low side effects are very minimal.	insomnia, flat feeling, tired in AM, my head feels like its buzzing making it difficult for me to sleep, loss of motivation, hunger in the morning, increases my prolactin, does not give me akathisia - which is a very good thing.  Pdoc would rather give me Geodon, but I always insist Abilify because it does not give me akathisia.I'v been taking this med for 7 years.	M	27	3  years10MG 1X D	8/24/2011

2	Anxiety problems	I really don't feel any positive results but what I do experience is sleeplessness and more anxiety at certain times(mainly around people)	I think that these drug companies make studies to try and prove that the neurons in out brain aren't performing properly and they come up with these expensive drugs that don't really help most people. I have much better results and can live normally with my Alprazolam. They even had me on Cymbalta at the same time as Abilify just as trial and error. My problems are with anxiety disorders triggered by certain circumstances and not a problem with the way my neurons in my brain are firing. I would say that Abilify is just another expensive drug the pharmaceutical companies are trying to promote for greater income instead of positive results in patients. I don't think the box above got my dosage right. I was started out on 30mg twice a day and now take 60mg twice a day. I really feel that it is making me more depressed and anxious.	M	43	 60 2X D	8/21/2011Email
5	bi polar I	Increased cholesterol, weight gain, severe food cravings.	I LOVE Abilify.  I took this medication for 3 years.  This drug made me "the most normal I've ever been" to quote my mother.  I do however dislike some of the side effects.  I gain weight very quickly on Abilify and experience intense food cravings.  I found that cutting out all processed foods and sugar helped me to stabilize my weight and stop the food cravings.  Unfortunately, no matter how healthfully I ate, my cholesterol went through the roof.  Even on a vegan diet my cholesterol was out of control.  The Dr. took me off Abilify due to it causing an increased cholesterol level.  I'm hoping my new med will work as well as Abilify with less side effects.  If you take this medication, even if you have no noticeable side effects, please make sure your doctor checks your bloodwork at least 4 times per year.	F	30	3  years5 mg 1X D	8/9/2011
4	depression, add to Paxil to boost	occasional nausea, constipation, helped with fiber and plenty of water, small lip twitching like you may get a twitch in your eye sometimes.	I have noticed a difference in my mood and energy level.  I sleep better at night, but do have vivid dreams that are weird. Am no more hungry than before.  I recommend this drug to those who are considering it.	F	43	19  days2mgs 1X D	8/3/2011
1	panic attacks/anxiety	The feeling was like a non-stop motor inside of my mind and body. Abilify gave me 10 times wore panic then I was experiencing in the first place. For soeone that has battled panic disorder and general anxiety for over 6 years this is the worst drug I have ever taken. I am still feeling the after effects of this terrible medication.	Do not take these meds for panic/anxiety!	M	29	21  days10mg 1X D	8/3/2011
2	depression	severe drowsiness, restless legs	Within a few days of taking Abilify, I knew it wasn't for me. I would have a hard time keeping my eyes open at school, at the same time fidgeting to high heaven. (Bone tired, but the fidgeting kept me awake, it was very frustrating.) I can't say whether it would have eased my depression because I stopped--- in my case the physical side effects were too overwhelming.	F	19	3  days 1X D	8/1/2011
3	negative thoughts,anger,depression	a lot of lethargy, going into depression,	abilify has somewhat helped me in clearing negative thoughts and other people talking about me, it has brought back my sharpness a bit, its kind of made me normal except i feel lethargic and sleepy throughtout the day but cant really sleep,	M	28	7  months15mg 1X D	7/31/2011Email
1	Bi-polar	suicidal thoughts & extreme mania	I was put on this and lamictal at the same time. After a few weeks everything got worse, my anxiety level was so high. I eventually had a horrible mania phase that resulted in moving 3,000 miles away, and then back, and once again 3,000 miles away. I also suffered from suicidal thoughts--I wanted out! After getting off of it, and upping my lamictal I have been so much better.	F	37	6  months 1X D	7/23/2011
5	add on to Zoloft	Less tired! More motivation! slight more anxiety. Worked in 3 to 4 days.	Please, someone give some good feedback about Abilify. I wonder why so many negative remarks. Because we are all different I suppose. I am not bipolar, but Zoloft alone was not cutting it. I still wanted to sleep the day away! Adding Abilify has been wonderful. I  now can't sleep during the day even if I tried! At night I am out quickly, from all the motivation and work that I have done throughout the day. This has worked great for me. Please, someone tell me you agree!!	F	28	3  weeks10 1X D	7/19/2011Email
1	mood disorder	Wow...  Three days was too long to be on this medication.. Can you say "massive food cravings"??  Geez, I'm not much of an eater, and almost immediately I wanted to bake all kinds of crap and eat constantly.  Sugar, bread, etc. What is up with that????  No more Abilify for me..

5	Resistant depression	None	This is an amazing drug that has helped my resistant depression.I have been taking Prozac for 15 years.  I have been on dosagesranging from 20 mg. up to 80 mg.  Recentely I started experiencing reacurring depression.  My doctor started me on a low dose of Abilify and within 1 day I could start to feel my mood lift.  Within one week on the Abilify, I have begun to enjoy many outside interests that I did not want to have anythingto do with. For me, it has been a wonder drug!

I am now able to function in social situations and dont feel the need to hide in my house. I dont feel like people are talking about me as much and I have alot more energy.

Please take caution with this medication.	F	21	1  months10mg 1X D	5/1/2011
1	bipolar disorder	weight gain, nausea, depression, anxiety	I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone. I began sinking into a horrible depression after 2 years on this drug and I do not take any other drugs on a daily basis. The weight gain is horrible and no matter how much dieting and exercise I do, the weight will not come off!	F	27	2  years10 MG 1X D	3/28/2011Email
1	depression	insatiable hunger and weight gain; lack of energy and loss of interest in activities I used to enjoy	There must be a better med. somewhere than this without the undesirable side effects (the commercial doesn't refer to it but it should emphasize you become a zombie). My personal recommendation is get a DOG and get out of the house!!	M	70	5  weeks10 mg 1X D	3/25/2011Email
2	Bipolar II  and Panic Disorder	My heart has been racing like mad, at one point I was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. My panic disorder has seemed to worsen since I've taken Abilify, and I have tremors more often than before. I am extremely mean, irritable and rude to others, even when I don't want to be. I've been numb at some points emotionally, but that has only happened once. I can't sleep, and if I manage to I wake up in the morning with my mind racing, and I end up jumping out of bed and doing things in a hyperactive manner. My chest feels heavy, and I am either burning up in a sweat or freezing cold.	A lot of people have said it's an amazing drug, but I must just be the 1 in 100 or 1000 that experienced the more serious side effects.	F	22	8  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011Email
2	add on to antidepressant	Extreme insomnia - went from sleeping 9-10 hours night which is needed due to chronic fatigue syndrome to only 5 hours per night even though I'm on a very potent sleep medicine.	The 1st day I felt like a zombie. The 2nd day and forward, I was unusually happy for someone who has had 3 deaths in their family in the last 6 months. Also increased my appetite which led to 3 # weight gain in those 10 days.	F	54	10  days2 MG 1X D	3/21/2011
2	Extreme Anxiety with Bipolar	Hypomania - like taking extra strong shots of espresso every couple of hours.  Completely restless, unable to concentrate, irritable/mean, everyone around moving too slowly, racing thoughts etc.  This drug was supposed to help me with anxiety, which it has, I'm too manic to care.  It has not effected my foggy brain, made anything clearer, or helped me in any way.  I just have a frantic energy like I want to go run five marathons back to back.	Maybe will work well for some, didn't for me.	F	36	4  days2 1X D	3/19/2011
5	add on to anti-depressant/anxiety	Sleep has decreased from 12 hrs a nite to 7 hrs. I do not feel hungry constantly. I do feel a bit hyper, but that was normal before the depression/anxiety. It may or may not be making it worse.	I actually sleep better at nite, fall asleep faster, and wake up more refreshed. This medicine has made a big difference, I feel like I woke up from a 6 month coma and am back to being able to get things done.	F	35	1  months2 MG 1X D	3/13/2011
2	Bi Polar	drowsy and spaced out while feeling restless. Cannot stop "wondering" around the house.	I feel like a zombie when I take abilify. Even though my legs and feet are tired from wondering, I still cant seem to stop or sit still. Going to talk to my doc about this	M	42	6  weeks5mg 1X D	3/8/2011
3	bipolar 2	hiccups, dizzyness, excessive need to sleep, nausea, hypoglycemia	I know I just started the drug but I do feel much more stable moodwise.  I am hoping the side effects subside soon and that this will finally be a drug that works more than a month	F	25	5  days5mg 1X D	3/7/2011
3	Bipolar Disorder	Extreme Fatigue	It made me absolutely exhausted, I would sleep for 15 hours at night and wake up even more tired than when I went to bed. It did keep me from being extremely depressed though, because when I stopped taking it I wound up being hospitalized for depression. Doesn't mean it won't work for others though!

4	Bipolar	Sometimes get tardive dyskinesia. Slight headache.	I'm sorry but I can deal with my involuntary movements from the medicine but after 5 days I feel like a different person already.  I'm not in bed all day anymore and things I used to have interest in I'm interested again.  I even lost my job last week but I don't care as long as I feel better than before.  It was Hell before Abilify.	M	39	5  days5 1X D	2/28/2011
2	Bi-Polar	Insomnia!!!!!  Restless legs, muscle cramping.  Shortness of breath and chest pressure, may be from drug induced anxiety.  Apetite increase and related weight gain.	It did stabilize my mood but all the side effects left me feeling like crap day in and day out!!!!!  Couldn't ever get comfortable regardless of if I was trying to sleep or just relax while sitting, standing, walking or otherwise conscious!!!!!  Terrible experience!!!!!

5	Bo-Polar I	I have been on this medicine a little under a month and I can say that it has changed my life. I was very moody and I think I've finally got it under control. It feels good to be happy and again, and look in the mirror and say, "Hey, you're awesome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can do this."		F	30	23  days5 1X D	2/20/2011Email
1	Paranoid Schizophrenia	Slow urine passing, traumatic headaches, undiagnosed tardive dyskinesia in my hands and lips, "blunt/drugged down" feeling by medicine, restless legs syndrome, removed parts of my own personality because of dulled effect of abilify.	Took this lethal poison pill for about 5 years until recently I had to cut down the dose on my own, due to causing me tardive dyskinesia in hands, and lips. I do not recommend this poison pill to ANYONE. WARNING: Once you start on this medicine you will feel "blunt/drugged" down and you wont be able to have your say about anything anymore because you cant think straight. Dulled down medicine.	M	24	5  years25 1X D	2/19/2011
3	Mood disorder	Disoriented, lethargic, indifferent, weight gain	I started taking Abilify because I would fixate and obsess about things. I was also dealing with anger and irrational behavior. My doctor said I have a busy mind, it has to stay busy or I freak out on stupid things. I could never feel any peace. I was constantly anxious, couldnt stop thinking, worrying, and obsessing. Abilify finally slowed my thoughts down and gave me some peace. However, now I feel like Im too calm. Im always tired and simply feel out of it. My job is suffering because Im forgetful and spacey all the time. My weight is suffering because all I think about now is food. I am glad that Ive had this short period of time of feeling mellow for the first time, but its time to get off of it and feel normal and healthy again, and hopefully redeem myself at work. I'm worried about withdrawal symptoms, but I'm going to go for it! Any similar stories or words of wisdom, please share, I've included my email address.	F	33	4  months5 mg 1X D	2/15/2011Email
4	Cymbalta withdrawal	energy boost on 2nd day, increased appetite	During Cymbalta discontinuation I was pushed in a bad depression. My Dr. prescribed 20mg Prozac, which helpd a lot with my mood. However, I was still extremely tired. After taking 2mg Abilify in the AM I have a lot of energy. It is almost difficult sitting at my desk at work. I feel like running and/or chatting all the time. Have difficulties focusing. Not sure if I stay on Abilify but it really helped giving me my energy back.	F	40	4  days2mg 1X D	2/8/2011
4	Bipolar	brief periods of dizziness, urine retention, restlessness	this works well for me, i was on 5mg for 5 wks which wasnt enough. 10mg reduced my mania and helped me with an unfortunate immediate switch into a depression. i suffered visual hallucination and after upping the dose the depression is gone and the visual disturbance is gone.  i want to stay on this dose but i may move to maintenence of 7.5 in 3 mos. i take klonopin which combats the restlessness....abilify its a good match for me.
