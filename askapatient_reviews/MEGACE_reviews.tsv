3	Complex hyperplasia with Atypia	Took one pill and this has made me hungrier than a lion at a gazelle buffet and so sleepy		F	30	 40mg 2X D	12/23/2011Email
2	Abnormal uterine bleeding- prehysto	30lb weight gain, nausea, fatigue, moodiness, extreme inability to concentrate		F	38	2  months40mg	12/11/2011
3	Extensive Complex Hyperplasia Atypi	Loss of sex drive,increased appetite which caused weight gain, increased blood preasure, cramps in my calves, bad night sweats and hot flashes.  Mood swings which alter every day living and fatigueness.	Had Extensive Complex Hyperplasia Atypical and a hysterectomy was not an option for me as I wanted to have a child. Doctors would have preferred to do one but I fought it. I was on aggressive Provera and Prometrium therapy before Megace but needed to get something stronger to reverse the condition before I could try for a child.  Megace altered my life so much I had to work from home once a week b/c things would really get to me and I would be VERY fatigue by mid week.  Gained 30 lbs in 3 months and when I tried to work out the fatigueness increased.  Am going back on Provera @ 40 mg 2x a day which is still aggressive but I am at the end of the conidition and hopefully only need 1 more D&C to test. Next month will be 1 yr since I started aggressive progesterone therapy.  I would have a good discussion with your doctor about this med if this is what is recommended. If I didn't want a child so bad I would have told them to do a hysterectomy b/c this med ruined my quality of life.		31	6  months160 2X D	6/9/2011
5	Appetite Loss	Megace works wonderfully.  I have not experienced any side effects besides sweating (only at night) and more frequent urination.  It has brought my appetite back and I have gained 8 pounds in 3 weeks.  Great drug!		F	27	3  weeks625 1X D	5/25/2011
5	To increase weight	Increased urination (especially during the night), lowered sex drive.	I've always had high metabolism and low appetite, was 6'3", 150lb and hated it. In two months, I gained thirty pounds and have never been happier with my self-image in my life.  This was the miracle drug I had been waiting for for years and while the side effects were annoying at worst, they were well worth the advantages.	M	19	2  months1 tsp 1X D	6/7/2010
2	fibroids	Weight gain and developed diabetes. Hair loss and breast reduction.	I would not take this if you are already overweight. I think it may result in subsequently developing diabetes and it did not shrink my fibroids.  They grew! It did diminish the bleeding problem associated with the fibroids, but it wasn't worth getting the new problems that developed.	F	53	18  months30 MG 1X D	2/18/2010
3	Endometrial hyperplasia	Vaginal bleeding at week # 5; lasted 3 weeks.  Swelling ankles.  Headaches.	Having Repeat biopsy in one month - so don't know if it worked!	F	63	2.5  months	9/3/2009
4	Aneroxia	hair loss, mood swings, insomnia, hungry all the time	I am still taking the medicine and I have gained almost 20 pounds.   The results are well worth the side effects.	F	14	3  months	1/3/2009
5	reoccurance of uterine cancer	fatigue, weight gain, swollen ankles, shortness of breath	The side effects are worth any inconvience. Taking drug for one year	F	62	12  months	1/2/2009Email
4	recurrent endometrialadenocarcinoma	weight gain, which brought on shortness of breath, hypertension;  fatigue; I believe cognitive effects (not thinking clearly	I know I have to take this. It brought inoperable, small amount of post-chemo cancer down to nearly the cellular level and they expect even further improvement in that respect. But the side effects have slowed me up terribly and are rough.	F	61	2  years	11/15/2008
4	Atypical hyperplasia	Side-effects change from month to month.  The first noticeable side effects were increased appetite and frequent urination.  I started dieting and have lost about 20 lbs.  Soon started noticing that I had trouble falling asleep and then sleep interruption (had to get up during the night to urinate).  I also get a lot of headaches, gas, pain in stomach and back, loss of sex drive, mood swings, loss of concentration, fatigue, tiredness and most recently pain in calf. There is some bleeding, but not like having a period.  Haven't had a period since I've been on the medication.	This medication works.  I realized I had a problem when I started having really heavy and continuous periods.  I had lots of clots and was always weak, felt faint and nauseous.	F	32	6  months	11/14/2008
4	increase weight	Loss of menstrual cycle, dry mouth	It increased my weight almost immediately and I gained weight, but my menstruation cycle was disrupted	F	36	2  months	11/7/2008
5	Adenomyosis/Heavy Menstral Bleeding	40mg once per day and only noticable side effect is some minor heartburn.	I was experiencing a lot of pelvic pain (due to adenomyosis) and very heavy menstral bleeding (due to uterine fibroids).  Within 3 days of starting this regimen, it stopped the bleeding, cold.  No bleeding, no spotting, nothing!  I'm probably still looking at a hysterectomy due to the adenomyosis, but I hope to stay on this med until then.	F	45	20  days	7/22/2008
1	Heavy menstrual bleeding	Gynecologist prescribed it for heavy periods due to fibroids.  Stopped the bleeding cold, but four days later I got a blood clot that led to a pulmonary embolism and almost killed me.	If you have any blood clotting disorders (I have Factor V Leiden) do not take this drug under any circumstances.  I also think any doctor who prescribes it should do a comprehensive blood test for clotting disorders first.  In my case, my gyno knew about my clotting disorder and prescribed it anyway.  The blood clot risk is in the literature but I found it before he did.	F	49	5  days	5/4/2008
4	Stomach cancer	Increased appetite and increase need for liquid fluids.	I was diagnosed in February 2007 with stage 4 stomach cancer.  After 6 months of chemo all malignant cells were destroyed, however the main tumor mass with malignant cells remain.  I have completed 5 weeks of radiation on the tumor which destroyed my appetite.  Megace has increased my appetite and a need for fluids which is very important.  I have only taken megace for two weeks, hopefully I will gain the 45 lbs back that I loss during treatment.  I will get back to you in a couple of months.	F	56	2  weeks	3/19/2008Email
3	Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma	chronic fatigue, no sex drive, irritable, periods of increased hunger.  The chronic fatigue is horrible. I don't drive by myself anymore, afraid I will fall asleep at the wheel.	Standard choice of treatment for my cancer, I will be discussing the side effects with my doctor next month.	F	22	3  months	2/22/2008Email
4	i was under  weight	The side effects i went through while on megace was that i had frequent urination, no sex drive at all, night sweats, blurred vision sometimes, mood changes, hungry all the time	i was really underweight i gained 20 pounds it helped me a lot.. yeah the side effects where bad but i got used to it and i loved the results it was worth taking Megace.. the side effects go away right after u stop talking it..	F	20	2  months	2/4/2008
4	For weight gain for Celiac Disease	Really bad fatugue, tingling sensation in neck and mouth, ankle and leg water retention. Gained 14 pounds in 3 weeks which was amazing but, side effects which over ride the outcome. Feeling like I am crashing all the time and metal taste in mouth,it also caused me to not have a menstal cycle.	I think the drug is worth taking due to my situation of malabsorbtion and lack of gaining weight. But, the side effects really take over. There is also no way you can get pregnant on this medication if you are young consider this because it can cause deformities in sexual organs of fetus's this can be really hard to deal with so make sure you are not planning on getting pregnant.	F	27	1  months	1/9/2008Email
5	complex atypical hyperplasia	There has been an increase in side effects each month as the 5 months have passed (only 2 more months to go!): moodiness, calf tension/pain, ankle swelling/fluid retention, mild weight gain, frequent urination (even when bladder is nearly empty) which also results in frequent sleep disruption due to waking every 1-2 hours, extreme fatigue (beyond what is accounted for by sleep disruption), mild hypertension, increased thirst, occasional headaches/body aches, occasional diarhea often combined with mild viral-like symptoms (i.e. hot flushes and exhaustion), increased appetite.	My biopsy at 3 months was clean and I am hopeful for my follow-up biopsy in 2 months.  The side effects are worth it because it is looking like I will be able to avoid both cancer and a hysterectomy.  I am glad my gynecologist recommended this approach even with the side effects (the side effects weren't bad for the first 1-2 months).  With diet, I have managed only a 5 lb. weight gain over the last 2 months only.  It is my hope to stop this gain and possibly reverse it before my next M.D. appointment.	F	37	5  months	6/4/2007
2	Complex hyperplasia w/severe atypia	Extreme insomnia, hot flashes, nausea, indigestion, back aches, tension/anxiety, no sex drive, heart palpitations, urinary problems	Cancer is gone but still have complex hyperplasia - MD says I need hysterectomy and I am starting to believe him. Side effects are wearing me down and quality of life is severely diminished.	F	35	5  months	4/2/2007Email
4	atypical uterine hyperplasia	I have been on Megace for 5 months now and at my last Dr visit, 2 months ago, the repeat biopsy came back beign. I'm still on the Megace.  I've had side effects,tiredness, moodiness and irritibility and low sex drive, but the Megace saved me from a hysterctomy.  I visit my Dr again in a month, so we shall see.  I guess it's been worth it. +		F	54	5  months	1/30/2007
2	Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma	Horrible hot flashes, irritability, depression, insatiable appetite, weight gain, moodiness, insomnia, fatigue, heart palpitations.	Dr. took me off Megace due to finding of pre-cancerous cells vs. actual cancer.  Symptoms have improved immediately.	F	42	2  months	12/10/2006
3	Complex Aty Endometrial Hyperplasia	extreme fatigue, some periods of increased hunger, mood change-intolerance, impatience, frustrated easily, poor quality sleep	Still taking Megace for another month, so I don't know yet whether it will be effective in eliminating the hyperplasia.	F	40	2  months	10/29/2006
4	Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma	Weight gain (40 lbs), extreme fatigue, hair thinning.	Megace is the gold standard for my type of cancer, but the side effects are very difficult to live with.	F	59	5  years	10/14/2006Email
1	increase appetite	insomnia, loss of hair, edema	it did increase my appetite, but the side effects are not worth it.	F	45	2  months	8/14/2005
2	endometrial hyperplasia	Back aches, tension/anxiety, sleeplessness, feeling of heaviness, tired, low sex drive, heart palpitations and racing intermittently during the day and evening. Increased appetite.		F	34	2  months	2/16/2005
