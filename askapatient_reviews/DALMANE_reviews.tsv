5	insomnia	Zero. Slight tiredness after 3rd day. Total relaxation in the a.m. No "hung over" or "drugged" feeling upon awakening. Long half-life so I take it for 3 days then skip 2 days. This helps with not building up more of a benzo tolerance.	Best sleep drug going. I suffer severe anxiety which keeps me up most nights. Ambien, Lunesta, Trazodone, Seroquel, Klonopin, even marijuana, all did nothing. I need something to shut my brain up. I also take 6mg's of Xanax daily. Only problem with Xanax is rebound anxiety every morning. Dalmane takes care of that. Dalmane is like taking a fist full of Valium b-4 bed. Thirty minutes after taking Dalmane it feels as if my mattress is a marshmellow which I'm sinking into, then I wake up 7-8 hours later fully refreshed. Long half-life which allows me to take it for 3 days then skip for 2 days, yet still feel the effects.	M	35	1  weeks30 mg 1X D	3/14/2012Email
1	insomnia	I couldn't wake up. Couldn't make any plans till 4 PM. Groggy, sedated, blurry vision, confusion.I became scared to drive as I wasn't ever fully awake.Attempts to stop this drug cased severe withdrawals.	I have tried for years to get off this drug. I have lowered the dose after slow but persistent tapering. It is an EXTREMELY unpleasant drug to taper from as it causes nasty withdrawals (panic attacks, re-bound insomnia, severe restlessness).This is a very additive benzo--please use with utmost caution. Do not suddenly stop this drug or allow yourself to be stitched over to another sleeping pill.It is an old benzo similar to Valium and has a very long half life (builds up in your system).The doctor who prescribed it had to not had any idea what it would do because it's that nasty of a drug.

5	insomnia	None- but, very very addictive, its a Benzo! Do not take more frequent than a few times. After a wk or so of daily use you are ADDICTED even with just one pill aday.	Suffered trauma in my earyl 20's, lost marriage, job etc from insomnia.  The only medication that worked was "dalmane".  Later in life prescribed xanax and dalmane, bad combo! addiction big time! Bare in mind, I took the lowest dose of xanax and still got "tolerance" addiction!!!!! one pill a day, yep.  Withdrawal was HELL.  Read Benzo.org, Prof Ashton's info on benzo's.   Please leave any benzo to "rare" use, only for those times when nothing will pull you out of days of insomnia.	F	54	15  years30 mg 1X AN	2/2/2011
4	insomnia	A bit of morning grogginess, but otherwise, none.	Has helped somewhat with my disordered circadian rhythm issues (falling asleep at dawn and waking around 3pm).  There's a bit of grogginess in the morning but not that bad.  Was taking Restoril, and Dalmane definitely makes me feel sleepier, which helps.  Overall, it's a good med.  Cheap too!

5	Insomnia, anxiety	Grogginess, dazed feeling in the morning.	After being hooked on Ambien, I decided to make a switch to something new after consulting my doc.  I took 30mg of this last night and it was the first time in a year that I slept over 8 hours in a row without waking. Since I don't want to become dependent on another drug I will be limiting the amount I take of it.  I con only hope it does not lose effectiveness over time.	M	34	1  days	8/1/2009
5	To help me sleep	none	This medication is an older one but works great without all the side effects. I have had no problems with it.	F	40	1  weeks	2/16/2008
4	sleep	works great, sleep very well not all the side effects. like ambien cr		F	40	1  days	10/13/2007
5	to sleep	Not sur if it caused hair loss. Stop taking it to see, other than that it did work great.	It does take about 3 days to really start working. But after that it was really good less side effects.	F	40	1  weeks	9/24/2007
5	sleeplessness	none	Works great.  Not a relaxant, your up one minute and asleep the next.  Some nights it works better than others????	F	37	7  years	9/20/2007
4	can not sleep	none	It has wotked fine. sleeping better. Don't forget everything. good so far.	M	40	7  days	9/5/2007
5	insomnia	tired the next day	I get a good night's sleep.	M	59	5  days	12/16/2006
5	insomnia	dry mouth		F	49	30  days	11/28/2005
3	Insomnia	None	Takes about three days to build up in your system before it works well. The first couple of nights it barely helped at all. By the third night I slept fairly well. I quit taking because there are better sleep aids out there that don't have to build up in your system with such a long half life.	M	38	15  days	11/4/2005
4	insomnia	Residual grogginess; felt like guardal shield around me and not quite experiencing life in the real sense; coffee helped me overcome grogginess in the AM.	Took for over 21 straight years; I know this is not good, but it seemed to work for me; depression caused me to be unable to sleep well or get to sleep, thus I could not afford to go off this medicine. After so many years on dalmane my new dr. switched me to another sleeping pill.	M	60	21  days	9/25/2004
